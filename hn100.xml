And much like the climate debate of the 2000s, a lot of what you hear is just mis-/disinformation from people who are trying to lock us into a fossil fuel future. </p><p>One of the most contentious yet stupid arguments is whether renewables reduce energy costs.  In this post, I’ll show an analysis of ERCOT data that demonstrates that renewables aren’t just clean, they’re saving Texas consumers serious money.  </p><p>Let’s compare August 2018 to August 2024.  Over this six-year period, average daily peak demand in August increased from 65 GW to 80 GW.   At the same time, there was a rapid build-out of solar power, with the average daily peak production increasing from 1.2 GW in 2018 to 18.8 GW in 2024.</p><p>Let’s start our analysis by comparing the price of electricity in these two months.

This decrease in net load for 60 GW of total load was due to the rapid build-out of solar energy between these years.  </p><p>We can now use these values of net load to determine the price of electricity.  Using Figure 2, we see that 52 GW of net load leads to a cost of electricity of around $30/MWh, while 42 GW of net load corresponds to around $20/MWh.  </p><p>In other words, the price of electricity for a total load of 60 GW is $30/MWh in 2018 and $20/MWh in 2024.  These are close to the numbers you would get from the total load vs. price plot (Fig. 1).</p><p><strong>The upshot</strong><span>: We can now explain why wholesale electricity was more expensive in 2018 than in 2024.  The rapid build-out of solar power reduced the need for fossil fuel-based electricity in 2024.  Since the price of electricity in Texas is set by how much fossil fuel-based electricity is required to satisfy demand, the solar energy build-out reduced the cost of electricity.  </span></p><p>Using data directly provided by ERCOT, we can estimate the demand-weighted average price in August 2024: $39/MWh.</p><p>We can also calculate what the demand-weighted average price for 2024 would have been with the price-demand relationship for 2018 shown in Fig. 1.

To do this, we consider two alternative scenarios: 1) capped scenario: the price stays fixed at the maximum 2018 price (red dashed line), 2) extrapolation scenario: the price-load relation follows a linear extrapolation from the end of the line (purple dashed line):</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-QDB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-QDB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-QDB!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-QDB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-QDB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-QDB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png" width="1456" height="827" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:827,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:337197,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.theclimatebrink.com/i/166342817?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-QDB!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-QDB!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-QDB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-QDB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321fefbd-b9eb-4709-a8da-26615116b6e5_4170x2369.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Figure 4.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Once we have these two scenarios, we take hourly load from Aug. 2024 and use the curves in Fig. 4 to estimate the price for each hour.

				<p>Jokes aside, this is exciting news. PNG is back to its former glory after its progress stalled for over two decades. Did you know the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000153.shtml#:~:text=The%20Library%20of%20Congress%20Recommended,specify%20a%20version%20of%20PNG.">U.S. Library of Congress</a>, <a href="https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/government-information-resources/guidelines/Documents/file-formats-irev.pdf">Library and Archives Canada</a>, and the <a href="https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/storing-and-preserving-information/preserving-information/born-digital-file-format-standards">National Archives of Australia</a> recommend PNG? It is important that we keep PNG current and competitive. After 20 years of stagnation, PNG is back with renewed vigor!</p>

							<h3>Proper HDR support (future‐proof, too!)</h3>
							<p>
								Figure 1 shows the colors our eyes can see.<br>
								The smaller, inner triangle represents the color space of most images.<br>
								The larger, outer triangle represents the colors that are typical with a High Dynamic Range (HDR) image.
							</p>
							<p>This new HDR support uses only 4 bytes (plus the usual PNG chunk overhead).</p>
							<p>Chris Lilley—one of PNG's original co‐authors and current Technical Director contributing to the new PNG work—wrote an <a href="https://svgees.us/blog/cICP.html">excellent article explaining how this works</a>.</p>

						<h3>Finally recognizes APNGs (animations!)</h3>
						<p>Animated PNGs were proposed by Mozilla quite some time ago. Support was added to Firefox, but other programs hesitated to adopt them.</p>
						<p>Today, animated PNGs are widely supported. It is time for the spec to reflect reality.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Officially supports Exif data</h3>
						<p>Exif stores additional information such as copyright information and even camera lens and GPS location of a photograph.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>General tidying up—fixing errata, clarifications, etc.</h3>

				<h2>Background</h2>

				<p>The last PNG spec was released over 20 years ago. Technology has advanced a lot since then. We're talking 3.5 years before the first iPhone.</p>

				<p>In fact, technological advancement is what resurrected PNG. The W3C Timed Text Working Group (think:&nbsp;subtitles) needed HDR support in PNG. A proposal was made, but a few experts decided we could do better.</p>

				<p>Momentum built, and additional parties became interested. Before we knew it, we had representation from (in alphabetical order) Adobe, Apple, BBC, Comcast / NBCUniversal, Google, MovieLabs, and of course W3C, who maintains the spec. It's quite the dream team.</p>

				<p>With these titans behind it, the image format is back with full momentum. Work has already begun on the <em>next&nbsp;two</em> PNG spec updates.</p>

				<h2>Already supported</h2>

				<p>Many of the programs you use already support the new PNG spec: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, iOS/macOS, Photoshop, DaVinci Resolve, Avid Media Composer...</p>

				<p>Plus, you saw some broadcast companies in that list above. Behind the scenes, hardware and tooling are being updated to support the new PNG spec. The next time you see a news ticker scrolling <q>Brave dog saves family</q> or the score banner update as your team pulls out a clutch play, check if it is HDR.</p>


				<h2>What's next?</h2>

				<p>I know you all immediately wondered, <q>better compression?</q>. We're already working on that. And parallel encoding/decoding, too! Just like this update, we want to make sure we do it right.</p>

				<p>We expect the next PNG update (Fourth Edition) to be short. It will improve HDR &amp; Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) interoperability. While we work on that, we'll be researching compression updates for PNG Fifth Edition.</p>

				<h2>Thanks</h2>
 
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/png/participants/">PNG Working Group participants</a> made all of this a reality. Be sure to let them know how much you appreciate their hard work.</p>

    <p>Hello this is Theodore Nichols and welcome to my world wide web page.</p>
    <p><u>Update 5/6/2025</u> My <a href="https://x.com/LegbootLegit/status/1919745971673551192" target="_blank">neighbor hurt himself</a> and is now Beefing with me about the coins. He has <a href="https://x.com/LegbootLegit/status/1919885715745202532" target="_blank">not returned my prototype thnickels</a> yet. Please help me share awareness of this situation.</p>
    <p><u>Updated 5/1/2025:</u> I have partnered with someone to help me take <a href="https://www.legboot.com/thnickels-pre-order/">pre-orders</a> for thnickels. Slots limited.</p>
    
    <p><u>Updated 4/30/2025:</u> I have received hundreds of e-Mails from my flyer. I told my grandson that flyers still work in this day and age. He said societal media is the only way, but I was right. And he is still very thin. <b>Thank you all for the interest, I will be in touch.</b><br>-Theo</p>
    <p><u>Updated 4/24/2025:</u> Thank you for the huge interest in my coins. Yes there are some pre order slots left but going fast.</p>
    <h2 id="intro">Thnickels</h2>
    <p><img src="https://thick-coins.net/thnickels%20in%20my%20hand.jpg" alt="holding two thick coins"></p>
    <p>Nickels are too thin we need a much heftier coin. That is why I am making thicker coins in my new <a href="#mint">minting facility</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="about">How It All Got Started</h2>
    <p>Some burglars recently entered my garage to pilfer my things. The only weapon nearby was a <b>bag of nickels</b>, which I brandished at the ruffians.</p>
    <p><img src="https://thick-coins.net/ten%20cents.jpg" alt="two nickels was not an effective weapon"></p><p>The burglars <b>laughed at me</b> about the slight bag of coins. They did not <b>respect</b> me or <b>fear my purse</b>.</p><p>They stole the nickels and my best push broom. <b>I have never felt so humiliated.</b></p>
    <p>That's when I resolved to NEVER be disrespected about my pocketchange again.</p>
    
    <h2 id="coins">Introducing: Thicker Coins</h2>
    <p>My new coins have a <b>much meatier handfeel</b> when compared to currency from the U.S. Mint.</p>
    <p>The enhanced weight is both <b>satisfying</b> to good guys and <b>threatening</b> to bad guys.</p>
    <p><img src="https://thick-coins.net/size%20comparison.jpg" alt="wimpy nickel vs beefy thnickel"></p><p>You can see in the photograph above how <b>pathetically thin</b> a regular "nickel" is between my fingers.</p>
    <p>The "thnickel" is <b>substantial and solid</b>, there is much more coin per coin.</p>
    <p>Feel free to review my designs below. <i>I welcome feedback on the designs as long as it is positive and respectful of me.</i></p>
    

    <h2 id="mint">The Mint</h2>
    <p>I have converted my garage into a mint. I am dedicated to producing enough thnickels for everyone in need of respect.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project <em>optionally</em> depends on the ICU library for its Search and Replace functionality.
By default, the project will look for a SONAME without version suffix:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Windows: <code>icuuc.dll</code></li>
<li>macOS: <code>libicuuc.dylib</code></li>
<li>UNIX, and other OS: <code>libicuuc.so</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If your installation uses a different SONAME, please set the following environment variable at build time:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>EDIT_CFG_ICUUC_SONAME</code>:
For instance, <code>libicuuc.so.76</code>.</li>
<li><code>EDIT_CFG_ICUI18N_SONAME</code>:
For instance, <code>libicui18n.so.76</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, this project assumes that the ICU exports are exported without <code>_</code> prefix and without version suffix, such as <code>u_errorName</code>.
If your installation uses versioned exports, please set:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>EDIT_CFG_ICU_CPP_EXPORTS</code>:
If set to <code>true</code>, it'll look for C++ symbols such as <code>_u_errorName</code>.
Enabled by default on macOS.</li>
<li><code>EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_VERSION</code>:
If set to a version number, such as <code>76</code>, it'll look for symbols such as <code>u_errorName_76</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Finally, you can set the following environment variables:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_AUTO_DETECT</code>:
If set to <code>true</code>, the executable will try to detect the <code>EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_VERSION</code> value at runtime.
The way it does this is not officially supported by ICU and as such is not recommended to be relied upon.
Enabled by default on UNIX (excluding macOS) if no other options are set.</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Address<br>
              &nbsp;</h3>

            <p>8601 Adelphi Road</p>

            <p>College Park, MD&nbsp; 20740</p>

            <p>Truck Deliveries - entrance at&nbsp;3301 Metzerott Road</p>

            <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:inquire@nara.gov">inquire@nara.gov</a></p>

            <p>Effective July 7, 2025, the National Archives at College Park, MD, will become a restricted-access federal facility with access only for visitors with a legitimate business need. It will no longer be open to the general public. Security officers will enforce these restrictions, and your cooperation is appreciated.</p>

            

            <h3>Parking</h3>

            

            

            <p>Only U.S. government federal employees with valid Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards and registered researchers with disability documentation may park in the Archives II garage.</p>

            <p>All NARA contractors, researchers, and other visitors with legitimate business needs must park in the PEPCO satellite parking lot. There will be a 15-minute loading/unloading zone to accommodate equipment and passenger drop-off and pick-up. Researchers will bring their equipment into the building, where it will undergo security screening. Equipment may be stored in a researcher locker or left in the lobby until the owner has moved their car to the PEPCO lot and returned to the building.</p>

            <p>All for-hire transportation services, such as Uber and Lyft, will be confined to this loading/unloading zone. Hotel shuttles and vans will be directed to discharge and pick up passengers at the Adelphi Road bus stops.</p>

            <p>If you park in an Americans with Disability Act (ADA) space without the proper disability documentation in the form of disability tags, placard, or permit, you will be ticketed and may be towed. Repeat offenders will lose their parking privileges. Security officers will thoroughly verify all&nbsp;ADA permits.</p>

            

            <h3>Visitor Requirements</h3>

            

            <p>All researchers must apply and present a <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/start/researcher-card">researcher card</a>, which may be obtained in Room 1000. This ensures that proper identification is on file for all individuals accessing the building to establish a legitimate business purpose. Abuse of any researcher registration to circumvent access by the general public may result in a trespass situation and a permanent ban from access to all NARA facilities.</p>

            <p>The pedestrian circle at the front of the building will be permanently closed to vehicle traffic. Registered researchers will be allowed to load and unload equipment at the designated 15-minute drop-off and pick-up zone.</p>

            

            <h3>Bus Services</h3>

            

            <p>The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) bus will cease operations on June 30, 2025. The Prince George’s County bus will not be authorized to enter NARA's roadway, bus stop, or the pedestrian circle. Passengers must use the designated bus stops on Adelphi Road for drop-off and pick-up. The NARA shuttle bus schedule will remain the same; however, drop-off will take place in the 15-minute loading/unloading zone, and pick-up will take place in the bus shelter.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your understanding and support of these changes to ensure the security and safety of all building occupants.</p>

            

            <h3>Hours</h3>

            

            <p>The research room at the National Archives at College Park, MD, is open Monday–Friday, 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Research appointments are highly encouraged, but you may also conduct research as a walk-in. Research appointments can be scheduled via Eventbrite on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/o/national-archives-dc-area-research-appointments-87533423643">National Archives DC-area Research Appointments</a>&nbsp;page.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h4><span>Collaboration for more speed, efficiency, and security in software development and the basis for an open and collaborative ecosystem</span></h4></p><div data-speakable="text"><p>With the support of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), 11 companies in the automotive industry have agreed on pre-competitive cooperation in open source software development.</p>

<p>A corresponding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed today at the 29th International Automotive Electronics Congress (AEK).</p>

<p>With the increasing importance and complexity of vehicle software, it is becoming critical for the industry to increase speed and efficiency in development while ensuring high quality and safety.</p>

<p>EA significant portion of the vehicle software is not directly accessible to the user and therefore not differentiating. This fact allows the corresponding software modules to be developed jointly in an open and collaborative ecosystem.</p>

<p>In order to achieve the necessary functional safety for automotive series software, a groundbreaking development process for open source was developed in preparation for certification according to the relevant standards.</p>

<p>In addition, by providing executable software modules instead of detailed specifications, standardization and increased development speed are achieved through the so-called code-first approach.<br>
The software development takes place in a transparent and vendor-independent environment of the Eclipse Foundation as part of the S-CORE project.</p>

<p>This ecosystem is open, both through software interoperability with relevant industry standards and for contributions and collaboration from other European and international companies.</p>

<p>The initiative's timeline envisages that the software scope for series development of a platform for autonomous driving will be available in 2026.</p>

<p>The modular software scope can be adapted or expanded and then made available to the industry as a customized distribution for series development. This allows manufacturers and suppliers to focus on differentiating features while maintaining core components together. This creates a strong foundation for innovation - and the freedom to focus on what makes the difference for the customer.</p>

<p>"Together we are building a future-proof and powerful software ecosystem - open, transparent and secure," VDA Managing Director Dr. Marcus Bollig said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>Date published: <!-- -->Jun 23, 2025</em></p>
<p>Time handling is everywhere in software, but many programmers talk about the topic with dread and fear. Some warn about how difficult the topic is to understand, listing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bizarre timezone edge cases</a> as evidence of complexity. Others repeat advice like "just use UTC bro" as if it were an unconditional rule - if your program needs precise timekeeping or has user-facing datetime interactions, this advice will almost certainly cause bugs or confusing behavior. Here's a conceptual model for thinking about time in programming that encapsulates the complexity that many programmers cite online.</p>
<h2>Absolute Time</h2>
<p>Two important concepts for describing time are "durations" and "instants". A duration is like the number of seconds it takes Usain Bolt to finish a 100m race; an instant is like the moment that he crossed the finish line, or the moment he was half-way through the race. The concept of "absolute time" (or "physical/universal time") refers to these instants, which are unique and precisely represent moments in time, irrespective of concepts like calendars and timezones.</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/usain_100m.jpg">
<p><em>Usain Bolt at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93dC0o2aHto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beijing 2008 Olympics</a> (Photo from <a href="https://www.boston.com/sports/olympics/2016/05/18/usain-bolt-positive-beijing-retests-bad-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boston.com</a>)</em></p>
<p>How can we refer to two instants in a way that describes which instant came first and what the duration is between them? Labeling them like "The instant Usain finished the race" or "The instant Neil Armstrong first stepped on the Moon" doesn't provide this information (it's like how labeling places as "home" or "store" doesn't communicate the distance between them). One way to precisely refer to instants is by their duration from some reference point: the instant Usain crossed the finish line is the instant 9.69 seconds from the reference point when the race starting pistol went off.</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/usain_100m_abstract.jpg">
<p>Programmers call this reference instant an "epoch" - it's the instant whose number representation is 0 seconds. The epoch could be any instant: Many systems support Unix time, which uses the Unix epoch (Jan 1st, 1970 00:00:00 UTC), but other epochs work too (e.g. Apollo_Time in Jai uses the Apollo 11 rocket landing at July 20, 1969 20:17:40 UTC).</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/usain_100m_unix_apollo.jpg">
<p><em>Each row of labels represents the same absolute instants in time, but with different rules for what those labels look like</em></p>
<p>The importance of an epoch may feel untrue, since we talk about instants in everyday conversation without explicitly stating a reference point, but even in phrases like "last night" or "tomorrow at noon", you're implicitly assuming a reference point of the current moment and talking about an instant that's some number of seconds away from the current moment. It's like how you can say "here" or "there" because of the implicit reference point of your current position.</p>
<h2>Civil Time</h2>
<p>While the seconds-from-epoch model is a useful way to talk about durations and instants, humans don't generally say "Wanna grab lunch at 1,748,718,000 seconds from the Unix epoch?" To discuss time, we invented "civil time" - higher level language and standards for labeling absolute time.</p>
<p>The Gregorian calendar is the most common system for expressing civil time - if you can read July 20, 1969 20:17:40, then you're familiar with it. An instant is labeled as a "datetime", with year/month/day/hour/minute/second values that increment according to defined rules (e.g. "increment the day field after 24 hours"). Some regions use different "locales" to display datetimes (e.g. <code><span><span>en</span><span>-</span><span>US</span></span></code> 6/5/2025 6:00 PM vs <code><span><span>de</span><span>-</span><span>DE</span></span></code> 5.6.2025, 18:00), but the underlying information is the same.</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/usain_100m_gregorian.jpg">
<p>The Gregorian calendar also defines labels for "periods" like Monday to Sunday and January to December. Think of periods as ambiguous durations: for example, a month can be anywhere from 28-31 days. The idea of "adding 1 month" to a datetime is ambiguous (in terms of the # of seconds added), but it's stable enough for humans to use periods to discuss larger durations of time.</p>
<p>This post focuses on the Gregorian calendar (instead of other systems like the Islamic calendar) since it's the standard calendar for most people, but all of these calendar systems do the same general thing: Each specifies well-defined rules for labeling absolute instants in time.</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/usain_100m_islamic.jpg">
<h2>Modern timekeeping</h2>
<p>Unix time and the Gregorian calendar are similar in that they are both "seconds-from-epoch" representations that can be converted between each other. Unix time counts seconds from January 1, 1970, while the Gregorian calendar counts from January 1, AD 1. We can express any instant in either system because we've "declared" reference points that link the systems together - the Unix epoch is defined in terms of the Gregorian calendar, creating an interoperable system. By representing instants as durations from an epoch, computers can more easily perform arithmetic and comparisons (e.g. checking if an instant comes before another instant is a numerical <code><span><span>&lt;</span></span></code> operation).</p>
<p>Theoretically, all computers could use the same epoch for timekeeping, but different epochs make more sense depending on requirements. For example, if your program only handles datetimes from 1970 - 2038, Unix time can represent them using 32-bit integers (so you potentially reduce memory and CPU usage by keeping the representation to 32 bits).</p>
<p>But how do we know the current absolute time? If today is 6/8/2025 00:00:00 how do we track that 86,400 seconds have passed since 6/7/2025 00:00:00, and so on extending back to Jan 1, AD 1? The history of human timekeeping is long, but here's a short version: For a long time, humans based timekeeping on the Sun; they operated under the assumption that a day has 24 hours based on Earth's rotation around its axis, and that a year has 365 days based on Earth's orbit around the Sun. A second was defined as 1/86400 of the average "solar day" (the duration it takes Earth to rotate so that the Sun returns to the same position in the sky. This requires ~361° of rotation since Earth also orbits the Sun and needs to rotate an extra ~1° to compensate).</p>
<p>However, this model is technically wrong. Earth's rotation speed fluctuates over time, partly due to climatic and geographical forces; the overall trend is a ~1.8ms slowdown every 100 years.</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/earth_rotation_speed_from_2015_to_2025.png">
<p><em>Earth's rotation speed was ~0.73ms longer than 86,400 seconds on May 24, 2025 (Graph is my own, generated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation#/media/File:Deviation_of_day_length_from_SI_day.svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IERS data</a>)</em></p>
<p>Moreover, Earth takes ~365.25 days to orbit the Sun, not 365. The Gregorian calendar accounts for Earth's 365.25-day orbit using leap years (where February occasionally has an extra day). However, it doesn't account for Earth's slowing rotation. This means that defining a second in terms of Earth's rotation is imprecise, because that duration will vary! If we kept this simplistic model, then over time, our 24-hour clocks would slowly drift out of sync with the Sun's position, leading to absurd situations like regularly seeing the moon at noon… A separate problem is how the local time will be different for people around the globe if everyone independently tracks the Sun.</p>
<p>To continue using the Gregorian calendar and 24-hour clocks while staying in sync with Earth's movement in space, humans created two main solutions:</p>
<h3>UTC</h3>
<p>UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) is a time "standard" used to synchronize clocks globally. The standard precisely defines the duration of a second (as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation of cesium-133 atoms). This "SI second" is a more stable, precise definition than "1/86400 of a solar day". The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) tracks the current UTC time by averaging hundreds of atomic clocks globally. Clocks in computers and other devices indirectly sync with this consensus time through mechanisms like NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers that broadcast time information.</p>
<p>The IERS also occasionally introduces leap second adjustments to sync the current UTC time with Earth's rotational position. Here's what this looks like practically: Adding a leap second looks like the clock going from 23:59:59 to 23:59:60 (i.e. one more second "happens" before 00:00:00), and subtracting a leap second looks like skipping from 23:59:58 to 00:00:00. Since 1972, 27 leap seconds have been added (none have been subtracted, but it's technically possible). These adjustments are irregular and unpredictable, usually decided a few months in advance (the last one was on December 31, 2016).</p>
<p>What this all means is that we continue using the Gregorian calendar, but a day may have 86401 or 86399 seconds (not always 86400), and so when calculating the duration between days, you have to do <code><span><span>number_of_days</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>86400</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>leap_seconds_delta</span></span></code> (where <code><span><span>leap_seconds_delta</span></span></code> is the sum of all positive and negative leap second adjustments between the two datetimes). So it's still possible to label instants and represent precise durations using the Gregorian calendar and UTC, but you need to know when leap second adjustments occurred so that you can account for those when computing precise durations.</p>
<p>But who is "inserting" leap second adjustments? No one is "physically" inserting them; rather, the IERS modifies the UTC standard to state that a leap second adjustment will occur at a future date (a few months in advance). Systems that care about precise UTC timekeeping must then update their leap second data to account for it (e.g. by ensuring they account for the leap second adjustment when computing the duration between 2 datetimes where one is before and one is after the leap second). In any case, the leap second system has caused various problems in the past few decades, so it has been decided that the leap second system <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-11-global-timekeepers-vote-scrap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will be abandoned by 2035</a>.</p>
<p>Leap seconds tend to be inserted at midnight, but to visualize what that instant would look like, let's assume that a positive leap second adjustment was scheduled to be inserted at the start of Usain Bolt's 100m race:</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/usain_100m_gregorian_leap_second.jpg">
<p>The key insight is that <code><span><span>2008</span><span>/</span><span>8</span><span>/</span><span>16</span><span> </span><span>14</span><span>:</span><span>30</span><span>:</span><span>08</span><span>.</span><span>69</span></span></code> still <em>represents</em> 9.69 seconds after the race started, even though the datetime looks like only 8.69 seconds elapsed. When computing the precise duration between datetimes like <code><span><span>2008</span><span>/</span><span>8</span><span>/</span><span>16</span><span> </span><span>14</span><span>:</span><span>29</span><span>:</span><span>59</span></span></code> and <code><span><span>2008</span><span>/</span><span>8</span><span>/</span><span>16</span><span> </span><span>14</span><span>:</span><span>30</span><span>:</span><span>09</span></span></code>, we know that we're using the UTC time standard, and so you have to check for any leap second adjustments between the two datetimes and account for them accordingly (so in this case, the duration between the two datetimes is 11 seconds, because 10 seconds + 1 leap second).</p>
<p>This is important to understand if your program needs precise timekeeping. JavaScript's Date object (based on Unix time), for example, doesn't account for leap seconds at all (i.e. it doesn't use "true" UTC). When calling <code><span><span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></code>, the returned number of milliseconds is actually less than the number of milliseconds that have elapsed "in real life" since January 1st, 1970. This may or may not cause bugs depending on program requirements.</p>
<h3>Timezones</h3>
<p>UTC allows humans to coordinate on the current absolute time, but it doesn't directly solve how the Sun is in different positions for people globally. Timezones allow humans to continue using civil time as usual (where "12PM" looks similar globally in terms of the Sun's position in the sky) while still being synced to UTC. In other words, practically all humans use UTC, but they express that UTC time slightly differently, and timezones define how to convert between these local expressions and the "baseline" expression of UTC+0.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: People disagree on the best definitions for "timezone", "standard time", and related concepts, but I'll clearly specify the best definitions in my view below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A "timezone" refers to the regions of Earth that follow the same rules for civil time. These rules generally look like a "standard time" that specifies a UTC offset - for example, Japan Standard Time (JST) has offset UTC+9, meaning that the absolute time of 2008/8/16 14:30 UTC+0 looks like 2008/8/16 23:30 UTC+9 in JST.</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/usain_100m_jst.jpg">
<p>Most standard times fall between UTC-12 and UTC+12, but this isn't a hard rule; in fact, a UTC+14 actually exists in the Line Islands! Regardless of the UTC offset, it's all the same absolute instants in time, just with different labels to refer to those instants. Neil Armstrong took his first step on the moon one time in history - he didn’t take another first step an hour later for the next timezone over...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) is the standard time used in places like the United Kingdom, defined as UTC+0. The acronym GMT has a lot of history behind it, causing people to mean different things when referring to it (e.g. some people are referring to the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, where time was measured in astronomic terms instead of using atomic clocks), but these days, people interchangeably saying "GMT" or "UTC" are usually referring to the idea of UTC+0 (i.e. the baseline way to refer to absolute instants in time).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People often assume that timezone rules are always singular, static UTC offsets, but that's not true: for example, California alternates between Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8) and Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7) every year. The "Pacific Time" (PT) zone refers to the set of regions (like California) that follow both PST and PDT. Moreover, not all timezone rule changes are predictable: for example, Samoa changed their standard time from UTC-11 to UTC+13 in 2011 to better align their civil time with nearby economic partners.</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/usain_100m_pst_to_pdt.jpg">
<p><em>Pacific Time transitioned from PST (UTC-8) to PDT (UTC-7) at <code><span><span>Sun</span><span> </span><span>09</span><span> </span><span>Mar</span><span> </span><span>2025</span><span> </span><span>02</span><span>:</span><span>00</span></span></code>, causing the local time to "spring
forward" from 02:00 to 03:00</em></p>
<p>It's easier to understand this sudden jump from 1:59 to 3:00 when watching the change alongside the corresponding UTC offsets:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>#</span><span> </span><span>Pacific</span><span> </span><span>Time</span><span></span></span>
<span><span>1</span><span>:</span><span>58</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>08</span><span>:</span><span>00</span><span></span></span>

<span><span>10</span><span>:</span><span>01</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span>00</span><span>:</span><span>00</span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>The civil times from the Pacific Time zone refer to the same absolute instants as the UTC+0 labels; what changed is the UTC offset used to generate those labels.</p>
<p>The thing to realize is that timezones aren't official "entities" defined by some international organization - rather, local governments determine the time rules of their localities, and then a timezone refers to the emergent grouping of regions that follow the same rules of civil time. (i.e. a "timezone" is useful language to refer to this group of regions, not an official "entity" that governments directly control. Local governments instead change the standard times they follow, and then that may change how we group regions together in timezones based on who shares what rules of civil time now).</p>
<p>Part of the reason why terminology get confusing is that you can technically think of a standard time as a timezone: Instead of thinking of GMT as a rule defined as UTC+0, you can also think of it as a timezone of regions like the United Kingdom and Ireland where, for some portion of the year, they follow the rule UTC+0.</p>
<p>The problem with treating standard times as timezones is that they're unstable: The United Kingdom only follows GMT (UTC+0) for part of the year because they switch to BST for summer. Treating GMT and BST as separate timezones would mean that United Kingdom residents need to select multiple timezone options in software…</p>
<p>So grouping regions based on who has the same local time or is currently following the same standard time is unstable. This is why timezone UIs in software generally list timezones that are stable year-round (i.e. every region in the timezone shares the same present rules and projected future rules for civil time, assuming no legislation changes happen). So instead of selecting PST or PDT, California residents select something like "Pacific Time (PT)".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Some timezone UIs confusingly will show something like "GMT" to refer to "the timezone that follows both GMT and BST".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that UTC offsets can change in a timezone has some interesting implications that'll be easier to see by converting the above 1D timeline images into 2D graphs:</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/dst_transition_graphs.png">
<p><em>"Spring forward" and "fall back" graphs (Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rnIHsqABfM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CppCon 2015: Greg Miller "Time Programming
Fundamentals"</a>)</em></p>
<p>If the UTC offset moves backwards by 1 hour, then one hour of civil datetimes are repeated (the same principle applies for moving backwards by any other arbitrary amount of time). This means that the absolute instant in time corresponding to <code><span><span>09</span><span> </span><span>Mar</span><span> </span><span>2025</span><span> </span><span>01</span><span>:</span><span>30</span></span></code> is ambiguous. Similarly, if the UTC offset moves forward by 1 hour, then one hour of civil datetimes are skipped/non-existent - <code><span><span>09</span><span> </span><span>Mar</span><span> </span><span>2025</span><span> </span><span>02</span><span>:</span><span>00</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>02</span><span>:</span><span>59</span></span></code> will never happen.</p>
<p>You can encapsulate all of this complexity with two functions:</p>

<p><em>Google Calendar chooses the latest valid civil time when attempting to input a non-existent value (due to a "spring
forward" transition from 02:00 to 03:00 in the Pacific Time zone)</em></p>
<p>What all this means is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unix time and the Gregorian calendar have slightly different goals. The Gregorian calendar and UTC (with leap seconds and leap years) help sync timekeeping to the Sun, whereas Unix time is more about representing precise instants and durations (ignoring concerns around leap seconds for example). Civil timekeeping isn't the same thing as precise time measurement.</li>
<li>Leap seconds and timezones are why a civil day is a "period" (i.e. an ambiguous duration): its duration may be less/greater than the duration of a "physical"/absolute day (86,400 SI seconds) due to leap second adjustments or UTC offset transitions.</li>
<li>The exact duration between 2 civil datetimes may not be immediately obvious due to potential leap second adjustments and UTC offset transitions between those two datetimes.</li>
<li>Computers treat time in a mathematically precise/well-defined way: humans "declared" the Unix epoch to be January 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC+0, and atomic clocks allow us to precisely calculate time elapsed since then such that we know the current time is 06/08/2025 07:37PM (in California at the time I'm writing this post). However, this precision breaks down the further back we go: UTC and atomic timekeeping only began around the mid-20th century, so pre-atomic timestamps lack "true" second-level precision, and even day-level precision is iffy due to calendar reforms (e.g. the Gregorian calendar is actually a successor to the Julian calendar), inconsistent historical record-keeping, and Earth's unstable rotation speed. When we retroactively refer to the datetime "Jan 1 1600 00:00:00 UTC+0", people alive at that absolute instant (some precise # of SI seconds ago) may not have labeled that instant in the same way! Maybe they'd say January 5 1600 (i.e. maybe our timekeeping is off by a few days and that inaccuracy has been lost to time)! However, certainly for datetimes after ~1970, we can be confident in the accuracy of our timekeeping.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Synthesis</h2>
<p>The above conceptual model is all you need to effectively understand how to handle time in programming broadly speaking and make sense of common, misleading advice online. A lot of the commonly cited "gotchas" around timezones and leap seconds can be encapsulated with this point: You can't make assumptions about the validity and progression of civil time that generalize for all timezones. Every region's UTC offset can change by any arbitrary amount at any arbitrary moment, meaning that you have to know the history of time rule changes as well as the current + projected future rules for a given timezone in order to know how civil time progresses every SI second. Think of timezone rules as arbitrary, ever changing UTC offsets. Civil time and UTC are politically/socially convenient constructs, so it's not surprising that they will be messy and imperfect. Moreover, you can't make assumptions about precisely when leap second adjustments will occur; for example, if you wanted to compute the UTC+0 datetime that is ~158 million seconds (~5 years) into the future, you could do that computation, but if a positive leap second is added within that timeframe, then your computed UTC datetime is off by one second because it now represents 158M + 1 second. Whether this is a problem or not depends on the requirements of your program, but the point is that the advice to "just use UTC+0" because of the idea that these timestamps won't change is technically wrong and it's important to understand why.</p>
<h2>The IANA Timezone Database</h2>
<p>Converting absolute time (UTC+0) to civil time for a given location requires knowing what UTC offset applies at that absolute instant. For example, as I write this, Indianapolis (a city in the state of Indiana, USA) is on EDT (Eastern Daylight Time), so when converting the current absolute datetime to EDT, you'd apply the UTC-4 offset to the datetime. Similarly, the times when Indianapolis transitions between EDT and EST are well-defined, so for any future date, it's possible to check if EST or EDT will be in effect and apply the corresponding UTC offset. But what about past datetimes? Indianapolis didn't always follow EST/EDT; they used to follow CST (Central Standard Time), for example, and time rules didn't fully match New York's rules until around 2006. So to determine the local datetime in Indianapolis for the absolute instant Jan 1 2004 00:00:00 UTC, you can't project the current ruleset for Indianapolis backwards to find the relevant UTC offset. You instead need to check the historical records for what offset was active in the past. The exact UTC offset isn't easily predictable for all locations on Earth because time rules can change arbitrarily. So where can you get a detailed history on the time rules for a given location?</p>
<p>The best open-source answer is the IANA database. It's a database that tracks historical timezone rule changes globally. An IANA timezone uniquely refers to the set of regions that not only share the same current rules and projected future rules for civil time, but <em>also</em> share the same history of civil time since 1970-01-01 00:00+0. In other words, this definition is more restrictive about which regions can be grouped under a single IANA timezone, because if a given region changed its civil time rules at any point since 1970 in a a way that deviates from the history of civil time for other regions, then that region can't be grouped with the others (this is why Indianapolis citizens use the <code><span><span>America</span><span>/</span><span>Indiana</span><span>/</span><span>Indianapolis</span></span></code> IANA timezone instead of the <code><span><span>America</span><span>/</span><span>New_York</span></span></code> timezone). The size of a given IANA timezone (e.g. <code><span><span>America</span><span>/</span><span>Los_Angeles</span></span></code> or <code><span><span>America</span><span>/</span><span>New_York</span></span></code>) is typically smaller than timezones like "Pacific Time" and "Eastern Time", because only regions with shared civil time history since 1970 are grouped together, whereas a traditional time zone (e.g. "Eastern Time") merely specifies the current and future UTC offset rules.</p>
<img src="https://shanrauf.com/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming/timezone_boundaries.png">
<p><em>Some IANA timezones are relatively small with irregular borders (Source: Evansiroky2, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Timezone-boundary-builder_release_2023d.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via Wikimedia
Commons</a>, CC BY 4.0)</em></p>
<p>By grouping regions that share the same past, present, and future rules for civil time (i.e. the same rules <a href="https://data.iana.org/time-zones/theory.html#scope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from 1970 onwards</a>), handling timezones becomes much easier: For a given location, as long as you know the corresponding IANA timezone, you can easily convert any absolute time from 1970 onwards into a civil time. Because of the above reasons, many operating systems and timezone libraries already use this database (Mac and Linux store the IANA database at <code><span><span>/usr/share</span><span>/</span><span>zoneinfo</span></span></code>; for Windows, you can <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convert Windows timezones into IANA timezones</a>).</p>
<p>The database is updated occasionally to include recent timezone rule changes around the world, and sometimes to backfill rules from before 1970. While the database does include many rules from before 1970, those rules are not necessarily comprehensive and fully accurate: The database focuses on having an accurate history of rules from 1970 onward (and you can think of the rules from before 1970 as a standardized fiction). This is not an issue for most programs.</p>
<p>While timezone rules can change and there might be a slight lag before the changes are reflected in database releases, virtually all timezone scenarios can be expressed in the IANA format, and most applications don't need more up-to-date data than what the standard database provides.</p>
<p>Every possible time rule change is expressable as UTC offset changes at given absolute instants. Even if theoretically a region using UTC+0 year-round were to skip 2 days, you could express that as a UTC offset transition from UTC+0 to UTC+48 (it's totally legal, even though that'd be a weird thing to do!). This means that practically all of the bizarre UTC offset transitions that people cite online are expressable in the IANA database. (I say "almost" because a few cases that people mention are from before 1970, among other caveats).</p>
<p>For example, people often cite Samoa "skipping" a day as evidence of the complexity of handling timezones; here's what that instant looks like in the IANA database:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>#</span><span> </span><span>Zone</span><span>	</span><span>NAME</span><span>		</span><span>STDOFF</span><span>	</span><span>RULES</span><span>	</span><span>FORMAT</span><span>	</span><span>[</span><span>UNTIL</span><span>]</span><span></span></span>

<p>The active UTC offset for Samoa changed from UTC-11 to UTC+13 at 2011 Dec 29 24:00. That's it!</p>
<p>For absolute instants after 1970, there's almost always an unambiguous conversion to civil time for a given IANA timezone. Most programs won't need to worry about the caveats, but I'll mention them here for completeness:</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;IANA database doesn't represent the DST rules&nbsp;for Morocco (<code><span><span>Africa</span><span>/</span><span>Casablanca</span></span></code>) beyond 2087 because the rules for daylight savings time in Morocco are based on the Islamic calendar and aren't nicely projectable into the future in a way that the database can concisely represent. As a result, the database manually lists the DST transitions for every year up to 2087, and that list may be manually extended further at some point in the future unless Morocco changes their time rules.</li>
<li><code><span><span>Africa</span><span>/</span><span>Monrovia</span></span></code> replaced local mean time in 1972, and Nepal (<code><span><span>Asia</span><span>/</span><span>Kathmandu</span></span></code>) did the same in 1986. Local mean time isn't as precise as UTC, and so if you want precise representations of absolute instants in these timezones, you would only be able to do so after they replaced local mean time.</li>
<li>(I haven't verified myself if there are other IANA timezones similar to the ones I mentioned above, but I'm pretty sure that this sort of thing is rare and not something that most programs need to worry about)</li>
</ul>
<p>"But how would I create a timezone picker where people know which IANA timezone identifier to pick? Can I deduce what IANA timezone to use if I have a location (as longitude/latitude coordinates or an address for example)?" Finding the official standard time and IANA timezone for any given person anywhere in the world at any point in history is a hard problem. If you rely on trying to deduce a timezone given a location (e.g. as an event planning website where people specify an event time and location), you are almost certainly going to make some mistakes. The best thing you can do is to let people specify the timezone that they want themselves, using something like the <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/bcp47/timezone.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unicode CLDR humanized names</a> for IANA timezones. Also, most OSes will tell you the IANA timezone that someone is currently using (on Windows, you can use Unicode CLDR's data <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to convert Windows timezones to IANA timezones), and so you can also use people's system timezone as the default in your program, and that's sufficient for many use cases.</p>
<p>"What happens if a region within a given IANA timezone changes their civil time rules? If their rules diverge from the rules of other regions in the timezone, then the IANA database would need to create a new timezone for that region; how exactly would I detect and handle that in my program?" The first thing to realize is that past datetimes won't have problems, because all datetimes from before the rule change (that causes a certain location to diverge into its own IANA timezone) will still be correct, because it's only the future rules that changed for the location, not the past rules. You'll only have issues if you fail to update to the correct IANA timezone when you're inputting datetimes going forward for that location. There are a few ways you could detect this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have access to the precise location (latitude/longitude) of a given entity that you have a corresponding datetime for, then you could use something like <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/timezone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Time Zone API</a> to check if the IANA key for that location has changed. The issue though is that you don't have control over what version of the IANA database that Google is using, and there's still some margin for error (e.g. at the borders between two timezones).</li>
<li>Assuming that people's system timezone on their OS gets properly updated to the correct IANA timezone, you could notice if that IANA timezone ever diverges from what the system timezone used to be, and act accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, there's only so much you can do to detect this; luckily, most programs won't need to worry about this. If you need precise time rules, you could subscribe to the IANA mailing list where patches to the timezone database are discussed, and if you bundle a copy of the IANA database with your application, you could make changes to the data yourself manually and handle things on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes, local governments change their time rules with little notice, so there's only so much that you can do (e.g. on October 17th, 2017, Sudan gave notice for a time rule change that would go into effect November 1st, 2017, so only 15 days of notice).</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Here are a few hand-picked use cases showing how to apply the above conceptual model:</p>
<h3>Chat forums that order messages by timestamp</h3>
<p>We care about the precise instant that messages were sent, so we can record the current time as a UTC+0 datetime when the server receives chat messages. Then, when displaying messages, the client can convert that UTC+0 datetime into the system timezone.
One thing to note is that this all assumes that the computer that the server is running on can return an accurate absolute time. When calling something like <code><span><span>time</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></code> in C, you're requesting the current time on the machine you're running on, but it's possible for the computer's clock to be slightly inaccurate or non-monotonic (e.g. if a leap second recently occurred, your machine may be off by a second before it does an NTP server sync to get the current UTC time). This is likely not a major concern for something like a chat forum, but the general point is that depending on your program's requirements, you'll want to verify your assumptions (such as the assumption that you can actually <em>get</em> the correct current absolute time if that's something that your program requires).</p>
<p>Let's say you want to add a feature to the chat forum that allows people to schedule a message for "1 day" in the future. Well, the thing to realize is that the language "1 day" is ambiguous: Does it mean adding 24 hours (i.e. 86,400 seconds), or does it mean incrementing the <code><span><span>day</span></span></code> field by 1 on the civil datetime (which may mean only adding 23 hours if the person's system timezone has a daylight savings transition where the clock shifts forwards by 1 hour). This is not a major issue for this program, but it could cause confusion (and it certainly could be a major issue for other programs with stricter precision requirements).</p>
<h3>Event planning website</h3>
<p>Let's say I'm creating a website for users to list information for upcoming events they're hosting. Someone wants to schedule a lecture event where some people will visit the venue in-person, and others around the world will watch the lecture live on Zoom. They specify that the event will happen at <code><span><span>2026</span><span>-</span><span>06</span><span>-</span><span>19</span><span> </span><span>07</span><span>:</span><span>00</span></span></code> at UCLA's Royce Hall (and the website uses their system timezone <code><span><span>America</span><span>/</span><span>Los_Angeles</span></span></code> to interpret that 07:00).</p>
<p>How should the server save this data? If you follow the advice of "just use UTC bro", you might convert <code><span><span>2026</span><span>-</span><span>06</span><span>-</span><span>19</span><span> </span><span>07</span><span>:</span><span>00</span><span> </span><span>UTC</span><span>-</span><span>7</span></span></code> to <code><span><span>2026</span><span>-</span><span>06</span><span>-</span><span>19</span><span> </span><span>14</span><span>:</span><span>00</span><span> </span><span>UTC</span><span>+</span><span>0</span></span></code> and store that datetime. But what happens now if California announces that they plan to abolish daylight savings time starting January 1st, 2026? (this idea is <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5041369-trump-wants-to-end-daylight-saving-time-weve-tried-before-heres-what-happened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">occasionally discussed by politicians</a>) When you converted 07:00 to UTC+0, you were making an assumption that on January 19 2026, California would be on daylight savings time (Pacific Daylight Time). However, now that this is no longer true, the UTC+0 datetime that you stored is off by one hour! You can think of the UTC datetime that you saved as a "cached" datetime because it's based on outdated time rules. The user's intention when specifying "7AM California" was "this event will start at 7AM no matter what, even if California timezone rules change such that the absolute instant in time for the event changes. My intention is for the local clock to show 07:00 when the event starts." The behavior that the creator of this event likely expects is that the event continues to occur at 07:00 in the timezone of the venue location, meaning that the time remains the same in civil terms for local visitors of the venue, but the time changes for everyone else in other timezones (which maybe you'd handle by sending an email notification to registered event participants). One way the website could handle this is by storing the user's exact input <code><span><span>2026</span><span>-</span><span>06</span><span>-</span><span>19</span><span> </span><span>07</span><span>:</span><span>00</span></span></code>, and also store the UTC+0 version of that datetime (if we assumed that the timezone rules won't change); this way, we can keep using the UTC+0 datetime for all logic, and we can recompute that UTC+0 datetime once we detect that the time rules for that timezone have changed.</p>
<p>Here's another example: What if someone was listing an in-person event for viewing an upcoming solar eclipse? The eclipse will happen at an absolute instant in time, so in this case, the time that the user specifies <strong>should</strong> be converted to a UTC+0 datetime, and then if time rules ever change, then it would be correct to keep using that UTC+0 datetime and convert it to the new local datetime for the event. So there isn't a "right" answer for the implementation; the point is to be clear on what the user's intentions are and handle those accordingly.</p>
<h3>A personal project</h3>
<p>Here's a specific example from my life: I'm currently working on a desktop app (Windows/Linux/Mac) that needs accurate civil datetimes from 1970 onward. Here’s what I plan to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a library</a> that works directly with a copy of the IANA database (which I'll bundle with my application instead of relying on the OS data), and I'll periodically download the latest version of the database to keep it reasonably up-to-date. I'll store computed UTC datetimes for all inputted local times, and then for every new version of the IANA database, reconvert the local datetimes into UTC+0 datetimes using the latest IANA database version (i.e. applying any potential changes that have occured. No need to be smart for now about only recomputing for timezones that have actually changed).<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This approach to fetching the latest IANA databse is similar to how <a href="https://github.com/lau/tzdata?tab=readme-ov-file#automatic-data-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time libraries like tzdata in Elixir</a> do things.</li>
<li>I'll convert Windows timezones into IANA timezones using <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this file</a> from the Unicode CLDR project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Save the user's system timezone when the application first starts. For UI operations where users are specifying a datetime, prefill the timezone option with that saved timezone, but also allow them to change the value of that timezone dropdown, and also have a "Make default" checkbox for the timezone. This way, the default behavior is what most users want, and changing the default timezone or doing a one-off for a different timezone is not too difficult. The dropdown will use humanized names for the IANA timezone keys, which I'll get from the Unicode CLDR project <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/bcp47/timezone.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

            The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/22/politics/trump-iran-strike-decision-inside">US military strikes on three of Iran’s nuclear facilities</a> last weekend did not destroy the core components of the country’s nuclear program and likely only set it back by months, according to an early US intelligence assessment that was described by seven people briefed on it.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcatncja000c3b6m4lumb8aw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The assessment, which has not been previously reported, was produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon’s intelligence arm. It is based on a battle damage assessment conducted by US Central Command in the aftermath of the US strikes, one of the sources said.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcatncja000d3b6muokzq00o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The analysis of the damage to the sites and the impact of the strikes on Iran’s nuclear ambitions is ongoing, and could change as more intelligence becomes available. But the early findings are at odds with President Donald Trump’s repeated claims that the strikes “completely and totally obliterated” Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth also said on Sunday that Iran’s nuclear ambitions “have been obliterated.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcaus87l001f3b6m0br6vydm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Two of the people familiar with the assessment said Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was not destroyed. One of the people said the centrifuges are largely “intact.” Another source said that the intelligence assessed enriched uranium was moved out of the sites prior to the US strikes.
    </p>

            “So the (DIA) assessment is that the US set them back maybe a few months, tops,” this person added.

            The White House acknowledged the existence of the assessment but said they disagreed with it.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcav3k1t001s3b6mwi312jvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement: “This alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as ‘top secret’ but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community. The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran’s nuclear program. Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcbbpjty00023b6mlibiznrr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Trump, who’s in the Netherlands attending this week’s NATO summit, pushed back on CNN’s report in a Truth Social post. “One of the most successful military strikes in history,” Trump wrote in the all-caps post adding, “The nuclear sites in Iran are completely destroyed!”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcauxyrz001l3b6mq2yyxt8r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The US military has said the operation went as planned and that it was an “overwhelming success.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcatnmxv000y3b6mblwtdi87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            It is still early for the US to have a comprehensive picture of the impact of the strikes, and none of the sources described how the DIA assessment compares to the view of other agencies in the intelligence community. The US is continuing to pick up intelligence, including from within Iran as they assess the damage.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcatncja000f3b6mlwskvn3g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Israel had been carrying out strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities for days leading up to the US military operation but claimed to need the US’ 30,000-pound <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/18/politics/bunker-buster-weapon-explained-dg">bunker buster bombs</a> to finish the job. While US B-2 bombers dropped over a dozen of the bombs on two of the nuclear facilities, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment plant and the Natanz Enrichment Complex, the bombs did not fully eliminate the sites’ centrifuges and highly enriched uranium, according to the people familiar with the assessment.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcatncja000g3b6mn9b6q4ey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Instead, the impact to all three sites — Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan — was largely restricted to aboveground structures, which were severely damaged, the sources said. That includes the sites’ power infrastructure and some of the aboveground facilities used to turn uranium into metal for bomb-making.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcazzkai000e3b6mh4fhvoyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The Israeli assessment of the impact of the US strikes also found less damage on Fordow than expected. However, Israeli officials believe the combination of US and Israeli military action on multiple nuclear sites set back the Iranian nuclear program by two years, assuming they are able to rebuild it unimpeded which Israel would not allow. But Israel had also stated publicly before the US military operation that Iran’s program had been set back by two years.
    </p>

            Hegseth also told CNN, “Based on everything we have seen — and I’ve seen it all — our bombing campaign obliterated Iran’s ability to create nuclear weapons. Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target and worked perfectly. The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission.“
    </p>

            On Tuesday morning, Trump repeated his belief the damage from the strikes was significant.

            “I think it’s been completely demolished,” he said, adding, “Those pilots hit their targets. Those targets were obliterated, and the pilots should be given credit.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcatncja000m3b6m0to4aecq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Asked about the possibility of Iran rebuilding its nuclear program, Trump responded, “That place is under rock. That place is demolished.”

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcatncja000n3b6mwrm2p19q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            While Trump and Hegseth have been bullish about the success of the strikes, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine said Sunday that while the damage assessment was still ongoing it would be “way too early” to comment on whether Iran still retains some nuclear capabilities.
    </p>

            Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would not echo Trump’s claims that the Iranian program had been “obliterated” when pressed by CNN on Tuesday.

            “I’ve been briefed on this plan in the past, and it was never meant to completely destroy the nuclear facilities, but rather cause significant damage,” McCaul told CNN, referring to the US military plans to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. “But it was always known to be a temporary setback.”

            Jeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who has closely reviewed commercial satellite imagery of the strike sites, agreed with the assessment that the attacks do not appear to have ended Iran’s nuclear program.

            “The ceasefire came without either Israel or the United States being able to destroy several key underground nuclear facilities, including near Natanz, Isfahan and Parchin,” Lewis said, referring to the ceasefire between Israel and Iran that Trump announced on Monday.

<p>People keep telling me that X11 doesn’t support DPI scaling, or fractional scaling, or multiple monitors, or something. There’s nothing you can do to make it work. I find this surprising. Why doesn’t it work? I figure the best way to find out is try the impossible and see how far we get.</p><p>I’m just going to draw a two inch circle on the screen.

Even better, I didn’t mention that I wasn’t actually running this program on my laptop. It was running on my router in another room, but everything worked as if by <span>MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</span>. Alas, we are still no closer to understanding why people say this is impossible.</p><p>Anyway, I think the point is we should probably ignore the people who can’t do something when they tell us we can’t do it either. I woke up this morning not knowing precisely how to draw a scaled circle, having never done so before, but armed with a vague sense that surely it must be possible, because come on of course it is, I got it working. And now look at me, driven insane by the relentless stare of three unblinking eyes.</p><p>With my new knowledge, I also wrote an onscreen <a href="https://humungus.tedunangst.com/r/xtoys/v/tip/f/ruler.c">ruler</a> using the shape extension. Somewhat tautological for measuring the two inch circle, but in the event anyone asks, I can now tell them my terminal line height is 1/8”, and yes, I measured.</p><p><img src="https://flak.tedunangst.com/images/terminal-ruler.jpg">

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://docs.rs/subsecond/0.7.0-alpha.1/subsecond/index.html">https://docs.rs/subsecond/0.7.0-alpha.1/subsecond/index.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44369642">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><rustdoc-search></rustdoc-search><section id="main-content"><details open=""><summary><span>Expand description</span></summary><div><h2 id="subsecond-hot-patching-for-rust"><a href="#subsecond-hot-patching-for-rust">§</a>Subsecond: Hot-patching for Rust</h2>
<p>Subsecond is a library that enables hot-patching for Rust applications. This allows you to change
the code of a running application without restarting it. This is useful for game engines, servers,
and other long-running applications where the typical edit-compile-run cycle is too slow.</p>
<p>Subsecond also implements a technique we call “ThinLinking” which makes compiling Rust code
significantly faster in development mode, which can be used outside of hot-patching.</p>
<h2 id="usage"><a href="#usage">§</a>Usage</h2>
<p>Subsecond is designed to be as simple for both application developers and library authors.</p>
<p>Simply call your existing functions with <a href="https://docs.rs/subsecond/0.7.0-alpha.1/subsecond/fn.call.html" title="fn subsecond::call"><code>call</code></a> and Subsecond will automatically detour
that call to the latest version of the function.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>for </span>x <span>in </span><span>0</span>..<span>5 </span>{
    subsecond::call(|| {
        <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello, world! {}"</span>, x);
    });
}</code></pre></div>
<p>To actually load patches into your application, a third-party tool that implements the Subsecond
compiler and protocol is required. Subsecond is built and maintained by the Dioxus team, so we
suggest using the dioxus CLI tool to use subsecond.</p>
<p>To install the Dioxus CLI, we recommend using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binstall"><code>cargo binstall</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code>cargo binstall dioxus-cli</code></pre></div>
<p>The Dioxus CLI provides several tools for development. To run your application with Subsecond enabled,
use <code>dx serve</code> - this takes the same arguments as <code>cargo run</code> but will automatically hot-reload your
application when changes are detected.</p>
<p>As of Dioxus 0.7, “–hotpatch” is required to use hotpatching while Subsecond is still experimental.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works">§</a>How it works</h3>
<p>Subsecond works by detouring function calls through a jump table. This jump table contains the latest
version of the program’s function pointers, and when a function is called, Subsecond will look up
the function in the jump table and call that instead.</p>
<p>Unlike libraries like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/detour">detour</a>, Subsecond <em>does not</em> modify your
process memory. Patching pointers is wildly unsafe and can lead to crashes and undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Instead, an external tool compiles only the parts of your project that changed, links them together
using the addresses of the functions in your running program, and then sends the new jump table to
your application. Subsecond then applies the patch and continues running. Since Subsecond doesn’t
modify memory, the program must have a runtime integration to handle the patching.</p>
<p>If the framework you’re using doesn’t integrate with subsecond, you can rely on the fact that calls
to stale <a href="https://docs.rs/subsecond/0.7.0-alpha.1/subsecond/fn.call.html" title="fn subsecond::call"><code>call</code></a> instances will emit a safe panic that is automatically caught and retried
by the next <a href="https://docs.rs/subsecond/0.7.0-alpha.1/subsecond/fn.call.html" title="fn subsecond::call"><code>call</code></a> instance up the callstack.</p>
<p>Subsecond is only enabled when debug_assertions are enabled so you can safely ship your application
with Subsecond enabled without worrying about the performance overhead.</p>
<h3 id="workspace-support"><a href="#workspace-support">§</a>Workspace support</h3>
<p>Subsecond currently only patches the “tip” crate - ie the crate in which your <code>main.rs</code> is located.
Changes to crates outside this crate will be ignored, which can be confusing. We plan to add full
workspace support in the future, but for now be aware of this limitation. Crate setups that have
a <code>main.rs</code> importing a <code>lib.rs</code> won’t patch sensibly since the crate becomes a library for itself.</p>
<p>This is due to limitations in rustc itself where the build-graph is non-deterministic and changes
to functions that forward generics can cause a cascade of codegen changes.</p>
<h3 id="globals-statics-and-thread-locals"><a href="#globals-statics-and-thread-locals">§</a>Globals, statics, and thread-locals</h3>
<p>Subsecond <em>does</em> support hot-reloading of globals, statics, and thread locals. However, there are several limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may add new globals at runtime, but their destructors will never be called.</li>
<li>Globals are tracked across patches, but will renames are considered to be <em>new</em> globals.</li>
<li>Changes to static initializers will not be observed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsecond purposefully handles statics this way since many libraries like Dioxus and Tokio rely
on persistent global runtimes.</p>
<p>HUGE WARNING: Currently, thread-locals in the “tip” crate (the one being patched) will seemingly
reset to their initial value on new patches. This is because we don’t currently bind thread-locals
in the patches to their original addresses in the main program. If you rely on thread-locals heavily
in your tip crate, you should be aware of this. Sufficiently complex setups might crash or even
segfault. We plan to fix this in the future, but for now, you should be aware of this limitation.</p>
<h3 id="struct-layout-and-alignment"><a href="#struct-layout-and-alignment">§</a>Struct layout and alignment</h3>
<p>Subsecond currently does not support hot-reloading of structs. This is because the generated code
assumes a particular layout and alignment of the struct. If layout or alignment change and new
functions are called referencing an old version of the struct, the program will crash.</p>
<p>To mitigate this, framework authors can integrate with Subsecond to either dispose of the old struct
or to re-allocate the struct in a way that is compatible with the new layout. This is called “re-instancing.”</p>
<p>In practice, frameworks that implement subsecond patching properly will throw out the old state
and thus you should never witness a segfault due to misalignment or size changes. Frameworks are
encouraged to aggressively dispose of old state that might cause size and alignment changes.</p>
<p>We’d like to lift this limitation in the future by providing utilities to re-instantiate structs,
but for now it’s up to the framework authors to handle this. For example, Dioxus apps simply throw
out the old state and rebuild it from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="pointer-versioning"><a href="#pointer-versioning">§</a>Pointer versioning</h3>
<p>Currently, Subsecond does not “version” function pointers. We have plans to provide this metadata
so framework authors can safely memoize changes without much runtime overhead. Frameworks like
Dioxus and Bevy circumvent this issue by using the TypeID of structs passed to hot functions as
well as the <code>ptr_address</code> method on <a href="https://docs.rs/subsecond/0.7.0-alpha.1/subsecond/struct.HotFn.html" title="struct subsecond::HotFn"><code>HotFn</code></a> to determine if the function pointer has changed.</p>
<p>Currently, the <code>ptr_address</code> method will always return the most up-to-date version of the function
even if the function contents itself did not change. In essence, this is equivalent to a version
of the function where every function is considered “new.” This means that framework authors who
integrate re-instancing in their apps might dispose of old state too aggressively. For now, this
is the safer and more practical approach.</p>
<h3 id="nesting-calls"><a href="#nesting-calls">§</a>Nesting Calls</h3>
<p>Subsecond calls are designed to be nested. This provides clean integration points to know exactly
where a hooked function is called.</p>
<p>The highest level call is <code>fn main()</code> though by default this is not hooked since initialization code
tends to be side-effectual and modify global state. Instead, we recommend wrapping the hot-patch

<p>The goal here is to provide granular control over where patches are applied to limit loss of state
when new code is loaded.</p>
<h3 id="applying-patches"><a href="#applying-patches">§</a>Applying patches</h3>
<p>When running under the Dioxus CLI, the <code>dx serve</code> command will automatically apply patches when
changes are detected. Patches are delivered over the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/dioxus-devtools">Dioxus Devtools</a>
websocket protocol and received by corresponding websocket.</p>
<p>If you’re using Subsecond in your own application that doesn’t have a runtime integration, you can
build an integration using the <a href="https://docs.rs/subsecond/0.7.0-alpha.1/subsecond/fn.apply_patch.html" title="fn subsecond::apply_patch"><code>apply_patch</code></a> function. This function takes a <code>JumpTable</code> which
the dioxus-cli crate can generate.</p>
<p>To add support for the Dioxus Devtools protocol to your app, you can use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/dioxus-devtools">dioxus-devtools</a>
crate which provides a <code>connect</code> method that will automatically apply patches to your application.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one design quirk of Subsecond is that running apps need to communicate the address
of <code>main</code> to the patcher. This is due to a security technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">ASLR</a>
which randomizes the address of functions in memory. See the subsecond-harness and subsecond-cli
for more details on how to implement the protocol.</p>
<h3 id="thinlink"><a href="#thinlink">§</a>ThinLink</h3>
<p>ThinLink is a program linker for Rust that is designed to be used with Subsecond. It implements
the powerful patching system that Subsecond uses to hot-reload Rust applications.</p>
<p>ThinLink is simply a wrapper around your existing linker but with extra features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic dynamic linking to dependencies</li>
<li>Generation of Subsecond jump tables</li>
<li>Diffing of object files for function invalidation</li>
</ul>
<p>Because ThinLink performs very to little actual linking, it drastically speeds up traditional Rust
development. With a development-optimized profile, ThinLink can shrink an incremental build to less than 500ms.</p>
<p>ThinLink is automatically integrated into the Dioxus CLI though it’s currently not available as
a standalone tool.</p>
<h3 id="limitations"><a href="#limitations">§</a>Limitations</h3>
<p>Subsecond is a powerful tool but it has several limitations. We talk about them above, but here’s
a quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Struct hot reloading requires instancing or unwinding</li>
<li>Statics are tracked but not destructed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="platform-support"><a href="#platform-support">§</a>Platform support</h3>
<p>Subsecond works across all major platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a)</li>
<li>iOS (arm64)</li>
<li>Linux (x86_64, aarch64)</li>
<li>macOS (x86_64, aarch64)</li>
<li>Windows (x86_64, arm64)</li>
<li>WebAssembly (wasm32)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a new platform you’d like to see supported, please open an issue on the Subsecond repository.
We are keen to add support for new platforms like wasm64, riscv64, and more.</p>
<p>Note that iOS device is currently not supported due to code-signing requirements. We hope to fix
this in the future, but for now you can use the simulator to test your app.</p>
<h3 id="adding-the-subsecond-badge-to-your-project"><a href="#adding-the-subsecond-badge-to-your-project">§</a>Adding the Subsecond badge to your project</h3>
<p>If you’re a framework author and want your users to know that your library supports Subsecond, you
can add the Subsecond badge to your README! Users will know that your library is hot-reloadable and
can be used with Subsecond.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 18:41:26 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.cottongeeks.com/articles/2025-06-24-fun-with-uv-and-pep-723">https://www.cottongeeks.com/articles/2025-06-24-fun-with-uv-and-pep-723</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44369388">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>              <h2> Fun with uv and PEP 723 <time datetime="2025-06-24T00:00:00.000Z"> June 24, 2025 </time> </h2>  <p>For the longest time, I have been frustrated with Python because I couldn’t use it for one-off scripts. I had to first ensure it was running in an environment where it could find the right Python version and the dependencies installed. That is now a thing of the past.</p>

<p>If you are not a Pythonista (or one possibly living under a rock), <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> is <em>an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.</em></p>
<p>uv also provides this nifty tool called <code>uvx</code> (kinda like <code>npx</code> from the Node/NPM ecosystem for Javascript/Typescript packages) which can be used to invoke a Python tool inside a package. <code>uvx</code> takes care of creating a (cached) disposable virtual environment, setting up the right Python version and installing all the dependencies before running.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>$ uvx ruff --version</span></span>
<span><span>Installed 1 package in 5ms</span></span>
<span><span>ruff 0.12.0</span></span></code></pre>

<p><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/">PEP 723</a> is a Python Enhancement Proposal that <em>specifies a metadata format that can be embedded in single-file Python scripts to assist launchers, IDEs and other external tools which may need to interact with such scripts.</em></p>
<p>Here is the example directly lifted from the proposal:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span># /// script</span></span>
<span><span># requires-python = "&gt;=3.11"</span></span>
<span><span># dependencies = [</span></span>
<span><span>#   "requests&lt;3",</span></span>
<span><span>#   "rich",</span></span>
<span><span># ]</span></span>
<span><span># ///</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> requests</span></span>
<span><span>from</span><span> rich.pretty </span><span>import</span><span> pprint</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>resp </span><span>=</span><span> requests.get(</span><span>"https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>data </span><span>=</span><span> resp.json()</span></span>
<span><span>pprint([(k, v[</span><span>"title"</span><span>]) </span><span>for</span><span> k, v </span><span>in</span><span> data.items()][:</span><span>10</span><span>])</span></span></code></pre>

<p>Combining uv and the PEP-723 metadata inside a Python script, we can run the script in the previous section as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>$ uv run pep.py</span></span>
<span><span>Installed 9 packages in 24ms</span></span>
<span><span>[</span></span>
<span><span>│   ('1', 'PEP Purpose and Guidelines'),</span></span>
<span><span>│   ('2', 'Procedure for Adding New Modules'),</span></span>
<span><span>│   ('3', 'Guidelines for Handling Bug Reports'),</span></span>
<span><span>│   ('4', 'Deprecation of Standard Modules'),</span></span>
<span><span>│   ('5', 'Guidelines for Language Evolution'),</span></span>
<span><span>│   ('6', 'Bug Fix Releases'),</span></span>
<span><span>│   ('7', 'Style Guide for C Code'),</span></span>
<span><span>│   ('8', 'Style Guide for Python Code'),</span></span>
<span><span>│   ('9', 'Sample Plaintext PEP Template'),</span></span>
<span><span>│   ('10', 'Voting Guidelines')</span></span>
<span><span>]</span></span></code></pre>

<p>We can combine things we covered in the previous sections to create a simple executable script that can extract YouTube transcripts.</p>
<p>First we create a Python script with a shebang and inline metadata.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script</span></span>
<span><span># /// script</span></span>
<span><span># requires-python = "&gt;=3.8"</span></span>
<span><span># dependencies = [</span></span>
<span><span>#     "youtube-transcript-api",</span></span>
<span><span># ]</span></span>
<span><span># ///</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> sys</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> re</span></span>
<span><span>from</span><span> youtube_transcript_api </span><span>import</span><span> YouTubeTranscriptApi</span></span>
<span><span>from</span><span> youtube_transcript_api.formatters </span><span>import</span><span> TextFormatter</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>if</span><span> len</span><span>(sys.argv) </span><span>&lt;</span><span> 2</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>    print</span><span>(</span><span>'Usage: provide YouTube URL or video_id as argument'</span><span>, </span><span>file</span><span>=</span><span>sys.stderr)</span></span>
<span><span>    sys.exit(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>url_or_id </span><span>=</span><span> sys.argv[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Extract video ID from URL if it's a full URL</span></span>

<span><span>if</span><span> video_id_match:</span></span>
<span><span>    video_id </span><span>=</span><span> video_id_match.group(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>else</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>    # Assume it's already a video ID</span></span>
<span><span>    video_id </span><span>=</span><span> url_or_id</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>try</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>    ytt_api </span><span>=</span><span> YouTubeTranscriptApi()</span></span>
<span><span>    transcript </span><span>=</span><span> ytt_api.fetch(video_id)</span></span>
<span><span>    formatter </span><span>=</span><span> TextFormatter()</span></span>
<span><span>    print</span><span>(formatter.format_transcript(transcript))</span></span>
<span><span>except</span><span> Exception</span><span> as</span><span> e:</span></span>
<span><span>    print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>'Error: </span><span>{</span><span>e</span><span>}</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>file</span><span>=</span><span>sys.stderr)</span></span>
<span><span>    sys.exit(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Note the shebang line: <code>#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script</code>. It is important to specify <code>uv run</code> with the <code>--script</code> flag when used on the shebang line.</p>
<p>We save this script as <code>ytt</code> and then make it executable with <code>chmod +x ytt</code>.</p>
<p>We can now run the script like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>$ ./ytt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgSQr0d5EVg</span></span>
<span><span>Installed 7 packages in 10ms</span></span>
<span><span>hey it's Matt here and today I'm going</span></span>
<span><span>to show you how to use UV not only to</span></span>
<span><span>install packages in your python projects</span></span>
<span><span>but to manage entire projects to create</span></span>
<span><span>virtual environments and even how to</span></span>
<span><span>manage entire versions of python with UV</span></span>
<span><span>uh and hopefully you'll understand by</span></span>
<span><span>any of this video UV is a dropin</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>…&lt;snipped text&gt;…</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="fun-times">Fun times</h2>
<p>This opens up a lot of possibilities for running Python code more seamlessly. Before this I used to prefer <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> for one-off scripts because it was easy to create a self-contained binary executable. But now that I could use uv, I coded up a quick MCP server in Python for extracting YouTube transcripts. Check it out on Github at <a href="https://github.com/cottongeeks/ytt-mcp">cottongeeks/ytt-mcp</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><!-- Article Start--><p>A 21-year-old Norwegian tourist claims he was denied entry to the United States and harassed by ICE agents after they discovered a JD Vance meme on his phone.</p> <p>Mads Mikkelsen arrived at New Jersey's Newark Airport on June 11 when he was pulled aside by border control and placed in a cell, he told Norwegian outlet Nordlys. Mads was travelling to the States to visit friends, first in New York and then in Austin, Texas, but suffered "harassment and abuse of power" at the hands of US immigration authorities.</p> <p>"I felt prejudiced, suspected and simply humiliated even then, in front of many other people at the airport," The Tromsø native recounted. "They took me to a room with several armed guards, where I had to hand over my shoes, mobile phone and backpack."</p> <p>Officers quizzed Mads about his visit, and his plans, before adopting a personal line of questioning. "They asked direct questions about drug smuggling, terrorist plans and right-wing extremism, completely without reason," he claimed.</p> <p>"They demanded full information about everyone I was going to meet in the US, including name, address, phone number and what they did for work." Mads' mother was due to meet up with him a few weeks into his stay and the pair had planned to travel to several national parks.</p> <p>"I had travelled for twelve hours, slept poorly, and was physically and mentally completely exhausted even before they started the questioning," he continued. A strenuous crackdown by U.S. Customs and Border Protection has followed President Donald Trump's return to office, with the service being allowed to search phones.</p> <p>A French scientist was denied entry at the border earlier this year, in March, after officers unearthed messages criticising Trump on his phone. Mikkelsen explained: "They threatened me with a minimum fine of $5,000 or five years in prison if I refused to provide the password to my phone."</p> <p>After handing over his password, Mads was told he would not be allowed to go through with his planned vacation after two images were not to the officers' liking. One image was of a meme showcasing JD Vance with a bald, egg-shaped head. Variations of the image were shared endlessly in March on social media, with the Vice President himself posting his own version.</p> <p>The other picture showed Mads with a wooden pipe which he had made years prior. "Both pictures had been automatically saved to my camera roll from a chat app, but I really didn't think that these innocent pictures would put a stop to my entry into the country," the 21-year-old admitted.</p> <p>Mads told Nordlys he tried to explain the images as being harmless and meant as jokes but the immigration authorities ignored his pleas. He claims he was then strip-searched, forced to give blood samples, a facial scan and fingerprints.</p> <p>"Later I was taken back in, and the situation got even worse. I was pushed up against a wall and was strip-searched with a lot of force. They were incredibly harsh and used physical force the whole time," he claimed.</p> <p>"I felt completely devastated and broke down, and was close to crying several times. I was on the verge of panic. It felt like I was a terrorist suspect where I was sitting. I tried to pull myself together several times, but in the end, I just wanted to get home again."</p> <p>The Norwegian adds he was placed in a cell for a further five hours, refused food or water and placed on a plane back to Oslo the same day he arrived for the holiday of a lifetime. "I don't feel there is any point in contacting the State Department, nor do I think they have any power against such a powerful and strict country as the United States," Mads conceded.</p> <p>Mathias Rongved, a spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned fellow Norwegians that it is their duty to be clued up on US regulations before entering the country. "Most trips to the US go without any particular problems," he said.</p> <p>"Entry regulations can change at short notice, and it is the traveller's responsibility to have valid documents and be familiar with the current entry regulations. It is the immigration authorities upon arrival who decide whether you are rejected at the border. Norwegian authorities cannot intervene in this decision.</p> <p>"It is also not necessarily the case that we receive a message either from other countries' border authorities or the Norwegian traveller if the person in question is not allowed to enter a country."</p>   <p><b>Join our Dublin Live breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click</b><a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/DJTiyHweTeJHu5aLKRIiPc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <b>this link</b> </a><b>to receive your daily dose of Dublin Live content.

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple customers aren’t thrilled they’re getting an ad from the Apple Wallet app promoting the tech giant’s Original Film, “F1 the Movie.” <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1937551035825807545">Across</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWallet/comments/1ljbjrs/how_do_i_turn_this_off">social</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1ljd94e/disable_fandango_ad_from_apple_pay/">media</a>, iPhone owners are complaining that their Wallet app sent out a push notification offering a $10 discount at Fandango for anyone buying two or more tickets to the film. </p>

<p>The feature film, starring Brad Pitt, explores the world of Formula 1 and was shot at actual Grand Prix races.

<p>“I did not pay over $1000 for an iPhone to get advertised at,” <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1ljd94e/disable_fandango_ad_from_apple_pay/">complains</a> one Reddit user (u/captain42d). Another recent post, already with dozens of replies, wants to know <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWallet/comments/1ljbjrs/how_do_i_turn_this_off">how to turn off Apple Pay ads</a>. </p>

<p>As it turns out, there’s a new option in iOS 26’s beta build to disable “Offers &amp; Promotions” from Apple Wallet that isn’t available in the current release. Instead, users not on the new beta build only have the option to disable notifications or to turn off seeing card benefits within Wallet during checkout. They can’t opt out of offers.</p>

<p>The addition of the new control toggle in iOS 26 suggests that Apple plans to push more marketing messages and promotions through the Wallet app in the future — something many iPhone users won’t appreciate. </p>

<p>Apple customers are generally averse to advertisements and marketing efforts pushed to their devices without their consent. In the past, they’ve pushed back at ads for Apple’s services <a rel="nofollow" href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/ios_adware">in their iOS Settings</a>, for example. And over 10 years later, people are still complaining about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.stereogum.com/2279219/u2-songs-of-innocence-apple-iphones/columns/sounding-board/">U2 album</a> that automatically appeared in their iTunes music library.</p>


<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All these F1 movie notifications from Apple is the equivalent of when they put that U2 album on everyone’s iTunes back in the day no one asked for. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://t.co/ukNLzwtuFD">pic.twitter.com/ukNLzwtuFD</a></p>— John Vezmar (@johnvezmar) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/johnvezmar/status/1937526455556039031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p>Recalling that marketing debacle, one Reddit user writes of the new Wallet push notification for the F1 film, “I am getting Bono flashbacks.” </p>

<p>Apple has been heavily promoting the F1 film along with its distribution partner, Warner Bros., which has included the launch of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91350375/f1-the-movie-trailer-apple-haptic-feel-cars-moving-brad-pitt">haptic trailer with vibration feedback</a>. The company even kicked off its recent WWDC 2025 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_DjDdfqtUE&amp;t=5404s">keynote</a> this month with a preview of the film’s action, with participation from Apple CEO Tim Cook and SVP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, as a race car driver.</p>

<p>We reached out to Apple for comment and did not immediately hear back.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Federal judge William Alsup <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.434709/gov.uscourts.cand.434709.231.0_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ruled</a> that it was legal for Anthropic to train its AI models on published books without the authors’ permission. This marks the first time that the courts have given credence to AI companies’ claim that fair use doctrine can absolve AI companies from fault when they use copyrighted materials to train large language models (LLMs).</p>

<p>This decision comes as a blow to authors, artists, and publishers who have brought dozens of lawsuits against companies like OpenAI, Meta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/disney-and-universal-sue-midjourney-alleging-ai-related-copyright-infringement/">Midjourney</a>, Google, and more. While the ruling is not a guarantee that other judges will follow Judge Alsup’s lead, it lays the foundation for courts to side with tech companies over creatives.</p>







<p>These lawsuits often depend on how a judge interprets fair use doctrine, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/03/unofficial-bridgerton-musical-lawsuit-netflix-barlow-bear/">notoriously finicky</a> carve-out of copyright law that <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/#:~:text=L.%20No.%2094%2D553,subsequent%20amendments%20to%20Title%2017." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hasn’t been updated</a> since 1976 — a time before the internet, let alone the concept of generative AI training sets.</p>

<p>Fair use rulings take into account what the work is being used for (parody and education can be viable), whether it’s being reproduced for commercial gain (you can write “Star Wars” fan fiction, but you can’t sell it), and how transformative a derivative work is from the original.</p>

<p>Companies like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/meta-says-copying-books-was-fair-use-authors-ai-lawsuit-2025-03-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Meta</a> have made similar fair use arguments in defense of training on copyrighted works, though before this week’s decision, it was less clear how the courts would sway.</p>

<p>In this particular case, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69058235/bartz-v-anthropic-pbc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bartz v. Anthropic</a>, the group of plaintiff authors also brought into question the manner in which Anthropic attained and stored their works. According to the lawsuit, Anthropic sought to create a “central library” of “all the books in the world” to keep “forever.” But millions of these copyrighted books were downloaded for free from pirate sites, which is unambiguously illegal.</p>

<p>While the judge granted that Anthropic’s training of these materials was a fair use, the court will hold a trial about the nature of the “central library.”</p>


<p>“We will have a trial on the pirated copies used to create Anthropic’s central library and the resulting damages,” Judge Alsup wrote in the decision. “That Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for theft but it may affect the extent of statutory damages.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>   <div> <h3> June 24, 2025 </h3> <p> <h3>Nico Waisman</h3> <h4>Head of Security</h4> </p> </div> <hr> <div> <p>For the first time in bug bounty history, an autonomous penetration tester has reached the top spot on the US leaderboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://xbow.com/_astro/top1-image2.I2cpMxV6_Z1CXWXw.webp" alt="" width="738" height="380" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Our path to reaching the top ranks on HackerOne began with rigorous benchmarking. Since the early days of XBOW, we understood how crucial it was to measure our progress, and we did that in two stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>First we tested XBOW with existing CTF challenges (from well-known providers like PortSwigger and Pentesterlab), then quickly moved on and built our own <a href="https://github.com/xbow-engineering/validation-benchmarks/">unique benchmark</a> that simulates real-world scenarios—ones never used to train LLMs before. The results were encouraging, but still these were artificial exercises.</li>
<li>The logical next step, therefore, was to focus on discovering zero-day vulnerabilities in open source projects, which led to many exciting findings. Some of these were reported on this blog before: in every case, we gave the AI access to source code, simulating a white-box pentest. While our paying customers were enthusiastic about XBOW’s capabilities, the community raised a key question: How would XBOW perform in real, black-box production environments? We took up that challenge, choosing to compete in one of the largest hacker arenas, where companies serve as the ultimate judges by verifying and triaging vulnerabilities themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dogfooding-ai-in-bug-bounties">Dogfooding AI in Bug Bounties</h3>
<p>XBOW is a fully autonomous AI-driven penetration tester. It requires no human input, operates much like a human pentester, but can scale rapidly, completing comprehensive penetration tests in just a few hours.</p>
<p>When building AI software, having precise benchmarks to keep pushing the limit of what’s possible, is essential. But when some of those benchmarks evolve into real-world environments, it’s a developer’s dream come true.</p>
<p>Discovering bugs in structured benchmarks and open source projects was a fantastic starting point. However, nothing can truly prepare you for the immense diversity of real-world environments, which span from cutting-edge technologies to 30-year-old legacy systems. No number of design partners can offer that breadth of system variety as that level of unpredictability is nearly impossible to simulate.</p>
<p>To bridge that gap, we started dogfooding XBOW in public and private bug bounty programs hosted on HackerOne. We treated it like any external researcher would: no shortcuts, no internal knowledge—just XBOW, running on its own.</p>
<p>HackerOne offers this unique opportunity, and as XBOW discovered and reported vulnerabilities across multiple programs, we soon found ourselves climbing the H1 ranks.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-discovery-and-scoping-capabilities">Scaling Discovery and Scoping capabilities</h3>
<p>Our first challenge was scaling. While XBOW can easily scan thousands of web apps simultaneously, HackerOne hosts hundreds of thousands of potential targets. As a startup with limited resources, even when we focused on specific vulnerability classes, we still needed to be strategic. That’s why we built infrastructure on top of XBOW to help us identify the high-value targets and prioritize those that would maximize our return on investment.</p>
<p>We started by consuming bug bounty program scopes and policies, but this information isn’t always machine-readable. With a combination of large language models and some manual curation, we managed to parse through them—with a few hiccups. (At one point, we were officially removed from a program that didn’t allow “automatic scanners.”)</p>
<p>With the domains ingested into our database, and a bit of “magic” to expand subdomains, we built a scoring system to highlight the most interesting targets. This scoring criteria covered a broad range of signals, including target appearance, presence of WAFs and other protections, HTTP status codes, redirect behavior, authentication forms, number of reachable endpoints, underlying technologies, and more.</p>
<p>Domain deduplication quickly became essential in large programs, it is common to encounter cloned or staging environments(e.g. stage0001-dev.example.com). Once a vulnerability is found in one, similar issues are likely to exist across others. To stay efficient, we used SimHash to detect content-level similarity and leveraged a headless browser to capture website screenshots and then applied imagehash techniques to assess visual similarity analysis, allowing us to group assets and focus our efforts on unique, high-impact targets.</p>
<h3 id="automated-vulnerability-discovery">Automated Vulnerability Discovery</h3>
<p>AI can be remarkably effective at discovering a broad range of vulnerabilities—but the real challenge isn’t always detection, It’s precision. Automation has long struggled with false positives, and nowhere is this more evident than in vulnerability scanning. Tools that flag dozens of irrelevant issues often create more work than they save. When AI enters the equation, the stakes grow even higher: models can generalize well, but verifying technical edge cases is a different game entirely.</p>
<p>To ensure accuracy, we developed the concept of <strong>validators</strong>, automated peer reviewers that confirm each vulnerability XBOW uncovers. Sometimes this process leverages a large language model; in other cases, we build custom programmatic checks. For example, to validate Cross-Site Scripting findings, a headless browser visits the target site to verify that the JavaScript payload was truly executed.
(don’t miss Brendan Dolan-Gavitt’s BlackHat <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-25/briefings/schedule/#ai-agents-for-offsec-with-zero-false-positives-46559">presentation on AI agents for Offsec</a>)</p>
<h3 id="xbows-real-world-impact">XBOW’s Real-World Impact</h3>
<p>Running XBOW across a wide range of public and private programs yielded results that exceeded our expectations—not just in volume, but in consistency and quality.</p>
<p>Over time, XBOW reported thousands of validated vulnerabilities, many of them affecting high-profile targets from well-known companies. These findings weren’t just theoretical; every submission was confirmed by the program owners and triaged as real, actionable security issues.</p>
<p><img src="https://xbow.com/_astro/top1-image1.DV-4rqXc_Z1OfWUq.webp" alt="" width="1338" height="966" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>The most public signal of progress came from the HackerOne leaderboard. Competing alongside thousands of human researchers, XBOW climbed to the top position in the US ranking. That wasn’t our original goal, and indeed was surprising since we didn’t have a buffer of untriaged reports from previous quarters—but it became a useful benchmark to track real-world performance and collect traces to reinforce our models.</p>
<p>XBOW submitted nearly 1,060 vulnerabilities. All findings were fully automated, though our security team reviewed them pre-submission to comply with HackerOne’s policy on automated tools. It was a unique privilege to wake up each morning and review creative new exploits.</p>
<p>To date, bug bounty programs have resolved 130 vulnerabilities, while 303 were classified as Triaged (mostly by VDP programs that acknowledged the issue but did not proceed to resolution). In addition, 33 reports are currently marked as new, and 125 remain pending review by program owners.</p>
<p><img src="https://xbow.com/_astro/top1-image3.DThYJmmV_Z1DRFBF.webp" alt="" width="603" height="500" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Across all submissions, 208 were marked as duplicates, 209 as informative and 36 as not applicable (most of them self-closed by our team). Interestingly, many of these informative vulnerabilities came from programs with specific constraints such as policies excluding third-party vulnerabilities or disallowing certain classes like Cache Poisoning.</p>
<p>XBOW identified a full spectrum of vulnerabilities including: Remote Code Execution, SQL Injection, XML External Entities (XXE), Path Traversal, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Cross-Site Scripting, Information DIsclosures, Cache Poisoning, Secret exposure, and more.</p>
<p>Over the past 90 days alone, the vulnerabilities submitted were classified as <strong>54</strong> critical, <strong>242</strong> high, <strong>524</strong> medium, and <strong>65</strong> low severity issues by program owners. Notably, around <strong>45% of</strong> XBOW’s findings are still awaiting resolution, highlighting the volume and impact of the submissions across live targets.</p>
<p><img src="https://xbow.com/_astro/top1-image4.HojM9nHo_1FMAll.webp" alt="" width="603" height="500" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>XBOW’s path to the top involved uncovering a wide range of interesting and impactful vulnerabilities. Among them was a previously unknown vulnerability in Palo Alto’s GlobalProtect VPN solution, affecting over 2,000 hosts. Throughout this process, XBOW consistently demonstrated its ability to adapt to edge cases and develop creative strategies for complex exploitation scenarios entirely on its own.</p>
<p>In the spirit of transparency, and in accordance with the rules and regulations of POC || GTFO, our security team will be publishing a series of blog posts over the coming weeks, showcasing some of our favorite technical discoveries by XBOW.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>Why you should write more toy programs</p>
                <hr>
                
            </div><div>
                <p>I am a huge fan of Richard Feyman’s famous quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What I cannot create, I do not understand”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s brilliant, and it remains true across many fields (if you’re willing to be a little creative with the
definition of ‘create’). It is to this principle that I believe I owe everything I’m truly good at. Some will tell you
to avoid reinventing the wheel, but they’re wrong: you <em>should</em> build your own wheel, because it’ll teach you more about
how they work than reading a thousand books on them ever will.</p>
<p>In 2025, the beauty and craft of writing software is being eroded. AI is threatening to replace us (or, at least, the
most joyful aspects of our craft) and software development is being increasingly commodified, measured, packaged, and
industrialised. Software development needs more simple joy, and I’ve found that creating toy programs is a great way to
remember why I started working with computers again.</p>
<h2>Keep it simple</h2>
<p>Toy programs follow the 80:20 rule: 20% of the work, 80% of the functionality. The point is <em>not</em> to build
production-worthy software (although it is true that some of the best production software began life as a toy).
Aggressively avoid over-engineering, restrict yourself to only whatever code is necessary to achieve your goal. Have
every code path panic/crash until you’re forced to implement it to make progress. You might be surprised by just how
easy it is to build toy versions of software you might previously have considered to be insummountably difficult to
create.</p>
<h2>Other benefits</h2>
<p>I’ve been consistently surprised by just how often some arcane nugget of knowledge I’ve acquired when working on a toy
project has turned out to be immensely valuable in my day job, either by giving me a head-start on tracking down a
problem in a tool or library, or by recognising mistakes before they’re made.</p>
<p>Understanding the constraints that define the shape of software is vital for working with it, and there’s no better way
to gain insight into those constraints than by running into them head-first. You might even come up with some novel
solutions!</p>
<h2>The list</h2>
<p>Here is a list of toy programs I’ve attempted over the past 15 years, rated by difficulty and time required. These
ratings are estimates and assume that you’re already comfortable with at least one general-purpose programming language
and that, like me, you tend to only have an hour or two per day free to write code. Also included are some suggested
resources that I found useful.</p>
<h3>Regex engine (difficulty = 4/10, time = 5 days)</h3>
<p>A regex engine that can read a POSIX-style regex program and recognise strings that match it. Regex is simple yet
shockingly expressive, and writing a competent regex engine will teach you everything you need to know about using the
language too.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Syntax">Wikipedia: Regex</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>x86 OS kernel (difficulty = 7/10, time = 2 months)</h3>
<p>A multiboot-compatible OS kernel with a simple CLI, keyboard/mouse driver, ANSI escape sequence support, memory manager,
scheduler, etc. Additional challenges include writing an in-memory filesystem, user mode and process isolation, loading
ELF executables, and supporting enough video hardware to render a GUI.</p>

<h3>GameBoy/NES emulator (difficulty = 6/10, time = 3 weeks)</h3>
<p>A crude emulator for the simplest GameBoy or NES games. The GB and the NES are classics, and both have relatively simple
instruction sets and peripheral hardware. Additional challenges include writing competent PPU (video) and PSG (audio)
implementations, along with dealing with some of the more exotic cartridge formats.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gbdev.io/">GB Dev</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki">NES Dev Wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>GameBoy Advance game (difficulty = 3/10, time = 2 weeks)</h3>
<p>A sprite-based game (top-down or side-on platform). The GBA is a beautiful little console to write code for and there’s
an active and dedicated development community for the console. I truly believe that the GBA is one of the last game
consoles that can be fully and completely understood by a single developer, right down to instruction timings.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm">Tonc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm">GBATEK</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Physics engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>A 2D rigid body physics engine that implements Newtonian physics with support for rectangles, circles, etc. On the
simplest end, just spheres that push away from one-another is quite simple to implement. Things start to get complex
when you introduce more complex shapes, angular momentum, and the like. Additional challenges include making collision
resolution fast and scaleable, having complex interactions move toward a steady state over time, soft-body interactions,
etc.</p>
<h3>Dynamic interpreter (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1-2 weeks)</h3>
<p>A tree-walking interpreter for a JavaScript-like language with basic flow control. There’s an unbounded list of extra
things to add to this one, but being able to write programs in my own language still gives me child-like elation. It
feels like a sort of techno-genesis: once you’ve got your own language, you can start building the universe within it.</p>

<h3>Compiler for a C-like (difficulty = 8/10, time = 3 months)</h3>
<p>A compiler for a simply-typed C-like programming language with support for at least one target archtecture. Extra
challenges include implementing some of the most common optimisations (inlining, const folding, loop-invariant code
motion, etc.) and designing an intermediate representation (IR) that’s general enough to support multiple backends.</p>
<h3>Text editor (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2-4 weeks)</h3>
<p>This one has a lot of variability. At the blunt end, simply reading and writing a file can be done in a few lines of
Python. But building something that’s closer to a daily driver gets more complex. You could choose to implement the UI
using a toolkit like QT or GTK, but I personally favour an editor that works in the console. Properly handling unicode,
syntax highlighting, cursor movement, multi-buffer support, panes/windows, tabs, search/find functionality, LSP support,
etc. can all add between a week or a month to the project. But if you persist, you might join the elite company of those
developers who use an editor of their own creation.</p>

<h3>Async runtime (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of language-specific variability as to what ‘async’ actually means. In Rust, at least, this means a
library that can ingest <code>impl Future</code> tasks and poll them concurrently until completion. Adding support for I/O waking
makes for a fun challenge.</p>
<h3>Hash map (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3-5 days)</h3>
<p>Hash maps (or sets/dictionaries, as a higher-level language might call them) are a programmer’s bread &amp; butter. And yet,
surprisingly few of us understand how they really work under the bonnet. There are a plethora of techniques to throw
into the mix too: closed or open addressing, tombstones, the robin hood rule, etc. You’ll gain an appreciation for when
and why they’re fast, and also when you should just use a vector + linear search.</p>

<h3>Rasteriser / texture-mapper (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2 weeks)</h3>
<p>Most of us have played with simple 3D graphics at some point, but how many of us truly understand how the graphics
pipeline works and, more to the point, how to fix it when it doesn’t work? Writing your own software rasteriser will
give you that knowledge, along with a new-found appreciation for the beauty of vector maths and half-spaces that have
applications across many other fields. Additional complexity involves properly implementing clipping, a Z-buffer, N-gon
rasterisation, perspective-correct texture-mapping, Phong or Gouraud shading, shadow-mapping, etc.</p>

<h3>SDF Rendering (difficulty = 5/10, time = 3 days)</h3>
<p>Signed Distance Fields are a beautifully simple way to render 3D spaces defined through mathematics, and are perfectly
suited to demoscene shaders. With relatively little work you can build yourself a cute little visualisation or some
moving shapes like the graphics demos of the 80s. You’ll also gain an appreciation for shader languages and vector
maths.</p>

<h3>Voxel engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2 weeks)</h3>
<p>I doubt there are many reading this that haven’t played Minecraft. It’s surprisingly easy to build your own toy voxel
engine cut from a similar cloth, especially if you’ve got some knowledge of 3D graphics or game development already. The
simplicity of a voxel engine, combined with the near-limitless creativity that can be expressed with them, never ceases
to fill me with joy. Additional complexity can be added by tackling textures, more complex procedural generation,
floodfill lighting, collisions, dynamic fluids, sending voxel data over the network, etc.</p>

<h3>Threaded Virtual Machine (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>Writing interpreters is great fun. What’s more fun? <em>Faster interpreters</em>. If you keep pushing interpreters as far as
they can go without doing architecture-specific codegen (like AOT or JIT), you’ll eventually wind up (re)discovering
<em>threaded code</em> (not to be confused with multi-threading, which is a very different beast). It’s a beautiful way of
weaving programs together out highly-optimised miniature programs, and a decent implementation can even give an AOT
compiler a run for its money in the performance department.</p>

</ul>
<h3>GUI Toolkit (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2-3 weeks)</h3>
<p>Most of us have probably cobbled together a GUI program using tkinter, GTK, QT, or WinForms. But why not try writing
your GUI toolkit? Additional complexity involves implementing a competent layout engine, good text shaping (inc.
unicode support), accessibility support, and more. Fair warning: do not encourage people to use your tool unless it’s
<em>battle-tested</em> - the world has enough GUIs with little-to-no accessibility or localisation support.</p>

<h3>Orbital Mechanics Sim (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>A simple simulation of Newtonian gravity can be cobbled together in a fairly short time. Infamously, gravitational
systems with more than two bodies cannot be solved analytically, so you’ll have to get familiar with iterative
<em>integration</em> methods. Additional complexity comes with implementing more precise and faster integration methods,
accounting for relativistic effects, and writing a visualiser. If you’ve got the maths right, you can even try plugging
in real numbers from NASA to predict the next high tide or full moon.</p>

<h3>Bitwise Challenge (difficulty = 3/10, time = 2-3 days)</h3>
<p>Here’s one I came up with for myself, but I think it would make for a great game jam: write a game that only persists 64
bits of state between subsequent frames. That’s 64 bits for everything: the entire frame-for-frame game state should be
reproducible using only 64 bits of data. It sounds simple, but it forces you to get incredibly creative with your game
state management. Details about the rules can be found on the GitHub page below.</p>

<h3>An ECS Framework (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1-2 weeks)</h3>
<p>For all those game devs out there: try building your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS</a>
framework. It’s not as hard as you might think (you might have accidentally done it already!). Extra points if you can
build in safety and correctness features, as well as good integration with your programming language of choice’s type
system features.</p>
<p>I built a custom ECS for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS5rj80L-pk">Super Mario 64 on the GBA</a> project due to the
unique performance and memory constraints of the platform, and enjoyed it a lot.</p>

<h3>CHIP-8 Emulator (difficulty = 3/10, time = 3-6 days)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> is a beautifully simple virtual machine from the 70s. You can write
a fully compliant emulator in a day or two, and there are an enormous plethora of fan-made games that run on it.

<h3>Chess engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2-5 days)</h3>
<p>Writing a chess engine is great fun. You’ll start off with every move it makes being illegal, but over time it’ll get
smart and smarter. Experiencing a loss to your own chess engine really is a rite of passage, and it feels magical.</p>

<h3>POSIX shell (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3-5 days)</h3>
<p>We interact with shells every day, and building one will teach you can incredible amount about POSIX - how it works, and
how it doesn’t. A simple one can be built in a day, but compliance with an existing shell language will take time and
teach you more than you ever wanted to know about its quirks.</p>

<h2>A note on learning and LLMs</h2>
<p>Perhaps you’re a user of LLMs. I get it, they’re neat tools. They’re useful for certain kinds of learning. But I might
suggest resisting the temptation to use them for projects like this. Knowledge is not supposed to be fed to you on a
plate. If you want that sort of learning, read a book - the joy in building toy projects like this comes from an
exploration of the unknown, without polluting one’s mind with an existing solution. If you’ve been using LLMs for a
while, this cold-turkey approach might even be painful at first, but persist. There is no joy without pain.</p>
<p>The runner’s high doesn’t come to those that take the bus.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I was recently poking around inside the original Power Macintosh G3’s ROM and accidentally discovered an easter egg that nobody has documented until now.</p>



<p>This story starts with me on a lazy Sunday using <a href="https://hexfiend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hex Fiend</a> in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/eharmon/rom_fiend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Harmon’s Mac ROM template (ROM Fiend)</a> to look through the resources stored in the Power Mac G3’s ROM. This ROM was used in the beige desktop, minitower, and all-in-one G3 models from 1997 through 1999.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-12.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="487" height="466" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-12.png 487w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-12-300x287.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px"></a></figure>



<p>As I write this post in mid-2025, I’m having a really difficult time accepting the fact that the Power Mac G3 is now over 27 years old. Wow!</p>



<p>While I was browsing through the ROM, two things caught my eye:</p>



<p>First, there was a resource of type <code>HPOE</code> which contained a JPEG image of a bunch of people, presumably people who worked on these Mac models.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/G3Picture.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/G3Picture.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/G3Picture.jpg 640w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/G3Picture-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure>



<p>This wasn’t anything new; <a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/2014/08/19/easter-egg-les-images-cachees-dans-les-roms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pierre Dandumont wrote about it back in 2014</a>. However, in his post, he mentioned that he hadn’t figured out how to display this particular hidden image on the actual machine. Several older Macs have secret keypress combinations to show similar pictures, but the mechanism for displaying this one was a complete mystery.</p>



<p>The second thing I found was a big clue: I kept looking for other interesting information in the ROM, and eventually I stumbled upon <code>nitt</code> resource ID 43, named “Native 4.3”. Thanks to <a href="https://blitter.net/blog/2021/02/09/pippin-kickstart-1-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keith Kaisershot’s earlier Pippin research</a>, I was quickly able to conclude that this was the PowerPC-native SCSI Manager 4.3 code. The SCSI Manager wasn’t what piqued my interest about this resource though. At the very end of the data, I found some interesting Pascal strings:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="460" height="104" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png 460w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-300x68.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a></figure>



<p>These strings were definitely intriguing:</p>



<ul>
<li>.Edisk</li>



<li>secret ROM image</li>



<li>The Team</li>
</ul>



<p>The “secret ROM image” text in particular seemed like it could be related to the picture shown above. I decided to dive deeper to see if I could figure out why the SCSI Manager contained these strings, in the hopes that I could solve the mystery. Would this be the clue I needed in order to figure out how to instruct the Power Mac G3 to display this picture?</p>



<p>Some quick Internet searching for the phrase “secret ROM image” revealed that <a href="https://www.mackido.com/EasterEggs/HW-PCIROM.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had been used for easter eggs with earlier PowerPC Macs</a>. On those machines, you just had to type the text, select it, and drag it to the desktop. Then, the picture would appear. That approach didn’t work on the G3.</p>



<p>I suspected there was some similar way to access this hidden image, but nobody had documented it, at least not as far as I could find. So I had no choice but to disassemble the code and see where this text was used. What is it with me and all these crazy rabbit holes?</p>



<p>I extracted the entire <code>nitt</code> resource ID 43 to a file and inspected it:</p>



<pre>$ file nitt43<br>nitt43: header for PowerPC PEF executable</pre>



<p>That wasn’t too surprising, considering that the first twelve bytes were “Joy!peffpwpc”. I fed this entire file into <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghidra</a>, which immediately recognized it as a PEF file and had no trouble loading it. Although I’m pretty familiar with reading x86 and ARM assembly, I know essentially nothing about PowerPC assembly code. Thankfully, Ghidra’s decompiler worked very well with this file.</p>



<p>There was one problem, though: it didn’t detect any references to the “secret ROM image” string, other than inside of a huge list of pointers to variables. After scratching my head a little bit, I realized that Ghidra wasn’t doing a great job of finding references to several variables. Luckily, running Auto Analyze a second time after the initial analysis seemed to help it find several more references to things, including all of the strings I was interested in! I didn’t change any options with the analyzer; it just found more stuff on the second run.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="765" height="317" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png 765w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2-300x124.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px"></a></figure>



<p>The function that used all of these strings was definitely doing something with the .EDisk driver, which I already knew was the RAM disk driver because of past hackery. It seemed to be using <code>strncmp()</code> to see if a string was equal to “secret ROM image”, and if so, it would create/open/write a file named “The Team”.</p>

<p>I cleaned up this decompilation quite a bit by giving names to variables and figuring out data types. Fortunately, a lot of the functions like <code>PBGetVInfoSync()</code> had lots of public documentation, so I just had to tell Ghidra about the various Mac Toolbox structs being used.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="661" height="831" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png 661w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4-239x300.png 239w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px"></a></figure>



<p>Okay, that’s a lot easier to understand!</p>



<p>I couldn’t figure out how to format the 32-bit function arguments such as 0x48504f45 into four-letter codes like <code>HPOE</code>, so that’s what the comments are. Ghidra simply wouldn’t let me display them as ASCII in the decompilation no matter what I did, even though hovering over the constant showed a tooltip with the equivalent text. This is easy to do in IDA, but I couldn’t figure out how to convince Ghidra to do it. I tried Set Equate, but it didn’t change anything. If someone knows how to make it work, I’d love to hear how!</p>



<p>Anyway, the decompiled code shown above makes sense, and here’s a summary of what it does:</p>



<ul>
<li>It looks for a driver called .Edisk. (The driver is really named .EDisk, but I guess Mac OS doesn’t care about case sensitivity for this.)</li>



<li>It finds a disk associated with that driver (the RAM disk).</li>



<li>It looks for a volume associated with that disk.</li>



<li>If the volume is named “secret ROM image”:
<ul>
<li>It loads <code>HPOE</code> resource ID 1, which contains the JPEG image data.</li>



<li>It creates a file of creator <code>ttxt</code> and type <code>JPEG</code> called “The Team”.</li>



<li>It opens the file, writes the JPEG data to it, and closes it.</li>



<li>Then it does something with the driver control entry that I didn’t bother trying to understand further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Okay, interesting! So this code was clearly looking for the RAM disk to be named “secret ROM image”, but I wasn’t sure exactly how to trigger it. This function was only ever called in one other place: another function, which was checking to see if its first argument was equal to the value 0x3DA (decimal 986).</p>



<p>I didn’t have my beige G3 handy for tinkering, so instead, I mentioned what I had discovered in #mac68k on Libera. <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@atax1a/114729277160021527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">^alex came to the rescue</a> after playing around in Infinite Mac with the hints I had given. They quickly figured out that the trick was to format the RAM disk, and type the special text into the format dialog:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png 640w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5-300x225.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure>



<p>I got out my desktop G3, tested it out on real hardware, and sure enough, it worked! If you want to try it for yourself just like ^alex did, you can <a href="https://infinitemac.org/1998/Mac%20OS%208.1?infinite_hd=false&amp;saved_hd=false&amp;machine=Power+Macintosh+G3+%28Beige%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run Infinite Mac in your browser using this link, which sets up an emulated beige G3 running Mac OS 8.1</a> using DingusPPC. There’s a quirk that causes it to fail to resolve an alias at startup. I intentionally disabled it; just click Stop when the error pops up. Here are instructions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enable the RAM Disk in the Memory control panel.</li>



<li>Choose Restart from the Special menu.</li>



<li>After the desktop comes back up, select the RAM Disk icon.</li>



<li>Choose Erase Disk from the Special menu.</li>



<li>Type the <em>secret ROM image</em> text exactly as depicted above.</li>



<li>Click Erase.</li>
</ul>



<p>When you open the newly-formatted RAM disk, you should see a file named “The Team”:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png 640w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6-300x225.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure>



<p>If you double-click the file, SimpleText will open it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-8.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-8.png 640w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-8-300x225.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure>



<p>Based on various people’s tests, including my own, it sounds like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/eaglebtc.bsky.social/post/3lsaz3jqsds2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this trick works all the way up through Mac OS 9.0.4</a>, but 9.1 may have been the first version where it finally stopped working.</p>



<p>As far as I have been able to determine, this particular secret was undiscovered until now. People definitely knew the image was there in the ROM, but nobody had figured out how to actually activate it. This is probably one of the last easter eggs that existed in the Mac prior to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-easter-eggs-are-back-in-os-x-and-this-one-is-insane-5929286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Jobs reportedly banning them in 1997 when he returned to Apple</a>. I wonder if he ever knew about this one?</p>



<p>Special thanks to ^alex for figuring out that the RAM Disk needed to be erased in order to activate the easter egg! I’m not sure I would have thought to try that, and it would have taken a lot more work to trace through the rest of the code to figure it out.</p>



<p>If you are reading this post and you were on “The Team”, I’d love to hear about it! I’m curious if anyone who worked at Apple in the era remembers this little secret.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>1️⃣ Billing infra gets complex fast</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">More than payments: it's building permission management, metering, usage limits with cron jobs, and connecting it to upgrade, downgrade, cancellation and failed payments states. Race conditions, edge cases, and other bugs will slow you down.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2️⃣ Billing and app logic should be decoupled</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Growing companies iterate on pricing often: raising prices, experimenting with credits or charging for a new feature. DB migrations, rebuilding in-app flows, internal dashboards for custom pricing and grandfathering users on old pricing is a nightmare.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">First, create your products and plans on the dashboard. We support <strong>any</strong> pricing model. Some popular ones we've seen include:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Usage &amp; Overage</strong> ⚡: set real-time usage limits and choose when they reset. Charge users if they go over.</li>
<li><strong>Credits</strong> 💰: users can access monetary or arbitrary credits that many features can draw from</li>
<li><strong>Seat-based with per-seat limits</strong> 👥:: bill customers for their users (or other entities)</li>
<li><strong>Pay upfront</strong> 💳: let users purchase a fixed quantity of a feature upfront, which is used over time</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Next, all your billing logic can be implemented through just 3 functions:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>/attach</code>: One function call for all purchase flows. We return a Stripe Checkout URL, or handle an upgrade/downgrade.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve been trying to get a better sense of how GPUs work. I’ve read a lot online, but the following posts were particularly helpful:</p>

<h2 id="compute-and-memory-hierarchy">Compute and memory hierarchy</h2>

<p>A GPU’s design creates an imbalance since it can compute much faster than it can access its main memory. An NVIDIA A100 GPU, for example, can perform 19.5 trillion 32-bit floating-point operations per second (TFLOPS), but its memory bandwidth is only about 1.5 terabytes per second (TB/s). In the time it takes to read a single 4-byte number, the GPU could have performed over 50 calculations.</p>

<p>Below is a diagram of the compute and memory hierarchy for an NVIDIA A100 GPU. The numbers I quote for flops/s and TB/s are exclusive to A100s.</p>

<p>This diagram shows the performance hierarchy.<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <strong>Global Memory (VRAM)</strong> is the large, slow, off-chip memory pool where all data initially lives. A <strong>Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)</strong> is the GPU’s unit of computation. To work, it must fetch data over the slow bus. To mitigate this, each SM has fast, on-chip <strong>Shared Memory</strong> (SRAM) with a bandwidth of 19.5 TB/s.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Programmers use this as a manually-managed cache.</p>

<p>A <strong>thread</strong> is the smallest unit of execution. Each thread has a private set of <strong>Registers</strong> to hold values for immediate computation, with access speeds over ?? TB/s.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> The hardware groups threads into <strong>Warps</strong> of 32. This post analyzes performance using the simplified model of <strong>lockstep execution</strong>, where all 32 threads in a warp execute the same instruction at the same time.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> On an A100, an SM has an upper limit of 64 warps. A programmer groups threads into a <strong>Block</strong>, a grid of threads that is guaranteed to run on a single SM. A block can be one, two, or three-dimensional. For simplicity, this post will focus on square two-dimensional blocks of <code>BLOCK_DIM x BLOCK_DIM</code> threads, where the total number of threads cannot exceed the hardware limit of 1024. All threads in a block share access to the same on-chip Shared Memory.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-performance-regimes">The Two Performance Regimes</h2>

<p>We analyze the performance of a <strong>kernel</strong>, which is a function launched by the host (CPU) to be executed in parallel by many GPU threads. A kernel’s performance is limited by either its memory bandwidth or its compute throughput. These two limits define the performance regimes.</p>

<p>An operation is <strong>memory-bound</strong> if its runtime is dictated by the speed of transferring data from Global Memory to the SM. For an operation like element-wise addition <code>y = x + 1</code>, the SM performs a trivial number of FLOPs for each element it reads. The SM spends most of its time idle, waiting for data.</p>

<p>An operation is <strong>compute-bound</strong> if its runtime is dictated by the SM’s arithmetic speed. A large matrix multiplication is the canonical example. Once data is loaded into the SM, a massive number of computations are performed. The memory bus is idle while the SM is busy.</p>

<p><strong>Arithmetic Intensity (AI)</strong> is the formal metric that determines the regime. It is the ratio of work to memory traffic.</p>

<p><code>Arithmetic Intensity = Total FLOPs / Total Bytes Accessed</code></p>

<p>For the Roofline model, <code>Total Bytes Accessed</code> specifically counts the data transferred between Global Memory (HBM) and the on-chip SM. This is because the model evaluates a kernel’s performance against the primary bottleneck: the slow off-chip memory bus. On-chip traffic, such as from Shared Memory to registers, is not included in this calculation.</p>

<p>The Roofline Model plots a kernel’s achievable performance (in FLOPs per second) against its AI. The two “roofs” are the hard physical limits of the GPU.</p>

<div><pre><code>  ^ Performance (TFLOPS)

                  Hardware Ridge Point (~13)

</code></pre></div>

<p>The performance of a kernel is determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When memory-bound, the SMs are stalled waiting for data. The runtime is the time it takes to move that data: <code>Runtime = Bytes_Accessed / Memory_Bandwidth</code>. The kernel’s performance is therefore <code>Performance = Total_FLOPs / Runtime = AI * Memory_Bandwidth</code>. On the log-log plot, this is the diagonal line.</li>
  <li>When compute-bound, the SMs are fully utilized. The performance is limited by their peak arithmetic throughput: <code>Performance = Peak_Compute_FLOPs</code>. This is the horizontal line.</li>
</ul>

<p>A kernel’s actual performance is the minimum of these two values. The <strong>ridge point</strong> is the AI where the two performance ceilings intersect. For the A100, this is <code>19.5 TFLOPS / 1.5 TB/s ≈ 13 FLOPs/Byte</code>. A kernel must exceed this AI to become compute-bound.  A kernel with AI lower than 13 operates in the memory-bound region; a kernel with AI higher than 13 operates in the compute-bound region. The goal of optimization is to increase AI to move the kernel’s operating point to the right, pushing its performance up until it hits the compute roof.</p>

<p>The “Peak Compute” roof of 19.5 TFLOPS is an ideal, achievable only with highly optimized instructions like Tensor Core matrix multiplications and high enough power limits. An operation can be compute-bound but still perform far below this peak. For example, a kernel with high AI that is dominated by scalar arithmetic or complex transcendental functions (<code>sin</code>, <code>exp</code>) will be limited by the throughput of those specific, slower instructions. This creates a lower effective “roof” for that kernel, as shown in the diagram. Increasing AI is necessary, but not sufficient; the FLOPs must also be efficient.</p>

<p>The primary strategy to increase AI is to maximize the reuse of data once it has been loaded into the SM’s fast on-chip memory. The following is a simplified model where a thread reads data from Global Memory directly into its private registers. This analysis calculates the <em>minimum required</em> data transfer; actual memory traffic depends on access patterns, which we will discuss later.</p>

<p>Consider computing <code>C = A@B</code>, where all matrices are <code>N x N</code> and use 4-byte floats.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 1: One thread computes one element <code>C[i,j]</code></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>FLOPs:</strong> To compute <code>C[i,j]</code>, the thread performs N multiply-add operations. This is <code>2*N</code> FLOPs.</li>
  <li><strong>Bytes Accessed:</strong> The thread must read row <code>i</code> of A (N floats) and column <code>j</code> of B (N floats). This is a total of <code>2*N</code> floats, or <code>8*N</code> bytes.</li>
  <li><strong>Arithmetic Intensity:</strong> <code>(2*N FLOPs) / (8*N Bytes) = 0.25 FLOPs/Byte</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This AI is low. The kernel will be memory-bound.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 2: One thread computes a <code>2x2</code> tile of C</strong>
To compute a <code>2x2</code> tile (<code>C[i,j]</code>, <code>C[i,j+1]</code>, <code>C[i+1,j]</code>, <code>C[i+1,j+1]</code>), the thread must perform the computation for all four elements.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>FLOPs:</strong> <code>4 elements * 2*N FLOPs/element = 8*N</code> FLOPs.</li>
  <li><strong>Bytes Accessed:</strong> The thread must read two rows from A (<code>A[i,:]</code>, <code>A[i+1,:]</code>) and two columns from B (<code>B[:,j]</code>, <code>B[:,j+1]</code>). This is <code>2*N + 2*N = 4*N</code> floats, or <code>16*N</code> bytes.</li>
  <li><strong>Arithmetic Intensity:</strong> <code>(8*N FLOPs) / (16*N Bytes) = 0.5 FLOPs/Byte</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These AI values are far below the A100’s ridge point of ~13 FLOPs/Byte. This simple register-only model is insufficient to make matrix multiplication compute-bound.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> The key to achieving high AI is for threads within a block to cooperate by loading a much larger tile of A and B into the shared, on-chip SRAM. By working together on this shared data, a block of 1024 threads can achieve an AI greater than 13. We will detail the mechanics of this in the section on Shared Memory.</p>

<h2 id="the-third-regime-overhead">The Third Regime: Overhead</h2>

<p>Performance can also be limited by host-side overhead. This is time the CPU (the host) spends preparing work for the GPU, for example, in the Python interpreter or a framework’s dispatch system.</p>

<p>An application is overhead-bound if its GPU kernels are too small or numerous. The GPU executes each small task quickly and then waits, idle, for the CPU to issue the next command. The runtime is dominated by the CPU’s inability to feed the GPU fast enough.</p>

<p>Modern frameworks use asynchronous execution to mitigate this. The host can queue a stream of commands for the GPU without waiting for each one to complete. If the individual GPU operations are sufficiently large, the host can “run ahead,” and the overhead of launching one kernel is hidden by the execution of the previous one.</p>

<p>For the remainder of this post, we assume our kernels are large enough that overhead is not the primary limiter, and focus instead on memory and compute.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="two-basic-strategies-for-increasing-performance-fusion-and-tiling">Two basic strategies for increasing performance: Fusion and Tiling</h2>

<p>With the kernel large enough to make launch overhead negligible, performance is governed by the two physical limits of the GPU: memory bandwidth and compute throughput. Increasing the performance of a kernel, therefore, means pushing its operating point on the Roofline model up and to the right. There are two basic strategies for achieving this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a sequence of individually memory-bound operations, the strategy is to <strong>fuse</strong> them into a single kernel to eliminate intermediate memory traffic.</li>
  <li>For a single, complex operation with high potential arithmetic intensity (like matrix multiplication), the strategy is to use <strong>tiling</strong> to maximize data reuse within the SM’s fast memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will address each strategy in turn.</p>

<h3 id="operator-fusion">Operator Fusion</h3>

<p>Chains of simple operations like <code>y = relu(x + 1)</code> are common. Each operation (<code>add</code>, <code>relu</code>) has a very low arithmetic intensity and is memory-bound. Executing them as separate, sequential GPU kernels is inefficient. The primary strategy to optimize these sequences is <strong>operator fusion</strong>.</p>

<p>The problem is the intermediate memory traffic. Consider the unfused execution of <code>y = relu(x + 1)</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Kernel 1 (<code>add</code>):</strong> Reads the entire tensor <code>x</code> from global memory. Computes <code>tmp = x + 1</code>. Writes the entire intermediate tensor <code>tmp</code> back to global memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Kernel 2 (<code>relu</code>):</strong> Reads the entire tensor <code>tmp</code> from global memory. Computes <code>y = relu(tmp)</code>. Writes the final tensor <code>y</code> back to global memory.</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach is wasteful. It involves two separate kernel launch overheads and forces a round-trip to slow global memory for the intermediate <code>tmp</code> tensor.</p>

<p>Fusion combines these steps into a single, more efficient GPU kernel. A JIT compiler like Triton or <code>torch.compile</code>’s Inductor backend can perform this transformation automatically.</p>

<p>In the fused kernel:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A single thread reads one element of <code>x</code> from global memory into its private registers.</li>
  <li>It performs all computations, i.e., <code>tmp = x + 1</code>, then <code>y = relu(tmp)</code>, entirely within those fast registers.</li>
  <li>It writes only the final result <code>y</code> back to global memory.</li>
</ol>

<p>The intermediate tensor <code>tmp</code> becomes ephemeral, never materializing in global memory. This cuts the memory traffic in half (one read of <code>x</code>, one write of <code>y</code>) and eliminates the launch overhead of the second kernel.</p>

<h3 id="tiling-strategy-for-compute-bound-kernels">Tiling: Strategy for Compute-Bound Kernels</h3>

<p>Our register-only model for <code>C=A@B</code> yielded an arithmetic intensity of 0.25 FLOPs/Byte, far below the A100’s ridge point of ~13. This is because a single thread reads <code>2*N</code> values to perform <code>2*N</code> FLOPs; the data is used once and then discarded. To increase data reuse and become compute-bound, threads within a block must cooperate to load large tiles of the input matrices into the SM’s fast, on-chip Shared Memory.</p>

<p>The logic of this cooperation is based on decomposing the matrix product. The calculation for a single element <code>C[i,j]</code> is a sum over the <code>k</code> dimension: <code>C[i,j] = sum_k A[i,k] B[k,j]</code>. This sum can be partitioned into a sum of partial sums over tiles. For square tiles, the inner <code>k</code> dimension is broken into tiles of size <code>BLOCK_DIM</code>, matching the outer dimensions. The formula becomes:`</p><p>

\[C[i,j] = \sum_{t=0}^{\text{NUM_K_TILES}-1} \left( \sum_{k=t \cdot \text{BLOCK_DIM}}^{(t+1) \cdot \text{BLOCK_DIM} - 1} A[i,k] B[k,j] \right)\]

</p><p>The tiling algorithm computes one term from the outer sum (one partial product) per iteration. A block of threads computes one output <code>C_tile</code> by iterating through the <code>k</code> dimension, loading tiles of A and B, computing their product on-chip, and accumulating the result. This is achieved with a three-phase pattern: <strong>Load, Synchronize, and Compute</strong>.</p>

<p>We now examine the mechanics of the three-phase <strong>Load, Synchronize, Compute</strong> pattern.</p>

<h3 id="the-coalesced-load-hbm-to-sram">The Coalesced Load: HBM to SRAM</h3>

<p>The first phase loads tiles of A and B from slow global memory (HBM) into fast on-chip Shared Memory (SRAM). The goal is to perform this transfer with the maximum possible memory bandwidth. This requires <strong>coalesced memory access</strong>. A memory access is coalesced when all 32 threads in a warp access a single, contiguous 128-byte block of HBM in one transaction.</p>

<p>To achieve this, the kernel maps thread indices to memory addresses. For a <code>BLOCK_DIM x BLOCK_DIM</code> block of threads loading a data tile of the same size, a common mapping is for thread <code>(tx, ty)</code> to be responsible for loading <code>A[global_row + ty, global_k + tx]</code> into <code>A_tile[ty, tx]</code> in Shared Memory. In this example, <code>BLOCK_DIM</code> is 32.</p>

<p>Consider a single warp of threads where <code>ty</code> is fixed and <code>tx</code> ranges from 0 to 31.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thread <code>(0, ty)</code> reads <code>A[global_row + ty, global_k + 0]</code>.</li>
  <li>Thread <code>(1, ty)</code> reads <code>A[global_row + ty, global_k + 1]</code>.</li>
  <li>…</li>
  <li>Thread <code>(31, ty)</code> reads <code>A[global_row + ty, global_k + 31]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming row-major storage, these threads access 32 consecutive 4-byte floats, a contiguous 128-byte segment. This is a perfect coalesced read. The entire <code>32x32</code> tile is loaded in 32 such coalesced reads, one for each warp in the block.</p>

<p>This load can be made more efficient with <strong>vectorized access</strong>. The physical memory transaction for a coalesced read fetches the full 128 bytes from HBM regardless. The difference is how the SM requests this data.</p>

<p>With scalar loads, the warp must issue 32 separate 32-bit load instructions. With vectorized loads, it issues only 8 wider 128-bit load instructions. This is more efficient because the SM has a limited number of instruction issue slots per clock cycle. Requesting the data with 8 wide instructions consumes fewer of these hardware resources than requesting it with 32 narrow instructions. This ensures the memory controller is kept busy with a continuous stream of full-width requests, increasing the <em>utilized</em> memory bandwidth by reducing SM-side bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Vectorized access is enabled by casting pointers in device code (e.g., from <code>float*</code> to <code>float4*</code>), promising the compiler that the memory is aligned to the vector size.</p>

<p>The efficiency of these vectorized loads relies on <strong>memory alignment</strong>. A single <code>float4</code> instruction loads a 16-byte vector. For a matrix of 4-byte floats, this vector contains 4 elements. The hardware executes this instruction efficiently only if the memory address is a multiple of 16. This means the matrix’s inner dimension <code>K</code> (the number of columns) must be a multiple of 4. If <code>K</code> is not a multiple of 4, the rows become misaligned with the 16-byte memory segments.</p>

<p>Consider a matrix of 4-byte floats and a memory system with 16-byte segments.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Aligned (K=8, a multiple of 4):</strong>
    <div><pre><code>Memory: |&lt;--- 16B ---&gt;|&lt;--- 16B ---&gt;|
        [Seg 0       ][Seg 1       ]
Row 0:  [e0 e1 e2 e3 | e4 e5 e6 e7]  (A float4 load for e0-e3 is aligned)
Row 1:  [e0 e1 e2 e3 | e4 e5 e6 e7]  (A float4 load for e0-e3 is aligned)
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Unaligned (K=7):</strong>
    <div><pre><code>Memory: |&lt;--- 16B ---&gt;|&lt;--- 16B ---&gt;|&lt;--- 16B ---&gt;|
        [Seg 0       ][Seg 1       ][Seg 2       ]
Row 0:  [e0 e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6]
Row 1:                      [e0 e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6] (A float4 load for Row 1's e0-e3 spans Seg 0 and Seg 1)
</code></pre></div>
    <p>This misalignment forces the hardware to issue more complex, slower load operations, reducing memory bandwidth.<sup id="fnref:karpathy" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:karpathy" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> This row-wise strategy provides coalesced access for matrix A. For matrix B, the required access patterns are in opposition.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>HBM Requirement:</strong> To maintain coalescing, the B tile must be read from HBM row-by-row.</li>
  <li><strong>Compute Requirement:</strong> The matrix multiplication itself requires access to columns of the B tile.</li>
</ol>

<p>Loading columns directly from a row-major matrix is an uncoalesced, strided access that serializes HBM transactions. The solution is therefore to load the B tile using coalesced row-reads, but then rearrange the data as it is written into Shared Memory. The structure of this rearrangement is dictated by the physical, banked architecture of Shared Memory.</p>

<h3 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h3>

<p>The <code>__syncthreads()</code> call acts as a barrier. No thread in the block proceeds until all threads have reached this point. This ensures the <code>A_tile</code> and <code>B_tile</code> are fully loaded into Shared Memory before the compute phase begins.<sup id="fnref:sync" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sync" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>:</p>

<h3 id="the-on-chip-hardware-banks-and-warps">The On-Chip Hardware: Banks and Warps</h3>

<p>Shared Memory is a physical resource located on the Streaming Multiprocessor (SM). When a thread block is scheduled to run on an SM, it is allocated a portion of that SM’s total Shared Memory for its exclusive use.</p>

<p>The Shared Memory is physically partitioned into 32 independent memory modules of equal size, called <strong>banks</strong>. These banks can service memory requests in parallel. This number is not arbitrary; it is matched to the <strong>warp size</strong>. Recall that a warp consists of 32 threads that execute instructions in lockstep, and it is the fundamental unit of memory access. The 32 banks are designed to serve, in parallel, the 32 memory requests from a single warp in one clock cycle, provided those requests target different banks.</p>

<p>Addresses, representing 4-byte words, are interleaved across the banks.</p>
<div><pre><code>bank 0:  [word 0, word 32, word 64, ...]
bank 1:  [word 1, word 33, word 65, ...]
...
bank 31: [word 31, word 63, word 95, ...]
</code></pre></div>
<p>The bank for a given word address is determined by <code>bank_id = address % 32</code>.</p>

<h3 id="the-bank-conflict-problem">The Bank Conflict Problem</h3>

<p>To achieve the full bandwidth of Shared Memory, the 32 threads of a warp must access words that fall into 32 different banks. A <strong>bank conflict</strong> occurs when multiple threads access different addresses that map to the same bank. The hardware resolves this by serializing the requests, reducing bandwidth. A <strong>broadcast</strong>, where all threads read the <em>same</em> address, is a fast, conflict-free operation.</p>

<p>This creates a problem for matrix multiplication. Consider a <code>BLOCK_DIM x BLOCK_DIM</code> tile stored in Shared Memory in a row-major layout, where <code>BLOCK_DIM=32</code>. The address of <code>tile[row, col]</code> is <code>row * 32 + col</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Row Access (A_tile):</strong> A warp accesses <code>A_tile[fixed_row, t]</code> for <code>t = 0..31</code>. The addresses are <code>fixed_row * 32 + t</code>. The bank for each thread <code>t</code> is <code>(fixed_row * 32 + t) % 32 = t % 32</code>. Since <code>t</code> is unique for each thread, the threads access 32 unique banks. This is a conflict-free, full-bandwidth access.</li>
  <li><strong>Column Access (B_tile):</strong> A warp accesses <code>B_tile[t, fixed_col]</code> for <code>t = 0..31</code>. The addresses are <code>t * 32 + fixed_col</code>. The bank for each thread <code>t</code> is <code>(t * 32 + fixed_col) % 32 = fixed_col % 32</code>. All 32 threads target the same bank. This causes a 32-way bank conflict, serializing the memory access.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution is to store the <code>B_tile</code> in a transposed layout within Shared Memory.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># Action for thread (tx, ty) during the load phase

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This “load-and-transpose” maneuver alters the on-chip computation. The calculation for an element of the partial product is no longer a dot product between a row of <code>A_tile</code> and a column of <code>B_tile</code>. Instead, using the transposed on-chip <code>B_tile</code>, the formula becomes:</p><p>

\[C_{\text{partial}}[i,j] = \sum_{k} A_{\text{tile}}[i,k] \cdot B_{\text{tile}}[j,k]\]

</p><p>In this formulation, a warp of threads computing different <code>j</code> values for a fixed <code>i</code> will access a row from <code>A_tile</code> and a row from the on-chip <code>B_tile</code>. Both are conflict-free access patterns. This single strategy solves both the HBM coalescing requirement and the SRAM bank conflict problem.</p>

<div><pre><code>   Load-and-Transpose Operation (Thread tx, ty)

<h3 id="e-the-on-chip-compute-phase-increasing-arithmetic-intensity">E. The On-Chip Compute Phase: Increasing Arithmetic Intensity</h3>

<p>With data staged in Shared Memory, the block performs the computation. The goal is to maximize data reuse from this fast on-chip memory. We will analyze two strategies for structuring this on-chip computation.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 1: One thread computes one output</strong></p>

<p>The simplest approach maps one output element to one thread. A <code>BLOCK_DIM x BLOCK_DIM</code> thread block computes a <code>TILE_DIM x TILE_DIM</code> data tile, where <code>BLOCK_DIM</code> and <code>TILE_DIM</code> are equal. This strategy is conceptually similar to <strong>Kernel 3</strong> in <a href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM" target="_blank">Boehm’s post</a>, which introduces Shared Memory caching.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> The hardware limit of 1024 threads per block constrains <code>BLOCK_DIM</code> to be at most 32. Thread <code>(tx, ty)</code> is responsible for a single output element <code>C_partial[ty, tx]</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># Action for a single thread (tx, ty) where BLOCK_DIM = TILE_DIM
</span><span>c_accumulator</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span>
<span>for</span> <span>k</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>TILE_DIM</span><span>):</span>
    <span>c_accumulator</span> <span>+=</span> <span>A_tile</span><span>[</span><span>ty</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>B_tile</span><span>[</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The arithmetic intensity for this strategy is <code>TILE_DIM / 4</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Total FLOPs:</strong> The block performs <code>2 * TILE_DIM^3</code> FLOPs.</li>
  <li><strong>Total Bytes Accessed (HBM):</strong> The block loads two data tiles, totaling <code>8 * TILE_DIM^2</code> bytes.</li>
  <li><strong>Arithmetic Intensity (AI):</strong> <code>(2 * TILE_DIM^3) / (8 * TILE_DIM^2) = TILE_DIM / 4</code> FLOPs/Byte.</li>
</ul>

<p>With <code>TILE_DIM</code> limited to 32, the maximum AI is <code>32 / 4 = 8</code>. This is insufficient to cross the A100’s ridge point of ~13. The kernel remains memory-bound.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 2: One thread computes multiple outputs</strong></p>

<p>To increase AI, we must increase <code>TILE_DIM</code> without increasing the number of threads. This requires decoupling the data tile size from the thread block size. We assign more work to each thread. This strategy corresponds to the goal of <strong>Kernel 5</strong> in <a href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM" target="_blank">Boehm’s post.</a></p>

<p>A <code>16x16</code> thread block (<code>BLOCK_DIM = 16</code>, 256 threads) can compute a <code>64x64</code> data tile (<code>TILE_DIM = 64</code>). Each thread now computes a <code>4x4</code> sub-tile of the output. This requires <code>TILE_DIM=64</code> to not exceed Shared Memory capacity.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>The AI calculation remains <code>TILE_DIM / 4</code>. With <code>TILE_DIM = 64</code>, the AI is <code>64 / 4 = 16</code> FLOPs/Byte. This exceeds the A100’s ridge point. The kernel is now <strong>compute-bound</strong>.</p>

<p>A compute-bound kernel’s runtime is limited by the SM’s arithmetic throughput. This does not guarantee high absolute performance. A kernel can be compute-bound but still be slow if its FLOPs are inefficient (e.g., using scalar FP32 math instead of specialized hardware like Tensor Cores<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>) or if the GPU operates below its peak clock speed due to power limits.</p>

<p>The inner loop in the code above can be further optimized. A thread loads four separate <code>float</code> values from <code>A_tile</code> into <code>a_regs</code>. It can instead issue a single instruction to load a 16-byte <code>float4</code> vector. This vectorized load from Shared Memory reduces the number of instructions issued for on-chip data movement, improving the efficiency of the compute phase. This corresponds to the on-chip vectorization refinement used in <strong>Kernel 6</strong> of <a href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM" target="_blank">Boehm’s post.</a></p>

<p><strong>A Final Consideration: Tile Quantization</strong></p>

<p>If matrix dimensions are not multiples of the tile size, the kernel launches extra blocks that perform wasted computation.</p>

<p>To cover an <code>M x N</code> matrix with <code>TILE_M x TILE_N</code> tiles, the GPU launches a grid of <code>ceil(M/TILE_M) x ceil(N/TILE_N)</code> thread blocks. Tiling a 65x65 matrix with 32x32 tiles requires a <code>ceil(65/32) x ceil(65/32)</code> = 3x3 grid of blocks. The kernel’s logic is fixed; each block is programmed to perform the arithmetic for a full 32x32 tile.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-matrix-multiplication/index.html#tile-quant" target="_blank">According to NVIDIA</a>, “While libraries ensure that invalid memory accesses are not performed by any of the tiles, all tiles will perform the same amount of math.” My understanding of why this happens (I’m happy to be corrected): Boundary blocks perform wasted work because the kernel explicitly pads the data. Threads assigned to load elements from outside the matrix bounds are prevented from doing so by a guard condition. Instead, they write zero to their location in the on-chip Shared Memory tile. The arithmetic loops are not shortened. The kernel’s logic is uniform across the tile. All threads in a warp execute the same multiply-add instructions. A thread whose data corresponds to a padded zero still executes the instruction; it just performs a useless computation, such as <code>C += A * 0</code>. The hardware resources are used, but the  work is discarded.</p>

<h2 id="additional-performance-considerations">Additional Performance Considerations</h2>

<p>We have made our kernel compute-bound. Its performance is now limited by the speed of its on-chip arithmetic. However, the kernel can still be made faster by managing additional aspects of the hardware. The following are three such considerations. There are others, but I’m not quite advanced enough to write about them, yet. See <a href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM" target="_blank">Boehm’s post</a> for others.</p>

<h3 id="occupancy-and-latency-hiding">Occupancy and Latency Hiding</h3>

<p>A warp <strong>stalls</strong> when it executes a long-latency instruction, such as a read from Global Memory. It cannot execute its next instruction until the data arrives, which can take hundreds of clock cycles. During this time, the SM’s compute units would be idle if the stalled warp were the only work available.</p>

<p>The SM hides this latency by executing other work. It can hold multiple thread blocks concurrently, creating a pool of resident warps. When one warp stalls, the SM’s hardware scheduler instantly switches to a different warp from this pool that is ready to run. This mechanism is called <strong>latency hiding</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Occupancy</strong> is the ratio of active warps on an SM to the maximum number it can support. High occupancy gives the scheduler a larger pool of warps to choose from. This increases the likelihood that it can find a ready warp to execute at any given cycle, keeping the compute units active.</p>

<p>This leads to a trade-off between the resources used per block and the number of blocks that can reside on an SM. The two extremes can be visualized as follows:</p>

<p>We tune the kernel’s resource usage to balance the benefit of high AI against the necessity of sufficient occupancy.

</code></pre></div>
<p>This serialization doubles the execution time of the divergent code, halving the warp’s effective throughput. We avoid this cost by writing branchless code in performance-critical sections, using primitives like <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> instead of <code>if-else</code>.</p>

<h3 id="quantization">Quantization</h3>

<p>Quantization reduces precision of elements of our tensor, from, say FP32 to FP16 or BFP16. This has two effects. First, it reduces the memory needed to store each element, for example, by 2. Thus, we can transfer twice as many elements per second from global memory to shared memory. This increases AI by 2.</p>

<p>Second, GPUs, such as the A100, can operate faster on lower precision elements. For example, on an A100, 312 TFLOPS are achievable for certain FP16 operations, whereas FP32 operations are limited to 19.5 TFLOPS. Thus, theoretically we can speedup computation by a factor of 16.</p>

<p>Quantization can therefore move us up and to the right on the Roofline plot.</p>

            Ripping the plastic wrap from the meat or prepackaged fruit and veggies you purchased at the grocery store may contaminate your food with micro- and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/08/health/bottled-water-nanoplastics-study-wellness">nanoplastics</a>, according to new research.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9l31wy000j3b6mc3lykznx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Plastic contamination may also occur when you’re unwrapping deli meat and cheese, steeping a tea bag in hot water, or opening cartons of milk or orange juice. Glass bottles and jars with a plastic-coated metal closure may also shed microscopic bits of plastic, the study found.
    </p>

            In fact, the abrasion from repeatedly opening and closing the caps on glass and plastic bottles can release an untold amount of micro- and nanoplastics into the beverage, said Lisa Zimmermann, lead author of the study published Tuesday in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-025-00470-3" target="_blank">journal NPJ Science of Food</a>.

            “The research shows the number of microplastics increases with each bottle opening, so therefore we can say it’s the usage of the food contact article which leads to micro- and nanoplastic release,” said Zimmermann, scientific communication officer at the Food Packaging Forum, a nonprofit foundation based in Zurich, Switzerland, that studies chemicals in food contact materials.

            “This is the first systematic evidence of how normal and intended use of foodstuffs packaged in plastics can be contaminated with micro- and nanoplastics,” Zimmermann said. “We found food packaging is actually a direct source of the micro- and nanoplastics measured in food.”

            And while scientists have long known about potentially toxic chemicals from plastics leaching into food, “what’s less clear, and deeply concerning, is just how significant food packaging is as a source of exposure to plastic particles and what that means for our health,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a Washington, DC-based health and environmental advocacy organization, in an email.

            At 1,000th the average width of a human hair, experts say nanoplastics are so teeny they can migrate through the tissues of the digestive tract or lungs into the bloodstream. As the blood circulates, the plastics may distribute potentially harmful synthetic chemicals throughout the body and into cells.

            Microplastic research is quite new, and studies so far often use different methods of microplastic identification and measurement. The lack of standard protocol can make it difficult to adequately compare findings, said senior study author Jane Muncke, managing director and chief scientific officer at the Food Packaging Forum.
    </p>

  





    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9l31wz000z3b6m4zz6u6hv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “The novel aspect of our analysis is we didn’t just collect all the studies, but we also examined the scientific reliability of their methods. We included a critical appraisal step,” Muncke said. “That left us with seven highly reliable studies — more high-quality research is definitely needed.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9l31wz00103b6mm1qa5lbt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            According to that research, ultraprocessed foods contain significantly more microplastics than minimally processed foods.

            “There’s a higher number of manufacturing steps with ultraprocessed foods, which can increase the contact time with plastic food processing equipment,” Muncke said, “thus increasing the chance of micro- and nanoplastic migration.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9l31wz00123b6mws7kn09d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Migration into food also increased when the plastic packaging was heated, washed for reuse, exposed to sunlight and subjected to mechanical stress — such as the twist used to open a bottle cap, according to the review. That sort of repeated stress could lead to higher abrasion than opening a plastic container, so future research should consider how plastic is used as well as the types of plastics, Muncke said.
    </p>

            “This is a rigorous, detailed and critical study that applies robust systematic methods to review the existing literature on microplastics and food contact materials,” said Megan Deeney, a research fellow and doctoral student in plastics and global health at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine at the University of London, in an email.

            “What is particularly important is that the authors take the time to extract and evaluate evidence on whether the presence of microplastics changed over time in these studies — this can help to identify the food contact material itself as a direct source of food contamination by microplastics,” said Deeney, who was not involved with the new research.

            One of the studies included in the new review found 1 liter of water — the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters bought at the store — contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles from seven types of plastics, of which 90% were identified as nanoplastics and the rest were microplastics.

            Another example involved <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/economically-motivated-adulteration-food-fraud/melamine-tableware-questions-and-answers" target="_blank">melamine</a>, which is used to make bowls, plates, cups and other plastic tableware.

            “In one study, researchers washed a melamine bowl 10 times, 20 times, 50 times, 100 times and measured the amount of microplastic it released each time,” Zimmermann said. “Then they put something in the bowl and tested it and found more microplastic release after increased washing.”

            While it’s not yet possible to clean microplastics from the food supply, there are steps one can take to reduce exposure to plastics and the chemicals they secrete.

            “One is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/health/preterm-birth-phthalates-study-wellness/index.html">an earlier interview with CNN</a>.

            “Avoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don’t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,” Trasande said.

            In addition, check the recycling code on the bottom of packaging to find the plastic type, and avoid plastics with recycling code 3, which typically contain <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness">phthalates</a>, he added.

Invest in a zippered fabric bag and ask the dry cleaner to return your clothes in that instead of those thin sheets of plastic.

            However, due to the pervasiveness of microplastics in the environment, “this is not something that any individual can solve on their own,” Deeney said.

git diffs to make the change for both of my example
<a href="https://github.com/nickjj/docker-flask-example/commit/8972f04c7724ad1ea5bfec6d18b2ca111575ab28" target="_blank">Flask</a>

projects. In this post we’ll go into more detail about these changes and how to
use a few <code>uv</code> commands.</p><h3 id="pyprojecttoml-vs-requirementstxt"><a href="#pyprojecttoml-vs-requirementstxt">#</a>
pyproject.toml vs requirements.txt</h3><p>Let’s start with defining our project’s dependencies.</p><p>You can create a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file and delete your <code>requirements.txt</code> after
you’ve entered your project’s dependencies and their versions into
<code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p><p>You only need to add your top level dependencies, uv will make a lock file for
you automatically which is somewhat comparable to what <code>pip freeze</code> would
produce except uv’s lock file has proper dependency trees and is way better.</p><p>Here’s a very small diff that shows an example of what to do, adjust it as
needed:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span># pyproject.toml
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>+[project]
</span></span></span><span><span><span>+dependencies = [
</span></span></span><span><span><span>+  "redis==5.2.1",
</span></span></span><span><span><span>+]
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span># requirements.txt
</span></span><span><span><span>-redis==5.2.1
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="dockerfile"><a href="#dockerfile">#</a>
Dockerfile</h3><p>It’s important that these steps happen in order. For example you’ll want the
environment variables defined before you install your dependencies.</p><h4>Install uv</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span><span>+COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.7.13 /uv /uvx /usr/local/bin/
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li>Ensure both <code>uv</code> and <code>uvx</code> binaries are installed on your system’s path<ul><li>Since uv is a compiled Rust tool we only need statically compiled binaries</li><li>You can find the latest release here: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases</a></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Dependency Files</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span><span>-COPY --chown=python:python requirements*.txt ./
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>+COPY --chown=python:python pyproject.toml uv.lock* ./
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li>Reference uv’s dependency related files instead<ul><li>That trailing <code>*</code> is important because it makes the lock file optional<ul><li>The first time you build your project the lock file might not exist</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Environment Variables</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span><span>+ENV \
</span></span></span><span><span><span>+  UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1 \
</span></span></span><span><span><span>+  UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT="/home/python/.local" \
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li><code>UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE</code><ul><li>Python source files will be compiled to bytecode<ul><li>This is preferred since all bytecode gets compiled once at build time<ul><li>Your app doesn’t need to do this at run-time when the container starts</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code> instructs uv to not make a virtual environment (venv)<ul><li>My example apps run things as a non-root <code>python</code> user</li><li>Ultimately all Python dependencies will be installed in this path</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Dependency Install Commands</h4><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span><span>-RUN chmod 0755 bin/* &amp;&amp; bin/pip3-install
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>+RUN chmod 0755 bin/* &amp;&amp; bin/uv-install
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In both cases I extracted their install commands to a separate script so it’s
easy to either run at build time in the Dockerfile (as seen above), or by
running it as a command at run-time to make sure your lock file gets updated
on your host machine through a volume.</p><p>In any case, both solutions are just shell scripts. Here’s the one for uv with
comments:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span><span>set</span> -o errexit
</span></span><span><span><span>set</span> -o pipefail
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Ensure we always have an up to date lock file.</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>if</span> ! <span>test</span> -f uv.lock <span>||</span> ! uv lock --check 2&gt;/dev/null<span>;</span> <span>then</span>
</span></span><span><span>  uv lock
</span></span><span><span><span>fi</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Use the existing lock file exactly how it is defined.</span>
</span></span><span><span>uv sync --frozen --no-install-project
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>There’s a few ways to use uv, such as using its pip sub-command but I like
using sync since it’s the “uv way” of doing things. The pip sub-command is
there to help create a mental model of how uv works, or continue using pip’s
commands through uv if you prefer.</em></p><p>The <code>--frozen</code> flag ensures the lock file doesn’t get updated. That’s exactly
what we want because we expect the lock file to have a complete list of exact
versions we want to use for all dependencies that get installed.</p><p>The <code>--no-install-project</code> flag skips installing your code as a Python package.
Since we have a <code>pyproject.toml</code> with a project defined the default behavior
is to install it as a package.</p><p>For a typical web app, you usually have your project’s dependencies and that’s
it. Your project isn’t an installable project in itself. However, if you do
have that use case feel free to remove this flag! You can think of this as
using <code>--editable .</code> with pip.</p><h3 id="add-update-or-delete-your-dependencies"><a href="#add-update-or-delete-your-dependencies">#</a>
Add, Update or Delete Your Dependencies</h3><p>If you’re using my example starter app, it comes with a few <a href="https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/replacing-make-with-a-shell-script-for-running-your-projects-tasks">run script</a> shortcuts. They’re shortcut shell scripts to run certain commands in a
container:</p><ul><li><code>./run deps:install</code><ul><li>Build a new image and volume mount out a new lock file</li><li>It’s mainly doing <code>docker compose build</code> and running <code>bin/uv-install</code> inside of a container which has a volume mount so your host’s lock file gets updated</li></ul></li><li><code>./run deps:install --no-build</code><ul><li>The same as above except it skips building but still mounts out a new lock file</li></ul></li><li><code>./run uv [...]</code><ul><li>It’s doing <code>docker compose exec web uv [...]</code></li><li>Execute any <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/" target="_blank"><code>uv</code> commands</a> you want, for example:<ul><li><code>uv add mypackage --no-sync</code><ul><li>Updates your <code>pyproject.toml</code> file and lock file but doesn’t install it<ul><li>Then you can run <code>./run deps:install</code></li></ul></li><li>This will either add a new dependency OR update an existing one<ul><li>For adding, if you omit <code>==X.X.X</code> it will add the current latest version as <code>&gt;=X.X.X</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code></li><li>For updating, include <code>==X.X.X</code> so <code>pyproject.toml</code> gets updated</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><code>uv remove mypackage --no-sync</code><ul><li>The same as above except it removes the package</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><code>./run uv:outdated</code><ul><li>It’s doing <code>docker compose exec web uv tree --outdated --depth 1</code></li><li>Show a list of outdated dependencies so you know what to update</li></ul></li></ul><p>The video below goes over the diffs together and runs some of the above commands.</p><h3 id="demo-video"><a href="#demo-video">#</a>
