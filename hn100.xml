          earliest version of this article was given as a talk at a conference
          called by the Southern Female Rights Union, held in Beulah, Mississippi
          in May 1970. It was written up for <u>Notes from the Third Year</u> (1971),
          but the editors did not use it. It was then submitted to several movement
          publications, but only one asked permission to publish it; others did
          so without permission. The first official place of publication was
          in Vol. 2, No. 1 of <u>The Second Wave</u> (1972). This early version
          in movement publications was authored by Joreen. Different versions
          were published in the <u>Berkeley Journal of Sociology</u>, Vol. 17,
          1972-73, pp. 151-165, and <u>Ms.</u> magazine, July 1973, pp. 76-78,
          86-89, authored by Jo Freeman. This piece spread all over the world.
          Numerous people have edited, reprinted, cut, and translated "Tyranny" for
          magazines, books and web sites, usually without the permission or knowledge
          of the author. The version below is a blend of the three cited here. </span></p></div>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">During 
        the years in which the women's liberation movement has been taking shape, 
        a great emphasis has been placed on what are called leaderless, structureless 
        groups as the main -- if not sole -- organizational form of the movement. 
        The source of this idea was a natural reaction against the over-structured 
        society in which most of us found ourselves, and the inevitable control 
        this gave others over our lives, and the continual elitism of the Left 
        and similar groups among those who were supposedly fighting this overstructuredness.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        idea of "structurelessness," however, has moved from a healthy 
        counter to those tendencies to becoming a goddess in its own right. The 
        idea is as little examined as the term is much used, but it has become 
        an intrinsic and unquestioned part of women's liberation ideology. For 
        the early development of the movement this did not much matter. It early 
        defined its main goal, and its main method, as consciousness-raising, 
        and the "structureless" rap group was an excellent means to 
        this end. The looseness and informality of it encouraged participation 
        in discussion, and its often supportive atmosphere elicited personal insight. 
        If nothing more concrete than personal insight ever resulted from these 
        groups, that did not much matter, because their purpose did not really 
        extend beyond this.<br>

          basic problems didn't appear until individual rap groups exhausted
          the virtues of consciousness-raising and decided they wanted to do
          something more specific. At this point they usually foundered because
          most groups were unwilling to change their structure when they changed
          their tasks. Women had thoroughly accepted the idea of "structurelessness" without
          realizing the limitations of its uses. People would try to use the "structureless" group
          and the informal conference for purposes for which they were unsuitable
          out of a blind belief that no other means could possibly be anything
          but oppressive.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">If
          the movement is to grow beyond these elementary stages of development,
          it will have to disabuse itself of some of its prejudices about organization
          and structure. There is nothing inherently bad about either of these.
          They can be and often are misused, but to reject them out of hand because
          they are misused is to deny ourselves the necessary tools to further
          development. We need to understand why "structurelessness" does
      not work.</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FORMAL 
        AND INFORMAL STRUCTURES</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Contrary 
        to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a structureless 
        group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for 
        any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in 
        some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over time; it 
        may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the 
        members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, 
        personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that 
        we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds 
        makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any 
        basis whatsoever could we approximate structurelessness -- and that is 
        not the nature of a human group.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This 
        means that to strive for a structureless group is as useful, and as deceptive, 
        as to aim at an "objective" news story, "value-free" 
        social science, or a "free" economy. A "laissez faire" 
        group is about as realistic as a "laissez faire" society; the 
        idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned 
        hegemony over others. This hegemony can be so easily established because 
        the idea of "structurelessness" does not prevent the formation 
        of informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly "laissez faire" 
        philosophy did not prevent the economically powerful from establishing 
        control over wages, prices, and distribution of goods; it only prevented 
        the government from doing so. Thus structurelessness becomes a way of 
        masking power, and within the women's movement is usually most strongly 
        advocated by those who are the most powerful (whether they are conscious 
        of their power or not). As long as the structure of the group is informal, 
        the rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness 
        of power is limited to those who know the rules. Those who do not know 
        the rules and are not chosen for initiation must remain in confusion, 
        or suffer from paranoid delusions that something is happening of which 
        they are not quite aware.<br>

      <p> <span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">For
          everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and
          to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not
          implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to
          everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized. This is
          not to say that formalization of a structure of a group will destroy
          the informal structure. It usually doesn't. But it does hinder the
          informal structure from having predominant control and make available
          some means of attacking it if the people involved are not at least
          responsible to the needs of the group at large. "Structurelessness" is
          organizationally impossible. We cannot decide whether to have a structured
          or structureless group, only whether or not to have a formally structured
          one. Therefore the word will not be used any longer except to refer
          to the idea it represents. Unstructured will refer to those groups
          which have not been deliberately structured in a particular manner.
          Structured will refer to those which have. A Structured group always
          has formal structure, and may also have an informal, or covert, structure.
          It is this informal structure, particularly in Unstructured groups,
          which forms the basis for elites.</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE 
        NATURE OF ELITISM</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">"Elitist" 
        is probably the most abused word in the women's liberation movement. It 
        is used as frequently, and for the same reasons, as "pinko" 
        was used in the fifties. It is rarely used correctly. Within the movement 
        it commonly refers to individuals, though the personal characteristics 
        and activities of those to whom it is directed may differ widely: An individual, 
        as an individual can never be an elitist, because the only proper application 
        of the term "elite" is to groups. Any individual, regardless 
        of how well-known that person may be, can never be an elite.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Correctly, 
        an elite refers to a small group of people who have power over a larger 
        group of which they are part, usually without direct responsibility to 
        that larger group, and often without their knowledge or consent. A person 
        becomes an elitist by being part of, or advocating the rule by, such a 
        small group, whether or not that individual is well known or not known 
        at all. Notoriety is not a definition of an elitist. The most insidious 
        elites are usually run by people not known to the larger public at all. 
        Intelligent elitists are usually smart enough not to allow themselves 
        to become well known; when they become known, they are watched, and the 
        mask over their power is no longer firmly lodged.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Elites 
        are not conspiracies. Very seldom does a small group of people get together 
        and deliberately try to take over a larger group for its own ends. Elites 
        are nothing more, and nothing less, than groups of friends who also happen 
        to participate in the same political activities. They would probably maintain 
        their friendship whether or not they were involved in political activities; 
        they would probably be involved in political activities whether or not 
        they maintained their friendships. It is the coincidence of these two 
        phenomena which creates elites in any group and makes them so difficult 
        to break.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">These 
        friendship groups function as networks of communication outside any regular 
        channels for such communication that may have been set up by a group. 
        If no channels are set up, they function as the only networks of communication. 
        Because people are friends, because they usually share the same values 
        and orientations, because they talk to each other socially and consult 
        with each other when common decisions have to be made, the people involved 
        in these networks have more power in the group than those who don't. And 
        it is a rare group that does not establish some informal networks of communication 
        through the friends that are made in it.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Some 
        groups, depending on their size, may have more than one such informal 
        communications network. Networks may even overlap. When only one such 
        network exists, it is the elite of an otherwise Unstructured group, whether 
        the participants in it want to be elitists or not. If it is the only such 
        network in a Structured group it may or may not be an elite depending 
        on its composition and the nature of the formal Structure. If there are 
        two or more such networks of friends, they may compete for power within 
        the group, thus forming factions, or one may deliberately opt out of the 
        competition, leaving the other as the elite. In a Structured group, two 
        or more such friendship networks usually compete with each other for formal 
        power. This is often the healthiest situation, as the other members are 
        in a position to arbitrate between the two competitors for power and thus 
        to make demands on those to whom they give their temporary allegiance.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        inevitably elitist and exclusive nature of informal communication networks 
        of friends is neither a new phenomenon characteristic of the women's movement 
        nor a phenomenon new to women. Such informal relationships have excluded 
        women for centuries from participating in integrated groups of which they 
        were a part. In any profession or organization these networks have created 
        the "locker room" mentality and the "old school" ties 
        which have effectively prevented women as a group (as well as some men 
        individually) from having equal access to the sources of power or social 
        reward. Much of the energy of past women's movements has been directed 
        to having the structures of decision-making and the selection processes 
        formalized so that the exclusion of women could be confronted directly. 
        As we well know, these efforts have not prevented the informal male-only 
        networks from discriminating against women, but they have made it more 
        difficult.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Because 
        elites are informal does not mean they are invisible. At any small group 
        meeting anyone with a sharp eye and an acute ear can tell who is influencing 
        whom. The members of a friendship group will relate more to each other 
        than to other people. They listen more attentively, and interrupt less; 
        they repeat each other's points and give in amiably; they tend to ignore 
        or grapple with the "outs" whose approval is not necessary for 
        making a decision. But it is necessary for the "outs" to stay 
        on good terms with the "ins." Of course the lines are not as 
        sharp as I have drawn them. They are nuances of interaction, not prewritten 
        scripts. But they are discernible, and they do have their effect. Once 
        one knows with whom it is important to check before a decision is made, 
        and whose approval is the stamp of acceptance, one knows who is running 
        things.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Since 
        movement groups have made no concrete decisions about who shall exercise 
        power within them, many different criteria are used around the country. 
        Most criteria are along the lines of traditional female characteristics. 
        For instance, in the early days of the movement, marriage was usually 
        a prerequisite for participation in the informal elite. As women have 
        been traditionally taught, married women relate primarily to each other, 
        and look upon single women as too threatening to have as close friends. 
        In many cities, this criterion was further refined to include only those 
        women married to New Left men. This standard had more than tradition behind 
        it, however, because New Left men often had access to resources needed 
        by the movement -- such as mailing lists, printing presses, contacts, 
        and information -- and women were used to getting what they needed through 
        men rather than independently. As the movement has charged through time, 
        marriage has become a less universal criterion for effective participation, 
        but all informal elites establish standards by which only women who possess 
        certain material or personal characteristics may join. They frequently 
        include: middle-class background (despite all the rhetoric about relating 
        to the working class); being married; not being married but living with 
        someone; being or pretending to be a lesbian; being between the ages of 
        twenty and thirty; being college educated or at least having some college 
        background; being "hip"; not being too "hip"; holding 
        a certain political line or identification as a "radical"; having 
        children or at least liking them; not having children; having certain 
        "feminine" personality characteristics such as being "nice"; 
        dressing right (whether in the traditional style or the antitraditional 
        style); etc. There are also some characteristics which will almost always 
        tag one as a "deviant" who should not be related to. They include: 
        being too old; working full time, particularly if one is actively committed 
        to a "career"; not being "nice"; and being avowedly 
        single (i.e., neither actively heterosexual nor homosexual).<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Other 
        criteria could be included, but they all have common themes. The characteristics 
        prerequisite for participating in the informal elites of the movement, 
        and thus for exercising power, concern one's background, personality, 
        or allocation of time. They do not include one's competence, dedication 
        to feminism, talents, or potential contribution to the movement. The former 
        are the criteria one usually uses in determining one's friends. The latter 
        are what any movement or organization has to use if it is going to be 
        politically effective.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        criteria of participation may differ from group to group, but the means 
        of becoming a member of the informal elite if one meets those criteria 
        art pretty much the same. The only main difference depends on whether 
        one is in a group from the beginning, or joins it after it has begun. 
        If involved from the beginning it is important to have as many of one's 
        personal friends as possible also join. If no one knows anyone else very 
        well, then one must deliberately form friendships with a select number 
        and establish the informal interaction patterns crucial to the creation 
        of an informal structure. Once the informal patterns are formed they act 
        to maintain themselves, and one of the most successful tactics of maintenance 
        is to continuously recruit new people who "fit in." One joins 
        such an elite much the same way one pledges a sorority. If perceived as 
        a potential addition, one is "rushed" by the members of the 
        informal structure and eventually either dropped or initiated. If the 
        sorority is not politically aware enough to actively engage in this process 
        itself it can be started by the outsider pretty much the same way one 
        joins any private club. Find a sponsor, i.e., pick some member of the 
        elite who appears to be well respected within it, and actively cultivate 
        that person's friendship. Eventually, she will most likely bring you into 
        the inner circle.<br>

          of these procedures take time. So if one works full time or has a similar
          major commitment, it is usually impossible to join simply because there
          are not enough hours left to go to all the meetings and cultivate the
          personal relationship necessary to have a voice in the decision-making.
          That is why formal structures of decision making are a boon to the
          overworked person. Having an established process for decision-making
          ensures that everyone can participate in it to some extent.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Although
          this dissection of the process of elite formation within small groups
          has been critical in perspective, it is not made in the belief that
          these informal structures are inevitably bad -- merely inevitable.
          All groups create informal structures as a result of interaction patterns
          among the members of the group. Such informal structures can do very
          useful things But only Unstructured groups are totally governed by
          them. When informal elites are combined with a myth of "structurelessness," there
          can be no attempt to put limits on the use of power. It becomes capricious.<br>

          has two potentially negative consequences of which we should be aware.
          The first is that the informal structure of decision-making will be
          much like a sorority -- one in which people listen to others because
          they like them and not because they say significant things. As long
          as the movement does not do significant things this does not much matter.
          But if its development is not to be arrested at this preliminary stage,
          it will have to alter this trend. The second is that informal structures
          have no obligation to be responsible to the group at large. Their power
          was not given to them; it cannot be taken away. Their influence is
          not based on what they do for the group; therefore they cannot be directly
          influenced by the group. This does not necessarily make informal structures
          irresponsible. Those who are concerned with maintaining their influence
          will usually try to be responsible. The group simply cannot compel
      such responsibility; it is dependent on the interests of the elite.</span></p>

        THE "STAR" SYSTEM</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        idea of "structurelessness" has created the "star" 
        system. We live in a society which expects political groups to make decisions 
        and to select people to articulate those decisions to the public at large. 
        The press and the public do not know how to listen seriously to individual 
        women as women; they want to know how the group feels. Only three techniques 
        have ever been developed for establishing mass group opinion: the vote 
        or referendum, the public opinion survey questionnaire, and the selection 
        of group spokespeople at an appropriate meeting. The women's liberation 
        movement has used none of these to communicate with the public. Neither 
        the movement as a whole nor most of the multitudinous groups within it 
        have established a means of explaining their position on various issues. 
        But the public is conditioned to look for spokespeople.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">While 
        it has consciously not chosen spokespeople, the movement has thrown up 
        many women who have caught the public eye for varying reasons. These women 
        represent no particular group or established opinion; they know this and 
        usually say so. But because there are no official spokespeople nor any 
        decision-making body that the press can query when it wants to know the 
        movement's position on a subject, these women are perceived as the spokespeople. 
        Thus, whether they want to or not, whether the movement likes it or not, 
        women of public note are put in the role of spokespeople by default.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This 
        is one main source of the ire that is often felt toward the women who 
        are labeled "stars." Because they were not selected by the women 
        in the movement to represent the movement's views, they are resented when 
        the press presumes that they speak for the movement. But as long as the 
        movement does not select its own spokeswomen, such women will be placed 
        in that role by the press and the public, regardless of their own desires.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This 
        has several negative consequences for both the movement and the women 
        labeled "stars." First, because the movement didn't put them 
        in the role of spokesperson, the movement cannot remove them. The press 
        put them there and only the press can choose not to listen. The press 
        will continue to look to "stars" as spokeswomen as long as it 
        has no official alternatives to go to for authoritative statements from 
        the movement. The movement has no control in the selection of its representatives 
        to the public as long as it believes that it should have no representatives 
        at all. Second, women put in this position often find themselves viciously 
        attacked by their sisters. This achieves nothing for the movement and 
        is painfully destructive to the individuals involved. Such attacks only 
        result in either the woman leaving the movement entirely-often bitterly 
        alienated -- or in her ceasing to feel responsible to her "sisters." 
        She may maintain some loyalty to the movement, vaguely defined, but she 
        is no longer susceptible to pressures from other women in it. One cannot 
        feel responsible to people who have been the source of such pain without 
        being a masochist, and these women are usually too strong to bow to that 
        kind of personal pressure. Thus the backlash to the "star" system 
        in effect encourages the very kind of individualistic nonresponsibility 
        that the movement condemns. By purging a sister as a "star," 
        the movement loses whatever control it may have had over the person who 
        then becomes free to commit all of the individualistic sins of which she 
      has been accused.</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">POLITICAL 
        IMPOTENCE</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Unstructured 
        groups may be very effective in getting women to talk about their lives; 
        they aren't very good for getting things done. It is when people get tired 
        of "just talking" and want to do something more that the groups 
        flounder, unless they change the nature of their operation. Occasionally, 
        the developed informal structure of the group coincides with an available 
        need that the group can fill in such a way as to give the appearance that 
        an Unstructured group "works." That is, the group has fortuitously 
        developed precisely the kind of structure best suited for engaging in 
        a particular project. <br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">While working in this kind of group is a very heady experience, it is also rare 
        and very hard to replicate. There are almost inevitably four conditions 
        found in such a group;<br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">1)<i> 
        It is task oriented</i>. Its function is very narrow and very specific, 
        like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task 
        that basically structures the group. The task determines what needs to 
        be done and when it needs to be done. It provides a guide by which people 
        can judge their actions and make plans for future activity.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">2) 
        <i>It is relatively small and homogeneous</i>. Homogeneity is necessary 
        to insure that participants have a "common language" for interaction. 
        People from widely different backgrounds may provide richness to a consciousness-raising 
        group where each can learn from the others' experience, but too great 
        a diversity among members of a task-oriented group means only that they 
        continually misunderstand each other. Such diverse people interpret words 
        and actions differently. They have different expectations about each other's 
        behavior and judge the results according to different criteria. If everyone 
        knows everyone else well enough to understand the nuances, these can be 
        accommodated. Usually, they only lead to confusion and endless hours spent 
        straightening out conflicts no one ever thought would arise.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">3) 
        <i>There is a high degree of communication</i>. Information must be passed 
        on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured 
        in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small 
        and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the 
        task. Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve 
        everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This 
        inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from 
        some of the decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, 
        but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which 
        perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each 
        other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can 
        be passed around easily.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">4) 
        <i>There is a low degree of skill specialization</i>. Not everyone has 
        to be able to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by 
        more than one person. Thus no one is indispensable. To a certain extent, 
        people become interchangeable parts.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">While 
        these conditions can occur serendipitously in small groups, this is not 
        possible in large ones. Consequently, because the larger movement in most 
        cities is as unstructured as individual rap groups, it is not too much 
        more effective than the separate groups at specific tasks. The informal 
        structure is rarely together enough or in touch enough with the people 
        to be able to operate effectively. So the movement generates much motion 
        and few results. Unfortunately, the consequences of all this motion are 
        not as innocuous as the results' and their victim is the movement itself.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Some 
        groups have formed themselves into local action projects if they do not 
        involve many people and work on a small scale. But this form restricts 
        movement activity to the local level; it cannot be done on the regional 
        or national. Also, to function well the groups must usually pare themselves 
        down to that informal group of friends who were running things in the 
        first place. This excludes many women from participating. As long as the 
        only way women can participate in the movement is through membership in 
        a small group, the nongregarious are at a distinct disadvantage. As long 
        as friendship groups are the main means of organizational activity, elitism 
        becomes institutionalized.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">For 
        those groups which cannot find a local project to which to devote themselves, 
        the mere act of staying together becomes the reason for their staying 
        together. When a group has no specific task (and consciousness raising 
        is a task), the people in it turn their energies to controlling others 
        in the group. This is not done so much out of a malicious desire to manipulate 
        others (though sometimes it is) as out of a lack of anything better to 
        do with their talents. Able people with time on their hands and a need 
        to justify their coming together put their efforts into personal control, 
        and spend their time criticizing the personalities of the other members 
        in the group. Infighting and personal power games rule the day. When a 
        group is involved in a task, people learn to get along with others as 
        they are and to subsume personal dislikes for the sake of the larger goal. 
        There are limits placed on the compulsion to remold every person in our 
        image of what they should be.<br>

          end of consciousness-raising leaves people with no place to go, and
          the lack of structure leaves them with no way of getting there. The
          women the movement either turn in on themselves and their sisters or
          seek other alternatives of action. There are few that are available.
          Some women just "do their own thing." This can lead to a
          great deal of individual creativity, much of which is useful for the
          movement, but it is not a viable alternative for most women and certainly
          does not foster a spirit of cooperative group effort. Other women drift
          out of the movement entirely because they don't want to develop an
          individual project and they have found no way of discovering, joining,
          or starting group projects that interest them.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Many
          turn to other political organizations to give them the kind of structured,
          effective activity that they have not been able to find in the women's
          movement. Those political organizations which see women's liberation
          as only one of many issues to which women should devote their time
          thus find the movement a vast recruiting ground for new members. There
          is no need for such organizations to "infiltrate" (though
          this is not precluded). The desire for meaningful political activity
          generated in women by their becoming part of the women's liberation
          movement is sufficient to make them eager to join other organizations
          when the movement itself provides no outlets for their new ideas and
          energies. Those women who join other political organizations while
          remaining within the women's liberation movement, or who join women's
          liberation while remaining in other political organizations, in turn
          become the framework for new informal structures. These friendship
          networks are based upon their common nonfeminist politics rather than
          the characteristics discussed earlier, but operate in much the same
          way. Because these women share common values, ideas, and political
          orientations, they too become informal, unplanned, unselected, unresponsible
          elites -- whether they intend to be so or not.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">These
          new informal elites are often perceived as threats by the old informal
          elites previously developed within different movement groups. This
          is a correct perception. Such politically oriented networks are rarely
          willing to be merely "sororities" as many of the old ones
          were, and want to proselytize their political as well as their feminist
          ideas. This is only natural, but its implications for women's liberation
          have never been adequately discussed. The old elites are rarely willing
          to bring such differences of opinion out into the open because it would
          involve exposing the nature of the informal structure of the group.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Many
          of these informal elites have been hiding under the banner of "anti-elitism" and "structurelessness." To
          effectively counter the competition from another informal structure,
          they would have to become "public," and this possibility
          is fraught with many dangerous implications. Thus, to maintain its
          own power, it is easier to rationalize the exclusion of the members
          of the other informal structure by such means as "red-baiting," "reformist-baiting," "lesbian-baiting," or "straight-baiting." The
          only other alternative is to formally structure the group in such a
          way that the original power structure is institutionalized. This is
          not always possible. If the informal elites have been well structured
          and have exercised a fair amount of power in the past, such a task
          is feasible. These groups have a history of being somewhat politically
          effective in the past, as the tightness of the informal structure has
          proven an adequate substitute for a formal structure. Becoming Structured
          does not alter their operation much, though the institutionalization
          of the power structure does open it to formal challenge. It is those
          groups which are in greatest need of structure that are often least
          capable of creating it. Their informal structures have not been too
          well formed and adherence to the ideology of "structurelessness" makes
          them reluctant to change tactics. The more Unstructured a group is,
          the more lacking it is in informal structures, and the more it adheres
          to an ideology of "structurelessness," the more vulnerable
          it is to being taken over by a group of political comrades.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Since
          the movement at large is just as Unstructured as most of its constituent
          groups, it is similarly susceptible to indirect influence. But the
          phenomenon manifests itself differently. On a local level most groups
          can operate autonomously; but the only groups that can organize a national
          activity are nationally organized groups. Thus, it is often the Structured
          feminist organizations that provide national direction for feminist
          activities, and this direction is determined by the priorities of those
          organizations. Such groups as NOW, WEAL, and some leftist women's caucuses
          are simply the only organizations capable of mounting a national campaign.
          The multitude of Unstructured women's liberation groups can choose
          to support or not support the national campaigns, but are incapable
          of mounting their own. Thus their members become the troops under the
          leadership of the Structured organizations. The avowedly Unstructured
          groups have no way of drawing upon the movement's vast resources to
          support its priorities. It doesn't even have a way of deciding what
          they are.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The
          more unstructured a movement it, the less control it has over the directions
          in which it develops and the political actions in which it engages.
          This does not mean that its ideas do not spread. Given a certain amount
          of interest by the media and the appropriateness of social conditions,
          the ideas will still be diffused widely. But diffusion of ideas does
          not mean they are implemented; it only means they are talked about.
          Insofar as they can be applied individually they may be acted on; insofar
          as they require coordinated political power to be implemented, they
          will not be.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">As
          long as the women's liberation movement stays dedicated to a form of
          organization which stresses small, inactive discussion groups among
          friends, the worst problems of Unstructuredness will not be felt. But
          this style of organization has its limits; it is politically inefficacious,
          exclusive, and discriminatory against those women who are not or cannot
          be tied into the friendship networks. Those who do not fit into what
          already exists because of class, race, occupation, education, parental
          or marital status, personality, etc., will inevitably be discouraged
          from trying to participate. Those who do fit in will develop vested
          interests in maintaining things as they are.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The
          informal groups' vested interests will be sustained by the informal
          structures which exist, and the movement will have no way of determining
          who shall exercise power within it. If the movement continues deliberately
          to not select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish
          power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do
          exercise power and influence be responsible for it. If the movement
          continues to keep power as diffuse as possible because it knows it
          cannot demand responsibility from those who have it, it does prevent
          any group or person from totally dominating. But it simultaneously
          insures that the movement is as ineffective as possible. Some middle
          ground between domination and ineffectiveness can and must be found.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">These
          problems are coming to a head at this time because the nature of the
          movement is necessarily changing. Consciousness-raising as the main
          function of the women's liberation movement is becoming obsolete. Due
          to the intense press publicity of the last two years and the numerous
          overground books and articles now being circulated, women's liberation
          has become a household word. Its issues are discussed and informal
          rap groups are formed by people who have no explicit connection with
          any movement group. The movement must go on to other tasks. It now
          needs to establish its priorities, articulate its goals, and pursue
          its objectives in a coordinated fashion. To do this it must get organized
      -- locally, regionally, and nationally.</span></p>

      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Once 
        the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of "structurelessness," 
        it is free to develop those forms of organization best suited to its healthy 
        functioning. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme 
        and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organization. But neither 
        should we blindly reject them all. Some of the traditional techniques 
        will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights into 
        what we should and should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal costs 
        to the individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment 
        with different kinds of structuring and develop a variety of techniques 
        to use for different situations. The Lot System is one such idea which 
        has emerged from the movement. It is not applicable to all situations, 
        but is useful in some. Other ideas for structuring are needed. But before 
        we can proceed to experiment intelligently, we must accept the idea that 
        there is nothing inherently bad about structure itself -- only its excess 
        use.<br>

                  we can keep in mind that are essential to democratic structuring
                  and are also politically effective:<br>
              </span></p>
              <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">1) 
                <u>Delegation</u> of specific authority to specific individuals 
                for specific tasks by democratic procedures. Letting people assume 
                jobs or tasks only by default means they are not dependably done. 
                If people are selected to do a task, preferably after expressing 
                an interest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment 
                which cannot so easily be ignored.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">2) 
                Requiring all those to whom authority has been delegated to be 
                <u>responsible</u> to those who selected them. This is how the 
                group has control over people in positions of authority. Individuals 
                may exercise power, but it is the group that has ultimate say 
                over how the power is exercised.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">3) 
                <u>Distribution</u> of authority among as many people as is reasonably 
                possible. This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in 
                positions of authority to consult with many others in the process 
                of exercising it. It also gives many people the opportunity to 
                have responsibility for specific tasks and thereby to learn different 
                skills.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">4) 
                <u>Rotation</u> of tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which 
                are held too long by one person, formally or informally, come 
                to be seen as that person's "property" and are not easily 
                relinquished or controlled by the group. Conversely, if tasks 
                are rotated too frequently the individual does not have time to 
                learn her job well and acquire the sense of satisfaction of doing 
                a good job.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">5) 
                <u>Allocation</u> of tasks along rational criteria. Selecting 
                someone for a position because they are liked by the group or 
                giving them hard work because they are disliked serves neither 
                the group nor the person in the long run. Ability, interest, and 
                responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection. 
                People should be given an opportunity to learn skills they do 
                not have, but this is best done through some sort of "apprenticeship" 
                program rather than the "sink or swim" method. Having 
                a responsibility one can't handle well is demoralizing. Conversely, 
                being blacklisted from doing what one can do well does not encourage 
                one to develop one's skills. Women have been punished for being 
                competent throughout most of human history; the movement does 
                not need to repeat this process.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">6) 
                <u>Diffusion of information</u> to everyone as frequently as possible. 
                Information is power. Access to information enhances one's power. 
                When an informal network spreads new ideas and information among 
                themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the 
                process of forming an opinion -- without the group participating. 
                The more one knows about how things work and what is happening, 
                the more politically effective one can be.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">7) 
                <u>Equal access to resources</u> needed by the group. This is 
                not always perfectly possible, but should be striven for. A member 
                who maintains a monopoly over a needed resource (like a printing 
                press owned by a husband, or a darkroom) can unduly influence 
                the use of that resource. Skills and information are also resources. 
                Members' skills can be equitably available only when members are 
                willing to teach what they know to others.<br>
              </span></p>
              <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">When 
                these principles are applied, they insure that whatever structures 
                are developed by different movement groups will be controlled 
                by and responsible to the group. The group of people in positions 
                of authority will be diffuse, flexible, open, and temporary. They 
                will not be in such an easy position to institutionalize their 
                power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group at 
                large. The group will have the power to determine who shall exercise 
                authority within it.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://allthatjazz.me/posts/doom-scrolling-struggles">https://allthatjazz.me/posts/doom-scrolling-struggles</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42791428">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a few months since I deleted a lot of apps on my phone and instead installed many restrictive apps to control my insatiable <em>scrolling</em> addiction.</p>
<h2>Fighting the interconnected reality</h2>
<p>There are simply too many means to escapism in one's electronic devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Content apps: Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.
</li>
<li>
Work apps: Slack, Workplace, etc
</li>
<li>
All these apps have moderate web apps, so no getaway while you have an easily accessible browser on your phone
</li>
<li>
You can easily login to these websites on your work laptop
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is hyper-connected and available at all times to occupy us. Wouldn't people prone to procrastination, such as myself, naturally choose to enter the rabbit hole if everything is at their fingertips? I think they would. At least, I did so.</p>
<h2>Do I need all these means of viewing content and scrolling at all times?</h2>
<p>Probably not. Let's experiment.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Delete content apps
<ul>
<li>
Entertainment: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit
</li>
<li>
Information databases: GoodReads, StoryGraph, IMDB
</li>
<li>
Messaging: Gmail, Slack
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete the browser from the phone
<ul>
<li>
Chrome, or rather disable it, because deleting it is not an option on my Android phone
</li>
<li>
Google, a super-app on Android phones with the browsing feature
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete personal profile/browser from the work laptop
<ul>
<li>
I used to have "Arc" browser on my work laptop with my personal Google account profile
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some early-stage issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Sharing a link/content from the work laptop to a personal space got more difficult. However, it's not a frequent problem.
</li>
<li>
I lost access to some services I used with my personal account. It was more convenient to do a simple task while working on my corporate laptop. Again, a problem that one can get used to.
</li>
<li>Deleting Chrome browser and Google apps caused worse problems
<ul>
<li>
I didn't even realize until then that some separate apps rely on the Google super-app. Like the weather app or some functionalities of the translation app! I lost access to these functionalities with disabling the super-app.
</li>
<li>
In some rare cases, the web app is better than the native Android app. I lost the ability to use them because I didn't have a browser anymore.
</li>
<li>
Some bank transfers need the browser page for authentication. Rarely, some other operations get blocked too without a browser.
</li>
<li>
Some quick, simple tasks don't need a whole Android app, a browser can handle them. But without a browser, those simple tasks become cumbersome.
</li>
<li>
Without the Email app, it's difficult to quickly access a ticket or receipt when you need it outdoors, away from your laptop.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current Situation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Deleting the personal account browser from the work laptop was successful. After a while, I got used to the minor inconveniences. More importantly, I removed some easily accessible procrastination tools from my professional workflow. No more checking personal emails, running quick online errands, or look something up.
</li>
<li>
Deleting work feeds from my phone was also successful. I realized I don't really need Slack, Gmail and Workplace apps all the time. It helped me set healthy boundaries with work. Now I only check my messages when I'm behind my desk and I'm not busy with focused, deep work.
</li>
<li>
Deleting content apps from my phone was another successful attempt. I've tried this method now and then. This time, I stuck with it once and for all.
</li>
<li>Deleting the browser apps from my phone proved more problematic, though. It impeded some daily operations with my phone.
<ul>
<li>
Some actions became impossible, as I mentioned in the previous part
</li>
<li>
To resolve that, I had to return to having browser apps on my phone, but with new restrictions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Later modifications</h4>
<p>To resolve the complications of not having a browser on my phone, I took these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimal launch UI to break my habits:
<ul>
<li>
The new UI is a simplistic black screen with no widgets or app icons
</li>
<li>This app can restrict other apps or hide an app from the view
<ul>
<li>
For example, I use this feature to enable the Google super-app, but hide it completely. So it's difficult for me to open it directly.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A more advanced website blocker and set restrictions on social media and browsing websites
<ul>
<li>
An interesting method I found in this app was to block distracting websites based on the location. I set them to be blocked at home, where I spend most of my focused time.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new browser instead of Chrome
<ul>
<li>
Doing this helped me break some old habits I've formed over the years with a browser I'm used to. For example, the Google ecosystem knew me too well and constantly recommended articles to me to click on. A new browser without this historical data helped me to focus on the task at hand instead of getting distracted by the shiny, new, but useless information online.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>After a few months of making the above changes and applying some adjustments, I'm seeing its effects. I still procrastinate, however, my devices can't lure me into the rabbit hole anymore. I have more control over what's available to me and I have an easier time choosing the alternatives over infinite scrolling.</p>
<p>These days when I spend time on my phone, I usually play "Spelling Bee," a game I enjoy and it has a daily "end" state unlike the infinite content apps. When I reach that point, I know that there isn't much to do with my phone. I always wanted to expand my reading time but never got to do that with the constant exposure to easy content. It's been a while that I'm able to choose to read when I'm looking for something to do besides work and chores.</p>
<p>I constantly need to find new ways to constrain my media consumption addictions, but I'm happy with my efforts. When it works, I feel saner and calmer and I do what I actually enjoy doing with my time. And if not, at least I'm doing what I need to do.</p>

<p>On the day of Trump’s second presidential inauguration, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/21/instagram-democrat-hashtags-blocked-search">Instagram censored search results</a> for the most popular hashtags associated with American Democrats, like “#Democrat”, “#PresidentBiden”, “#VoteBlue”, “#MichelleObama”, “#Kamala”, and dozens more. This ban lasted for 9 total hours and affected users worldwide, regardless of their content settings. During that same time, Instagram was displaying full search results for “#Republican”, “#Trump”, “#VoteRed”, “#PresidentTrump”, and every other popular Republican hashtag I tried. I found about 50 censored political tags related to Democrats, but every Republican tag was still working fine. </p>

<p>The removal of these pro-Democrat hashtags started on the evening of January 20th, 2025, coincidentally a few hours after Trump signed the “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/">Restoring Freedom Of Speech</a>” executive act. These censored results lasted for about 9 hours, then went back to normal at around 5 am PST. I want to state again that these words were censored for all Instagram users on the website and app regardless of that user’s content settings or their location.</p>



<figure><a href="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-21-at-11.12.08%E2%80%AFAM.png"><img decoding="async" width="515" height="207" src="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-21-at-11.12.08%E2%80%AFAM.png" alt="A screenshot from man-vs-spider on Reddit that says &quot;
I haven’t been able to get it to work for #democrat or #dnc at all. I’ve changed my settings to allow more “sensitive” content and still it’s not working&quot;" srcset="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-21-at-11.12.08 https://docpop.org/2025/01/the-day-instagram-blocked-democracy/AM.png 515w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-21-at-11.12.08 https://docpop.org/2025/01/the-day-instagram-blocked-democracy/AM-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px"></a></figure>



<p>Meta claimed this was a technical “error” affecting hashtags “across the political spectrum,” but this is demonstrably false. I searched through the most popular hashtags used by Democrats and Republicans last night and found that the majority of Democrat terms were being censored, while none of the popular Republican tags were affected. This selective censorship is a scary look into Meta’s updated content moderation practices and its potential alignment with the new administration.</p>



<p>The following hashtags were actively blocked by Instagram on the first day of Trump’s second presidency. While they are now searchable again, I personally confirmed all of these hashtags were inaccessible last night:</p>



<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Barack</li>



<li>BarackObama</li>



<li>Bernie</li>



<li>BernieSanders</li>



<li>Biden</li>



<li>Constitution</li>



<li>Democrat</li>



<li>Democrats</li>



<li>DNC</li>



<li>Fascism</li>



<li>FuckTrump </li>



<li>Insurrection</li>



<li>Jan6th</li>



<li>JohnOliver</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div>
<ul>
<li>JoeBiden</li>



<li>Kamala</li>



<li>Leftist</li>



<li>Liberal</li>



<li>Liberals</li>



<li>MichelleObama</li>



<li>Obama</li>



<li>OccupyDemocrats</li>



<li>PresidentBiden</li>



<li>PresidentObama</li>



<li>Queer</li>



<li>ReproductiveRights</li>



<li>VoteBlue</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<p>And those were just the ones I could find yesterday. I’m sure there are many more. Instagram is still blocking other hashtags like ProChoice, GeorgeConway (a writer critical of Trump), JackSmith (the special counsel against Trump), 14thAmendment, and Drumpf. It’s possible those words were already being censored before Trump’s inauguration, so I didn’t include them on the list above.</p>



<p>During that same 9-hour window, I confirmed the following words were <strong>not</strong> being censored on IG:</p>



<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>AltRight</li>



<li>DonaldJTrump</li>



<li>DonaldTrump</li>



<li>FuckObama</li>



<li>FuckBiden</li>



<li>FuckKamala</li>



<li>LetsGoBrandon</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div>
<ul>
<li>MelaniaTrump</li>



<li>PresidentTrump</li>



<li>Republican</li>



<li>RNC</li>



<li>Trump</li>



<li>VoteRed</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<p>Those words all worked. You couldn’t search for FuckTrump, but you could search for FuckObama or FuckBiden. Trump was searchable, but Biden, Kamala, Bernie, and Obama were not. You could search for MelaniaTrump, but not MichelleObama. PresidentTrump still showed millions of results, while discussions of PresidentBiden were marked as “sensitive content”. </p>



<p>We don’t know what caused Meta to censor these words, but we do know this was not affecting “both sides.”. This was an extremely targeted list of censored words.</p>



<p>As a contrast, I saw several claims on Threads and IG that TikTok was also heavily censoring content. I tested it out for myself and was still fully able to search for words like “Fascist,” “Fascism,” “Democrat,” and “Trump”. I was also able to post pro-Palestinian content like “Free Palestine” without having the post removed. If TikTok is censoring content, they are being more clever about it than Instagram is. </p>



<p>Though we can prove that Instagram was censoring certain hashtags last night, we can’t say why they were doing it. It’s possible this really was a computer error with no human oversight, but I’ve never heard of a computer bug that only affects people based on their political affiliation. </p>



<p>To understand why this happened, take a look at the context surrounding it. Last year, Trump accused Zuckerberg of election interference and threatened <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-once-threatened-jail-112328545.html">to lock Mark up “for life”</a>. After Trump won the election, Zuckerberg started a series of regular visits to Mar-a-Lago for private meetings with the President-Elect. Last week, Zuckerberg announced big changes to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-instagram-meta-changes-dei-fact-checkers-dana-white-rcna187370">Meta’s content moderation team</a> and added Dana White (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-dana-white-ufc-trump-ally-meta-board-zuckerbeg-2025-1">a Trump loyalist</a>) to Meta’s board. Yesterday, Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-inaugural-brings-worlds-billionaire-elites-en-masse-dc-2025-01-21/">attended Trump’s inauguration along with</a> Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Shou Zi Chew, and several other of the richest tech oligarchs. </p>



<p>With all of that in mind, I find it unlikely that an Instagram error selectively silencing Trump’s political opponents would coincidentally occur on the first day of his second presidency. Given the state of *gestures broadly at everything around me*, I believe that Meta has many systems in place to quickly silence Trump’s political opponents, and last night we saw one of those systems being used. If Meta really did have an “error” yesterday, it was probably that they activated that system too early. </p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPAs memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The number zero was invented against a backdrop of numbering systems which don't have placeholders.  So instead of "nothing in the tens place" they would just omit that place entirely and provide a different kind of thing instead.  Roman numerals do this, they just make 10 and 100 fundamentally different by using X or C instead.</p>
<p>Along these lines, <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-12-20/knots-representing-numbers-the-mathematics-of-the-incas.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">knots have been used</a> as a system of accounting.  The idea is that you'd have a container full of things, and tied to it would be a string.  Knots on that string would tell you how many things are in there, which might be easier than cracking the lid and counting, especially if it's something like cups of rice.</p>
<p>My point is that when you're doing this kind of accounting, you physically group the objects into recognizable shapes (likely rectangles of consistent side length).  But then if you're using a numbering system with 0 in it, you don't directly correspond the shapes to symbols, you have to count the number of same-type shapes you have.  So you end up asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how <strong>many</strong> of that shape do I have?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there's this implicit potential for "many", even if it might turn out that there's only one in your particular case. I imagine a proponent of the new system, explaining it to one of the old guard.  They would have them group the objects into piles of certain shapes/sizes and at some point say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't have 1 or 2 or 3 ... or 9 ten<strong>s</strong> then you put a zero here.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/assumed-audiences.html">Assumed audience</a>:</b> Software developers who want to improve at their craft. Assumes a bit of background about programming in general, and also just a <em>little</em> bit of background knowledge about Rust and TypeScript. (You’ll be just fine if you know no more of either than that they exist and roughly what they are.)</p><p>As a bit of a prelude, consider this extended quote from Fred Hebert, <a href="https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html">Complexity Has to Live Somewhere</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fighting complexity is a recurring theme of software development I’ve seen repeat itself over and over again. It’s something I keep seeing debated at all levels: just how much commenting should go on in functions and methods? What’s the ideal amount of abstraction? When does a framework start having<span></span> <span>“</span>too much magic”? When are there too many languages in an organisation?</p>
<p>We try to get rid of the complexity, control it, and seek simplicity. I think framing things that way is misguided. Complexity has to live somewhere.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When we adopt something like microservices, we try to make it so that each service is individually simple. But unless this simplicity is so constraining that your actual application inherits it and is forced into simplicity, it still has to go somewhere. If it’s not in the individual microservices, then where is it?</p>
<p>Complexity has to live somewhere. If you are lucky, it lives in well-defined places. In code where you decided a bit of complexity should go, in documentation that supports the code, in training sessions for your engineers. You give it a place without trying to hide all of it. You create ways to manage it. You know where to go to meet it when you need it. If you’re unlucky and you just tried to pretend complexity could be avoided altogether, it has no place to go in this world. But it still doesn’t stop existing.</p>
<p>With nowhere to go, it has to roam everywhere in your system, both in your code and in people’s heads. And as people shift around and leave, our understanding of it erodes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s more, and it’s good, so <a href="https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html">read the whole thing</a>! And as you do, you might consider how it pairs with the quote from Peter Naur <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/notes/two-quotes-on-software-engineering/">I shared yesterday</a>. Now — </p>
<p>Hebert applies this to microservices, I think appropriately. I think it also applies to <em>types</em>. The types always exist; the complexity they represent always exists. The question is first of all whether we have written them down anywhere — that is, whether we have a contract about them that can be enforced, and if so what can enforce them. Secondarily, then, the expressiveness of a type system is a measure of what kinds of the program’s complexity we <em>can</em> write down as types.</p>
<p>People who are a bit allergic to types often feel constrained by them, but those of us who like robust types see that relationship the other way around. As <a href="https://dfreeman.io/">Dan Freeman</a> put it to me recently: types are a tool, just like tests, but you have to <em>use</em> that tool. Types do provide constraints, much as tests do — but they are only the types <em>we choose to impose</em>. That is, they are knowledge we are encoding into the program.</p>
<p>The same basic thesis applies to our tests, which represent a different set of knowledge than our types. This is the benefit of<span></span> <span>“</span>test-driven development”, particularly in the red-green cycle: it is a way of encoding knowledge into the program. Test expressiveness works in different ways than type expressiveness, but it is a useful way of evaluating different kinds of and different approaches to testing.</p>
<p>This is why I like Rust. The complexity of correctly <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/temporal-spatial-memory-safety/">spatial and temporal safety</a> has to live somewhere. Rust pushes the majority of that complexity into its type system, and particularly the famed borrow checker. The rest of the complexity it isolates in <code>unsafe</code> blocks. Mind: <code>unsafe</code> allows you to know where the complexity lives, but it does not tell you where your getting that complexity wrong will <em>surface</em>. But the combination of the borrow checker and the isolation that <code>unsafe</code> offers <em>does</em> allow us to <em>control</em> the complexity. We cannot get rid of it. We can only isolate it.</p>
<p>A garbage collector gives you memory safety and not having to think explicitly about memory allocation and deallocation, but the complexity is still not gone — it has moved to the implementation, to weird performance cliffs, and to difficult-to-debug leaks of memory or other resources. That trade is very often worth it, though!</p>
<p>Whether with Rust or with a garbage collector, isolating the temporal and spatial safety means we don’t have to keep it in our heads <em>most of the time</em>, and that allows us to focus on other problems. This is why there are so many developer tools for JavaScript and Python being written in Rust: not because people didn’t want fast tools before, but because for many developers, keeping all the safety issues in their heads as they would have had to do with C or C++ was more than they felt they could reasonably do <em>and also ship the thing they cared about</em>. Rust’s borrow checking opens that door to many more people, because it has isolated that complexity, and thereby provided a more usable tool.</p>
<p>This exact dynamic is also why I like TypeScript, even including some of the wilder types I ended up writing for Ember and LinkedIn in years past. The complexity was always there — often far more than anyone realized before we started trying to write down types that actually accurately represented the system. TypeScript did not create the complexity, much as people sometimes <em>felt</em> like it added complexity to the code we were looking at. No, it merely shone a light on the existing complexity, and gave us the opportunity — and a tool with which — to <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/is-typescript-good/#:~:text=In%20software%2C%20the,of%20the%20system.">start grappling with it</a>.</p>
<p>Isolating complexity is useful. As Hebert says,<span></span> <span>“</span>If you are lucky, it lives in well-defined places.” It is not always possible to isolate complexity — we are not always lucky — , but when isolating complexity <em>is</em> possible, it is glorious, because isolating complexity is the essence of successful abstractions.</p>

<p dir="auto">We present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets.
This system includes two foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model - Hunyuan3D-DiT, and a large-scale
texture synthesis model - Hunyuan3D-Paint.
The shape generative model, built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly
aligns with a given condition image, laying a solid foundation for downstream applications.
The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant
texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes.
Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio - a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation
process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes
efficiently.
We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models,
including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and
e.t.c.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h3><a id="user-content-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Architecture" href="#architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Hunyuan3D 2.0 features a two-stage generation pipeline, starting with the creation of a bare mesh, followed by the
synthesis of a texture map for that mesh. This strategy is effective for decoupling the difficulties of shape and
texture generation and also provides flexibility for texturing either generated or handcrafted meshes.</p>

The numerical results indicate that Hunyuan3D 2.0 surpasses all baselines in the quality of generated textured 3D assets
and the condition following ability.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>tl;dr</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The map you see is the Mercator projection.</p>
        <p>But unlike a standard Mercator projection, you can substitute any point on earth as the "pole". (The initial view shows Boston as the pole point)</p>
        <p>Furthermore, this map cuts off much, much closer to the poles than normal, allowing you to see many more orders of magnitude of distortion.</p>
        <p>Because this yields a map several times taller than it is wide, it is shown sideways from its usual orientation.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Backstory</h3>
      <div>

        <p>
          The Mercator projection is infamous for its distortion at high latitudes.
          This distortion gets exponentially worse as you approach the poles.
          It is in fact impossible to show the poles on a Mercator map — they are infinitely far away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any Mercator map you've ever seen must cut off the top/bottom edges at some arbitrary point.
          The map usually stops hundreds, if not thousands of miles short of the poles.
        </p>

        <p>
          But I've often wondered what lies beyond those cut-offs... to make a map that didn't cut off but simply kept going.
          As the distortion progresses towards infinity, you would eventually reach the scale of cities, houses, insects, atoms...
        </p>

        <p>
          But of course that'd all be on a featureless expanse of ice.
        </p>

        <p>
          To make things actually interesting, we must artifically shift the pole of the projection to a more interesting place.
          Imagine the earth encased by a rigid cage of latitude and longitude lines.
          We rotate the earth while leaving the cage fixed until a new point of interest has taken the place of the North Pole.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is called an <em>oblique Mercator</em>, and is normally used to shift an area of interest onto the equator of the map to avoid distortion.
          But whereas others avoid the distortion, we embrace it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note how strange the oblique Mercator looks even without the increased cutoffs.
          The standard Mercator is so ingrained in the public consciousness that we perceive it as 'normal'.
          But once you shift the pole its pervasive distortion is shockingly apparent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, increasing the cutoffs produces a map much taller than it is wide.
          So it is presented sideways here for easier viewing (<a href="#" dest="sp">set the pole to the North/South Pole</a> like usual to see this most clearly).
          You can also switch back to "normal" orientation via the <a href="#"><img src="https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/img/rotate.png"> button</a>.
        </p>

      </div>
      <h3>Orientation</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Let's take a moment to digest what we have here. Namely:
          </p><ul>
            <li>a single map projection
            </li><li>…showing the entire surface of the earth
            </li><li>…while traversing all the way from the human scale, to the global scale
          </li></ul>
        

        <p>
          It really creates this "center of the universe" feeling.
          Basically a mathematical embodiment of the sentiment in this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mappery.com/maps/A-View-of-World-from-9th-Avenue-Map.jpg">famous <i>New Yorker</i> cover</a>. (<a href="#" dest="ny" layer="map"><i>Mercator: Extreme</i> version</a>)
        </p>

        <p>Keep these principles in mind to best navigate around the map:

          </p><ul>
            <li>
              Horizontal lines on the map ("meridians") represent straight lines radiating out from the pole point in all directions.
              Lines one half of a map-width apart from each other represent <em>opposite</em> directions.
              The properties of the meridians are best seen with a central plaza like the <a href="#" dest="arc" layer="sat">Arc de Triomphe</a>.
            </li><li>
              Vertical lines ("parallels") show rings of constant distance from the pole point.
              This can visualize <a href="#" dest="vulcan">encircledness</a> or <a href="#" dest="sthelena">remoteness</a>.
              The nearest landfall from St. Helena in any direction can be found by a vertical line sweeping towards the left.
          </li></ul>
        

        <p>
          You may find yourself trying to get 'behind' or 'to the other side of' the pole point.
          There is no such thing!
          All directions away from the pole point proceed towards the left.
          The pole itself exists at all points along the right-hand edge (technically, infinitely far to the right).
        </p>

        <p>
          If at any time you get disoriented, I strongly recommend using the <a href="#">companion map <img src="https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/img/map.png"></a> to see the correspondence to a normal map which makes these navigational principles clear.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Other Curiosities</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Now knowing that horizontal and vertical lines represent distance and bearing, if we center the pole on a <a href="#" dest="atl" layer="map">major city</a>, we can visualize its transportation network in a whole new way.
          Beltways and ring roads become vertical frontiers, while highways become a dendritic network branching off to destinations in all directions.
          We can see all of Atlanta's highway links in a single view, including the special few that make it as far as New York, St. Louis, Dallas, and Miami.
        </p>

        <p>
          Closely related, the extreme Mercator is an excellent way to visualize <a href="https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/img/routes_example.jpg" target="_blank">long-distance driving routes</a>.
          Think about how when you drive such a route, you start on some local/residential roads, then make your way to bigger arteries, and eventually to a highway.
          Here, even as smaller roads fade into nothing, the next road of your route always seems to still be visible.
          Size in this map is proportional to distance, so the extreme Mercator ends up normalizing scale in a very human-accessible way.
          The only cost is you have to turn your mind inside-out a bit.
        </p>

          Lastly, the extreme Mercator is an excellent way to visualize antipodes — points that are on the complete opposite sides of the earth from each other.
          So far we haven't touched the left-side cutoff, namely because the antipode is usually <a target="_blank" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Antipodes_LAEA.png">in the middle of the ocean</a>.
          But this is <a href="#" dest="antipode" layer="sat">not always the case</a>.
          Here we find two buildings exactly opposite the planet from each other.
          Where one is day, the other is always night.

          I hope you enjoy this novel way of viewing our world.

Inspired by the worlds of <a href="https://abakcus.com/must-read-books-on-mathematics-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mathematics</a> and nature, Araujo employs <a href="https://abakcus.com/top-10-islamic-geometry-books/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">geometry</a>, trigonometry, and sequences of dots to produce jaw-dropping three-dimensional images that often appear to have been generated by cutting-edge computer software. However, what sets Araujo apart is his unwavering commitment to traditional techniques; each artwork is painstakingly rendered by hand using only essential tools—a lamp for light, a ruler, a compass, and a protractor. Through this meticulous process, he unfolds the significance of the <a href="https://abakcus.com/products/fibonacci-golden-spiral-clock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden</a> Ratio, showcasing its spiritual depth and presence within the natural order.</p><p>In Araujo’s artistic journey, there truly is no room for error. He understands that while the creative spirit might flow freely, the technical execution must be flawless: <strong>“Working by hand, with ink on canvas, my main concern is to be aware of what I’m always doing. Errors are paid dearly.”</strong> Araujo recounts that he became engrossed in the intelligent patterns of nature at a young age, noticing spirals, sequences, and proportions that reveal the hidden structures of life itself.

Have a relative (sort of) who works at a 3M plant. Shit still occasionally 
happens.<br>
&gt; You can't just say that and go away!! How are you not irresistibly <br>
&gt; interested in that?? I would've interrogated that relative so hard<br>
It just came up in passing at Thanksgiving! I don't really know him 
that 
well; he's an in-law. He mentioned being able to throw small washers and 
bolts at the field and watching them get repelled. People got 
interested, and so someone came with a voltmeter, and after throwing a 
couple more, they checked for voltage, and there was a residual charge 
after they finally caught on on a plastic sheet to prevent immediate 
grounding. It also had a very slight magnetic field. It's apparently 
fairly common, but engineering hasn't come up with a solid explanation 
why.</i> 
<br></p><p>

I met this guy at an ESD meeting in austin once. He said the strength of 
the field maxed out his equipment at a distance so he couldn't get a 
maximum measurement.
<br>
After he published the paper he was contacted by NASA and all the three 
letter agencies asking for more info. He wanted to experiment around with 
it but no company had millions to throw into such a project (presumably, 
the government did). It had to be a pretty narrow window of temperature, 
pressure, humidity, etc. They kept the garage door open so that's where 
the insects and sparrows got sucked in (which obviously ruined the 
product).
<br>
He said it was actually known to the technicians for awhile before he 
experienced it and they just were kinda like "meh". Eventually they fixed 
the grounding issue on the machine and the problem never popped up again.
<br>
edit: found the ESD website. David Swenson apparently is still with them 
on their board of directors. http://centxesdassoc.homestead.com/
<br></i></p><div>
<p>
  Problems: coulomb forces would be expected to <i>attract</i> a person
  into the "chamber" formed by the PP film, and the attractive force
  should increase linearly across distance. There should be no "wall" in
  the center, a discrete wall is repulsive, also nonlinear.<br></p>

<p>If for some reason a
  person was repelled from the center of the chamber rather than being
  attracted, there still should be no "wall," since the repulsion force 
should exist over a large distance; it
  should act like a deep pillow which exerts more and more force as one
  moves deeper into it.  Large fuzzy fields, this is how
  magnets and iron behave, and this is how e-fields and conductive objects
  should also behave.
<br></p>

<p>

  A thought: unspooling of film typically generates a much higher net 
charge on
  the long piece of film than on the small surface of the spool.
  However, since charge is created in pairs, and net charge is conserved, 
the imbalances of charge <i>must</i> 
be
  equal and opposite.  The charge on the entire length of moving film 
<i>must</i>
  be equal in magnitude to the charge on the spool.  Yet the charge on the
  film is very large and is continuously increasing.  The limited
  surface-charge on the spool required that opposite charge is being 
<i>lost
  through some unseen path.</i>  
<br></p>

<p>
Very probably the spool is spewing out 
enormous quantities of ionized air with polarity opposite that of the 
charge on the moving plastic film.
<br></p>

<p>

  Charged air would be created by discharge in the cleft between film and 
spool as the 
film
  was peeled from the spool.  I wonder if film was being peeled from the 
top of
  the spool, so that any ionized air created in the cleft would be 
launched into the
"tent-chamber" region?  (If it was peeled from the bottom of the spool,
the charged air would end up outside the "tent.")  Or, if a corona
discharge arises in the cleft between film and spool, perhaps the UV and
e-fields of this corona can ionize the air on both sides of the exiting
plastic film, and spray the charged air everywhere. 
<br></p>

<p>

  So, if the charged "tent" of film is negative in the above situation,
  and if a large quantity of positively charged air is being generated
  by the spool, then perhaps the "invisible wall" is caused by a cloud of
  suspended air ions held in position by e-fields.  Perhaps it's a 
pressure gradient created by
  ionized air trapped under the tent by electrostatic attraction.  Yet
  again this effect would be expected to create a diffuse zone of 
increasing
  force, not a "wall", but an "invisible pillow."  Added note: concrete 
floors behave as conductors (resistors) in this situation.  Where 
megavolts at 
microamps are involved, the division between insulators and conductors is 
at 10^6/10^-6 =  1000 gigaohms.  Concrete resistivity is 
in the realm of megohms, so it behaves like a grounded metal sheet. 
<br></p>

<p>

  However, a volume of charged air is somewhat analogous to iron
  filings near a magnet.  If a solid sheet of iron filings is held in
  place by a magnet, then a literal "wall" is created, and this wall will
  resist penetration by nonferrous objects.  If in the above manufacturing
  plant, a sheet of highly charged air is for some reason being held in
  place by the fields created by the charged film, then a transparent
  "wall" made of charged air would come into being.  It might produce 
pressures on surfaces, and resist  penetration by human bodies. 
<br></p>

<p>

  My question is this: if the entire situation could be turned on its
  side, so the "invisible wall" became an "invisible floor", could a
  person *<i>stand</i>* on it?  Have we discovered the long-sought "Zero-G
  waterbed?"  :)    - B.B.
