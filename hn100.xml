<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The cybersecurity expert, Connor Goodwolf, has spoken with 10TV and other media outlets in the last few weeks detailing what information is on the dark web.</p><div>
                    <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — A Franklin County judge granted a temporary restraining order against the <a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/columbus-undercover-police-information-on-dark-web/530-d806b92a-ff1d-435a-9eac-1f88076878aa" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/columbus-undercover-police-information-on-dark-web/530-d806b92a-ff1d-435a-9eac-1f88076878aa" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a> expert who revealed what kind of information and how much of it was taken during a cyberattack on the city last month.</p>
                    <p>The cybersecurity expert, Connor Goodwolf, has spoken with 10TV and other media outlets in the last few weeks detailing what information is on the dark web. Goodwolf is the name he uses for interviews and is not his legal name.</p>
                        
                    <p>The city says it first learned something was wrong on July 18 when the city's department of technology "found evidence of an abnormality in its system." The city then severed its connection to the internet.</p>
                    <p>Two weeks later, the hacker group Rhysida claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had 6.5 terabytes of data. The group later released 45% of the data it took from the city.</p>
                    
                    <p>On Aug. 13, Mayor Andrew Ginther said the data stolen by hackers was either corrupted or encrypted, meaning it was likely useless. Hours later, <a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/cybersecurity-expert-personal-data-of-over-400000-private-citizens-is-dark-web/530-5e74cf74-a8f9-42d9-8407-317b042b6f19" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/cybersecurity-expert-personal-data-of-over-400000-private-citizens-is-dark-web/530-5e74cf74-a8f9-42d9-8407-317b042b6f19" target="_blank">Goodwolf told 10TV</a> that wasn't true and he showed what kind of personal information he was able to access.</p>
                    <p>Goodwolf continued to speak with 10TV about what data from the city was posted<em>&nbsp;</em>on the dark web, most recently revealing that the Columbus police crime matrix is downloadable. That database includes witness, victim and suspect information from any police report in the last 10 years. It also shows undercover police reports.</p>
                    <p>The city filed for the temporary restraining order against Goodwolf Thursday morning and it was granted later in the day. The city is seeking at least $25,000 in damages. The total amount will be determined at a trial.</p>
                    <p>By granting the temporary restraining order, the court is ordering Goodwolf to stop accessing, downloading and disseminating the city's stolen data.</p>
                    <p>In the lawsuit, the city claims Goodwolf has caused "irreparable harm" and "widespread concern throughout the Central Ohio region."</p>
                    <p>During a press conference on Thursday, City Attorney Zach Klein said this is not about suppressing Goodwolf's First Amendment right.</p>
                                <div>
                                    <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hUtI9w7u9lk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>
                                </div>
                    <p>"This is not about speech. It's not. It's about the actual action of going on the keyboard, going into the dark web, gathering the information, downloading it to your computer and then disseminating it to people who are in the press or otherwise," Klein said.</p>
                                
                    <p>When Klein was asked if the city is filing the temporary restraining order now to prevent more embarrassment, he said that is not the case.</p>
                    <p>"This is two and a half weeks into Connor being out there. If this was really about some sort of embarrassment, wouldn't we have filed it two and a half weeks ago? This is about the escalation of the type of data that threatens criminal investigations," Klein said.</p>
                    <p>Klein said he is working to protect officers, victims and witnesses. He adds that the information that Goodwolf has downloaded and shared is a threat to public safety.</p>
                    <p>"I am not going to let our officers down. I am not going to let our victims down. I am not going to let our witnesses down who are out there. Some witnesses are in tough cases. They put their ass on the line to go to court. They have the right to have their identity protected," Klein said.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the city says Goodwolf is threatening to publicly share the city's stolen data in the form of a website that he will create himself. Goodwolf previously told 10TV he does plan to set up a website, but it would only allow people to see if their name was part of the data breach.</p>
                    <p>Klein's office sent a release saying it respects the judge's decision to side with the city.</p>
                    <p>"This decision is a positive step to stem the dissemination of stolen confidential personnel and victim data—information that compromises active investigations and poses a threat to the lives and livelihoods of real people," Klein said.</p>
                    <p>The city filed four claims for relief against Goodwolf:</p>
                    <div>
<ul><li>Damages for criminal acts</li><li>Invasion of privacy</li><li>Negligence</li><li>Civil conversion</li></ul>                    </div>
                    <p>Franklin County Common Pleas Court records show a final pretrial conference is scheduled for Sept. 18, 2025.</p>
                    <p>10TV reached out to Goodwolf for comment, but he declined.</p>
                                <div>
                                    <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8oecRcBTRc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21542/end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell">https://www.anandtech.com/show/21542/end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41399872">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>It is with great sadness that I find myself penning the hardest news post I’ve ever needed to write here at AnandTech. After over 27 years of covering the wide – and wild – word of computing hardware, today is AnandTech’s final day of publication.</p>

<p>For better or worse, we’ve reached the end of a long journey – one that started with a <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/42/amd-k6-review">review of an AMD processor</a>, and has ended with the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21524/the-amd-ryzen-9-9950x-and-ryzen-9-9900x-review">review of an AMD processor</a>. It’s fittingly poetic, but it is also a testament to the fact that we’ve spent the last 27 years doing what we love, covering the chips that are the lifeblood of the computing industry.</p>

<p>A lot of things have changed in the last quarter-century – in 1997 NVIDIA had yet to even coin the term “GPU” – and we’ve been fortunate to watch the world of hardware continue to evolve over the time period. We’ve gone from boxy desktop computers and laptops that today we’d charitably classify as portable desktops, to pocket computers where even the cheapest budget device puts the fastest PC of 1997 to shame.</p>

<p>The years have also brought some monumental changes to the world of publishing. AnandTech was hardly the first hardware enthusiast website, nor will we be the last. But we were fortunate to thrive in the past couple of decades, when so many of our peers did not, thanks to a combination of hard work, strategic investments in people and products, even more hard work, and the support of our many friends, colleagues, and readers.</p>

<p>Still, few things last forever, and the market for written tech journalism is not what it once was – nor will it ever be again. So, the time has come for AnandTech to wrap up its work, and let the next generation of tech journalists take their place within the zeitgeist.</p>

<p>It has been my immense privilege to write for AnandTech for the past 19 years – and to manage it as its editor-in-chief for the past decade. And while I carry more than a bit of remorse in being AnandTech’s final boss, I can at least take pride in everything we’ve accomplished over the years, whether it’s <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/10325/the-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-and-1070-founders-edition-review">lauding some legendary products</a>, writing <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/2829">technology primers that still remain relevant today</a>, or watching <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/4">new stars rise in expected places</a>. There is still more that I had wanted AnandTech to do, but after 21,500 articles, this was a good start.</p>

<p>And while the AnandTech staff is riding off into the sunset, I am happy to report that the site itself won’t be going anywhere for a while. Our publisher, Future PLC, will be keeping the AnandTech website and its many articles live indefinitely. So that all of the content we’ve created over the years remains accessible and citable. Even without new articles to add to the collection, I expect that many of the things we’ve written over the past couple of decades will remain relevant for years to come – and remain accessible just as long.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://forums.anandtech.com/">AnandTech Forums</a> will also continue to be operated by Future’s community team and our dedicated troop of moderators. With forum threads going back to 1999 (and some active members just as long), the forums have a history almost as long and as storied as AnandTech itself (wounded monitor children, anyone?). So even when AnandTech is no longer publishing articles, we’ll still have a place for everyone to talk about the latest in technology – and have those discussions last longer than 48 hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://forums.anandtech.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/AT_Forums.png"></a></p>

<p>Finally, for everyone who still needs their technical writing fix, our formidable opposition of the last 27 years and fellow Future brand, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/">Tom’s Hardware</a>, is continuing to cover the world of technology. There are a couple of familiar AnandTech faces already over there providing their accumulated expertise, and the site will continue doing its best to provide a written take on technology news.</p>

<h3>So Many Thank Yous</h3>

<p>As I look back on everything AnandTech has accomplished over the past 27 years, there are more than a few people, groups, and companies that I would like to thank on behalf of both myself and AnandTech as a whole.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I cannot thank enough all the editors who have worked for AnandTech over the years. There are far more of you than I can ever name, but AnandTech’s editors have been the lifeblood of the site, bringing over their expertise and passion to craft the kind of deep, investigative articles that AnandTech is best known for. These are the finest people I’ve ever had the opportunity to work with, and it shouldn’t come as any surprise that these people have become even bigger successes in their respective fields. Whether it’s hardware and software development, consulting and business analysis, or even launching rockets into space, they’ve all been rock stars whom I’ve been fortunate to work with over the past couple of decades.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/Ian_Anton_Gavin.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/Ian_Anton_Gavin_575px.jpg"></a><br>
<small><em>Ian Cutress, Anton Shilov, and Gavin Bonshor at Computex 2019</em></small></p>

<p>And a special shout out to the final class of AnandTech editors, who have been with us until the end, providing the final articles that grace this site. Gavin Bonshor, Ganesh TS, E. Fylladitakis, and Anton Shilov have all gone above and beyond to meet impossible deadlines and go half-way around the world to report on the latest in technology.</p>

<p>Of course, none of this would have been possible without the man himself, Anand Lal Shimpi, who started this site out of his bedroom 27 years ago. While Anand retired from the world of tech journalism a decade ago, the standard he set for quality and the lessons he taught all of us have continued to resonate within AnandTech to this very day. And while it would be tautological to say that there would be no AnandTech without Anand, it’s none the less true – the mark on the tech publishing industry that we’ve been able to make all started with him.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/2014-02-26%20MWC.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/2014-02-26%20MWC_575px.jpg"></a><br>
<small><em>MWC 2014: Ian Cutress, Anand Lal Shimpi, Joshua Ho</em></small></p>

<p>I also want to thank the many, many hardware and software companies we’ve worked with over the years. More than just providing us review samples and technical support, we’ve been given unique access to some of the greatest engineers in the industry. People who have built some of the most complex chips ever made, and casually forgotten more about the subject than we as tech journalists will ever know. So being able to ask those minds stupid questions, and seeing the gears turn in their heads as they explain their ideas, innovations, and thought processes has been nothing short of an incredible learning experience. We haven’t always (or even often) seen eye-to-eye on matters with all of the companies we've covered, but as the last 27 years have shown, sharing the amazing advancements behind the latest technologies has benefited everyone, consumers and companies alike.</p>

<p>Thank yous are also due to AnandTech’s publishers over the years – Future PLC, and Purch before them. AnandTech’s publishers have given us an incredible degree of latitude to do things the AnandTech way, even when it meant taking big risks or not following the latest trend. &nbsp;A more cynical and controlling publisher could have undoubtedly found ways to make more money from the AnandTech website, but the resulting content would not have been AnandTech. We’ve enjoyed complete editorial freedom up to our final day, and that’s not something so many other websites have had the luxury to experience. And for that I am thankful.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/CES_2016_AT_Editors.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/CES_2016_AT_Editors_575px.jpg"></a><br>
<small><em>CES 2016: Ian Cutress, Ganesh TS, Joshua Ho, Brett Howse, Brandon Chester, Billy Tallis</em></small></p>

<p>Finally, I cannot thank our many readers enough. Whether you’ve been following AnandTech since 1997 or you’ve just recently discovered us, everything we’ve published here we’ve done for you. To show you what amazing things were going on in the world of technology, the radical innovations driving the next generation of products, or a sober review that reminds us all that there’s (almost) no such thing as bad products, just bad pricing. Our readers have kept us on our toes, pushing us to do better, and <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/3988/the-use-of-evgas-geforce-gtx-460-ftw-in-last-nights-review">holding us responsible when we’ve strayed from our responsibilities</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a website is only as influential as its readers, otherwise we would be screaming into the void that is the Internet. For all the credit we can claim as writers, all of that pales in comparison to our readers who have enjoyed our content, referenced it, and shared it with the world. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you for sticking with us for the past 27 years.</p>

<h3>Continuing the Fight Against the Cable TV-ification of the Web</h3>

<p>Finally, I’d like to end this piece with a comment on the Cable TV-ification of the web. A core belief that Anand and I have held dear for years, and is still on our <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/home/about/">About page</a> to this day, is AnandTech’s rebuke of sensationalism, link baiting, and the path to shallow 10-o'clock-news reporting. It has been our mission over the past 27 years to inform and educate our readers by providing high-quality content – and while we’re no longer going to be able to fulfill that role, the need for quality, in-depth reporting has not changed. If anything, the need has increased as social media and changing advertising landscapes have made shallow, sensationalistic reporting all the more lucrative.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/Anand_AGN_June_1998.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/Anand_AGN_June_1998.jpg"></a><br>
<small><em>Speaking of TV: Anand Hosting The AGN Hardware Show (June 1998)</em></small></p>

<p>For all the tech journalists out there right now – or tech journalists to be – I implore you to remain true to yourself, and to your readers' needs. In-depth reporting isn’t always as sexy or as exciting as other avenues, but now, more than ever, it’s necessary to counter sensationalism and cynicism with high-quality reporting and testing that is used to support thoughtful conclusions. To quote Anand: “I don't believe the web needs to be academic reporting or sensationalist garbage - as long as there's a balance, I'm happy.”</p>

<h3>Signing Off One Last Time</h3>

<p>Wrapping things up, it has been my privilege over the last 19 years to write for one of the most impactful tech news websites that has ever existed. And while I’m heartbroken that we’re at the end of AnandTech’s 27-year journey, I can take solace in everything we’ve been able to accomplish over the years. All of which has been made possible thanks to our industry partners and our awesome readers.</p>

<p>On a personal note, this has been my dream job; to say I’ve been fortunate would be an understatement. And while I’ll no longer be the editor-in-chief of AnandTech, I’m far from being done with technology as a whole. I’ll still be around on <a href="https://x.com/RyanSmithAT">Twitter/X</a>, and we’ll see where my own journey takes me next.</p>



<p>To everyone who has followed AnandTech over the years, fans, foes, readers, competitors, academics, engineers, and just the technologically curious who want to learn a bit more about their favorite hardware, thank you for all of your patronage over the years. We could not have accomplished this without your support.</p>

<p>-Thanks,<br>
Ryan Smith</p>

This new solution is based on an in-house developed system called DPS (Digital Preservation Services), which uses IBM-HPSS as the underlying bit repository for data storage. This transition, which is expected to span over a couple of years, is necessary to ensure the long-term preservation and accessibility of the National Library’s digital collection.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://digitalpreservation-blog.nb.no/blog/2024-08-28-rearchiving-2-million-hours-of-digital-radio/retro-4601416_1280.webp" alt="Old radio"></p><h2 id="transition-to-a-new-preservation-solution">Transition to a New Preservation Solution</h2><p>In 2023, all new data archiving was transferred to the new DPS preservation solution. At this time, the old bit repository contained over 14 Petabytes of digitized and legally deposited historical material, which needs to be re-archived into DPS. A key part of this process involves analyzing and repackaging the historical data to meet the new DPS requirements.</p><h2 id="historical-legally-deposited-radio">Historical Legally Deposited Radio</h2><p>Among the materials to be re-archived are 2.2 million hours of digital radio, equivalent to 2.5 million files and a total of 1 Petabyte of data. This includes both born-digital and digitized radio programs from the period 1993-2022.</p><p>In 1993, there were four radio channels delivering 16,500 hours of radio. By 2022, the number of radio channels had increased to 30, collectively delivering 150,000 hours of radio. With the phasing out of the old bit repository, it became necessary to move this data to the new preservation solution.</p><h2 id="dsm-to-dps-a-thorough-process">DSM to DPS: A Thorough Process</h2><p>DSM (Digital Longterm Storage) has been the National Library’s internal management system for legally deposited radio for the past 20 years. The data has been stored in an Oracle HSM bit-repository in three instances (disk, tape, tape), and the radio material was fetched daily from various broadcasters. Some radio broadcasts were stored as mp3 and wav files, with accompanying checksum files. Other broadcasts were only stored as mp3.</p><p>Before the re-archiving process began, it was decided to generate new MP4 playback files from the wav files to replace the varying qualities of the old mp3 files. The new MP4 files is not to be archived in DPS, as they are secured on the Wowza viewing platform. The new MP4 playback format chosen was 160kbit AAC with the M4A (audio) container. Fraunhofer FDK AAC (libfdk_aac) was used as the codec.</p><p>All objects were packaged according to the <a href="https://earkaip.dilcis.eu/">E-ARK standard</a>, and metadata was generated in MODS format. File identification was performed using the tool Siegfried, and technical metadata is extracted using <a href="https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo">Mediainfo</a>. Each file was carefully processed and documented, and “events” were created to record what had been done. These were stored in the DPS database.</p><h2 id="timeline-and-experience">Timeline and Experience</h2><p>Preliminary studies and mapping began in the fall of 2023, and the development of the re-archiving workflow, based on Apache NiFi, started in December 2023. The first version was put into operation on February 27, 2024, and by June 24, 2024, the re-archiving of 2.2 million radio programs was completed.</p><p>The generation of new MP4 files was time-consuming, but an infrastructure running 35 parallel threads made it possible to achieve a re-archiving rate of 9 Terabytes per day.</p><h2 id="findings-and-lessons-learned">Findings and Lessons Learned</h2><p>During the process, discrepancies were found in 577 out of 2.2 million objects. None of the errors occurred while the data was stored in the Oracle HSM bit repository. Most errors are related to inadequate control routines when the material was first received and archived.</p><h3 id="checksum-mismatch-4-cases">Checksum mismatch (4 cases)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> Objects failed due to a checksum mismatch, where the recorded checksum and the actual calculated checksum during re-archiving differed.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> For each of these objects, all three copies in Oracle HSM (disk, tape, tape) were checked and found to be identical. This means the discrepancy between the actual checksum and the recorded checksum must have occurred before the object was first archived. For these four objects, we chose to include the mp3 file in the preserved object, as it had the correct checksum. Additionally, an “event” was recorded describing why we also preserved the mp3 file.</li></ul><h3 id="null-byte-file-1-case">Null-byte file (1 case)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> An object where the wav file was null byte, causing a checksum mismatch.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> We checked all three copies in Oracle HSM and found they were identical. The discrepancy between the actual checksum and the recorded checksum must have occurred before the object was stored in Oracle HSM. For this object, we chose to include the mp3 file in the preserved object, as it had content and the correct checksum. An “event” was also recorded to explain why the mp3 file was preserved.</li></ul><h3 id="corrupt-file-1-case">Corrupt file (1 case)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> A file with the correct checksum that failed because we couldn’t extract “duration” from Mediainfo, revealing that the file was corrupt.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> We chose to archive the corrupt file in the absence of alternatives and recorded an “event” describing our findings.</li></ul><h3 id="urn-validation-failed-507-cases">URN validation failed (507 cases)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> Objects with a URN that was not in the expected format. The URN validator extracts data from the URN and uses it to build MODS metadata for the object to be archived. In this case, the validator indicated that the URN content did not match what it expected. The discrepancy appears to be due to file delivery errors related to a broadcaster for a short period in October 2011.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> URNs were changed to the correct format.</li></ul><h3 id="duplicate-files-48-cases">Duplicate files (48 cases)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> During the re-archiving process, it was discovered that 48 objects from DSM were already archived in DPS. This is related to the transition of radio production workflows on March 21, 2023. At that time, daily legal deposit of radio was moved from DSM to the new DPS. In this process, the first datasets were manually loaded into the new DPS to ensure the transition was correct. By mistake, they were also captured by the old production workflow and archived in DSM. The data from the transition day was therefore stored in both the new DPS and the old DSM. When we started re-archiving the radio, we encountered duplicate errors for the programs from that day since they were already archived in DPS.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> No action was needed as the data is correctly archived in DPS.</li></ul><h3 id="duplicate-files-16-cases">Duplicate files (16 cases)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> After re-archiving was completed, there were 16 objects that, for various reasons, remained in the queue marked as not archived but were actually archived in DPS. These are mostly related to a cleanup after a backup-related incident on March 1, 2024.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> No action was needed as the data is correctly archived in DPS.</li></ul><h2 id="statistics-and-results">Statistics and Results</h2><p>The re-archiving process resulted in 2.1 million new MP4 files, totalling 143 TB of new playback files on nb.no, replacing 40 TB of the old MP3 files. In total, 2,183,478 archive packages were re-archived in the new DPS preservation environment.</p><p>This work represents a significant improvement in the National Library’s ability to preserve and make available digital radio material for future generations.</p><h2 id="some-numbers">Some numbers</h2><p><strong>Statistics from DSM (old preservation environment)</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>MimeType</th><th>Quantity</th><th>Bytes</th><th>TiB</th><th>TB</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>audio/mpeg</td><td>24 997</td><td>1 436 936 706 369</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>audio/x-wav</td><td>2 158 485</td><td>1 053 241 022 424 650</td><td>958</td><td>1 053</td></tr><tr><td>text/plain</td><td>358 462</td><td>12 177 323</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Statistics from DPS (new preservation environment)</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Num AIPs</th><th>Bytes</th><th>TiB</th><th>TB</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>radio-DK</td><td>350 929</td><td>47 733 509 049 163</td><td>43</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>radio</td><td>1 832 549</td><td>1 007 674 770 422 690</td><td>916</td><td>1 007</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2 183 478</td><td>1 055 408 279 471 850</td><td>959</td><td>1 055</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>TiB (TebiByte) is bytes/1024 which is the exact unit of measurement for data volume.</em></p><p><em>TB(TeraByte) is bytes/1000 which is the most commonly used unit of measurement for approximate data volume.</em></p><p>2.1 million new MP4 (M4a) files were produced, which together amounted to 130TiB/143TB with new access files on nb.no.

<h2><span>Rust</span>’<span>s Ugly Syntax</span> <time datetime="2023-01-26">Jan 26, 2023</time></h2>
<p><span>People complain about Rust syntax.</span>
<span>I think that most of the time when people think they have an issue with Rust</span>’<span>s syntax, they actually object to Rust</span>’<span>s semantics.</span>
<span>In this slightly whimsical post, I</span>’<span>ll try to disentangle the two.</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>’<span>s start with an example of an ugly Rust syntax:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>&lt;P: <span>AsRef</span>&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(path: P) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>fn</span> <span>inner</span>(path: &amp;Path) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path)?;</span>
<span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>bytes</span> = <span>Vec</span>::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>    file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> bytes)?;</span>
<span>    <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>  <span>inner</span>(path.<span>as_ref</span>())</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>This function reads contents of a given binary file.</span>
<span>This is lifted straight from the standard library, so it is very much not a strawman example.</span>
<span>And, at least to me, it</span>’<span>s definitely not a pretty one!</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>’<span>s try to imagine what this same function would look like if Rust had a better syntax.</span>
<span>Any resemblance to real programming languages, living or dead, is purely coincidental!</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>’<span>s start with Rs++:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>template</span>&lt;std::HasConstReference&lt;std::Path&gt; P&gt;</span>
<span>std::io::outcome&lt;std::vector&lt;<span>uint8_t</span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>std::<span>read</span>(P path) {</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> <span>read_</span>(path.<span>as_reference</span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>static</span></span>
<span>std::io::outcome&lt;std::vector&lt;<span>uint8_t</span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span><span>read_</span>(&amp;<span>auto</span> <span>const</span> std::Path path) {</span>
<span>    <span>auto</span> file = <span>try</span> std::File::<span>open</span>(path);</span>
<span>    std::vector bytes;</span>
<span>    <span>try</span> file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;bytes);</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> <span>okey</span>(bytes);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>A Rhodes variant:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>public</span> io.Result&lt;ArrayList&lt;Byte&gt;&gt; read&lt;P <span>extends</span> <span>ReferencingFinal</span>&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(</span>
<span>        P path) {</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> myRead(path.get_final_reference());</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>private</span> io.Result&lt;ArrayList&lt;Byte&gt;&gt; <span>myRead</span><span>(</span></span>
<span><span>        <span>final</span> reference lifetime <span>var</span> Path path)</span> {</span>
<span>    <span>var</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> File.open(path);</span>
<span>    ArrayList&lt;Byte&gt; bytes = ArrayList.new();</span>
<span>    <span>try</span> file.readToEnd(borrow bytes);</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> Success(bytes);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Typical RhodesScript:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span>public <span>function</span> read&lt;P <span>extends</span> <span>IncludingRef</span>&lt;<span>Path</span>&gt;&gt;(</span>
<span>    <span>path</span>: P,</span>
<span>): io.<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Array</span>&lt;byte&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> <span>myRead</span>(path.<span>included_ref</span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span>private <span>function</span> <span>myRead</span>(<span></span></span>
<span><span>    path: &amp;<span>const</span> Path,</span></span>
<span><span></span>): io.<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Array</span>&lt;byte&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>    <span>let</span> file = <span>try</span> <span>File</span>.<span>open</span>(path);</span>
<span>    <span>Array</span>&lt;byte&gt; bytes = <span>Array</span>.<span>new</span>()</span>
<span>    <span>try</span> file.<span>readToEnd</span>(&amp;bytes)</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span>(bytes);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Rattlesnake:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>read</span>[P: Refing[Path]](path: P): io.Result[<span>List</span>[byte]]:</span>
<span>    <span>def</span> <span>inner</span>(<span>path: @Path</span>): io.Result[<span>List</span>[byte]]:</span>
<span>        file := <span>try</span> File.<span>open</span>(path)</span>
<span>        <span>bytes</span> := <span>List</span>.new()</span>
<span>        <span>try</span> file.read_to_end(@: <span>bytes</span>)</span>
<span>        <span>return</span> Ok(<span>bytes</span>)</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> inner(path.ref)</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>And, to conclude, CrabML:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span>read :: 'p  ref_of =&gt; 'p -&gt; u8 vec io.either.t</span>
<span>let read p =</span>
<span>  let</span>
<span>    inner :: &amp;path -&gt; u8 vec.t io.either.t</span>
<span>    inner p =</span>
<span>      let mut file = try (File.open p) in</span>
<span>      let mut bytes = vec.new () in</span>
<span>      try (file.read_to_end (&amp;mut bytes)); Right bytes</span>
<span>  in</span>
<span>    ref_op p |&gt; inner</span>
<span>;;</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>As a slightly more serious and useful exercise, let</span>’<span>s do the opposite </span>—<span> keep the Rust syntax, but try to simplify semantics until the end result looks presentable.</span></p>
<p><span>Here</span>’<span>s our starting point:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>&lt;P: <span>AsRef</span>&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(path: P) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>fn</span> <span>inner</span>(path: &amp;Path) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path)?;</span>
<span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>bytes</span> = <span>Vec</span>::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>    file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> bytes)?;</span>
<span>    <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>  <span>inner</span>(path.<span>as_ref</span>())</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The biggest source of noise here is the nested function.</span>
<span>The motivation for it is somewhat esoteric.</span>
<span>The outer function is generic, while the inner function isn</span>’<span>t.</span>
<span>With the current compilation model, that means that the outer function is compiled together with the user</span>’<span>s code, gets inlined and is optimized down to nothing.</span>
<span>In contrast, the inner function is compiled when the std itself is being compiled, saving time when compiling user</span>’<span>s code.</span>
<span>One way to simplify this (losing a bit of performance) is to say that generic functions are always separately compiled, but accept an extra runtime argument under the hood which describes the physical dimension of input parameters.</span></p>
<p><span>With that, we get</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>&lt;P: <span>AsRef</span>&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(path: P) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path.<span>as_ref</span>())?;</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>bytes</span> = <span>Vec</span>::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>  file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> bytes)?;</span>
<span>  <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The next noisy element is the </span><code>&lt;P: AsRef&lt;Path&gt;&gt;</code><span> constraint.</span>
<span>It is needed because Rust loves exposing physical layout of bytes in memory as an interface, specifically for cases where that brings performance.</span>
<span>In particular, the meaning of </span><code>Path</code><span> is not that it is some abstract representation of a file path, but that it is just literally a bunch of contiguous bytes in memory.</span>
<span>So we need </span><code>AsRef</code><span> to make this work with </span><em><span>any</span></em><span> abstraction which is capable of representing such a slice of bytes.</span>
<span>But if we don</span>’<span>t care about performance, we can require that all interfaces are fairly abstract and mediated via virtual function calls, rather than direct memory access.</span>
<span>Then we won</span>’<span>t need </span><code>AsRef</code><span>at all:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>(path: &amp;Path) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path)?;</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>bytes</span> = <span>Vec</span>::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>  file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> bytes)?;</span>
<span>  <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Having done this, we can actually get rid of </span><code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code><span> as well </span>—<span> we can no longer use generics to express efficient growable array of bytes in the language itself.</span>
<span>We</span>’<span>d have to use some opaque </span><code>Bytes</code><span> type provided by the runtime:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>(path: &amp;Path) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;Bytes&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path)?;</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>bytes</span> = Bytes::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>  file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> bytes)?;</span>
<span>  <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Technically, we are still carrying ownership and borrowing system with us, but, without direct control over memory layout of types, it no longer brings massive performance benefits.</span>
<span>It still helps to avoid GC, prevent iterator invalidation, and statically check that non-thread-safe code isn</span>’<span>t actually used across threads.</span>
<span>Still, we can easily get rid of those &amp;-pretzels if we just switch to GC.</span>
<span>We don</span>’<span>t even need to worry about concurrency much </span>—<span> as our objects are separately allocated and always behind a pointer, we can hand-wave data races away by noticing that operations with pointer-sized things are atomic on x86 anyway.</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>(path: Path) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;Bytes&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path)?;</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>bytes</span> = Bytes::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>  file.<span>read_to_end</span>(bytes)?;</span>
<span>  <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Finally, we are being overly pedantic with error handling here </span>—<span> not only we mention a possibility of failure in the return type, we even use </span><code>?</code><span> to highlight any specific expression that might fail.</span>
<span>It would be much simpler to not think about error handling at all, and let some top-level</span><br>
<code>try { } catch (...) { /* intentionally empty */ }</code><br>
<span>handler deal with it:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>(path: Path) <span>-&gt;</span> Bytes {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path);</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>bytes</span> = Bytes::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>  file.<span>read_to_end</span>(bytes);</span>
<span>  bytes</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><strong><strong><span>Much</span></strong></strong><span> better now!</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I apologize for yet another digression.</p>
      <p>The direct result of bulletproof infrastructure / cloud providers which are "too big to fail" is the
         <cite>balkanized internet</cite>. I don't think this has fully come to pass, but it might be starting
         to happen or might come to pass soon.
      </p>
      <p>Back in 1995 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network">NSFNet</a>
         shut off their nationwide backbone (at least for public access). Around 2000 there was a great
         dieoff, and since that time the dominant model has been one of advertising and unabashedly selling user behavioral data (<cite>surveillance capitalism</cite>); with the advent of AI that monetization has been extended to users' work product (their pictures, their posts, etc.) as well.
      </p>
      <h3>A Brief History of the Internet</h3>
      <p>Prior to about 1989 there was no public access to the internet. Which is to say, there was one
         large network which ran internet protocols, and it was private to government, military, and research /
         educational institutions. The core of the backbone was administered by the
         <cite>National Science Foundation</cite>. There's this thing called the <cite>Hatch Act</cite>
         (which I am intimately familiar with) which evolved when a pangolin kissed a cocoa bean somewhere in Virginia;
         due to its infectious nature the Hatch Act required the Internet to be strictly segregated from the public
         at a high isolation level.
      </p>
      <p>This was the <cite>Compuserve / AOL epoch</cite>. Compuserve and AOL weren't the only ones,
         and they were only "glorified chat" if the <cite>cloud</cite> is "glorified chat" (come to think of it...).
         There were some custom mini-services, although nothing as sophisticated as modern apps. So beyond the
         "glorified chat" aspect (which would likely have been referred to as a "bulletin board system"
         (BBS) at the time), these all-in-one services were precursors to <cite>cloud native</cite>, because of
         their self-contained communities. That word "community" is fraught, because it can apply
         to not only the users of an app but to cloud native ecosystems themselves.
      </p>
      <p>So basically: Al Gore didn't invent the internet, but he and Newt Gingrich decriminalized
         it, which is to say pried loose the Hatch Act's death grip and allowed some public access. Importantly,
         this access had to be strictly non-commercial. Which is to say that the traffic transiting the NSFNet
         backbone had to be noncommercial in nature. This didn't mean that you couldn't offer a commercial
         service (such as charging for internet access) just that the traffic itself had to be noncommercial:
         so no ads, no paid services with data transiting the NSFNet backbone.
      </p>
      <p>The intent, implicitly or otherwise, was that commercial providers would build out a commercial internet;
         and they did. In 1995 NSFNet disabled public access to their backbone. Nonetheless, in their minds
         people continued to carry on as though the internet was run on some kind of noncommercial basis.
         There was this notion that people would run their own services on their own servers and democracy would
         run free, naked, and wild. People crusaded vociferously on the internet on the basis of this delusion:
         there was strong resistance by "netizens" to making internet FAQs designed to help people access the
         internet, given away for free via the internet, available for free on the walled gardens such as Compuserve and AOL.
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile a new epoch, a gold rush of sorts, was underway to find ways to monetize this. Running an
         ISP was obvious. People paid for their ISP. ISPs did things to make it easy / democratize access, such
         as providing tools for publishing user content without having to learn HTML; they offered email so that
         people didn't have to run their own mail servers; they ran the web servers. Strictly speaking, at this
         point in evolution actually being "on" the internet required things like having a datacenter
         presence which your average user (even the savvy ones) mostly weren't going to care to do; whereas nowadays
         your average home in urban North America / Western Europe has more potential bandwidth than the datacenter
         provided to an ISP at that time.
      </p>
      <p>Some of those pre-internet services offered internet access when it became possible to do so.
         People in urban North America / Western Europe are largely unaware that free / low cost phones
         in third world countries have been offered bundled with and subsidized by as an example <cite>Facebook</cite>:
         the people with these phones can access the internet, but they do it via Facebook. 
      </p>
      <p>Due to externalities, the monetization experiment experienced a devastating, epoch-ending dieoff
         around the year 2000. What survived were models based on advertising to users based on, and the outright
         selling of, users' behavioral data. Now we have "AI", except we've had various forms of
         (sometimes useful) AI and statistical regression since before the internet became public; the
         distinguishing feature of the current crop seems to be the wholesale trawling and laundering of any and
         all accessible content to train models; the curation (or lack thereof) and training of these models
         largely takes place in the cloud, and increasingly by the cloud providers themselves.
      </p>
      <p>There's an aphorism that "we're learning from data if we can generalize from our training data to our
         problem set" (<cite>Abu-Mostafa</cite>) and this is a lot like <cite>Deming's</cite> "what gets
         measured gets done" (sometimes at the expense of everything else). So what can we learn about
         "cloud native" as a community (or cohort) from all of this?
      </p>
      <p>It has bespoke infrastructure, compared to the actual internet. The cloud services don't have a
         common architecture, rather they have distinguishing features. Many services are self-contained
         within any given cloud service. There are barriers to transparent interoperability with the general
         internet. And here's the possibly contentious thing: <em>they view the general Internet as an external
         resource</em> and as a consequence the cloud native community interacts largely with their particular
         community provider not the Internet itself.
      </p>
      <p>I don't think I'm torturing metaphors as an idle pastime here: <cite>Amazon</cite> owns or controls
         <em>well over 1/256th of the entire class 4 address space</em>. Here is the
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splinternet">Wikipedia article for "balkanized internet"</a>
         and I think it buries the lede (find it in the second paragraph) and misses the point: the term was coined in 2001.
      </p>
      <h3>So Here We Are Today</h3>
      <p>I am disabling <cite>AWS</cite> access to my on-prem servers (at least mostly). This is partly an
         experiment and partly an expediency, as I will explain. (As a technical side note, I'm mostly
         concerned with TCP traffic and it is possible to distinguish which is the client and which is the
         server from the initial handshake. I'm blocking connection attempts to my services from clients in
         AWS. Clients on my network can still establish connections to services hosted in AWS.)
      </p>
      <p>I run a number of services locally, accessible from the internet. Along with web services I run a
         demo of <a href="https://github.com/m3047/trualias">Trualias</a>, a DNS server, and SMTP (email). I've
         had a "no crawl" policy for a number of years. The assets which I serve are intended for
         consumption primarily by individuals on the internet. The DNS server deserves a special technical mention
         because it uses UDP with fallback to TCP: it provides limited public access to security telemetry
         (you can taste it: <code>dig @131.191.85.30 'fail2ban;*.keys.redis.athena.m3047' txt</code>).
         That could possibly be useful to a service running in the cloud, but in any case I'd expect someone
         relying on it to reach out before they made it part of their operations.
      </p>
      <p>If it was strictly web services there are other mitigations I could deploy e.g. reverse DNS lookups.
         <a href="https://github.com/m3047/rear_view_rpz/blob/main/utilities/PTR_Recs_Useless.md">Cloud providers do
         crappy reverse DNS because it's their job</a>: it fits their narrative that things in
         their cloud are <cite>ephemeral</cite>. To be fair, AWS does a better job than many other cloud providers
         and I've heard (although I've never tried it) that you can set the reverse DNS for your instances.
         (If you yearn for reverse DNS which works I invite you to take a look at
         <a href="https://github.com/m3047/rear_view_rpz">Rear View RPZ</a>.)
         These reverse lookups might not be what you think, let me use SMTP to explain why.
      </p>
      <p>I make an exception for SMTP: unless you truly stink, I allow you to connect to my mail server
         even if I block attempts to connect to other services. The reason is reverse DNS. Although technically
         you don't need accurate reverse DNS to run SMTP, as a practical matter nobody will talk to you or
         accept your mail if you don't: I can make a reasonable first pass at whether SYNs are from a
         legitimate mail server by assessing reverse DNS. There are wrinkles to this, e.g. reputation services
         can score your reverse DNS: there are certain patterns which are common to rented and ephemeral resources.
      </p>
      <p>I can make a reasonable initial assessment as to whether or not an address belongs to a cloud provider
         by the reverse DNS (or lack thereof).
      </p>
      <p>Where did this start? I block some abusive services with identifiable netblocks; this led to
         selectively blocking some small hosting providers as a proof of concept. In the case of AWS
         specifically, it started with excessive ping traffic. Ping can be abused because it is a
         connectionless protocol and so people can forge ping requests pretending to be sourced from some other
         actual location, and the response (pong) will go there instead of returning to them. I'm inclined
         to suppress responding to incessant pings, but if I don't block it outright that means I need to
         generate temporary firewall rules. The problem is that Amazon is so huge that it results in a lot of
         rules. So I started collecting AWS address ranges. I don't always paint within the lines, but I presently
         have <a href="http://athena.m3047.net/pub/cidr-lists/">53 CIDRs</a> which collectively represent all
         of the AWS address space which abuse targets / comes from; on the other hand at times I can see twice
         that number of temporary firewall rules. Stopping abusive crawlers / scanners renting from a "too big to fail"
         cloud provider is a good side effect and I won't miss them when they disappear from my web logs.
      </p>
      <p>Most of my popular resources, or the ones which might plausibly be deployed in the cloud, are
         hosted in the cloud (<a href="https://github.com/m3047">GitHub</a>). Somebody who is deploying
         some of the other things in the cloud should be maintaining a repository of their own to use for
         staging. If your repository is in AWS you'll no longer be able to check for updates; you'll have to do
         that from a desktop or privately hosted resource... or talk to me about making some specific arrangement.
         I don't think that's too much to ask. And if all you have is a smartphone, an S3 bucket, and some
         EC2 instances I don't know that I consider you to be "on the internet", although you should
         be able to access those resources from your smartphone.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately we live in a world where orthogonal threats deserve mitigations too, in particular
           data <a href="http://assets.m3047.net/theft6.html">theft</a>. This theft occurs when open source materials are appropriated
           without permission for
           unintended purposes. This is such a mitigation and it involves <a href="http://consulting.m3047.net/dubai-letters/cats-and-bunnies.html">cats and bunnies</a>,
           as well as <a href="http://consulting.m3047.net/dubai-letters/bird-list.html">birds</a>.
           Hypothetically cats and bunnies should be good mitigations, although repeating "poem poem poem poem
           poem poem" or "without within without within without within without within" might also work.
           <a href="http://consulting.m3047.net/dubai-letters/more-cats.html">Cats</a>
           and <a href="https://assets.m3047.net/bunnies-in-a-field.jpg">bunnies</a> work well because there are innumerable videos of them and some of
           them are <a href="http://consulting.m3047.net/dubai-letters/buy-videos-now.html">available
           for purchase and you can buy now</a>. <a href="http://consulting.m3047.net/dubai-letters/crows.jpg">Birds</a> on the other hand are more effective
           at level 2 in the OSI
           model where they have been documented in an <a href="http://consulting.m3047.net/dubai-letters/bird-rfcs.html">RFC</a> as a method for the
           transport of IP datagrams.
        </p>
      <h3>Elevating it to Policy</h3>
      <p>When you're a large cloud provider you need to do better than this. We have tools for disseminating
         potentially useful forensic information: DNS, whois... If you're big enough to catch my attention
         for this mitigation, you're big enough to run your own reverse DNS. Whois for individual addresses,
         extra information encoded in reverse DNS or published somewhere else in the DNS namespace.
         A "storm center" blog where current abuse patterns (and the address blocks affected)
         are discussed.
      </p>
      <p>SMTP doesn't just have reverse DNS, it has things like SPF (published as DNS TXT records). I
         have an address. There is no technical reason I shouldn't be able to use that address to locate
         information which answers some contemporaneous burning questions: Do the resources behind that address
         send pings? How many? Do they make outbound TCP connections? To what services? Who controls the resources?
         Is the resource under attack? What kind of an attack? What kind of mitigations would you like other
         resources on the internet to provide, if any (see <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7208">SPF</a>)?
         Proper mitigations are helpful to all parties; poorly targeted mitigations not so much.
      </p>
      <p>It's a shame it's come to this. If it catches on it will lead to a balkanized internet,
         and people who live their online lives in the bubble of the large cloud providers will mostly not
         notice any inconvenience which they can't attribute in their minds to choosing one cloud provider or another.

  <title>Firewall rules: not as secure as you think</title>
  


<p>This post introduces some tricks for jailbreaking hosts behind
“secure” enterprise firewalls in order to enable arbitrary inbound and
outbound requests over any protocol. You’ll probably find the tricks
outlined in the post useful if you need to deploy software in a hostile
networking environment.</p>
<p>The motivation for these tricks is that you might be a vendor that
sells software that runs in a customer’s datacenter (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software">on-premises
software</a>), so your software has to run inside of a restricted
network environment. You (the vendor) can ask the customer to open their
firewall for your software to communicate with the outside world
(e.g.&nbsp;your own datacenter or third party services), but customers will
usually be reluctant to open their firewall more than necessary.</p>
<p>For example, you might want to <code>ssh</code> into your host so
that you can service, maintain, or upgrade the host, but if you ask the
customer to open their firewall to let you <code>ssh</code> in they’ll
usually push back on or outright reject the request. Moreover, this
isn’t one of those situations where you can just ask for forgiveness
instead of permission because you can’t begin to do anything without
explicitly requesting <em>some</em> sort of firewall change on their
part.</p>
<p>So I’m about to teach you a bunch of tricks for efficiently tunneling
whatever you want over seemingly innocuous openings in a customer’s
firewall. These tricks will culminate with the most cursed trick of all,
which is tunneling <strong>inbound SSH</strong> connections inside of
<strong>outbound HTTPS</strong> requests. This will grant you full
command-line access to your on-premises hosts using the most benign
firewall permission that a customer can grant. Moreover, this post is
accompanied by a <a href="https://github.com/Gabriella439/holepunch">repository named
<code>holepunch</code> containing NixOS modules automating this ultimate
trick</a> which you can either use directly or consult as a working
proof-of-concept for how the trick works.</p>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>Most of the tricks outlined in this post assume that you control the
hosts on both ends of the network request. In other words, we’re going
to assume that there is some external host in your datacenter and some
internal host in the customer’s datacenter and you control the software
running on both hosts.</p>
<p>There are four tricks in our arsenal that we’re going to use to
jailbreak internal hosts behind a restrictive customer firewall:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">forward
proxies</a> (e.g.&nbsp;<code>squid</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy">TLS-terminating
reverse proxies</a> (e.g.&nbsp;<code>nginx</code> or
<code>stunnel</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_connection">reverse
tunnels</a> (e.g.&nbsp;<code>ssh -R</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bryanpkc/corkscrew"><code>corkscrew</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you master these four tools you will typically be able to do
basically anything you want using the slimmest of firewall
permissions.</p>
<p>You might also want to read another post of mine: <a href="https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/09/forward-and-reverse-proxies-explained.html">Forward
and reverse proxies explained</a>. It’s not required reading for this
post, but you might find it helpful or interesting if you like this
post.</p>
<h4 id="proxies">Proxies</h4>
<p>We’re going to start with proxies since that’s the easiest thing to
explain which requires no other conceptual dependencies.</p>
<p>A <strong>proxy</strong> is a host that can connect to other hosts on
a client’s behalf (instead of the client making a direct connection to
those other hosts). We will call these other hosts “upstream hosts”.</p>
<p>One of the most common tricks when jailbreaking an internal host (in
the customer’s datacenter) is to create an external host (in your
datacenter) that is a <strong>proxy</strong>. This is really effective
because <em>the customer has no control over traffic between the proxy
and upstream hosts</em>. The customer’s firewall can only see, manage,
and intercept traffic between the internal host and the proxy, but
everything else is invisible to them.</p>
<p>There are two types of proxies, though: forward proxies and reverse
proxies. Both types of proxies are going to come in handy for
jailbreaking our internal host.</p>
<h4 id="forward-proxy">Forward proxy</h4>
<p>A <strong>forward proxy</strong> is a proxy that lets the client
decide which upstream host to connect to. In our case, the “client” is
the internal host that resides in the customer datacenter that is trying
to bypass the firewall.</p>
<p>Forward proxies come in handy when the customer restricts which hosts
that you’re allowed to connect to. For example, suppose that your
external host’s address is <code>external.example.com</code> and your
internal hosts’s address is <code>internal.example.com</code>. Your
customer might have a firewall rule that prevents
<code>internal.example.com</code> from connecting to any host other than
<code>external.example.com</code>. The intention here is to prevent your
machine from connecting to other (potentially malicious) machines.
However, this firewall rule is quite easy for a vendor to subvert.</p>
<p>All you have to do is host a forward proxy at
<code>external.example.com</code> and then any time
<code>internal.example.com</code> wants to connect to any other domain
(e.g.&nbsp;<code>google.com</code>) it can just route the request through the
forward proxy hosted at <code>external.example.com</code>. For example,
<code>squid</code> is one example of a forward proxy that you can use
for this purpose, and you could configure it like this:</p>
<pre><code>acl internal src ${SUBNET OF YOUR INTERNAL SERVER(S)}

http_access allow internal
http_access deny all</code></pre>
<p>… and then <code>squid</code> will let any program on
<code>internal.example.com</code> connect to any host reachable from
<code>external.example.com</code> so long as the program configured
<code>http://external.example.com:3128</code> as the forward proxy. For
example, you’d be able to run this command on
<code>internal.example.com</code>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>$</span> curl <span>--proxy</span> http://external.example.com:3128 https://google.com</span></code></pre></div>
<p>… and the request would succeed despite the firewall because from the
customer’s point of view they can’t tell that you’re using a forward
proxy. Or can they?</p>
<h4 id="reverse-proxy">Reverse proxy</h4>
<p>Well, actually the customer <em>can</em> tell that you’re doing
something suspicious. The connection to <code>squid</code> isn’t
encrypted (note that the scheme for our forward proxy URI is
<code>http</code> and not <code>https</code>), and most modern firewalls
will be smart enough to monitor unencrypted traffic and notice that
you’re trying to evade the firewall by using a forward proxy (and they
will typically block your connection if you try this). Oops!</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a very easy way to evade this: encrypt the
traffic to the proxy! There are quite a few ways to do this, but the
most common approach is to put a “TLS-terminating reverse proxy” in
front of any service that needs to be encrypted.</p>
<p>So what’s a “reverse proxy”? A <strong>reverse proxy</strong> is a
proxy where the proxy decides which upstream host to connect to (instead
of the client deciding). A <strong>TLS-terminating</strong> reverse
proxy is one whose sole purpose is to provide an encrypted endpoint that
clients can connect to and then it forwards unencrypted traffic to some
(fixed) upstream endpoint (e.g.&nbsp;<code>squid</code> running on
<code>external.example.com:3128</code> in this example).</p>
<p>There are quite a few services created for doing this sort of thing,
but the three I’ve personally used the most throughout my career
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nginx</code></li>
<li><code>haproxy</code></li>
<li><code>stunnel</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For this particular case, I actually will be using
<code>stunnel</code> to keep things as simple as possible
(<code>nginx</code> and <code>haproxy</code> require a bit more
configuration to get working for this).</p>
<p>You would run <code>stunnel</code> on
<code>external.example.com</code> with a configuration that would look
something like this:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>[default]</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>accept</span> <span>=</span> <span>443</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>connect</span> <span>=</span> <span>localhost</span><span>:</span><span>3128</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><span>cert</span> <span>=</span> <span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span><span>to</span><span>/</span><span>your-certificate.pem</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>… and now connections to <code>https://external.example.com</code>
are encrypted and handled by <code>stunnel</code>, which will decrypt
the traffic and route those requests to <code>squid</code> running on
port <code>3128</code> of the same machine.</p>
<p>In order for this to work you’re going to need a valid certificate
for <code>external.example.com</code>, which you can obtain for free
using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>. Then you
staple the certificate public key and private key to generate the final
PEM file that you reference in the above <code>stunnel</code>
configuration.</p>
<p>So if you’ve gotten this far your server can now access any publicly
reachable address despite the customer’s firewall restriction. Moreover,
the customer can no longer detect that anything is amiss because all of
your connections to the outside world will appear to the customer’s
firewall as encrypted HTTPS connections to
<code>external.example.com:443</code>, which is an extremely innocuous
type of of connection.</p>
<h4 id="reverse-tunnel">Reverse tunnel</h4>
<p>We’re only getting started, though! By this point we can make
whatever outbound connections we want, but <em>WHAT ABOUT INBOUND
CONNECTIONS</em>?</p>
<p>As it turns out, there is a trick known as a <strong>reverse
tunnel</strong> which lets you tunnel inbound connections over outbound
connections. Most reverse tunnels exploit two properties of TCP
connections:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP connections may be long-lived (sometimes very long-lived)</li>
<li>TCP connections must necessarily support network traffic in both
directions</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, in the common case a lot of TCP connections are short-lived. For
example, when you open https://google.com in your browser that is an
HTTPS request which is layered on top of a TCP connection. The HTTP
request message is data sent in one direction over the TCP connection
and the HTTP response message is data sent in the other direction over
the TCP connection and then the TCP connection is closed.</p>
<p>But TCP is much more powerful than that and reverse tunnels exploit
that latent protocol power. To illustrate how that works I’ll use the
most widely known type of reverse tunnel: the SSH reverse tunnel.</p>
<p>You typically create an SSH reverse tunnel by running a command like
this from the internal machine
(e.g.&nbsp;<code>internal.example.com</code>):</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>$</span> ssh <span>-R</span> <span>"</span><span>${EXTERNAL_PORT}</span><span>:localhost:</span><span>${INTERNAL_PORT}</span><span>"</span> <span>-N</span> external.example.com</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In an SSH reverse tunnel, the internal machine
(e.g.&nbsp;<code>internal.example.com</code>) initiates an outbound TCP
request to the SSH daemon (<code>sshd</code>) listening on the external
machine (e.g.&nbsp;<code>external.example.com</code>). When <code>sshd</code>
receives this TCP request it <em>keeps the TCP connection alive</em> and
then listens for inbound requests on <code>EXTERNAL_PORT</code> of the
external machine. <code>sshd</code> forward all requests received on
that port through the still-alive TCP connection back to the
<code>INTERNAL_PORT</code> on the internal machine. This works fine
because TCP connections permit arbitrary data flow both ways and the
protocol does not care if the usual request/response flow is suddenly
reversed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, an SSH reverse tunnel doesn’t just let you make inbound
connections to the internal machine; it lets you make inbound
connections to <strong>any machine reachable from the internal
machine</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;other machines inside the customer’s datacenter).
However, those kinds of connections to other internal hosts can be
noticed and blocked by the customer’s firewall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the point of view of the customer’s firewall, our internal
machine has just made a single long-lived <strong>outbound</strong>
connection to <code>external.example.com</code> and they cannot easily
tell that the <em>real</em> requests are coming in the other direction
(<strong>inbound</strong>) because those requests are being tunneled
inside of the outbound request.</p>
<p>However, this is not foolproof, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A customer’s firewall can notice (and ban) a long-lived
connection</p>
<p>I believe it is possible to disguise a long-lived connection as a
series of shorter-lived connections, but I’ve never personally done that
before so I’m not equipped to explain how to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>A customer’s firewall <em>will</em> notice that you’re making an
SSH connection of some sort</p>
<p>Even when the SSH connection is encrypted it is still possible for a
firewall to detect that the SSH protocol is being used. A lot of
firewalls will be configured to ban SSH traffic by default unless
explicitly approved.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, there is a great solution to that latter problem, which is
…</p>
<h4 id="corkscrew"><code>corkscrew</code></h4>
<p><code>corkscrew</code> is an extremely simple tool that wraps an SSH
connection in an HTTP connection. This lets us disguise SSH traffic as
HTTP traffic (which we can then further disguise as HTTPS traffic by
encrypting the connection using <code>stunnel</code>).</p>
<p>Normally, the only thing we’d need to do is to extend our
<code>ssh -R</code> command to add this option:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>ssh</span> <span>-R</span> <span>-o</span> <span>'ProxyCommand /path/to/corkscrew external.example.com 443 %h %p` …</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>… but this doesn’t work because <code>corkscrew</code> doesn’t
support HTTPS connections (it’s an extremely simple program written in
just a couple hundred lines of C code). So in order to work around that
we’re going to use <code>stunnel</code> again, but this time we’re going
to run <code>stunnel</code> in “client mode” on
<code>internal.example.com</code> so that it can handle the HTTPS logic
on behalf of <code>corkscrew</code>.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>[default]</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>yes</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><span>accept</span> <span>=</span> <span>3128</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>connect</span> <span>=</span> <span>external.example.com</span><span>:</span><span>443</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>… and then the correct <code>ssh</code> command is:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>$</span> ssh <span>-R</span> <span>-o</span> <span>'ProxyCommand /path/to/corkscrew localhost 3128 %h %p` …</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>… and now you are able to disguise an outbound SSH request as an
outbound HTTPS request.</p>
<p><strong>MOREOVER,</strong> you can use that disguised outbound SSH
request to create an SSH reverse tunnel which you can use to forward
inbound traffic from <code>external.example.com</code> to any
<code>INTERNAL_PORT</code> on <code>internal.example.com</code>. Can you
guess what <code>INTERNAL_PORT</code> we’re going to pick?</p>
<p>That’s right, we’re going to forward inbound traffic to port 22:
<code>sshd</code>. Also, we’re going to arbitrarily set
<code>EXTERNAL_PORT</code> to 17705:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>$</span> ssh <span>-R</span> 17705:localhost:22 <span>-N</span> external.example.com</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, (separately from the above command) we can <code>ssh</code> into
our internal server via our external server like this:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>$</span> ssh <span>-p</span> 17705 external.example.com</span></code></pre></div>
<p>… and we have complete command-line access to our internal server and
the customer is none the wiser.</p>
<p>From the customer’s perspective, we just ask them for an
innocent-seeming firewall rule permitting outbound HTTPS traffic from
<code>internal.example.com</code> to <code>external.example.com</code>.
That is the most innocuous firewall change we can possibly request
(short of not opening the firewall at all).</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>I don’t think all firewall rules are ineffective or bad, but if the
same person or organization controls both ends of a connection then
typically anything short of completely disabling internet access can be
jailbroken in some way with off-the-shelf open source tools. It does
require some work, but as you can see with the <a href="https://github.com/Gabriella439/holepunch">associated
<code>holepunch</code> repository</a> even moderately sophisticated
firewall escape hatches can be neatly packaged for others to reuse.</p>

<h3 id="ed3a">Part 1<br>1) 2021-July-24, she was arrested</h3>



<p id="9c8c">I was sound asleep, in a hazy state, when suddenly I heard the door to the bedroom being opened.</p>



<p id="1a16">My heart skipped a beat: Could she know that the situation had been exposed and was about to kill me? Does she have a knife in her hand? What should I do now?…</p>



<p id="1f98">Before I could come up with a plan, there was a “click,” and the light turned on. I saw a muscular man standing at the door: “I am police.”</p>



<p id="7d31">I rubbed my eyes and looked closely. It was the muscular male police officer who had taken my statement a few hours ago. I checked my watch, and it was July 24, 2021, Saturday, 00:15 AM.</p>



<p id="b768">I hastily put on some clothes and went out of the room. I saw that the light in my children’s room was also on, with only my son sleeping. My daughter and my wife,&nbsp;<strong>Kim</strong>, were not in bed. At that moment, I heard my daughter’s voice downstairs. Following the sound, the police officer behind me said, “Don’t talk to her (referring to&nbsp;<strong>Kim</strong>).”</p>



<p id="3a61">On the stairs, I saw Kim standing helplessly in front of the TV in the living room, wearing only a tank top and underwear. Another muscular man stood beside her, and she seemed to be under some sort of restraint. Although they were both in plain clothes, they were undoubtedly police officers. My three-and-a-half-year-old daughter was murmuring something beside them. She must have sensed the tense atmosphere. When she saw me, she hurried over and took my hand. I took the opportunity to pick her up and take her back to her room to sleep.</p>



<p id="bd89">After a while, the muscular man at the door told me: “She wants her pants.” I found the shorts she had worn the day before on a chair. As I grabbed the clothes, I felt a small bottle. I flipped it out from the clothes and told the police officer, “I found it.” Immediately, the police officer told me, “Don’t touch it with your hands.” I told him, “I didn’t touch it,” and then handed it over to the police.</p>



<p id="4096">I returned to the children’s room to comfort my daughter to sleep. I didn’t know when the police left. All the lights downstairs were on, but I didn’t see anyone. Obviously,&nbsp;<strong>Kim</strong>&nbsp;had been taken away by the police.</p>



<h3>2) 2021-July-17, I discovered the truth</h3>



<p id="863a">Fast forward to the weekend a week ago.</p>



<p id="b995">Less than 2 minutes after I left my water bottle and returned to the table, I noticed that the cap of my water bottle was not in its original position. Our kitchen and living room are connected, and only Kim and our two kids were at home. The kids were in the living room, one playing a Switch game, and the other watching an iPad. They wouldn’t touch my water bottle. Could it be Kim? Why would she tamper with my water bottle? A negative thought crossed my mind, but I instantly dismissed it. It couldn’t be; I must have been mistaken earlier!</p>



<p id="928f">Due to my hypercalcemia for over a year, I underwent numerous tests including PET CT scans, MRI scans, ultrasounds, genetic sequencing, and more, but no cause could be found. My blood calcium levels remained high. Blood samples were sent to research institutions in Denmark, Finland, Gothenburg, and others, but no cause was identified. With no root cause found, all they could do was alleviate the symptoms and reduce the damage to my heart and kidneys. The doctor arranged home care for me, with blood tests and saline drips administered three times a week. Meanwhile, I was instructed to drink as much water as possible every day. I usually drank over 6 liters, sometimes up to 10 liters. So, I constantly had to drink water and use the restroom.</p>



<p id="3866">The second time I felt something was amiss with my water bottle was when I noticed the water level had slightly risen. Again, it was less than 2 minutes after I had left the kitchen to use the restroom. When I returned, the water level had unmistakably increased. A chill ran down my spine, and I felt a hint of suspicion creeping up.</p>



<p id="cae8">From then on, whenever I left my water bottle, I made a tiny mark on the cap with a knife and took a photo of the cap and the water level using my phone camera.</p>

<p id="7b35">Indeed, when I returned from the restroom and checked, the position of the cap had changed again, and the water level had risen slightly. At that moment, I felt like a thunderbolt had struck, my mind went blank. Yet, I still didn’t want to believe it was true.</p>



<p id="a309">I installed monitoring software on an old Android phone at home and placed it in the room where I usually work. I used to work from home everyday due to COVID epidemic.<br>On the evening of July 22, 2021, around 9 o’clock, I was downstairs in the living room hanging out with my son when I heard Kim enter my study room upstairs.</p>



<p id="5675">I took out my phone and opened the monitoring app. I saw Kim take out a small brown glass bottle from her pocket, then pick up an Coke can from the table, put it back down. Next, she picked up another 1.5-liter water bottle , took a few sips, and then poured the brown liquid from the small bottle into the water bottle. She then left the room. The entire process took less than 20 seconds.</p>

<p>Before, it was just suspicion, but when I witnessed this scene for real, I was truly shocked. I couldn’t hear my son talking beside me, my hands were trembling as I held the phone, and the phone almost slipped from my grasp. Before I could gather my thoughts, Kim entered the room again and continued pouring the remaining liquid from the brown bottle into another water bottle.</p>

<p id="874f">I slumped onto the sofa, feeling dizzy and disoriented.</p>



<p id="5979">I couldn’t sleep at all that night because I knew that our family was finished. Our beloved son and daughter were about to lose their intact family. I stayed awake the whole night, not knowing how I managed to get through it.</p>



<p id="2f92">Early the next morning, I sent a text message to my doctor and arranged to meet in the doctor’s office that afternoon.</p>



<p id="251c">As usual on Friday mornings, the nurse came to our apartment to take blood and administer the drip. In the brief two minutes it took me to get up and use the bathroom, Kim completed the poisoning operation within 30 seconds again:</p>

<p id="73a6">In the afternoon, during a break in the doctor’s consultations, I finally met with the doctor. I told her everything I had discovered. I had been holding back my emotions, but when I showed the doctor the video, I couldn’t help but break down in tears. I also gave the doctor the water bottle I had brought with me.<br>The doctor immediately arranged to analyze the water I brought and asked me to wait at home for the results before deciding what to do next. Two hours later, the doctor called me with the results, which showed a high concentration of vitamin D. However, the doctor was unsure about the next steps. She advised me to try to obtain the brown bottle and have its contents analyzed at the hospital.</p>



<p id="f18d">About half an hour later, the doctor called me again. She said that after discussing with another one of my primary doctors, they both agreed that we should immediately contact the police. A police man would call me shortly. I found a secluded place to wait for the call.</p>



<p id="f672">Ten minutes later, I received a call from the police, asking me to come to the station for questioning. The interrogation lasted until late at night, around nine o’clock. The police informed me that they wouldn’t take any immediate action and advised me to return home and carry on as if nothing had happened while taking precautions to protect myself.</p>



<p id="1ebf">Due to the lack of sleep the previous night, I was extremely tired that night and drifted off to sleep in a daze, not knowing when exactly I fell asleep.</p>



<p id="878b">Within less than an hour of falling asleep, the scene described at the beginning of this narrative unfolded.</p>



<h3 id="3a9b">Part 2<br>3) 2019 summer, Hypercalcemia</h3>



<p id="2d2d">At the end of 2018, I was diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Following the doctor’s advice, I started taking prednisone orally in March 2019, even though I had no symptoms at that time, except for elevated ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) levels was a little bit high. In the subsequent three months of follow-up, my ACE levels had returned to normal, and CT scans showed that the granuloma in my lungs were improving. If all went well, the sarcoidosis would have cleared up in six months, and I could stop taking the medication.</p>



<p id="58bc">However, things often don’t go as planned.<br>In June 2019, I began to feel unwell: fatigue, thirst, frequent urination, and sluggish muscle reactions. Several times, I nodded off at my desk in the morning at work, and sometimes I even sneaked into a small meeting room to rest against a chair. I thought it was because my little daughter were noisy at night, and I hadn’t slept well. However, after more than a month of, not only did my health not improve, but it was getting worse.</p>



<p id="0a82">On September 14, 2019, there was a Chinese food festival at Kungsträdgården. I bought my favorite spicy braised beef there, but it tasted strange, nothing like the familiar taste it used to have. Even though it was a small portion, I couldn’t finish it.</p>



<p id="f831">In September, I contacted my doctor, suspecting that the prednisone were causing diabetes. The doctor asked me to have a blood test.</p>



<p id="ca6c">The blood test results showed a eGFR was of 56 mL/min and a blood calcium level of 3.97 mmol/L.</p>

<p id="0ffc">After seeing the blood test results, the doctor immediately called me and informed me that my blood calcium level was too hight, and hypercalcemia had already hurted my kidneys, with a eGFR of 56 (normal range should be &gt;80), and my blood creatinine level was 131 (normal range 60–100). The doctor instructed me to go to hospital immediately.</p>



<p id="3875">On September 26th, I was admitted to Capio Saint Göran’s Hospital. They immediately fitted me with electrocardiogram equipment, checked my blood oxygen saturation, and I was covered in devices and various tubes.</p>

<p id="fa5b">On the first night, the heart rate monitoring alarmed a lot, and my heart rate dropped to as low as 30 beats per minute. Nurses repeatedly came in, asking, “Are you OK?” to confirm that I was still alive.</p>



<p id="167d">Due to the limited facilities at this hospital, I was transferred to Karolinska huddinge specializing in heart disease by ambulance in early October.</p>



<p id="b239">It was my first time taking ambulance. During the transfer, my body trembled uncontrollably the whole way, and upon arrival at the hospital, my blood pressure was measured at 160/190.</p>



<p id="da9f">During my hospital stay, one blood test revealed a severe overdose of vitamin D in my body. The level of <strong>25-OH Vitamin D</strong> was 938 nmol/L (normal range 75–125), exceeding the limit by 8 times, and the level of <strong>1,25-OH Vitamin D</strong> was 2510 pmol/L (normal range 20–208), exceeding the limit by 12 times.</p>

<p id="6f17">The following day, after a collective consultation involving cardiologists, endocrinologists, and pulmonologists, I was informed that I had hypercalcemia and vitamin D toxicity.</p>



<p id="40a1">The long-term severe hypercalcemia had already hurted my heart and kidneys, leading to kidney failure and AV block I/II/III. The doctors recommended immediate implantation of a pacemaker.</p>



<p id="77d3">In that moment, I felt like the whole world had dimmed.</p>



<p id="ab2a">There was nothing I could do but comply with the treatment. Fortunately, the subsequent treatment went relatively smoothly. After about two weeks of hospitalization, the hypercalcemia was corrected, and there was slight improvement in my creatinine levels. However, it would likely take more than six months for the massive amount of vitamin D in my body to be gradually metabolized, according to the doctor.</p>

<p id="ad41">I was quite health before, I was not mentally prepared to have a pacemaker implanted. I requested further observation and suggested that the pacemaker should only be implanted if absolutely necessary.<br>The doctor agreed and advised me to undergo regular blood tests and dynamic electrocardiograms at home. If the situation was getting worse, then the pacemaker would be necessary.</p>



<p id="cf09">After one month of discharge from hospital, all blood indicators remained stable, and there was considerable improvement in the heart AV block. Subsequent check-ups showed that my heart condition was improving.</p>



<p id="82be">However, in the following two check-ups, there were signs of further elevation in vitamin <strong>25-OH Vitamin D</strong> levels. I asked the doctor about this, expressing concern that there might be an underlying issue in my body that had not been detected. The doctor suggested that it could be due to measurement errors, didn’t have to worry about it.</p>

<p id="4ff8">It seemed like I thought this ordeal was over.</p>



<p id="2d23">Little did I know, this was just the beginning of my misfortune.</p>



<h3>4) 2020-April, fatigue</h3>



<p id="5ff7">In April 2020, the same symptoms reappeared: fatigue, increased thirst, frequent urination, and sluggish muscle reactions.</p>



<p id="6e4d">As I remember, once I accompanied Kim and children to Skansen, where I felt very low in energy. I struggled to keep up with the children and spent most of the time finding a place to rest my head on the table and sleep. I also constantly felt thirsty.</p>



<p id="584b">By the end of May, blood tests revealed continued hypercalcemia: ionized calcium at 2.12 (normal range 1.15–1.33), total calcium at 4.11 (normal range 2.15–2.50), a eGFR of 35 (normal range should be &gt;80), and a creatinine level of 180 (normal range should be &lt;100). Furthermore, the vitamin <strong>25-OH Vitamin D</strong> level was at a staggering 1500 nmol/L, even higher than the 938 nmol/L measured in October 2019.</p>



<p id="cf35">Overall, the situation was worse than the episode in September 2019.</p>

<h3>5) 2020-June, Hypercalcemia again</h3>



<p id="2c63">I called nurse for help, finally had a blood test on June 1st.<br>After seeing the blood test result, the doctor asked to go to Karolinska immediately. I was readmitted to the Karolinska Hospital (Solna) again that day.</p>

<p>During my hospital stay, there were multiple instances of my heart rate dropping sharply to 30 bmp, triggering alarms throughout the hallway. In the middle of the night, around 3 o’clock, a group of nurses and doctors surrounded me. Ultimately, they had to resort to administering Bricanyl(Epinephrine medicine) to raise my heart rate.<br></p>

<p>In the following days, I underwent continuous IV fluid therapy for 24 hours a day. This rapid intervention quickly corrected the hypercalcemia, and there was some relief in my heart rate issues as well.<br>However, the cause of the massive amount of vitamin D and hypercalcemia remained a mystery to the doctors.</p>

<p id="1323">On the weekend I was discharged from the hospital, I cooked some beef for myself and ate half of it. When I returned from the bathroom, I noticed a bitter taste in the beef and a spicy sensation in the half-bottle of cola. Given my previous experience with changes in taste related to high blood calcium levels, I immediately suspected that my blood calcium levels had risen again. Since the taste was unpleasant, I poured out the remaining beef and cola.</p>



<p id="0e36">Sure enough, in the afternoon, I felt very tired and fatigued. I didn’t even have the energy to hang out with the children on the sofa. Kim, being considerate, suggested that I go sleep in the bedroom while she took care of the children.</p>



<p id="473a">We had arranged to have a follow-up appointment a week later, and as expected, my blood calcium levels had returned to the same levels as before my previous hospitalization. I was readmitted immediately. After around the clock of continuous IV fluid therapy, my blood calcium levels were corrected after 4 days, and I was discharged again.</p>



<p id="6218">However, a few days after returning home, I started feeling unwell again, leading to another hospitalization after a follow-up check-up.</p>



<p id="9c0a">This cycle continued repeatedly, and between June and August, I was admitted to the hospital more than 10 times.</p>

<p>The peak of my blood calcium levels marked the beginning of each hospitalization, and each time it reached its lowest point, it signaled my discharge from the hospital.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1414" data-permalink="https://rattvisan.blog/2024/07/28/yes-i-was-poisoned-by-my-wife-a-software-engineer-of-top3-us-company/image-16/" data-orig-file="https://rattvisan.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-15.png" data-orig-size="720,474" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://rattvisan.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-15.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://rattvisan.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-15.png?w=720" tabindex="0" role="button" loading="lazy" width="720" height="474" src="https://rattvisan.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-15.png?w=720" alt=""></figure>



<p>The doctors also found it confused. Despite drinking 5.5 to 7 liters of water every day, my calcium levels couldn’t be maintained within the normal reference range. Once IV fluid therapy was initiated, the calcium levels would decrease again.</p>

<p id="c268">The doctor wrote in the my medical journal: “During his hospitalization, he took medication on time, and even without IV fluid therapy, his blood calcium levels were normal. However, once he returned home, his blood calcium levels became elevated. It is evident that he did not adhere to the medication schedule at home as instructed.”</p>



<p id="492f">This statement is obviously not true. I set alarms on my phone to remind me to take medication. When it’s time, I take the stomach-protecting medicine first, then set a timer for 30 minutes before having breakfast. After breakfast, I set another timer for 30 minutes and then take medications such as prednisone, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, vitamin B12, and folic acid. These medications have been with me for over a year, and I have not skipped taking them even one day.</p>



<p id="7821">Why drinking plenty of water didnt work, but IV fluid therapy worked for hypercalcemia very well?</p>

<p>The doctor mentioned “dramatic course of care.” in my journal where blood calcium levels spike after discharge, leading to readmission to the hospital.<br></p>

<p>Why was it that everything was normal in the hospital even without I fluid therapy, but once I return home, hypercalcemia came again?<br></p>

<p>Till 2021-August, I’d been in and out of the hospital more than ten times. While in the hospital, the treatment mainly involves simple IV fluid therapy to lower calcium levels. However, I was occupying a whole room, which seemed like a waste of medical resources.<br>Later on, the doctor decided to arrange for home care for me and had a PICC line implanted in my arm to avoid repeated needle pricks.</p>

<p id="4ebd">For the following year, I received IV therapy at home. Despite the treatment alleviating symptoms, there was not even the slightest improvement in the issues of elevated blood calcium and excessive vitamin D levels.<br>The following pictures shows only part of an IV fluid bags:</p>

<p>Every doctor believes that the excessive amount of vitamin D in my body must have been acquired from external sources (food or water), as it’s unlikely that my body could produce such a large amount of vitamin D on its own.</p>

<p>Despite receiving IV therapy 3–7 times a week, my blood calcium levels remained consistently high. I often complained to the doctor about how hypercalcemia affects my sense of taste, as I frequently perceive water to taste strange. Is this a viable clue, and is there a medical explanation for it? However, the doctor also mentioned that they had never heard of hypercalcemia affecting taste sensation.</p>

<p id="a088"><strong>Why strange taste</strong>? Nobody knew.</p>



<p id="19f3">I am immensely grateful to the two endocrinologists&nbsp;<strong>Martin Larsson</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Sigridur Björnsdottir</strong>, whose expertise and compassionate care saved my life during my illness. Their dedication to their profession and unwavering commitment to my well-being were truly remarkable. Without their skillful intervention and support, I might not be here today. Their expertise, coupled with their empathetic approach, made all the difference during a challenging time in my life. I cannot thank them enough for their exceptional care and support.</p>



<h3>6) 2021-Jan, I almost died</h3>



<p id="bc9c">On January 8, 2021, a Friday night, a “allergic” reaction during IV fluid therapy almost took me my life.<br>It was around 10:30 PM when the IV fluid was completed. As usual, I needed Kim’s help to flush the PICC on my arm with low-concentration saline solution. We had been doing this routine for several months without any problems.<br>However, this time, something unexpected happened. As soon as she began pushing the syringe, I instantly felt my entire body flush with heat, my heart pounding rapidly, as if it were about to burst out of my chest. In a matter of seconds, my palms were sweating a lot. In that moment, I felt like I might not make it through the night.</p>



<p id="19af">I immediately shouted for her to stop pushing the syringe and call the doctor. She hesitated abnormally, claiming she had no doctor’s phone number.<br>After taking a moment to regain some composure, I found out the emergency contact number for the nursing agency and urged her to call. She dialed for a while and said no one answered.<br>I then suggested calling for an ambulance. She claimed not to know the ambulance number either. I informed her it was 112 for emergencies, but seeing her take a long time to respond in her own room, I dialed 112 myself and called for an ambulance.<br>By the time I took the ambulance to the hospital, all symptoms had disappeared, and I felt no discomfort.<br>It was well past 5 AM, and the temperature was below freezing outside. In an effort to save money, I walked for nearly 40 minutes to get back home.</p>

<p id="66dd">On next Monday January 11th, as usual, a nurse came to my home in the morning around 9 o’clock to take blood samples and put IV fluid on me.<br>I told the nurse, about what had happened the previous Friday night.<br>The nurse immediately became concerned and told me he needed to call the doctor to discuss the situation before proceeding.<br>After making the call, he said we could continue as usual but to let him know immediately if anything unusual occurred.</p>



<p id="2c66">Following the usual procedure, he began flushing the PICC line on my arm with a low-concentration saline solution. As soon as he pushed in a bit, I immediately felt the same sensations as the previous Friday: my blood vessels heating up, my heart rate accelerating. I promptly asked him to stop. He was alarmed and asked me to calm down while he called the doctor again for further instructions.<br>The doctor said they had never heard of an allergic reaction to saline solution, especially considering I had been using it for a year without any issues. However, as a precaution, the doctor recommended switching to a different type of saline solution packaged in a different bag.<br>Later, after consulting with the doctor, it was decided that there would be no more manual flushing of the PICC line in the future. Instead, the nurse would pre-hang the low-concentration saline solution used for flushing, and after all procedures were complete, I would turn the valve myself for flushing without the need for manual intervention.<br>After switching to the new bag of saline solution, the flushing process proceeded without any further incidents.</p>

<p>However, the cause of that incident has not been determined.<br></p>



<h3>7) Where are Vitamin D and calcium from?</h3>



<p id="9a42">I had been asking the doctor where the excessive vitamin D and persistently high calcium levels in my body was coming from.</p>



<p id="d3f4">The doctor conducted tests on the seasoning packet used for the braised beef, but found no abnormalities. They also analyzed the electrolyte content of the tap water in my area but found no issues.</p>



<p id="aaf4">There was suspicion of tumors in my body, so I underwent three PET-CT scans, multiple MRI scans, ultrasounds, bone density tests, and genetic sequencing, but no abnormalities were found.</p>



<p id="dd34">The doctor suspected a dietary issue and prescribed protein nutritional drinks for me. I consumed only three bottles of these drinks daily, along with small amounts of staple foods and no vegetables, for 6 consecutive months, but there was no improvement in the high calcium levels.</p>



<p id="723d">I even conducted a fasting test, abstaining from food for three days and only consuming water, yet my blood calcium remained high.</p>



<p id="6092">During a one-week fasting period, I monitored my blood glucose levels regularly and ate a piece of fruit when my blood sugar was low. However, there was no sign of a decrease in blood calcium levels during or after the fasting period.<br>If blood calcium didn’t come from the body or from food and water, could it be coming from the water?</p>



<p id="8148">For a period of time, I spent over three thousand kronor buying bottled mineral water from the ICA MAXI, with a calcium content of only 10.7 mg/L. I drank it continuously for two months, but there was no improvement in my blood calcium levels at all.</p>



<p id="7a7f">If blood calcium didn’t come from the body, food, or water, then where did it come from? I firmly believe that my tests were accurate, so could there be something undetected in my body?</p>



<p id="30c2">Although IV fluid therapy can alleviate symptoms, the deterioration of renal function can be observed from the creatinine levels.<br>Additionally, due to long-term IV fluid treatment and medication, my weight dropped to the lowest ever recorded, 58 kg, but the facial edema made it seem like I had gained weight.</p>



<p id="1da3">I couldn’t sit idly by and wait for the worst. I must go to hospitals in China for a second opinion.<br>Despite Kim’s efforts to dissuade me, I have booked a flight for August 2021 to visit hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing.</p>



<p id="6d17">I think she couldn’t wait any longer. Because once I go to China, the hypercalcemia will immediately resolve on its own, and she will be at risk of exposure.</p>







<h3>8) What I had experienced</h3>



<p id="dd21">The past two years for I have been filled with numerous medical procedures and treatments.</p>



<p id="2774">Here are the statistics:</p>



<ul>
<li>3 times: Full-body MRI scans and echocardiograms</li>



<li>3 times: Full-body PET-CT scans</li>



<li>3 times: Full-body bone density tests</li>



<li>3 times: Ambulance transport to the hospital</li>



<li>11 times: Hospitalizations for treatment</li>



<li>182 times: Home nursing visits for care</li>



<li>321 days: Duration of PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) in your body</li>



<li>336 times: IV blood draws for testing</li>



<li>1200 hours: Total duration of IV therapy, spent sitting at the table working despite illness</li>



<li>3720 milliliters: Equivalent to 75% of my blood volume has been taken out for testing</li>



<li>6000 milliliters: Minimum daily water intake required</li>



<li>600,000 milliliters: Amount of saline solution infused into your body for treatment</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past two years, despite numerous tests, the underlying cause of my condition remained elusive. Doctors resorted to daily IV therapy to lower your blood calcium levels. They also advised me to consume fewer calcium-rich foods and avoid excessive sunlight exposure.<br>Since vegetables are high in calcium, you avoided them and primarily consumed plain noodles or dumplings, accompanied by 6 to 10 liters of water daily, along with IV fluids. This regimen resulted in severe electrolyte imbalances: high calcium levels but low magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin. Medications such as potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, vitamin B12, and folic acid were necessary to maintain electrolyte balance.</p>



<p id="9dd3">Breakfast could only be breads, no butter, no eggs, because they are all rich in vitamin D. I dared not drink fruit juice because of long-term use of prednisone, which leads to diabetes, and drinking fruit juice will further increase blood sugar.</p>



<p id="1b1f">Almost every day, I stayed at home for IV infusion, and couldn’t exercise because a PICC catheter was implanted in my body. I couldn’t engage in strenuous exercise or carry heavy objects normally, so my physical condition was getting worse. If I only needed 2 liters of IV infusion, and it is completed around 8:00 in the evening, I could go out for a walk, often returning around 10:00 in the night. If unfortunately I need 3 liters of saline, then I basically couldn’t go out all day.</p>



<p id="ac6e">Taking a shower at night was also a problem. To avoid infection, I needed to put a plastic bag on my arm and tie it with rubber bands at both ends before taking a shower. I hade to raise my right hand and wash with the other hand.</p>



<p id="0bdd">In the summer of 2020, despite taking double doses of prednisone, high blood calcium levels could not be controlled. In August of the same year, I started taking methotrexate. A month later, severe oral ulcers appeared, and both the upper and lower lips were rotten, making it impossible to eat normally for several weeks. And severe hair loss, there were handfuls of hair next to the chair where I often sat. Kim often came to my room to help me clean up the hair. At that time, I was really moved. I thought she didn’t complain at all when I was sick, and even helped clean up my room. What a good wife!</p>



<p id="74db">As early as the summer of 2020, the doctor asked me if Kim and I usually shared a meal and how my relationship with Kim was. The doctor also talked to Kim. Now it seems that these questions all had deeper implications, but I was naive at the time and ignored these questions.</p>



<p id="d3d4">I never thought of the word “poisoning” because I really couldn’t connect the “elite” who graduated from a prestigious university in China and worked for one of the top three companies in the world with “criminals”. I deeply understand the cost of crime.</p>



<p id="3044">Over the past few years, my blood calcium levels have fluctuated widely, often exceeding the upper limit of the normal range, which is 1.33 mmol/L. However, since Kim was arrested by the police on July 24rd, my blood calcium levels have consistently remained within the normal range of 1.15–1.33 mmol/L.</p>

<h3 id="be30">Part 4</h3>



<h3 id="17a1">9) Conversation between Kim and me</h3>



<p>After being detained for 10 days in jail, on the first day of her release, we had a conversation.&nbsp;Below is the content of the conversation:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Don’t you think there’s something you need to tell me?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Aren’t you the one who wants a divorce?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Don’t you think you should apologize first?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Apologize for what?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Don’t you think you owe me an apology?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I don’t want to discuss these things with you. Are you just thinking about divorce?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: It’s not just about divorce anymore.</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: What else is it?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Why did you put something in my water?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I told you it was potassium.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Potassium? Did the police confirm it was potassium? Did they show you the results?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: They did.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: It’s come to this point already, you’ve been detained for two weeks. If you’re honest now, it might reduce your punishment, you know?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: They’re still investigating. If you don’t believe what I say, it doesn’t matter. I can say it’s potassium, but they’ll confirm it. And if they haven’t found out, they wouldn’t let me go.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Do you know, I’ve been struggling it for days. I shouldn’t have told the doctor about this. I should have talked to you privately and spared you from punishment. But now, seeing your attitude, I have no reason to regret. If you continue like this, I won’t say a word in your favor to the police.</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: It’s not about whether you say good things or not. They’ll investigate.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Do you think I was not sure but told my doctor what happened? And you think the doctor wasn’t sure that but reported it to the police? You think the police didn’t have evidence?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I know. But do you know, they said there was vitamin D in the water. I didn’t put any vitamin D in.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Where did you get the potassium? Where did you buy it?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I bought it online.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Can I see the purchase record?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Why should I show it to you?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Then let me ask you a second question. When did you start putting it in?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Around the summer.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Were you worried I didn’t have enough potassium, so you secretly gave it to me without telling me?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I discussed it with you. I asked you if you were lacking in potassium before, and you said you ate bananas. I asked if bananas were enough. I suggested you take some potassium, remember?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: I’ve been taking potassium chloride all along, never stopped.</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: When did you start taking potassium chloride? You never told me, how would I know.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: So you secretly supplemented potassium for me, didn’t you?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: No, I just put potassium in for you.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: You secretly put potassium in for me, why didn’t you tell me?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I told you before, didn’t I? I asked you about it. I said, regarding this matter, I asked you once. You mentioned something about your potassium was low or zinc was low. I asked if your doctor had said anything, and you said your doctor didn’t mention anything. Then you said you should eat bananas or sunflower seeds, and then I told you, I said there’s no point in eating these things. At that time, I…</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Did you secretly buy potassium then?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Then I asked, I said, should you get some sort of supplement or something, and you said you didn’t need it.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: So then you secretly bought potassium for me, to supplement it, right?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: This is undeniable; they can verify it.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: What kind of potassium did you buy? You can’t just buy any kind of potassium element.</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: It’s a potassium supplement, a liquid. I’m not lying to you. They can verify it; I’m not saying that if I tell you now and tell the police it’s potassium, they will check. If there’s no potassium in it, right?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Kim, you’ve disappointed me too much.</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: It’s potassium, I’ve told you, it’s not. Just wait until the police find out, they will investigate.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: I’ve given you a chance before, I hoped we could discuss this privately, resolve this matter, and keep this family going. Now it seems like I’ve overestimated you.</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Can’t you just let them find out? They will investigate. This thing can’t be fabricated out of thin air. It’s not like if I say there’s potassium, there will be.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: What did the police say when they released you today?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: They didn’t say that, they just said I could leave, they released me. Did I run out by myself? I don’t see why you can’t believe this; am I lying to you?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: I believe that. Did the police show you the evidence they had?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: What evidence do you mean? They mentioned that someone said they gave me something, they took some water, and there was some other stuff, what else? They showed me the photos.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Did you ever put anything in my condiments?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I told you I put potassium in, so maybe I did, I put potassium in them. This can’t be faked; they can verify it.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Did you put it in all the condiments?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I don’t remember, I don’t know how many.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Why didn’t you tell me you put it in the condiments?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Same reason, I mentioned it before. Don’t you think we had communication issues before? Did you ever react nicely to what I said?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: So you do good deeds without leaving a trace, don’t you?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: It’s not about doing good deeds without leaving a trace; I just have to do something. And I’m telling you this is nothing; I’m not repeating myself. I said I put potassium in, and I didn’t, if I insist on it, it’s not like saying if I tell them it’s potassium, they will believe it. Do you think the police are stupid? What I say is what it is.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: When do you usually put potassium in for me?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: It varies; I just see.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Do you put it in when I’m not next to the water bottle?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Yes, and I don’t have a specific time for it.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: So when I’m not next to the water bottle, you just put it in?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I have to find an opportunity; I only put it in when you’re not there.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Why put it in when I’m present?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I told you before, you didn’t want it, so I said I’d put it in.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: When it’s time to put in potassium, shouldn’t you tell my doctor? Are you a doctor?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: You’ve been telling me about your low potassium.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Why did you put potassium in for me, and did you ever communicate with my doctor about it?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I asked you. You didn’t want it.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: You didn’t ask me; I didn’t say I didn’t want it.</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: I communicated with you about this.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Whether I need to supplement potassium or not, the doctor knows, I know, but you don’t.</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Because you’ve been telling me about your low potassium. Otherwise, how would I know what you told me, including your low heart rate? How would I know what you’ve told me?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: You’re not being honest; at this moment, you’re still thinking about covering it up. Do you know? The charge is attempted murder, which carries a sentence of 6 to 8 years. If you cooperate, you can get a reduced sentence. With your attitude…</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: It’s not about attitude; it’s about evidence. I can’t fabricate something out of nothing, you know? I’m not fabricating; it’s not like whatever you say will happen.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: You didn’t show the police the evidence of you buying potassium, the purchase records. Didn’t the police ask you to show them? Did you buy it online or at a pharmacy?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Yes, I bought it online.</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: Online, can I see it?</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: Why should you see it?</em><br><strong>Me</strong><em>&nbsp;: You do a good deed, and I thank you.</em><br><strong>Kim</strong><em>: There’s no need for that; my lawyer told me not to give my things to others.</em><br><em>…</em></p>

        <p>A few days into making One Million Checkboxes I thought I’d been hacked. What was <em>that</em> doing in my database?</p>

<p>A few hours later I was tearing up, proud of some brilliant teens.</p>

<p>But let’s back up.</p>

<p><em>Note - I’m trying something new; I’ve also made a <a href="https://youtu.be/OI4DbECnp8A">YouTube video</a> that tells this story. I’m trying to decide whether I’m interested in making videos; check it out if you’d like!</em>
<!-- excerpt-end --></p>
<h2 id="what-was-one-million-checkboxes">What was One Million Checkboxes?</h2>
<p>On June 26th 2024, I <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-14-one-million-checkboxes/">launched a website</a> called One Million Checkboxes (OMCB). It had one million <em>global</em> checkboxes on it - checking (or unchecking) a box changed it for everyone on the site, instantly.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/30mins-activity-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/30mins-activity.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> The site, 30 minutes after launch </p>
    
</div>

<p>My expectations for the site were very low and very wrong. I thought hundreds of players would check thousands of boxes - instead, 500,000 players checked over 650,000,000 boxes in the two weeks that I kept the site online. The site made it into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/style/one-million-checkboxes-game.html">New York Times</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/02/one-million-checkboxes-pointless-fun/">Washington Post</a>; it’s on <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/one-million-checkboxes">Know Your Meme</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Checkboxes">Wikipedia</a>. The whole thing was a wild ride.</p>

<p><a href="https://eieio.games/essays/scaling-one-million-checkboxes/">A separate blog of mine</a> covers the technical details behind OMCB. This blog covers my favorite story from running the site.</p>

<p>But to tell you that story, I need to give you two bits of context.</p>

<h2 id="bit-of-context-1-omcb-made-it-hard-to-draw">Bit of context 1: OMCB made it hard to draw</h2>
<p>I like to make games that help people interact on the internet. Some people are assholes when they interact on the internet. So when I make <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-12-stranger-video/">games</a> like <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-13-talk-paper-scissors/">this</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I try to add constraints to make the average interaction a little more pleasant.</p>

<p>I’ve been around long enough to know what people will draw if you put an unrestricted canvas on the public internet, so for OMCB I wanted to constrain drawing.</p>

<p>To do this I scaled the number of checkboxes in a row to the size of the browser window. Here’s what that looks like in practice:</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/omcb-window-example.gif" alt="The text 'EXAMPLE' is written using checkboxes. The message disappears unless the browser window is fully stretched out.">
</p>
<p>excuse the kerning</p>

<p>Here I’ve written “EXAMPLE” - but you can only see it if the browser is exactly the right width! As soon as the number of checkboxes in a row changes the message disappears.</p>

<p>This meant that if you drew something rude on your phone it wouldn’t show up for me on my laptop and vice-versa: your graffiti was only visible to people with the exact same display as your own. This constraint was particularly nice because it was subtle; you might never realize that your writing wasn’t visible to anyone else on the site!</p>

<p>I got a <em>lot</em> of comments asking for me to “fix” this so that people could draw. But the choice here was very intentional.</p>

<p>I’ve found that the best stories from my stranger-interaction games come from how people work around the constraints that I add.</p>

<p>That was foreshadowing.</p>

<h2 id="bit-of-context-2-how-i-stored-state">Bit of context 2: how I stored state</h2>
<p>OMCB had a million checkboxes on it. One million is a big number! So I wanted to store and transmit my state efficiently.</p>

<p>To do this I said - a checkbox has two valid states. It’s checked or it’s unchecked. That’s like a bit - a bit is either 0 or 1. So I just stored the state for each checkbox as a bit. Bit 3 was “1” if checkbox 3 was checked and “0” otherwise.</p>

<p>That’s a million bits. There are 8 bits in a byte, so that’s 125,000 bytes, which is 125KB - not even the size of an MP3! Totally workable.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/binary-encoding.png" alt="An example of how data was stored. Checked boxes are stored as 1s, unchecked boxes as 0s.">
</p>
<p>checked boxes are 1s, unchecked boxes are 0s</p>

<p>I stored this data in Redis (an easy to use database) and base64-encoded<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> it when transmitting it to clients.</p>

<p>I promise this matters. Let’s get back to the story.</p>

<h2 id="have-i-been-hacked">Have I been hacked?</h2>
<p>A few days after launching OMCB, I rewrote the backend in go (with the help of my friend <a href="https://github.com/EliotHedeman">Eliot</a>) to keep up with the load. And then, for some reason, I dumped an ascii encoding of the raw bytes in my database. I don’t know why - I just did it.</p>

<p>The data I saw looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/catgirls1.png" alt="raw binary data from the OMCB database. The url 'https://catgirls.win/omcb' repeatedly shows up">
</p>
<p>what in the world</p>

<p>And my reaction to the data looked something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/am-i-hacked.png" alt="The same image as above, with 'what the fuck, am I hacked' on it">
</p>
<p>sheer terror</p>

<p>I panicked. There were URLs in my database! There were URLs pointing to <em>catgirls.win</em> in my database!! Something was very very wrong.</p>

<p>I assumed I’d been hacked. I poured over my logs, looking for evidence of an intrusion. I read and re-read my code, searching for how somebody could be stuffing strings into a database that should have just contained 0s and 1s.</p>

<p>I couldn’t find anything. My access logs looked fine. My (very simple) code was ok. My heart rate increased. My girlfriend patiently waited for me to join her for dinner. And then - wait.</p>

<p>Wait!</p>

<p>I saw it.</p>


<p>I looked at the checkboxes that corresponded to the sketchy URLs in my database.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/corresponding.png" alt="An arrow pointing from the 'h' in https://catgirls.win/omcb to the 8 checkboxes on the website that comprise the byte that represents that h">
</p>
<p>the "h" is one byte - 8 bits. 8 checkboxes. those 8 checkboxes</p>
<p>That H - it represented one byte. One byte represented 8 bits. <em>8 bits represented 8 checkboxes.</em></p>

<p>Those chunks of 8 checkboxes formed a repeating pattern that lined up with the URLs. And if I changed something - if I unchecked a box - the pattern immediately reappeared.</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/pattern.gif" alt="A repeating pattern of checkboxes. When the user unchecks some boxes the boxes are immediately re-checked">
</p>
<p>spooky</p>

<p>I hadn’t been hacked.</p>

<p><em>Someone was writing me a message in binary.</em></p>

<h3 id="what-does-that-mean">What does that mean?</h3>
<p>When I dumped my database, redis converted the data to ascii.</p>

<p>To do that, it read the data one byte - 8 bits - at a time. It converted that byte to a number between 0 and 255 (2^8 - 1). And then it checked whether that number was in the printable ascii character range (32 - 127). If it was, it printed out the corresponding character; otherwise it printed the byte’s hex representation (e.g. <code>\x00</code> for <code>0</code>).</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/binary-explanation.png" alt="8 checkboxes and their binary representation. Checkboxes forming the pattern 01101000 represent an h, checkboxes forming the pattern 01110100 represent a t.">
        <img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/asciitable.gif" alt="an ascii table">
</p>
<p>104 represents an 'h' and '116' represents a 't'</p>

<p>So someone was:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Checking boxes</li>
  <li>To flip bits</li>
  <li>To form numbers</li>
  <li>That formed letters</li>
  <li>That spelled out the URL</li>
</ul>

<p>And they were doing it with <em>thousands of other people on the site.</em></p>

<p>I was impressed.</p>

<h2 id="down-the-rabbit-hole">Down the rabbit hole</h2>
<p>So.</p>

<p><code>https://catgirls.win/omcb</code></p>

<p><em>catgirls dot win</em></p>

<p>I hemmed and hawed. I googled around. And then I clicked the link.</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/invite.png" alt="An invite to a discord called 'Checking Boxes'">
</p>
<p>interesting</p>

<p>The link went to a discord! And the discord was called “Checking Boxes”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. I joined the discord.</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/discord-join.png" alt="Discord chat logs. Nolen says 'hi, i made the website.' Someone else says 'WHOA, YES, ITS YOU'">
</p>
<p>saying hello</p>

<p>And someone was really excited to see me! We chatted for a bit. And then they asked me something that blew my mind:</p>

<p>"Have you seen your checkboxes as a 1000x1000 image yet?"</p>

<p>I said no. They showed me what they were up to:</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/og-grid.png" alt="A black and white grid. There is a banner on the grid that spells out 'be gay do crime' as well as a QR code.">
</p>
<p>goodness</p>

<p>They were downloading data for all million checkboxes and rendering them as a 1000x1000 grid (the unchecked boxes are white; the checked boxes are black).</p>

<p>There’s a lot going on here! We’ve got “be gay do crime” - love that - but there’s some interesting technical stuff here too.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/annotated-grid.png" alt="An annotated version of the same grid">
</p>
<p>double goodness</p>

<p>The repeated noise at the bottom is the binary message I found. Above that is a base64 version of the same message - remember that base64 is what I used for transport. And on the left side is a QR code (with full error correction!). All of these messages linked to the discord.</p>

<p>The discord was full of some very sharp teens<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, and they were writing these secret messages to gather other very sharp teens to talk about botting the site. Anyone who was writing a bot would probably be looking at either the base64’d version of the data, the binary version, or the the 1000x1000 image version; they were covering all the bases.</p>

<p>And this worked! The discord grew from under 20 people when I joined to over 60 by the time I shut the site down.</p>

<h2 id="so-whatd-they-do">So what’d they do?</h2>
<p>Well, they drew a whole lot! As they built better systems for drawing (and better reverse-engineered my rate limits<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>) their drawings became more complex.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/drawing-bsod.png" alt="A drawing of a windows blue screen of death on one million checkboxes">
</p>
<p>A windows blue screen of death - pre CrowdStrike incident!</p>

<p>Over time they experimented with animations and even tried out some protocols for adding color - like treating adjacent cells as the red, green, and blue channels of a color and drawing to a smaller grid.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/drawing-fullgrid.gif" alt="Lots of drawings on one million checkboxes, including several of Jake Gyllenhaal">
</p>
<p>The grid at its most chaotic - someone was a Jake Gyllenhaal fan.</p>

<p>I gave the discord a warning before I sunset the site. The night before doing it I removed all my rate limits to see how much traffic the site could handle and what they could do. We ended up with some really cool animations - my favorite was a Rickroll (this clip is not sped up).</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/drawing-rickroll.gif" alt="An animated rickroll drawn on one million checkboxes">

<h2 id="is-botting-good">Is botting good?</h2>
<p>Lots of people were mad about bots on OMCB. I’m not going to link to anything here - I don’t want to direct negative attention at anyone - but I got hundreds of messages about bots. The most popular tweet about OMCB complained about bots. People…did not like bots.</p>

<p>And I get it! The typical ways that folks - especially folks who don’t program - bump into bots are things like ticket scalping and restaurant reservation bots. Bots that feel selfish and unfair and antisocial.</p>

<p>And there certainly was botting that you could call antisocial. Folks wrote tiny javascript boxes to uncheck every box that they could - I know this because they excitedly told me.</p>

</p>
<p>ok!</p>

<p>I expected this - I’m a programmer! - but people told me that it ruined the site for them and I suppose I understand that.</p>

<p>So, sure. This drawing probably degraded the experience for “regular” users - although the botters did have some rules around where to bot, and I would occasionally chime in to ask them to dial things down.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/wapo.png" alt="A message from me asking for folks to tone down botting because OMCB is in the Washington Post">
</p>
<p>debatable how well this worked</p>

<p>So there are some caveats. I understand why people don’t like bots; maybe this wasn’t an unassailable good. But man…</p>

<h2 id="i-found-this-so-moving">I found this so moving!</h2>

<p>In highschool, I wrote a recursive mail rule that sent a friend of mine millions of messages as a joke. I (accidentally!) repeatedly crashed the school’s mail server<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>The adults in my life<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> were largely not mad at me. They asked me to knock it off, but also made me a t-shirt. <em>I don’t think I’d be doing what I do now without the encouragement that I received then.</em></p>

<p>What this discord did was so cool - so surprising - so creative. It reminded me of me - expect they were 10 times the developer I was then (and frankly, better developers than I am now). Getting to watch it live - getting to provide some encouragement, to see what they were doing and respond with praise and pride instead of anger - was deeply meaningful to me. I still tear up when I think about it.</p>

<p>I’m proud to have made something that this discord decided was worth playing with, and I’m even more proud of what they did with it.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what they go on to make.</p>

<p><em>Again - I’ve made my <a href="https://youtu.be/OI4DbECnp8A">first YouTube video</a> to tell this story. Given how emotional I found the whole thing, I thought being able to use my voice would be nice. Check it out if you’re interested!</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id=""><p><em>[D.N.A]</em> Elasticsearch and Kibana can be called Open Source again. It is hard to express how happy this statement makes me. Literally jumping up and down with excitement here. All of us at Elastic are. Open source is in my DNA. It is in Elastic DNA. Being able to call Elasticsearch Open Source again is pure joy.</p><p><em>[LOVE.]</em> The tl;dr is that we will be adding AGPL as another license option next to ELv2 and SSPL in the coming weeks. We never stopped believing and behaving like an open source community after we changed the license. But being able to use the term Open Source, by using AGPL, an OSI approved license, removes any questions, or fud, people might have.</p><p><em>[Not Like Us]</em> We never stopped believing in Open Source at Elastic. I never stopped believing in Open Source. I’m going on 25 years and counting as a true believer. So why the change 3 years ago? We had <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-aws" target="_self">issues with AWS</a> and the market confusion their offering was causing. So after trying all the other options we could think of, we changed the license, knowing it would result in a fork of Elasticsearch with a different name and a different trajectory. It’s a long story.</p><p><em>[Like That]</em> The good news is that while it was painful, it worked. 3 years later, Amazon is fully invested in their fork, the market confusion has been (mostly) resolved, and our partnership with AWS is stronger than ever. We were even named AWS partner of the year. I had always hoped that enough time would pass that we could feel safe to get back to being an Open Source project - and it finally has.</p><p><em>[All The Stars]</em> We want to make the life of our users as simple as possible. We have people that really like ELv2 (a BSD inspired license). We have people that have SSPL approved (through MongoDB using it). Which is why we are simply <strong>adding another option, and not removing anything</strong>. If you already use and enjoy Elasticsearch, please carry on, nothing changed. For others, you now have the option to choose AGPL as well.</p><p><em>[LOYALTY.]</em> We chose AGPL, vs another license, because we hope our work with OSI will help to have more options in the Open Source licensing world. And it seems like another OSI approved license will rhyme with SSPL and/or AGPL. Heck, maybe AGPL is enough for infrastructure software like us with how things have progressed since we had to change the license (for example, Grafana who moved to it from Apache2). We are committed to figure it out.</p><p><em>[euphoria]</em> I am so happy to be able to call Elasticsearch Open Source again.</p><p><em>[Alright]</em> With any change, there can be confusion, and, of course, there can be trolls. (Aren’t there always trolls?) Let’s have some fun and try to answer some of these.. Here are some I can imagine, but let’s keep adding to this.</p><ul><li>“Changing the license was a mistake, and Elastic now backtracks from it”. We removed a lot of market confusion when we changed our license 3 years ago. And because of our actions, a lot has changed. It’s an entirely different landscape now. We aren’t living in the past. We want to build a better future for our users. It’s because we took action then, that we are in a position to take action now.</li><li>“AGPL is not true open source, license X is”: AGPL is an OSI approved license, and it's a widely adopted one. For example, MongoDB used to be AGPL and Grafana is AGPL. It shows that AGPL doesn’t affect usage or popularity. We chose AGPL because we believe it’s the best way to start to pave a path, with OSI, towards more Open Source in the world, not less.</li><li>“Elastic changes the license because they are not doing well” - I will start by saying that I am as excited today as ever about the future of Elastic. I am tremendously proud of our products and our team's execution. We shipped Stateless Elasticsearch, ES|QL, and tons of vector database/hybrid search improvements for GenAI use cases. We are leaning heavily into OTel in logging and Observability. And our SIEM product in Security keeps adding amazing features and it's one of the fastest growing in the market. Users' response has been humbling. The stock market will have its ups and downs. What I can assure you, is that we are always thinking long term, and this change is part of it.</li></ul><p>If we see more, we will add them above to hopefully reduce confusion.</p><p><em>[HUMBLE.]</em> It’s so exciting to build for the future. Elasticsearch is back to being Open Source. Yay! What a wonderful thing to say. What a wonderful day.</p><p>Forever :elasticheart: <img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt55b1ec79ff67529a/66d0cd939d291d1b0fcd8171/elasticheart.svg" alt="elasticheart.svg" height="24" width="24"> Open Source<br>Shay</p></div></div>]]></description>
