<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is part 1 of a blog mini-series, in which we explore the full-text search functionality in PostgreSQL and investigate how much of the typical search engine functionality we can replicate. In part 2, we'll do a comparison between PostgreSQL's full-text search and Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along and try out the sample queries (which we recommend; it's more fun that way), the code samples are executed against the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots">Wikipedia Movie Plots</a> data set from Kaggle. To import it, download the CSV file, then create this table:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> </span><span>movies</span><span>(</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	ReleaseYear </span><span>int</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Title </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Origin </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Director </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Casting </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Genre </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	WikiPage </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Plot </span><span>text</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And import the CSV file like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>\</span><span>COPY</span><span> movies(ReleaseYear, Title, Origin, Director, Casting, Genre, WikiPage, Plot)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>FROM</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>wiki_movie_plots_deduped.csv</span><span>'</span><span> DELIMITER </span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span> CSV HEADER;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The dataset contains 34,000 movie titles and is about 81 MB in CSV format.</p>

<p>The Postgres approach to full-text search offers building blocks that you can combine to create your own search engine. This is quite flexible but it also means it generally feels lower-level compared to search engines like Elasticsearch, Typesense, or Mellisearch, for which full-text search is the primary use case.</p>
<p>The main building blocks, which we'll cover via examples, are:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>The <code>tsvector</code> and <code>tsquery</code> data types</li><li>The match operator <code>@@</code> to check if a <code>tsquery</code> matches a <code>tsvector</code></li><li>Functions to rank each match (<code>ts_rank</code>, <code>ts_rank_cd</code>)</li><li>The GIN index type, an inverted index to efficiently query <code>tsvector</code></li></ul>
<p>We'll start by looking at these building blocks and then we'll get into more advanced topics, covering relevancy boosters, typo-tolerance, and faceted search.</p>

<p>The <code>tsvector</code> data type stores a sorted list of <em>lexemes</em>. A <em>lexeme</em> is a string, just like a token, but it has been <em>normalized</em> so that different forms of the same word are made. For example, normalization almost always includes folding upper-case letters to lower-case, and often involves removal of suffixes (such as <code>s</code> or <code>ing</code> in English). Here is an example, using the <code>to_tsvector</code> function to parse an English phrase into a <code>tsvector</code>.</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> unnest(to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>'</span><span>I</span><span>''</span><span>m going to make him an offer he can</span><span>''</span><span>t refuse. Refusing is not an option.</span><span>'</span><span>));</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span> lexeme | positions | weights</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------+-----------+---------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>go</span><span>     | {</span><span>3</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> m      | {</span><span>2</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> make   | {</span><span>5</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> offer  | {</span><span>8</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>option</span><span> | {</span><span>17</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> refus  | {</span><span>12</span><span>,</span><span>13</span><span>}   | {D,D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>6</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, stop words like “I”, “to” or “an” are removed, because they are too common to be useful for search. The words are normalized and reduced to their root (e.g. “refuse” and “Refusing” are both transformed into “refus”). The punctuation signs are ignored. For each word, the <strong>positions</strong> in the original phrase are recorded (e.g. “refus” is the 12th and the 13th word in the text) and the <strong>weights</strong> (which are useful for ranking and we'll discuss later).</p>
<p>In the example above, the transformation rules from words to <em>lexemes</em> are based on the <code>english</code> search configuration. Running the same query with the <code>simple</code> search configuration results in a <code>tsvector</code> that includes all the words as they were found in the text:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> unnest(to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>'</span><span>I</span><span>''</span><span>m going to make him an offer he can</span><span>''</span><span>t refuse. Refusing is not an option.</span><span>'</span><span>));</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>  lexeme  | positions | weights</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------+-----------+---------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> an       | {</span><span>7</span><span>,</span><span>16</span><span>}    | {D,D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> can      | {</span><span>10</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> going    | {</span><span>3</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> he       | {</span><span>9</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> him      | {</span><span>6</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> i        | {</span><span>1</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>is</span><span>       | {</span><span>14</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> m        | {</span><span>2</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> make     | {</span><span>5</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>not</span><span>      | {</span><span>15</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> offer    | {</span><span>8</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>option</span><span>   | {</span><span>17</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> refuse   | {</span><span>12</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> refusing | {</span><span>13</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> t        | {</span><span>11</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>to</span><span>       | {</span><span>4</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>16</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, “refuse” and “refusing” now result in different lexemes. The <code>simple</code> configuration is particularly useful when you have columns that contain labels or tags.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL has built-in configurations for a pretty good set of languages. You can see the list by running:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> cfgname </span><span>FROM</span><span> pg_ts_config;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notably, however, there is no configuration for CJK (Chinese-Japanese-Korean), which is worth keeping in mind if you need to create a search query in those languages. While the <code>simple</code> configuration should work in practice quite well for unsupported languages, I'm not sure if that is enough for CJK.</p>

<p>The <code>tsquery</code> data type is used to represent a normalized query. A <code>tsquery</code> contains search terms, which must be already-normalized lexemes, and may combine multiple terms using AND, OR, NOT, and FOLLOWED BY operators. There are functions like <code>to_tsquery</code>, <code>plainto_tsquery</code>, and <code>websearch_to_tsquery</code> that are helpful in converting user-written text into a proper <code>tsquery</code>, primarily by normalizing words appearing in the text.</p>
<p>To get a feeling of <code>tsquery</code>, let's see a few examples using <code>websearch_to_tsquery</code>:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>the dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> &amp; </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That is a logical AND, meaning that the document needs to contain both “quick” and “dog” in order to match. You can do logical OR as well:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>quick OR dog</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> | </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And you can exclude words:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader -wars</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>---------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> &amp; </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span><span> &amp; !</span><span>'</span><span>war</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Also, you can represent phrase searches:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>"the dark vader son"</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>     websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>------------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>son</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This means: “dark”, followed by “vader”, followed by “son”.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the “the” word is ignored, because it's a stop word as per the <code>english</code> search configuration. This can be an issue on phrases like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>"do or do not, there is no try"</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>tri</span><span>'</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>row</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Oops, almost the entire phrase was lost. Using the <code>simple</code> config gives the expected result:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>"do or do not, there is no try"</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>                           websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>do</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>or</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>do</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>not</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>there</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>is</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>no</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>try</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can check whether a <code>tsquery</code> matches a <code>tsvector</code> by using the match operator <code>@@</code>.</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>) @@</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>		</span><span>'</span><span>Dark Vader is my father.</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>?column?</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> t</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>While the following example doesn't match:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader -father</span><span>'</span><span>) @@</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>		</span><span>'</span><span>Dark Vader is my father.</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>?column?</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> f</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now that we've seen <code>tsvector</code> and <code>tsquery</code> at work, let's look at another key building block: the GIN index type is what makes it fast. GIN stands for <em>Generalized Inverted Index.</em> GIN is designed for handling cases where the items to be indexed are composite values, and the queries to be handled by the index need to search for element values that appear within the composite items. This means that GIN can be used for more than just text search, notably for JSON querying.</p>
<p>You can create a GIN index on a set of columns, or you can first create a column of type <code>tsvector</code>, to include all the searchable columns. Something like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> movies </span><span>ADD</span><span> search tsvector </span><span>GENERATED</span><span> </span><span>ALWAYS</span><span> </span><span>AS</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	(to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, Title) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, Plot) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Director) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	 to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Genre) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Origin) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Casting)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>) STORED;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then create the actual index:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>INDEX</span><span> </span><span>idx_search</span><span> </span><span>ON</span><span> movies </span><span>USING</span><span> GIN(search);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can now perform a simple test search like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>                        title</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------------------------------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (aka Star Wars)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>Return</span><span> of the Jedi</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>3</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>To see the effects of the index, you can compare the timings of the above query with and without the index. The GIN index takes it from over 200 ms to about 4 ms on my computer.</p>

<p>So far, we've seen how <code>ts_vector</code> and <code>ts_query</code> can match search queries. However, for a good search experience, it is important to show the best results first - meaning that the results need to be sorted by <em>relevancy</em>.</p>
<p>Taking it directly from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-RANKING">docs</a>:</p>

<p>The two ranking functions mentioned are <code>ts_rank</code> and <code>ts_rank_cd</code>. The difference between them is that while they both take into account the frequency of the term, <code>ts_rank_cd</code> also takes into account the proximity of matching lexemes to each other.</p>
<p>To use them in a query, you can do something like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>       ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>)) rank</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> rank </span><span>DESC</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span> title                                            |    rank</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------------------------------------------------+------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>Return</span><span> of the Jedi                               | </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>21563873</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith     | </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>12592985</span></span>

<p>One thing to note about <code>ts_rank</code> is that it needs to access the <code>search</code> column for each result. This means that if the <code>WHERE</code> condition matches a lot of rows, PostgreSQL needs to visit them all in order to do the ranking, and that can be slow. To exemplify, the above query returns in 5-7 ms on my computer. If I modify the query to do search for <code>dark OR vader</code>, it returns in about 80 ms, because there are now over 1000 matching result that need ranking and sorting.</p>
<h2 id="Relevancy-tuning">Relevancy tuning</h2>
<p>While relevancy based on word frequency is a good default for the search sorting, quite often the data contains important indicators that are more relevant than simply the frequency.</p>
<p>Here are some examples for a movies dataset:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>Matches in the title should be given higher importance than matches in the description or plot.</li><li>More popular movies can be promoted based on ratings and/or the number of votes they receive.</li><li>Certain categories can be boosted more, considering user preferences. For instance, if a particular user enjoys comedies, those movies can be given a higher priority.</li><li>When ranking search results, newer titles can be considered more relevant than very old titles.</li></ul>
<p>This is why dedicated search engines typically offer ways to use different columns or fields to influence the ranking. Here are example tuning guides from <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/relevance-tuning-guide.html">Elastic</a>, <a href="https://typesense.org/docs/guide/ranking-and-relevance.html">Typesense</a>, and <a href="https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/core_concepts/relevancy">Meilisearch</a>.</p>
<p>If you want a visual demo of the impact of relevancy tuning, here is a quick 4 minutes video about it:</p>

<p>While Postgres doesn't have direct support for boosting based on other columns, the rank is ultimately just a sort expression, so you can add your own signals to it.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to add a boost for the number of votes, you can do something like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>))</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>-- numeric booster example</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>log</span><span>(NumberOfVotes)</span><span>*</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>01</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> rank </span><span>DESC</span><span> </span><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The logarithm is there to smoothen the impact, and the 0.01 factor brings the booster to a comparable scale with the ranking score.</p>
<p>You can also design more complex boosters, for example, boost by the rating, but only if the ranking has a certain number of votes. To do this, you can create a function like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>create</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>numericBooster</span><span>(rating </span><span>numeric</span><span>, votes </span><span>numeric</span><span>, voteThreshold </span><span>numeric</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>returns</span><span> </span><span>numeric</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> $$</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>		</span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span> votes </span><span>&lt;</span><span> voteThreshold </span><span>then</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> rating </span><span>end</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>$$ </span><span>language</span><span> </span><span>sql</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And use it like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>))</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>-- numeric booster example</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>+</span><span> numericBooster(Rating, NumberOfVotes, </span><span>100</span><span>)</span><span>*</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>005</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> rank </span><span>DESC</span><span> </span><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's take another example. Say we want to boost the ranking of comedies. You can create a <code>valueBooster</code> function that looks like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>create</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>valueBooster</span><span> (col </span><span>text</span><span>, val </span><span>text</span><span>, factor </span><span>integer</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>returns</span><span> </span><span>integer</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> $$</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>		</span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span> col </span><span>=</span><span> val </span><span>then</span><span> factor </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>$$ </span><span>language</span><span> </span><span>sql</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function returns a factor if the column matches a particular value and 0 instead. Use it in a query like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title, genre,</span></span>

<p>Remember when we talked about the <code>tsvector</code> lexemes and that they can have weights attached? Postgres supports 4 weights, named A, B, C, and D. A is the biggest weight while D is the lowest and the default. You can control the weights via the <code>setweight</code> function which you would typically call when building the <code>tsvector</code> column:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> movies </span><span>ADD</span><span> search tsvector </span><span>GENERATED</span><span> </span><span>ALWAYS</span><span> </span><span>AS</span></span>

<p>Note how the movie titles with “jedi” in their name have jumped to the top of the list, and their rank has increased.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that having only four weight “classes” is somewhat limiting, and that they need to be applied when computing the <code>tsvector</code>.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL doesn't support fuzzy search or typo-tolerance directly, when using <code>tsvector</code> and <code>tsquery</code>. However, working on the assumptions that the typo is in the query part, we can implement the following idea:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>index all <em>lexemes</em> from the content in a separate table</li><li>for each word in the query, use similarity or Levenshtein distance to search in this table</li><li>modify the query to include any words that are found</li><li>perform the search</li></ul>
<p>Here is how it works. First, use <code>ts_stats</code> to get all words in a materialized view:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> MATERLIAZED VIEW unique_lexeme </span><span>AS</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>SELECT</span><span> word </span><span>FROM</span><span> ts_stat(</span><span>'</span><span>SELECT search FROM movies</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, for each word in the query, check if it is in the <code>unique_lexeme</code> view. If it's not, do a fuzzy-search in that view to find possible misspellings of it:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> unique_lexeme</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>WHERE</span><span> levenshtein_less_equal(word, </span><span>'</span><span>pregant</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>) </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>   word</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> premant</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> pregrant</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> pregnant</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> paegant</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> because that's what search engines like Elasticsearch use for fuzzy search.</p>
<p>Once you have the candidate list of words, you need to adjust the query include them all.</p>

<p>Faceted search is popular especially on e-commerce sites because it helps customers to iteratively narrow their search. Here is an example from amazon.com:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://xata.io/mdx/blog/amazon_faceted_search.png"><img alt="Faceted search on Amazon" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></a></p><p><figcaption>Faceted search on Amazon</figcaption></p></div>
<p>The above can implemented by manually defining categories and then adding them as <code>WHERE</code> conditions to the search. Another approach is to create the categories algorithmically based on the existing data. For example, you can use the following to create a “Decade” facet:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> ReleaseYear</span><span>/</span><span>10</span><span>*</span><span>10</span><span> decade, </span><span>count</span><span>(Title) cnt </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>star wars</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>GROUP BY</span><span> decade </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> cnt </span><span>DESC</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>decade | cnt</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------+-----</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>2000</span><span> |  </span><span>39</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>2010</span><span> |  </span><span>31</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1990</span><span> |  </span><span>29</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1950</span><span> |  </span><span>28</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1940</span><span> |  </span><span>26</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1980</span><span> |  </span><span>22</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1930</span><span> |  </span><span>13</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1960</span><span> |  </span><span>11</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1970</span><span> |   </span><span>7</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1910</span><span> |   </span><span>3</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1920</span><span> |   </span><span>3</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>11</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This also provides counts of matches for each decade, which you can display in brackets.</p>
<p>If you want to get multiple facets in a single query, you can combine them, for example, by using CTEs:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>WITH</span><span> releaseYearFacets </span><span>AS</span><span> (</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>star wars</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>GROUP BY</span><span> val </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> cnt </span><span>DESC</span><span>),</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>genreFacets </span><span>AS</span><span> (</span></span>

<p>The above should work quite well on small to medium data sets, however it can become slow on very large data sets.</p>

<p>We've seen the PostgreSQL full-text search primitives, and how we can combine them to create a pretty advanced full-text search engine, which also happens to support things like joins and ACID transactions. In other words, it has functionality that the other search engines typically don't have.</p>
<p>There are more advanced search topics that would be worth covering in detail:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>suggesters / auto-complete</li><li>exact phrase matching</li><li>hybrid search (semantic + keyword) by combining with pg-vector</li></ul>
<p>Each of these would be worth their own blog post (coming!), but by now you should have an intuitive feeling about them: they are quite possible using PostgreSQL, but they require you to do the work of combining the primitives and in some cases the performance might suffer on very large datasets.</p>
<p>In part 2, we'll make a detailed comparison with Elasticsearch, looking to answer the question on when is it worth it to implement search into PostgreSQL versus adding Elasticsearch to your infrastructure and syncing the data.

Our goal is to clear the obstacles for crafters to do their best work and be rewarded for it.</p><p><strong>I’ve worked at many companies where the career ladders always seem to require product managers to become people managers. It’s always like, “If you want to be a director, you need to manage X+ people.” What are your thoughts on this?</strong></p><p>I think traditional career ladders are broken - they just don’t work.</p><p>At Shopify, we have a management track and a crafter track. What this means is you don’t need to manage more people to get promoted and make more money.</p><p>I think this dual track approach is incredibly empowering for crafters. Is managing more people a hard job? Sure. But so is being an individual contributor (IC) leading an open-source project that impacts our entire code base. It’s just a different kind of complexity.</p><p><strong>It’s a copout the complexity is only associated with managing more people.</strong></p><p>I was talking to a Chief Product Officer who decided to return to a being an individual contributor. He told me that what he really loved is just working with engineers and customers. It’s ok to admit this to yourself.</p><p><strong>As companies scale, optics start playing a larger role. People start spending more time on internal docs than actually talking to customers. How do you prevent this from happening at Shopify?</strong></p><p>At Shopify, we rage against becoming a big bureaucratic company.</p><p>In most product reviews, product managers spend way too much time preparing the perfect presentation for execs. </p><p>At Shopify, our approach to product reviews is different. We want to see how the product actually works by playing with the demo or diving into the code. </p><p><strong>No one ever asks in as Shopify product review: “What’s the strategy of this?” Strategy is the least meaningful aspect of whether a product is great or not.</strong></p><p>We want our PMs to be extremely user-focused, to take full ownership over problems, and to have a high tolerance for risk.</p><p>If these attributes aren't present, product managers tend to become "keepers of strategy.” You end up with smart, highly credentialed individuals spending all their time writing strategy memos to increase their team size so that they can write even more strategy memos.</p><p>At Shopify, our primary job is to build products, not career ladders. Therefore, we focus on the actual product that’s shipping during reviews, not the strategy behind it.</p><p><strong>I love that. Many PMs have this grand vision and strategy but end up just shipping the MVP and moving onto something else.</strong></p><p>Yes, many people misunderstand how great products are built.</p><p>They think that a great product comes from a strategy document, but that’s not true. </p><p><strong>Great products are built through continuous tinkering and adjustments. Every product that we love has been built this way.</strong></p><p>At Shopify, staying in touch with the customer is a crucial aspect of the PM role. We do this in a few ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>We remove internal hoops to talk to customers.</strong><span> Anyone can do it. In fact, it's part of the job. I talk to customers everyday.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We become the customer. </strong><span>Many Shopify PMs (including myself and Tobi) have stores. This lets us experience the customer’s pain and struggles directly.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We encourage everyone to be a customer service representative. </strong><span>Getting this experience, even for just a few days, gives people much more insight into customer needs.</span></p></li></ol><p>Our customers are independent business owners. In many ways, they’re similar to us. They’re builders who want to focus on craftsmanship.</p><p>That’s why we love hiring former founders as employees. Even those at Shopify who aren't founders have a founder mentality.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png" width="1016" height="579" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:579,&quot;width&quot;:1016,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:312323,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Tobi (Shopify CEO) co-founded Shopify after getting frustrated by how difficult it was to set up his online snowboarding store</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>I also enjoy working with founders vs. corporate types. I think founders just have a deep urgency to bring value to the customer and to the business.</strong></p><p>Yes, it’s hard to imagine what Shopify would look like if it were run by corporate types. It probably won’t exist to be honest.</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on measuring progress using metrics and OKRs?</strong></p><p>We don’t over-index on OKRs. Many important things can’t be measured and not everything that can be measured is important.</p><p>If you focus too much on turning 1 into 1.1, you risk neglecting things that actually matter. Instead, we’re a company of crafters who focus on tinkering and continuous feedback loops. </p><p><strong>Many companies spend a lot of time deciding if they're measuring the right thing. We prefer to focus on building the right thing.</strong></p><p>That's not to say there isn't a role for measurement. Measurement is crucial for making sure that you're doing the right thing. However, building products isn’t the same as being a stock broker. They’re different jobs. </p><p>Bottom line:</p><p><strong>Building great products is a matter of having taste and knowing when your product will resonate with customers.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, this is why there are so few good product managers. I can't teach taste or the kind of extreme ownership over problems that we require, nor can I teach customer empathy. I can help fine-tune these skills, but my job is to select people who already possess these qualities.</p><p>If you’re enjoying this post, please fill out this 1-minute survey about the newsletter:</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://forms.gle/46v611Xcu5qtC5xr8&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Fill out a 1-min reader survey&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://forms.gle/46v611Xcu5qtC5xr8" rel=""><span>Fill out a 1-min reader survey</span></a></p><p><strong>In early 2023, Shopify initiated operation “Chaos Monkey” to:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Cancel all meetings with 3+ people&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Reinstate “no meeting Wednesdays”</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove needless Slack channels</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>Can you share why the exec team decided to do this?</strong></p><p>It started during Christmas break 2022 when Tobi and I had a conversation.</p><p>The fact is, nobody joined Shopify to spend all day sitting in meetings.

We simply had a conversation, wrote the code, and implemented it. </p><p><strong>How do you prevent meeting bloat from creeping in over time?</strong></p><p>After we unleashed Chaos Monkey, we knew that we would have to keep pushing the boundaries to keep unnecessary meetings off the calendar. </p><p>Today, we are releasing the Shopify Cost Calculator as an internal tool for all Shopify employees.

But that’s the thing:</p><p><strong>A meeting is a bug that some other process didn’t work out.</strong></p><p>When an ad hoc meeting happens, we try to understand why written exchanges didn't work to make improvements.</p><p><strong>How can folks reading this protect their time to focus on their craft? Can they just say no to meetings?</strong></p><p>I think it’s hard because most companies are structured to serve managers. </p><p>Even the physical office reflects this. The top floors are often reserved for managers. At Shopify, we follow an inverted organizational chart where the lowest level is the CEO, reflecting our commitment to servant leadership. </p><p><span>For those who want to focus on their craft, my advice is to just </span><a href="https://www.shopify.com/careers" rel="">apply to Shopify.</a></p><p><strong>I find that a company’s culture frequently starts to erode as the company gets larger. </strong></p><p>You have to fight everyday to keep the culture alive. At Shopify, we focus on 3 areas:</p><ol><li><p><strong>We frequently ask “Why?” </strong><span>We question every process to understand if it still needs to exist. Often, companies adopt best practices like OKRs without second thought. We don’t like doing something blinding just because it’s the status quo.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We hire people who like risk. </strong><span>Like I said before, we like hiring founders as employees. We try to avoid hiring people who want to minimize risk by adopting industry best practices blindly. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>We focus on the mission. </strong><span>We want to be the all-in-one commerce platform for people to start and grow businesses. We try to avoid getting distracted by other side quests. </span></p></li></ol><p><strong>I think the last point is particularly important. Many companies claim to be mission focused but always get distracted by the latest trend.</strong></p><p>Yes.

</figure><p>The first genome-wide hunt to find genetic risk factors for long COVID has yielded a hit: a DNA sequence near a gene called <i>FOXP4</i>, which is active in the lungs and in some immune cells.</p><p>The study, which was released as a preprint on 1 July<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, used data collected from 6,450 people with long COVID across 16 countries. Researchers hope that this analysis will be just the beginning: a vast amount of data are required to unpick a disorder as complex as long COVID, which has been associated with more than 200 symptoms, including severe fatigue, nerve pain and difficulties with concentration and memory.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>“It’s very important that this type of study is being done,” says Chris Ponting, who studies medical bioinformatics at the University of Edinburgh, UK. “It will gain momentum and greater power as the case number increases.”</p><p>Such studies are early steps towards learning more about the causes of long COVID, says Stéphanie Longet, an immunologist at Jean Monnet University in Saint-Étienne, France, who has long COVID. “There are several key topics which are essential for patients, including treatments and prevention,” she says. “When causes, maybe multifactorial, [are] clearly understood, it will help to treat patients who will be more susceptible to develop long COVID and potentially prevent long COVID.”</p><h2>Susceptibility genes</h2><p>For more than three years, the global COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative has been searching for DNA sequences that are associated with a risk of developing severe COVID-19. That hunt, which is ongoing, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01655-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01655-0" data-track-category="body text link">has implicated genes involved in the immune system</a> and in allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter cells<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>.</p><p>The long-COVID study is a spin-off from that effort, says Hugo Zeberg, a geneticist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and a lead author on the preprint. To study the condition, the team compiled data from 24 studies involving a total of nearly 6,500 people diagnosed with long COVID, as well as more than a million other participants who served as controls.</p><article data-label="Related">

Why studies give different answers</p></a>
 </article><p>In one analysis that combined data from 11 of those studies, researchers found a particular region of the genome that was associated with about 1.6-fold higher odds of developing long COVID. That segment of DNA is near a gene called <i>FOXP4</i>, which is active in the lungs and other organs. The variant linked to long COVID is also associated with higher expression of <i>FOXP4</i> in lung cells.</p><p>Previous research has linked the same gene to an increased risk of severe COVID-19, and Zeberg and his colleagues found that it is also associated with lung cancer. Although having severe COVID-19 increases the risk of developing long COVID, the team found that the contribution of the DNA variant to long-COVID risk was too large to be explained by its link to severe COVID-19 alone. “This variant has a much stronger impact on long COVID than its impact on severity,” says Zeberg.</p><p>Replicating that finding in other data sets would help to strengthen the study’s conclusions, says Zhongshan Cheng, a bioinformatician at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Much of the data used in the long-COVID analysis was also used in the analysis that found a link between <i>FOX4P</i> and severe COVID-19, he notes. Fresh data would help to rule out the possibility that other factors, such as lung cancer, could have influenced the apparent association with <i>FOX4P</i>.</p><h2>More to come</h2><p>Even so, the study is a breakthrough, Cheng says, and future studies will probably add to the list of genetic risk factors for long COVID.</p><p>“It won’t just be a single answer, there will be a whole variety of people’s vulnerabilities contributing to why they haven’t recovered from COVID,” says Ponting. He and his colleagues proposed a study that would have included DNA from 15,000 people with long COVID. But grant reviewers rejected the proposal, he says, because they thought the condition too complex to be dissected in the way Ponting's team suggested.</p><p>“I disagree,” he says. “It is very complicated, but also very important to pick apart. The health and socio-economic costs of long COVID are enormous.”</p>

Something seems broken. You’re frustrated — and you have no idea how to fix it. </p><p> In times like these, I like to step back and ask a question: </p><p><b>“What problem do I actually have?”</b></p><p> Because here’s the thing: When we can’t find a solution, it’s often because we’re trying to solve the wrong problem. </p><p> In this newsletter, I’ll help you find the problem you <span><i>actually</i></span> have — by distilling it down to one simple word. Then we can find a solution that <span>actually</span> works. </p><p><h2><span><b>Let’s start with an example.</b></span></h2></p><p> A young professional recently came to me with a problem. He works at an advertising agency, and his ideas are always getting shot down. He’s frustrated, demoralized, and can’t figure out what’s wrong. </p><p> “Should I just start executing my ideas without asking permission?” he asked me. </p><p> This would be an act of desperation, but he sees no other choice. He believes in his ideas. Nobody’s giving him a chance. So maybe he just… spends some time and money, and proves himself that way? </p><p> To which I said: <span><i>Hold up there.</i></span></p><p> The problem is, he doesn’t actually know what problem he has. Which means he can’t find the right solution. </p><p> And that’s the most common problem of all. </p><p><h2><span><b>We can find your problem.</b></span></h2></p><p> Have you ever gone to a physical therapist? It’s a fascinating experience. </p><p> You go in complaining about your shoulder, and after a little while, the PT says: “Oh, the problem is actually your lower back, which is forcing you to stand this way, and then you’re compensating with your neck, which is being felt in your shoulder.” </p><p> Fix the lower back, and your shoulder pain goes away. Or something like that — I’m not a physical therapist! (Also, <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.yedoKneSQBFy1PjJDJ1KYZuGSApb5CAkTCe3c3lhY9U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">lol this</a>.) </p><p> The point is, our work and life problems function similarly. </p><p> Problems feel big and abstract, and they radiate outward. We spend a lot of time trying to solve for the <span><i>symptom</i></span> of the problem, rather than locating the actual problem itself. </p><p> So, how can we actually find the source? </p><p><h2><span><b>You need a “one-word problem.”</b></span></h2></p><p> Consider this: What if your problem is actually very small? </p><p> That’s not to say it’s simple or unimportant. It’s just to say, it’s specific. The problem is <span><i>this thing</i></span>, not <span><i>everything</i></span>. </p><p> And how do we find that? By focusing. Your goal is to distill your problem down to a simple, single word — so small it can fit inside a Mad Libs-style sentence like this: </p><p><span><b>“I don’t have a ______ problem. I actually have a ______ problem.”</b></span></p><p> And how do you do <i><span>that</span></i>? </p><p> Let’s go back to the young man at the advertising agency. </p><p> Nobody accepts his ideas — so right now, we might say he has an “acceptance problem.” That’s a big, abstract problem that’s hard to solve. </p><p> But also, he’s never tested whether that’s his <span><i>actual</i></span> problem. </p><p> So, it’s time for: </p><p><b>Step #1: Create some hypotheses.</b>&nbsp; </p><p> Break out all the potential problems you’re facing — write down any realistic, untested possible version of your problem. For example, I presented the advertising guy with a few. </p><p> What if, instead of having an acceptance problem, he really has a… </p><div><ul><li><p><span><b>Ideas problem: </b></span>He thinks his ideas are good, but they are bad. </p></li><li><p><span><b>Seniority problem: </b></span>His team doesn’t value junior people’s ideas. </p></li><li><p><span><b>Vibe problem: </b></span>He’s part of a team that doesn’t value his type of ideas. </p></li><li><p><span><b>Communication problem: </b></span>His ideas are good, but he’s bad at communicating them. </p></li><li><p><span><b>Collaboration problem: </b></span>He’s going it alone, while his colleagues collaborate to get more buy-in from the team. </p></li></ul></div><p> So, there are six possible problems. Write them all down, I said. </p><p><b>Step #2: Experiment!</b>&nbsp; </p><p> Run tests to see which problem you actually have. Because each one-word problem comes with its own solution. </p><p> Some are easy to test. For example, with the ad guy: The seniority problem is easily testable. He can think back — are other junior members of the team being rejected, or are their ideas getting through? </p><p> But many will require effort. The communication problem is a big one. Maybe his ideas are great but also complicated — so when he describes them in meetings, nobody understands him. What can he do instead? Make sketches? Quick mock-ups? He should test this out. </p><p> Perhaps this sounds exhausting. But it should sound liberating. Because before, this advertising guy only saw the symptom of a problem and had one high-risk solution in mind — and that was to spend time and money executing ideas without permission, and probably pissing off his boss. </p><p> But now he has a <i><span>lot</span></i> of potential solutions. And one day, he can finally fill out the Mad Libs: </p><p><span><b>“I don’t have an </b></span><span><span><b>acceptance</b></span></span><span><b> problem. I actually have a </b></span><span><span><b>communication</b></span></span><span><b> problem.”</b></span></p><p> Along the way, of course, he (and you!) should also ask others for input. He could approach his boss and say: “Hey, I’m having trouble getting my ideas through, and I came up with a couple of potential solutions. What do you think about these?” That’ll start a helpful conversation. </p><p><h2><span><b>Now, apply this thinking everywhere.</b></span></h2></p><div><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/36d64f59-f89e-4a76-8e45-ec079a4c34f8/DALL_E_2023-07-08_08.36.01_-_one-line_drawing_of_person_looking_down_at_a_giant_tumbleweed2.png"></p><p><small><p>Made with DALL-E 2</p></small></p></div><p> Are you in a struggling relationship? Step back and ask: “Do I have a relationship problem, or a…” </p><p> Now what is it? Communication problem? Lifestyle problem? Jealousy problem? Something else? Maybe there’s something specific to solve for, without having to blow up the entire relationship. </p><p> Are you unhappy at work? Step back and ask: “Do I have a job problem, or a…” </p><p> Now what is it? Manager problem? Responsibilities problem? And so on. </p><p> I remember once interviewing Jason Robins, the founder of DraftKings, about an existential problem his company faced: Multiple states were threatening to change their gambling laws, which would have put DraftKings out of business. </p><p> This seemed like an existential problem. But how do you solve for that!? So he stepped back and basically asked: <span><i>What problem do I actually have?</i></span></p><p> “It's really no different than figuring out how to build a product that people want,” <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbnRyZXByZW5ldXIuY29tL2dyb3dpbmctYS1idXNpbmVzcy9ob3ctZHJhZnRraW5ncy1zdXJ2aXZlZC1hbmQtbWFkZS1kYWlseS1mYW50YXN5LXNwb3J0cy1sZWdhbC8zMDAxMjg_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1qYXNvbmZlaWZlci5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1ob3ctdG8tc29sdmUteW91ci1iaWctcHJvYmxlbXMtYnktc29sdmluZy15b3VyLXJlYWwtcHJvYmxlbSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiIwNWI1ZjRhNC02NzQwLTQyZmUtOTk4MC02Nzg2YzcyMzczOWUiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6IjQwY2ZjOTgzLWE5OWYtNGNlNy05YzUzLTExNTg5NjRmZGU5ZSIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiMmZmZWM0MTAtYzVmNS00YjExLWEwMGEtNzBlMDc3MmFhZmQzIiwiaWF0IjoxNjg5MTc3NjA1LjkzMSwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.0MPlbB6TwKlGvG7cobgQG5jXvJkRa965pIkBYMM9SPQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">he told me</a>. “It was: <span><i>This is the problem we've got to solve</i></span>. And all of a sudden, you know what you’re doing.” </p><p> In DraftKing’s case, Robins realized he had a <i>relationships problem</i>. DraftKings had no relationships with lawmakers, which meant no open dialog or opportunity to create common ground. So they invested in lobbyists, started meeting with local officials, and ultimately helped craft laws that made lawmakers happy but kept DraftKings in business. </p><p> Your problems are real. They are hard. They drain your time and energy. But they are not everything, and they are not everywhere. They are contained. Identifiable. Solvable. </p><p> But you will not get there until you can name them. Until you know what you’re dealing with.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and others asked the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, Treasury Department, and the IRS to investigate whether TaxSlayer, H&amp;R Block, and TaxAct violated taxpayer privacy laws by sharing sensitive user information with the two tech firms.</p><p>Senators also released <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Attacks%20on%20Tax%20Privacy_Final.pdf">their own report</a> Wednesday detailing the accusations, first raised <a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook">by <em>The Markup </em>last November</a>. The report alleges that for years, tax preparation companies infused their products with Meta and Google tracking pixels that revealed identifying information — like a user’s full name, address, and date of birth. The senators also suggest that some of the information provided, like the forms a user accessed, could be used to show “whether taxpayers were eligible for certain deductions or exemptions.”&nbsp;</p><p>The senators claim that the companies did not receive user consent to share this information, which could violate laws banning tax preparers from sharing tax return information with third parties, especially since much of this data could be used for advertising purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>“The findings of this report reveal a shocking breach of taxpayer privacy by tax prep companies and by Big Tech firms that appeared to violate taxpayers’ rights and may have violated taxpayer privacy law,” the senators said in their Tuesday letter.&nbsp;</p><p>TaxSlayer, H&amp;R Block, and TaxAct all confirmed that they shared “extensive taxpayer data” through Meta’s pixel in the senators’ report. After <em>The Markup </em>published its November findings, each of the companies said they had “removed or disabled” it from their websites. &nbsp; </p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>Written by <a href="https://klangmag.co/lifers-dayjobbers-and-the-independently-wealthy-a-letter-to-a-former-student/www.maxalper.xyz">Max Alper</a></p><hr><p><em>Last year, a private student of mine had gotten in touch with me via email at around 3 AM. I had known this student for years prior, as they were in one of the earliest college courses I ever taught when they were an undergraduate at CUNY. This student, now in their mid-twenties, had witnessed much of my growth as an educator, from a nervous graduate student lecturing a room of indifferent college students to Professor Shitlord Emeritus of the Internet. <br></em></p><p><em>I often take the feedback of students like these incredibly close to heart. I thrive on constructive criticism, and these students have seen the changes I’ve made to my lessons and teaching style based on their words and feedback over the years. So when I saw this person shoot me a DM at 3 AM the previous night, I was a bit concerned. No good DMs get sent at 3 AM, nothing good happens at 3 AM.<br></em></p><p><em>The student, who we will call Billy, starts off with the first sentence: “Hey Max, depression really sucks.” We’re getting right to it off the bat. </em></p><p><em>Billy tells me how much they’ve been struggling during the past few years, even before COVID, burning themselves out trying to make a living as a working musician in Brooklyn. It’s hard for anybody anywhere in the states to pay rent off their art. I can only imagine what it’s like to grow up an aspiring artist all the while watching your hometown turn into the hip stomping ground for wealthy transplants from the Midwest and other parts of the East Coast. If anyone should have a shot in the various New York music scenes first and foremost, it should be local kids like Billy. <br></em></p><p><em>So it breaks my heart when Billy tells me he feels like a failure in his own city. And because of the toll this has taken on his mental health, Billy says he’s giving up on music altogether and applying to trade school. I responded with a few thoughts for Billy, some of which I’ve expanded upon below, that I’d like to share with you all.</em></p><hr><p>Dear Billy,<br></p><p>This breaks my heart on a few levels. For one thing, I’ve known you since you were a college student in my American Music History class getting your BA in Music. I thought I had done a decent enough job exposing the bullshit of the music industry to younger artists such as yourself, but one can only keep it <em>so real</em> in a college classroom without getting fired for telling their students that the game rigged.</p><p>What I wish I could have told you then is that every industry is saturated with nepotism and corruption, and oftentimes the arts are where these toxic qualities of the market get put on full display. We <em>do not</em> live in a meritocracy, hard work doesn’t automatically equal success when we are competing against those who have paid their way to the front of the line. But not to worry Billy, you have time to make your mark in your beautiful hometown of New York, let me tell you why.</p><p>Look at your favorite artists, alive or dead, the ones who you have always aspired to be as a professional. Chances are they have had one of three types of musical careers. Every professional musician I’ve met has fallen into one of these macro categories. I know it seems like an overgeneralization, but it continues to prove itself to be tried and true in my experience, so just hear me out. <br></p><p>The first of these three types of professional artists is the independently wealthy artist. I’m not saying look to the ones who flaunt it, you need to look for the ones with<em> time</em>. Often the most noticeable sign of merit on the surface level of a musician is their virtuosity behind their instrument. To shred is to impress, right? Yes, even I can admit that some good old-fashioned practice on a traditional instrument can indeed improve one's musical abilities tenfold. But this type of practice takes time, lots of time. <br></p><p>Who paid for all this time? How does someone outside of a conservatory program have the time to compose, record, and perform new original material every month, let alone to even practice their instrument an hour a day? The answer almost always comes down to the ability to not have to worry about paid work while pursuing your craft. As in, most likely, someone in your family pays your rent.</p><p>I’m not saying wealthy people can’t make incredible artists. Without Marcel Duchamp’s monthly allowance from his father throughout his adult life, we would never have Dada. Giacinto Scelsi was literally the heir and Duke of La Spezia castle estate. Something more contemporary? Grimes’ mother was a Crown Prosecutor, the Canadian equivalent of a District Attorney, in Vancouver. Frankie Cosmos’ dad is the guy from Wild Wild West, no, not Will Smith, the other guy. Julian Casablancas’ father ran New York’s top super modeling agency while young Julian hung out at the kid’s table with Ivanka Trump at Christmas time. The list goes on. <br></p><p>As talented and influential as these folks may be, it’s impossible not to link their artistic careers to the affluent lifestyles that supported them since birth. We can love their work while acknowledging that their upbringing most certainly is not the norm, nor is it something that your average aspiring artist can emulate in their practices. It’s like sprinting a hundred-meter dash while expecting to have the same shot of winning as the runner who is given a ninety-meter handicap. Time is money, and there will always be people out there who have more time than you to pursue their passions. So, fuck ‘em dude, you work with the time you have, it’s not a race.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5uEXY88I2QRSyIsBLNLih1oEIMj7Jucr024ENhVUMqrONq662OzO2B7Ame4iw3zvw_UNLav13XSYH_cuKRfSIlVBMtJjyM83BA9RKlrqoZrSu3cnuhTb8v16C4cXFcyDop3UBeSI2QcMQtcRxmjKdg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="583" height="329"></figure><p>The second general category of musical career is that of the lifer, or one who has dedicated their life to the struggle of making a living solely as an independent working musician, for better or worse. There’s never a better time to be about that life than when you’re young. You’ll never know it ain’t for you unless you try, and you got the energy for it in your early twenties. Being about that life includes, but is not limited to, tour nomadism, working seven days a week across multiple musical projects that both gig and record, and relying solely on the income generated from said touring and bands. This <em>usually</em> means not making much money, especially in the COVID and post-COVID world. Not to say you can’t make decent money off Bandcamp sales when you have the right amount of presence on the internet, but the effect of the pandemic has without a doubt been crippling to working musicians. As smaller venues closed across the country, private equity moved in. <br></p><p>In our contemporary hellscape that is the recording industry, gigs and direct in-person sales of merchandise are essential. For all the good that the monthly Bandcamp Friday series has done both during and after the pandemic, which included waiving all sales fees for artists to yield 100% revenue on the first Friday of every month, mass adoption of streaming platforms as the main means of record distribution has all but cemented the death of recorded music on its own as an asset of monetary value. <br></p><p>Not to say lifers playing the game by industry standards had it good before streaming, artists have been getting fucked over on royalties and rights to their masters since the phonograph. What makes our contemporary record industry different is that it has merged with platform capitalism at its highest level of infrastructure. One simply cannot survive off streaming alone without a means of getting playlisted by the platform algorithm, which often incentivizes those that can afford to game the system to do so. Streamfarming, algo-boosting, and paid bots have become quite profitable industries if you know where to look. If companies like Spotify can't make a profit and are propped up by shareholders, how should you be expected to earn a living using their platforms unless you find a way to game the system? Do you have 20 smartphones lying around, per chance?<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Sghh3F0nis9Mdb0YerKvd2EJBuOMUYwXZtk_rBFbMoUCF5VY6OrmkmIiSb3R39kYfqa96daVEfExnIt-RXURQn4OonjIm0yskkOYDO4vl2WNA32Lf12TrxVot0LhRleBJxyGj5UcW8wF0onVKRgCwg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="542" height="529"></figure><p><br>For an artist, choosing to not engage in self-promotion via streaming or social media platforms is in and of itself an act of protest. To knowingly cut oneself off from an algorithmically boosted audience makes it that much harder for an artist to get heads out to shows to pay full price at the door and buy merch directly after the concert. Hell, even I am married to the platform as an independent music teacher at this point. Instagram can get heads through the door, unfortunate as it may be, it may be the reason why you’re reading this letter at all. <br></p><p>With the way the cookie crumbles, Spotify and other streaming platforms can that much more likely get you a Bandcamp sale from someone who discovered you while scrolling the algorithm. To live that life as an online musician means to constantly release work across all platforms, to take advantage of every Bandcamp Friday. Any potential means of monetization is worthwhile, hustle equals survival. It's the sigma grindset on a quest for minimum wage.<br></p><p>The founder of Spotify, Daniel Ek, tells us that artists need to make more work if they want to benefit from the new systems in place. Nothing has changed for lifers. Hustle hard, no sleep. Believe me, just because I am acknowledging the sad truth doesn’t mean I don’t want to burn it all to the ground in a blaze of glory. Or at the very least demand a Spotify healthcare plan for any and all artists on the platform in a country that otherwise won’t provide it for them. A boy can dream. I digress.</p><p>It’s because of this harsh reality that romanticizing the lifer lifestyle in 21st century Brooklyn, or any other major American city, as anything other than the struggle it is can be incredibly dangerous. Millennials and Zoomers have been sold the lie that the big cities remain a bastion for cutting edge arts and culture, let alone that they are even livable for working artists. What year do they expect us to believe it is? The <em>New York Times</em> loves to gloat about the local renaissance happening in Bushwick in the Arts Section while covering a tech CEO who recently bought a brownstone in Bed-Stuy for a cool five million in the Real Estate section. <br></p><p>No-wave New York and its grandchildren are all but dead when rent costs as much as it does. The Lower East Side is a weekend playground for New Jersey’s most drunk. People who live in a closet in the shadow of a Chinatown fish market on one side and the Manhattan Bridge on the other pay upwards of $3000 monthly for the privilege to do so. The ground level of McKibben Lofts is now home to yoga studios and organic markets. The live/work loft space of the solitary working artist in the 2010s is nothing more than a leftover set on a soundstage for HBO’s <em>Girls, </em>unless you’re looking for nine roommates<em>. </em><br></p><p>The Lifer game is an uphill battle in the big cities, where nightlife can be both the main source of income for many, while also being the major contributing factor to the rising costs of living. It’s for this reason that I assume that some of the most successful lifers I’ve encountered have made the bulk of their careers outside of the big cities. Those that have sought a smaller, tight-knit <em>community</em> over a larger <em>scene,</em> a sort of preferred intimacy over a massive reach,<em> </em>are bound to find it wherever they end up. The lifer game is a social one first and foremost. It’s one of survival, but also one that requires a greater community to prosper. So as long as we put ourselves out there as a resource and provide a means of putting each other on bills and a place to crash whenever a head rolls into town, <strong>DIY will never die</strong>, struggle it may be. <br></p><p>The third and final general category of musical career I’ve encountered, and the one I’ve found myself in for some time now, is that of the Dayjobber. It’s the category you seem to find yourself falling into, Billy; a line of work you claim makes you a failure as an artist by choosing to enter. I wish I could strangle you through the computer screen, Billy, lovingly, of course, to snap you out of the toxic mindset you’ve found yourself in. Okay, no strangling, how about a very stern bearhug? <br></p><p>Not only are you not a failure for coming to terms with the fact that you’d prefer the peace of mind and mental health benefits that financial stability outside the arts can provide, but you’re also that much more of a professional artist as a result of this acknowledgment. A day job not only pays the bills, but also provides a necessary break for your ears and brain. You know your work requires sustenance, time and money doesn’t grow on trees, so you seek to build a cushion to support your artistic practices. It doesn’t matter if you’re not practicing every day or gigging every weekend. You make it work on your terms, at your own pace. It’s more than what most do in their adult age. At least you're fucking doing it.<br></p><p>I’m telling you this as a guy who has never paid his bills off gigs and record sales alone. I make fucking noise music and walls of ambient textures, dude, I don’t expect to receive a big advance from Atlantic or Sony to crank out my algorithmically generated pulsating meter nowness anytime soon. I came to terms early in my musical career with the fact that I needed to find a trade if I wanted to pay my bills and continue to pursue my art. The key is finding something you’re actually good at. <br></p><p>When I was in college, I spent my weekends working as a direct support professional for various schools and learning centers for kids in New York with special needs. The plan at the time was to just get into special education at the vocational level out of college. The work was gratifying and steady on its own and I was a decent teacher, a music-related profession wasn’t even in the cards at the time. It was only through years of working as a DSP that I eventually started to plan out syllabi that combined both K-12 education and music technology. <br></p><p>This ultimately pushed me to go to graduate school for an MFA in Sonic Arts and Electronic Music. Hey, Billy, this was when we first met! I was only a humble, broke, and eager graduate student working as an adjunct music instructor and studio assistant when you enrolled in my Music in Global America class. I didn’t re-enter the academy simply to better myself as an artist, I did so to expand my abilities to teach, talk, and write about music technology. Words, education, and technology are my trade, it just so happens that it now relates to the words, education, and technology of music on a full-time schedule. <br></p><p>And I am by no means alone in my pursuits to pay my bills outside of gigs and record sales. Philip Glass, boring as I may find him, is a hero of mine in this regard. He has gone on record to say “I expected to have a day job for the rest of my life”, having worked alongside fellow minimalist Steve Reich and sculptor Richard Serra as a moving company in the 1960s, as well as a cab driver up to (and during) the premiere of <em>Einstein on the Beach</em> in 1976. John Cage never stopped foraging for rare mushrooms and truffles - what was once his primary skill for sustenance during the Great Depression had transformed into his main source of income well into the peak of his career as a composer and public intellectual. Michelin Star restaurants in Manhattan paid top dollar for Cage’s occasional fungal findings upstate, enough to make sure he could spend the majority of his time composing and writing, sometimes with and or about mushrooms themselves. Charles Ives never stopped selling life insurance. Fenriz, of Norwegian Black Metal pioneers Darkthrone, never stopped being a postman and a union member. The list goes on.<br></p><p>You’re not a failure by being a dayjobber, Billy, you’re an artist, just like the rest of us. So what if you aren’t some rich kid from the Upper East Side who had the privilege of being stuck in a practice room since Kindergarten? Sure that kid can shred, but do you really want to be that person? You’re playing shows, making records, and selling merch online, all without daddy’s money to hold you down. You’re making it happen without the head start that Richy Rich got the second he was born. Be proud of that! Knowing that the game is rigged is liberating! Just because the music industry lacks meritocracy doesn’t mean you can’t blow these assholes out of the water through your craft. Your experiences outside their bubble will only foster more creativity as a result. <br></p><p>So what if it takes a bit longer because you can only dedicate an occasional evening or weekend to work on your new record? So long as you dedicate yourself to that time, as little as it may be, so long as you allow the public to hear what you’ve been up to, whenever or wherever that may be, Billy, then you’ll never be a failure. You’re still alive, aren’t you? Then you can make the time, but no rush.</p><p>Your former professor,</p><p>Max</p><hr><div><p><em><a href="https://klangmag.co/ear-fatigue/www.maxalper.xyz">Max Alper</a> aka La Meme Young is a composer, educator, writer, and cultural worker.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	<a href="https://variety.com/t/milan-kundera/" id="auto-tag_milan-kundera" data-tag="milan-kundera">Milan Kundera</a>, whose 1984 novel “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” was turned into an Oscar-nominated film, has died at the age of 94.</p>



<p>
	Kundera died Tuesday in Paris after a long illness, Jindra Pavelková, a representative of the Moravian Library, the Czech library housing his personal collection, told <em>Variety</em> Wednesday. </p>



<p>
	“Milan Kundera was a writer who reached whole generations of readers across all continents and achieved global fame,” Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said. “He leaves behind not only notable fiction, but also significant essay work.”

</p>



<p>
	The 1988 film adaptation of “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” was directed by <a href="https://variety.com/t/philip-kaufman/" id="auto-tag_philip-kaufman" data-tag="philip-kaufman">Philip Kaufman</a> and starred Daniel Day-Lewis and Juliette Binoche. Jean-Claude Carrière and Kaufman were Oscar nominated for adapted screenplay, and Sven Nykvist was Oscar nominated for cinematography.

	</p>




<p>
	Other films based on his writing include 1965’s “Nobody Will Laugh,” directed by Hynek Bocan, which won the Grand Prize at Mannheim-Heidelberg Film Festival, 1969’s “The Joke,” directed by Jaromil Jires, which played at San Sebastián Film Festival, and 1969’s “I, the Distressing God,” directed by Antonín Kachlík.</p>



<p>
	Kundera was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1929. His first novel, “The Joke,” was published in 1967, and was greeted with acclaim. French poet Louis Aragon called it “one of the greatest novels of the century.” </p>



<p>
	In 1968, the Prague Spring, a period of liberal reform in Czechoslovakia, was crushed by Soviet troops. Kundera criticized the invasion, and was subsequently ostracized by the Communist regime, and sacked from his post at Prague’s FAMU film school. “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” centers on the Prague Spring and its aftermath.</p>



<p>
	In 1975, he emigrated to France, and was stripped of his Czechoslovak citizenship four years later. He became a French citizen in 1981, and lived in France until his death, although he was made a citizen of the Czech Republic in 2019.</p>

never coming back as a society, language is gone, skills are gone, we are just in rags grunting at each other," Brotherstone said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For the actors and crew it was "a ball" to make, according to Dinsdale.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"We had the biggest laugh I remember, it was one of the happiest crews ever."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>To him though, Threads remains a "seminal" piece of television which still resonates with audiences.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"It was one of the most

 Building the Theory</h2>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Most of my free time for the past few years has gone into building out the compiler's foundations so that it could support this unexplored approach.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It was <i>hard</i>. Any kind of borrowing system is already pretty complex, but they also requires full generics, which are notoriously difficult. <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a> <a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
On top of that, an entire new compiler stage was needed to get regions and generational references to work seamlessly together. <a href="#note6" data-noteid="6">6</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Finally, a few months ago, <b>the regions prototype was finished</b>. It's rough around the edges, <a href="#note7" data-noteid="7">7</a> but it successfully compiled something for the first time.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
With that, I made the <a href="https://github.com/Verdagon/RegionsBenchmarks/blob/main/cellular-automata/CellularAutomata.vale">first ever zero-check Vale program</a>! <a href="#note8" data-noteid="8">8</a>
</p>
<p>
It was a program that uses <a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664">Cellular Automata</a> to generate a level for a roguelike game.
</p>

</section>

<section>
<p>
Of course, it didn't work perfectly at first. Compilers are tricky. The slightest misstep in the compiler code will add extra instructions to the resulting assembly, causing artificial overhead in the final program. And sometimes, there's extra little bits of information you need to pass to the optimizer (or the CPU itself!) to trick it into the most optimal behavior.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
To help me track down the problems, I kept comparing its assembly to the assembly generated by Vale's "unsafe" modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>unsafe_no_bounds</span> is similar to C; all memory-safety protections are turned off, and it only uses raw pointers for everything, rather than generational references.
</li>
<li>
<span>unsafe_with_bounds</span> then adds bounds checking for array accesses, similar to how Rust does it.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
After a couple months of tracking down differences, the resulting assembly looked nearly identical to Vale's <span>unsafe_with_bounds</span> mode! Every difference was expected <a href="#note9" data-noteid="9">9</a> and everything looked pretty reasonable.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="the-benchmarks">
 The Benchmarks</h2>
<p>
Finally, I benchmarked the program again:
</p>

</section>
<div>
      
      <pre><code>Summary
  './build_unsafe_no_bounds/main' ran
    1.18 ± 0.01 times faster than './build_unsafe_with_bounds/main'
    1.18 ± 0.01 times faster than './build_safe_fastest/main'</code></pre>
    </div>
<section>
<p>
Success! Vale's normal mode (<span>safe_fastest</span> here) showed no slowdowns compared to only bounds checking.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
In other words, <b>this approach has no observable overhead.</b> <a href="#note10" data-noteid="10">10</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Finally seeing this was a shock, a relief, and almost surreal. No overhead! We knew it was possible in theory, but seeing it happen for real still felt very surprising.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Feel free to play with it! Just build from the <a href="https://github.com/Verdagon/Vale/tree/regions">regions branch</a>, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Verdagon/RegionsBenchmarks">benchmarking scripts</a>, and to ask any questions in the <a href="https://discord.gg/SNB8yGH">discord server</a>.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
And before we get too excited, let's keep these important details in mind:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This is not benchmarking against languages like C and Rust directly. Those compilers have years of unrelated optimizations that would just confound the experiment, so I compare with <span>unsafe_no_bounds</span> and <span>unsafe_with_bounds</span> to isolate those variables and get a more accurate comparison of the memory safety approaches.
</li>
<li>
This was benchmarked on a Razer Blade 15" 2018 (512GB SSD) running Ubuntu 22.04, using <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a> inside a <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/cset-shield.1.html">cset shield</a>.
</li>
<li>
When I made larger programs, I observed quite a bit of optimizer noise, <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a> where a minor change in one area would swing the measurements one way or another. <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a> Benchmark results for the larger programs seemed rather fragile. We'll need a large set of benchmark programs to isolate away this optimizer noise.
</li>
<li>
In a larger program (a tiny roguelike game), I also observed that the optimizer didn't merge two identical branches of an if-statement, and missed a couple other obvious optimizations. I'm not sure how the presence of an integer (especially unread!) would affect this. It could even be a bug in LLVM, which are pretty common.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
That last one hints that we might want our own Vale-specific pre-optimizer, similar to Rust's <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a>, since LLVM was designed more with C in mind. <a href="#note13" data-noteid="13">13</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Still, even with these details, these results are quite promising!
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">
 What does this mean?</h2>
<p>
This means that generational references and regions combine to form a memory safety approach that is very, very fast.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It also means that this approach is actually viable, and could be desirable for quite a few software domains. A domain might desire this approach if:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It wants more predictable latency than tracing garbage collection.
</li>
<li>
It wants better performance and cache friendliness than reference counting.
</li>
<li>
It wants to prototype and iterate more easily than with borrow checking.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="where-does-vale-go-from-here">
 Where does Vale go from here?</h2>
<p>
The above benchmarks compared Vale's safe mode to Vale's unsafe modes, for a more accurate comparison of the memory safety approaches.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
However, there are still a few things to do before Vale can really go toe-to-toe with languages like C and C++. <a href="#note14" data-noteid="14">14</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I'll need to start a Vale-specific pre-optimizer, since LLVM's optimizer seems to have some problems reasoning about generations and immutability.
</li>
<li>
Vale still needs to support inline data, instead of putting all structs on the heap. (Note that that wouldn't affect the above benchmarks, which didn't use any structs.)
</li>
<li>
Regions are still just in the prototype phase. I'll need to smoothe out the rough edges, pay down a bit of tech debt, and merge this code in before doing anything else.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
After this is merged in, I'll be making the standard library use regions so that every user will benefit from them, even if their main program code doesn't use regions directly.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It's a pretty ambitious endeavor, so it's not clear how long this will take.

Previously, Vale had templates (like C++), not full generics.

It took the Golang team a decade to figure out their generics, and I don't blame them at all for that, after this struggle with generics!

<p>
Under the hood, it reduces regions to "pure height" integers: negative for region generic parameters, zero for the default region, and increasing positive for every pure block.

<div id="note7" data-noteid="7">
<p><span>7</span></p><section>
<p>
For example, its compile errors are very, <i>very</i> verbose, and there are a lot of things that just trigger assertions in the compiler still. I'll be fixing all of these before merging it into the main branch.

<p>
The only expected difference is that it put a pseudo-random generation number at the top of every allocation, though it never needed to read it for any generation checks. This is really just a montonically increasing register under the hood, to keep things fast. We'll be able to remove this once we add <a href="https://verdagon.dev/blog/zero-cost-borrowing-regions-part-2-isolates">isolates</a> or <span>uni</span>que references.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note10" data-noteid="10">
<p><span>10</span></p><section>
<p>
There could be overhead in theory, in the form of a nonatomic monotonically incrementing integer used for filling generations. It doesn't seem to affect the performance, likely because registers and simple arithmetic operations are so cheap on modern CPUs compared to the real bottleneck which is memory latency. The optimizer also often optimizes it out, since it sees nobody using these generations.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note11" data-noteid="11">
<p><span>11</span></p><section>
<p>
This is not the same thing as benchmark noise. This benchmarking setup reported very consistent run times (hence the <span>± 0.01</span> in the output).
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note12" data-noteid="12">
<p><span>12</span></p><section>
<p>
In fact, when I switched the size of the generation numbers, it consistently had negative overhead (<span>1.13 ± 0.01</span>), which is a bit weird considering that there weren't that many generation numbers in the program anyway. It did change the register allocations, so I suspect that's dwarfing any performance differences from anything actually semantically different in the programs.
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note13" data-noteid="13">
<p><span>13</span></p><section>
<p>
We might want this anyway, as I'm pretty sure LLVM would treat generational references as undefined behavior, if it could figure out that we're intentionally accessing released memory.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated unprecedented
capabilities in multiple AI tasks. However, hardware inefficiencies have become
a significant factor limiting the democratization of LLMs. We propose Chiplet
Cloud, an ASIC supercomputer architecture that optimizes total cost of
ownership (TCO) per token for serving generative LLMs. Chiplet Cloud fits all
model parameters inside the on-chip SRAMs to eliminate bandwidth limitations
while moderating the die size to improve system costs while leveraging software
mappings to overcome data communication overhead. We propose a comprehensive
design methodology that accurately explores a spectrum of major design
trade-offs in the joint space of hardware-software and generates a detailed
performance-cost analysis on all valid design points. We evaluate Chiplet Cloud
on four popular LLMs. Compared to GPU and TPU, our architecture can achieve up
to 94x and 15x improvement in TCO/Token respectively, significantly reducing
the cost for realistically serving modern LLMs.

                                        Since most code is written using ASCII characters, these characters are the
                                        backbone of every coding font. They have been sculpted with particularly great
                                        precision and attention to detail.

                                                There are better ways to design than putting a big effort into making
                                                something look special. Special is generally less useful than normal,
                                                and less rewarding in the long term. Special things demand attention for
                                                the wrong reasons, interrupting potentially good atmosphere with their
                                                awkward presence.

                                                The most noticable characters in Commit Mono are ‘agrQ£@’. If you’re not
                                                used to looking at fonts, they can be difficult to tell apart, but if
                                                those characters match what you see here, you’re looking at Commit Mono.

                                                The ligatures already in Commit Mono are added because they provide
                                                additional functionality (i.e. != becomes ≠), but they are off by
                                                default. Commit Mono won’t be updated with ligatures that purely serve
                                                aesthetic purposes (i.e. $&gt; becomes connected).

                                                You need to check if your editor/IDE/terminal supports ligatures. If it

                                            All features/ligatures are baked into the ‘calt’ OpenType Feature, which can
                                            be turned on by ‘enabling font ligatures’. In VS Code you simply put
                                            ["editor.fontLigatures": true,] in the settings.json file.

<p dir="auto">English is a high-level, multi-paradigm, expressive, general purpose language optimized for concurrent communications. English has been successfully used in a wide variety of scenarios, such as long-term data storage, analog and digital arts, and text-based adventures, to name a few. To date, English is used on more than 1,456 million carbon-based devices, and powers more than five million books.</p>
<p dir="auto">English has been designed over the course of fourteen centuries. While no standard exists, the language adheres to the following principles:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Portability: English follows a Write Once, Read Anywhere, Then Rewrite (WORATR) philosophy.</li>
<li>Extensibility: Like Lua, English can borrow constructs and keywords from other languages.</li>
<li>Multi-paradigm: English supports most modern programming paradigms (imperative, meta, etc.)</li>
<li>Resilience: English programs can execute on organic hardware despite severe syntax errors.</li>
<li>Polymorphism: English evolves over time without having to refactor existing codebases.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">English's stability makes it ideal for long-term projects where data integrity is more important than precision: The last breaking change in the specifications happened five centuries ago and there are no plans for further major releases.</p>
<p dir="auto">English's mantra is "there's more than one way to say it".</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Syntax</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a typical English program that implements the Frost pathfinding algorithm:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference."><pre><code>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

<p dir="auto">English uses whitespace and commas to delimit words, relying heavily on punctuation. Statements can end with a period or, less frequently, with a semicolon. Blocks are usually separated by two or more line breaks. Correct statements are always written in sentence case.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Operators</h3>
<p dir="auto">English uses the following operators:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>!</code>: Emphasize execution (similar to CSS's <code>!important</code>). Can be stacked</li>
<li><code>?</code>: Request information or open data stream thread. Can be stacked</li>
<li><code>,</code>: Concatenate statements in the same block</li>
<li><code>.</code>: End of statement</li>
<li><code>;</code>: End of statement (weak)</li>
<li><code>:</code>: Definition, for example for functions or clauses</li>
<li><code>...</code>: Temporarily suspend async execution (similar to <code>await</code>)</li>
<li><code>-</code>: Short break in execution or definition of list items</li>
<li><code>"</code>: Import value from another module or class</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Code comments are added using parentheses or round brackets. Unlike other programming languages, English executes code comments with lower priority to enrich execution context and debug logging. For example:</p>

<p dir="auto">English operators can be overloaded, although this is not recommended by the ENG23 committee.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Statements and control flow</h3>
<p dir="auto">English statements are free-form and its execution depends on the interpreter's training, as well as word order. Conditional execution and exception handling also depend on the mood and tense of the keywords, as well as resources available.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keywords</h3>
<p dir="auto">English does not have reserved words, relying instead on a set of 470,000 keywords that can be used interchangeably and even repeated to accelerate memory allocation. The training process results in scores that make the usage of certain keywords less likely. Keywords that score higher in the profanity dimension might cause the system to panic.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Data structures</h2>
<p dir="auto">English only has two data structures, Lists and Raw. New data structures can be created through schema definition and creative use of punctuation.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Typing</h2>
<p dir="auto">English uses context-sensitive and duck typing. The only base types are <code>strings</code> and <code>numbers</code>, with no size limit. Buffer overflows are typically handled by the interpreter, which performs just-in-time (JIT) type casting and guessing. To compensate for the lack of predefined types, English uses a rich system of classes, with <code>noun</code>, <code>adjective</code>, and so on.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2>
<p dir="auto">English programs are self-documenting and implement literate programming.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tooling</h2>
<p dir="auto">Currently, the only compiler available is Wernicke. It requires a temporal lobe trained in social settings for at least three to four years, though better results can be achieved with training runs in excess of 30 years.</p>
<p dir="auto">Numerous development environments (IDEs) have been released since version 1.0. The most common editors for English are Word and Docs, although programs can still be written in WordPerfect, Vi, and emacs. English is unique in that it can be coded on almost any medium capable of supporting scratches and marks, such as paper, stone, or clay.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are millions of English libraries available. You can look for the closest in Google Maps.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Community</h2>
<p dir="auto">The English community is vibrant, with more than 150 distributions available. For a complete list of forks see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_English" rel="nofollow">List of dialects</a>.</p>

<p>The layout of the Disney parks may not be something you think about except for at the end of the day when your feet are aching and sitting feels like the best ride ever. Or when you’re hiking around the Epcot World Showcase in the blazing sun and afternoon heat. <strong>But</strong> <strong>the ways the Imagineers have creatively designed the parks influence your experience more than you think, and in ways you might not have considered before.</strong> </p>



<p>So today we’re going to talk about why we love (or mostly love) Disney’s park designs and architectural illusions. And we’ll learn a bit about the history of Disney’s design along the way. </p>



<p>Let’s dive in, shall we?</p>



<p>We all know Disney creates the impression of height using forced perspective (or at least you do now!). Almost all the buildings on Main Street USA are designed with a 1—5/8—1/2 scale. The first floor is full scale, followed by the next facade floor being 5/8 before adding a third fake floor that is only 1/2 size. This illusion draws the eyes up and makes you think (from the ground) that the building is three stories when it actually is quite shorter. (Note: Main Street USA in the Magic Kingdom in Florida uses a 7/8 scale instead because it has a larger castle and so everything is sized up instead of “pony size” like Walt wanted at Disneyland).</p>

<p>This same effect is widely used in the parks, everywhere from Liberty Square to the tree stump atop Splash Mountain, and even the castles themselves. All buildings at Disney need to stay under 200 feet in order to not have to put lighting on the top for aircraft safety, which means even our beloved Cinderella Castle is only 189 feet high (though it looks quite a bit taller). </p>

You can tell by looking at the windows and comparing their sizes as your eye moves upwards!</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are a few buildings on Main Street USA, however, that do not use forced perspective. One is Tony’s Town Square restaurant building, which needed to be tall enough to block the view of the Contemporary while in the parks and was therefore built with all its floors true-to-size.</p>



<p>Another is the Town Square Firehouse, which stands a full three stories because the original plans for the parks included an apartment for Walt’s family like its counterpart in Disneyland. As you may know, Walt sadly passed away before the opening of Walt Disney World, which made the apartment unnecessary. But as construction was already underway, the building was completed full-scale.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="853" src="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-768x1024.jpg?resize=640%2C853&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/38-scaled.jpg?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Town Square Firehouse, looking rather large on Main Street. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Forced perspective isn’t limited to the height of the buildings, however, on Main Street USA. The buildings themselves are designed to be at a slightly wider angle on one side of the building, so when you are traveling down the street towards the castle, it creates an illusion that the end of the street (and castle) is far away in the distance. When you turn around and head towards the exit after a long day, the street appears shorter and the end of the street manageably closer. </p>



<p>The trees also play a part in this visual trickery, as they are smaller as you look down the street towards the castle to make the magnificent structure appear larger and more impressive. The trees planted in the Town Square near the exit are larger and therefore create the illusion as you walk back to your resort that the train station is much closer.</p>



<p>And speaking of the walk back to your hotel room…</p>



<p>Walt had a term for the sore feet we often get after a long day of traipsing around the parks… he called it “museum feet”. His goal in designing the original parks was to avoid tired, aching feet as much as possible by creating useful walkways that connected people quickly to their destination. </p>



<p>After traveling to Washington D.C. and seeing the French-born architect Pierre L’Enfant’s hub-and-spoke street designs, Walt proposed the same concept for Disneyland (if you’ve ever traveled in Paris, you’ll notice this is a common architectural street layout there as well). Below is a 1:100 scale model of opening day in Disneyland, where you can see this concept played out:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?w=1280 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/29-1-scaled.jpg?w=1920 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Disneyland, Opening Day, 1955.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In this original design, every land is accessible via the hub in the center of the park. This hub, called “Central Plaza” or “Plaza” by Walt and the Imagineers (hence “The Plaza Inn” name) allowed for visitors to always have an anchor point to orient themselves to no matter where they were in the park. The castle itself became a visual reference for this anchor point. </p>



<p>But what Walt soon realized is that everyone had to backtrack back to the hub in order to get to another land, and that simply called for too much walking. So, secondary routes between each land were created at the back so that you could easily travel from land to land. </p>



<p>I am going to pause here and mention that, in my opinion, it is a major flaw in the design of the Magic Kingdom in Disney World that there is NOT a back entrance to Frontierland connecting it to Liberty Square/Fantasyland as there is in Disneyland. That walk from Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is ROUGH to backtrack around the Rivers of America on a hot Floridian day. </p>

You can clearly see what I mean here on the left side around the river. Even from the sky you can tell that is a LONG way to walk!</figcaption></figure>



<p>I digress. </p>



<p>Sadly, not all of the parks are laid out in this brilliant hub-and-spoke fashion. Epcot could easily be known as “Every Person Comes Out Tired” simply because of its massive double-circle design that arguably creates more steps needed than any other park. We could go on and on about why it’s that way (namely: it was supposed to be two separate parks and they pushed the two models together to create one large one) but that’s a whole other post for another day. </p>

<p>Animal Kingdom takes a page from the Magic Kingdom in design, with the hub being Discovery Island with the Tree of Life as a visual anchor. There are also walkways on the backside of all lands leading into the next land, much like Disneyland. This park feels smaller than it is at times because of this simple design that makes almost every area easily accessible. I particularly appreciate the bypass of DinoLand U.S.A., allowing me quick access to Expedition Everest without having to pass through that visually assaulting area.</p>

<p>It’s here I make my apologies to all the DinoLand fans out there… I love the cute Chester and Hester backstory, but would much rather have the defunct <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Beastly_Kingdom">Beastly Kingdom</a> area instead, quite honestly. </p>



<p>And now we come to an oft-controversial park that, at 72 acres, is one of the smallest of any Disney park, but is quickly becoming more beloved as it evolves. That’s right, I’m looking at you, California Adventure. </p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?w=1280 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/32-2-scaled.jpg?w=1920 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Don’t be fooled by the large buildings, the bottom right corner is all Disney’s Grand Californian Resort and not part of the park!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where to start with this park? This is a question you may ask yourself when you enter it (from Buena Vista street OR the Grand Californian if you are a guest there). While the Carthay Circle Theatre is next to a small circular fountain, the lands are nowhere near connected by a central hub. And once you get back to Pixar Pier (top right in photo) or Radiator Springs Racers, you may find yourself with quite a trek back to the entrance. The visual anchor is arguably Grizzly Peak, but it’s not a clear center location point in any regard. </p>



<p>The fact is, it’s easy to get quite lost in this park. Case in point, while talking to a friend the other day, they didn’t know there were three entrances to Cars Land (and they were a Disney regular). That’s not surprising as the design is not intuitive in the least. It’s a sprawling, chaotic mess that is reminiscent of the lack of forethought that went into designing this park in the first place. Disney is doing a great job correcting its early mistakes of DCA with the Pixar retheming, the creation of the (beautiful!) Radiator Springs, and now the addition of Marvel, but it’s hard to hide the bad bones of structure that make walking around this park a little awkward, to say the least. </p>



<p>That being said, I have an abundance of love for California Adventure, and it’s become a family favorite. And the small footprint of the park makes it an easy stroll, even if we do get a bit lost at times.  And who’s to say it’s such a bad thing to be lost while on Flo’s V-8 Cafe’s back patio watching the cars go by with a backdrop of Ornament Valley?</p>

<p>Which brings us to Hollywood Studios. A plethora of opinions abound about this park at the moment. Some love the layout, some hate it, but regardless, I think we can all agree its set-up is not the most convenient or intuitive.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="965" src="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM-679x1024.png?resize=640%2C965&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM.png?resize=679%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 679w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM.png?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM.png?resize=768%2C1158&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM.png?resize=1018%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1018w, https://i0.wp.com/disneycicerone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-08-at-4.28.01-PM.png?w=1098&amp;ssl=1 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Hollywood Studios from above… the green is Echo Lake, and you can clearly see Batuu on the bottom left in shades of brown and grey.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The compact design of this park at just 135 acres makes it feel quite crowded even when it’s running at the same capacity as the rest of the parks. Even though it’s larger than the Magic Kingdom, the lands themselves do not have many vast open areas, therefore consistently channeling people into smaller walkways. I am pretty sure there are places I have never been in Hollywood Studios just because I didn’t know how to get there (or didn’t care to try to figure it out). </p>



<p>One could debate about what the visual anchor is for this park at the moment. Is it the Chinese Theater with Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway? Or the Hollywood Tower Hotel, even all the way down at the end of the street? It used to be the Earffel&nbsp;Tower before they dismantled it for the addition of Toy Story Land(or the giant sparkly sorcerer hat that blocked the view of the Chinese Theater). It’s hard to say, though I lean towards the Chinese Theater as the center now that Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway has become so popular. </p>



<p>Ok, Disney friends. Let’s bring it back to the original park, shall we? Let’s return to Walt’s design, where it all started. </p>



<p>One cannot talk about layout without discussing the brilliance of the Imagineers and what they have done with the postage-stamp size of Disneyland. At only 85 acres, this park has many more rides per the relative space as Magic Kingdom, and many of them opening-day (or Walt-concept) originals that still operate with only slight variations. </p>

<p>One of the most fascinating visual tricks is the way Disney places several rides in the same show building to save on space, changing only the facade on the outside of the building. Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride is on the first floor, while Alice in Wonderland climbs up to the second story to wind around above Mr. Toad. You can see the show building, which also includes Peter Pan’s Flight and The Mad Hatter gift shop in the photo below:</p>

<p>You probably have already heard about the “berm”, with the Disneyland Railroad atop it, which creates a visual barrier between you and the outside world while in the Magic Kingdom. What you may not know is that, in order to create the Haunted Mansion and the Pirates of the Caribbean, the show buildings had to be built <em>outside</em> the berm.</p>



<p>Ever wonder why Pirates of the Caribbean in Disneyland has two drops at the beginning of the ride instead of only one at Disney World?</p>



<p>Because you have to get below the train tracks, and into a separate building. </p>



<p>The same is true with the Haunted Mansion. As mentioned in my previous post about Halloween, the stretching room was designed solely to get everyone down a level in an elevator so they could walk down a long hallway underneath the berm. Imagineers and guests liked the gag so much that they replicated it in the Disney World version, but with the room stretching up instead of down since there was plenty of space for the show building right next to the stretching room. Well, technically they did plan to have elevators in the Magic Kingdom version of the Haunted Mansion, but they decided not to install them and changed their plans when Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion elevator shaft sprung a leak from the Rivers of America. The two elevators planned for Disney World still went to good use, however. One ended up in the Fantasyland stage, and the other currently resides sits under Cosmic Ray, raising him up and down as the need arises. </p>



<p>Anyway, back to Disneyland. You can clearly see in this photo below the two show buildings on the opposite side of the tracks:</p>

<p>I could go on and on for days about the layouts and intricacies within the lands themselves and how they are arranged for optimal guest traffic flow coupled with visual awe and wonder. That so many lands keep you closely within the theming without the intrusion of the surrounding areas is a magical feat unto itself. </p>



<p>The Imagineers have spent countless years hiding, sculpting, maneuvering, and designing ways for us to see the Disney parks in a specific way.</p>



<p>And that is why we love Disney. Because they not only care to bring us a beautiful Main Street USA but choose to make it magical in a way that goes beyond our understanding, creating a unique place that feels nostalgic even though none of us have ever lived in the early 1900s. </p>



<p>They invent space where there isn’t space, allowing us to believe that two rides can occupy the same location at the same time and that the Haunted Mansion could go on forever. </p>



<p>They turn an extra drop or an elevator ride into something we think of now as iconic when all it did was serve a practical need. </p>



<p>The magic is in the details, and all of this only scratches the surface of the Imagineering architectural design magic (don’t get me started about Liberty Square moving through time or the reason behind the name of the Seven Seas Lagoon!).</p>



<p>The next time you walk down Main Street, pause for a moment and take a glance at the second-story windows. Those names forever influenced the parks we know and love, and have altered our perspective in more magical ways than we’ll ever know. </p>

  <p><strong>Biologists present the latest innovation in nest building: bird nests made from anti-nesting spikes. Researchers from Naturalis Biodiversity Center and the Natural History Museum Rotterdam collected these special nests for the first time and described this remarkable behavior in a scientific publication as 'an ultimate adaptation to life in the city.'</strong></p>
                            </div>
          


    
              <div>
                                                                  <div>
                          <h2><p>A nest</p><p>that is a joke</p></h2>
          <div><p>If you look around in cities, you can see anti-bird spikes on many buildings. The sharp metal spikes are placed to scare away birds, and to prevent them from building nests. But birds are not so easily scared away, it now appears. Researchers from two Dutch natural history museums collected nests of a carrion crow and a Eurasian magpie that were largely built with material that should have deterred birds: bird nests made of anti-bird spikes. "It's like a joke, really" says biologist Auke-Florian Hiemstra of Naturalis: "Even for me as a nest researcher, these are the craziest bird nests I've ever seen."</p>

<p>The adaptability and creativity of urban birds seem to know no bounds. Researchers from Naturalis Biodiversity Center and the Natural History Museum Rotterdam describe these spiky structures in the scientific journal <em>Deinsea</em>. "Just when you think you've seen it all after half a century of studying natural history, these inventive crows and magpies really surprise me again," said Kees Moeliker, director of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam and co-author of the scientific publication.</p>

<p><strong>1500 metal spikes</strong><br>
It started with the discovery of a huge nest in Antwerp, in the courtyard of a hospital, which was spotted by one of the patients. High up in a tree, magpies made a huge nest of up to 1,500 metal spikes. For this particular nest, birds have pulled as many as 50 meters (150 feet) of anti-bird pins from the eaves. “An impregnable fortress”, says Hiemstra, “because the magpies appear to be using the pins exactly the same way we do: to keep other birds away from their nest.”</p>

<p>Magpies make a roof on their nest to prevent the robbery of eggs and young, and they specifically look for thorny plants in nature for this purpose. Spiky branches keep hungry egg robbers away. In the city there is another option: the anti-bird spikes. “They are literally made to keep birds at bay,” says Hiemstra, “which is how they seem to be used by birds as well.”</p>

<div><p><strong>Rebel birds</strong><br>
And it is not just one pair of magpies that have ventured into the bird-repellent material. The article describes several magpie nests with anti-bird spikes as nesting material. This behavior has already been seen in the Netherlands, Belgium and Scotland. Other sharp materials, such as barbed wire and knitting needles, are also used by magpies for the roof of their nests. Crow's nests made of anti-bird spikes are currently only known from the Netherlands.</p><p>
It was already known that birds are not easily deterred by the pins. The '<a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/city-file/article/face-adversity-saga-parkdale-pigeon">Parkdale Pigeon</a>' gained fame for not being scared away by anti-bird pegs and several videos show the rebellious <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/05/chick-flick-cockatoo-gives-anti-nesting-spikes-the-bird-in-viral-video">behavior of birds</a> tearing <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-05/corella-contraceptive-needed-to-address-plague/11274434">the spikes off roofs</a>. The collaboration between the Leiden and Rotterdam museums has now resulted in the first scientific publication showing that birds also use those miserable anti-bird pins as nesting material.</p></div>

<div><p><strong>Condoms and cocaine</strong><br>
Auke-Florian Hiemstra (1992) is doing a PhD at Naturalis and Leiden University on the use of artificial materials in animal structures, and has previously published on the use of <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/ab/71/2/article-p215_7.xml?language=en">face masks</a> and <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/159/2/article-p193_5.xml">plastic plants</a> in bird nests. He also regularly encounters condoms, fireworks, cocaine wraps, sunglasses and windshield wipers as nesting material for his coots. “If even bird-repellent sharp spikes are used as nesting material, apparently anything can end up in a bird's nest these days. It doesn’t get any crazier than this, does it?"</p><p>
The large magpie's nest of anti-bird pins from Antwerp can be seen from 11 July as a new highlight in the LiveScience room of Naturalis, which can be visited free of charge. The Natural History Museum Rotterdam exhibits the crow's nest of anti-bird pins in the recently opened exhibition 'National Park Rotterdam', along with a number of other remarkable constructions of urban animals.</p><p><img alt="Metal bird nest" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2f846d7c-0530-4235-be4d-a3303234a972" src="https://www.naturalis.nl/uploads/inline/Magpie%20nest%20_0.jpg" width="1256" height="942" loading="lazy"></p></div></div>

Let's abuse a bug in <code>java.lang.String</code> to make some <em>weird</em> Strings.
We'll make "hello world" not start with "hello", and show that not all empty Strings are equal to each other.
</p>

<h2>Intro: Equality among Strings</h2>

<p>
Before we get started, we look at what it takes for two Strings to be equal in the JDK.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Why is <code>"foo".equals("fox")</code> false?
</blockquote>

<p>
Because Strings are compared character by character, and the third character of those Strings is different.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Why is <code>"foo".equals("foo")</code> true?
</blockquote>

<p>
You might think that in this case the Strings are also compared character by character.
But String literals are <em>interned</em>.
When the same String appears as a constant multiple times in the source code, it's not just another String with the same content.
It is the same instance of String.
And the first thing that String.equals does is <code>if (this == anObject) { return true; }</code>, so it doesn't even look at the contents.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Why is <code>"foo!".equals("foo⁉")</code> false?

<p>
Since JDK 9 (since <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/254">JEP 254: Compact Strings</a>), a String represents its content internally as a byte array.
"foo!" only contains simple characters, with a codepoint less than 256. The String class internally encodes such values using the latin-1 encoding, with one byte per character.
"foo⁉" contains a character (⁉) that cannot be represented using latin-1, so it encodes the whole String using UTF-16, with two bytes per character.
The <code>String.coder</code> field keeps track of which of the two encodings was used.
When comparing two Strings with a different <code>coder</code>, then <code>String.equals</code> always returns false.
It does not even look at the contents, because if one String can be represented in latin-1, and the other one can not, then they can't be the same. Or can they?
</p>

<p>
Note: The compact strings feature can be disabled, but it's enabled by default. This blog post assumes it is enabled.

<h2>Creating a broken String</h2>

<blockquote>
How are Strings created? How exactly does <code>java.lang.String</code> choose to use latin-1 or not?
</blockquote>
<p>
Strings can be created in multiple ways, we'll focus here on the String constructor that takes a <code>char[]</code>.
It first tries to encode the characters as latin-1 using <code>StringUTF16.compress</code>. If that fails, it returns <code>null</code> and the constructor falls back to using UTF-16.
Here is a simplified version of how that is implemented.
(For readability I removed irrelevant indirections, checks and arguments from the actual implementation
  <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/b3f34039fedd3c49404783ec880e1885dceb296b/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/String.java#L277-L279">here</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/b3f34039fedd3c49404783ec880e1885dceb296b/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/String.java#L4757-L4772">here</a>)

</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>/**
 * Allocates a new {@code String} so that it represents the sequence of
 * characters currently contained in the character array argument. The
 * contents of the character array are copied; subsequent modification of
 * the character array does not affect the newly created string.
 */</span>
<span>public</span> <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>value</span><span>[])</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
There is the bug. This code does not always preserve the assumptions that <code>String.equals</code> makes that we talked about above.
Do you see it?

</p><p>
The javadoc points out that "subsequent modification of the character array does not affect the newly created string".
But how about <em>concurrent</em> modification?
The String constructor has a race condition.
The contents of <code>value</code> may have changed between trying to encode it as latin-1, and encoding it as UTF-16.
That way we can end up with a String that only contains latin-1 characters, but is encoded as UTF-16.
We can trigger that race condition like this:

</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>/**
 * Given a latin-1 String, creates a copy that is
 * incorrectly encoded as UTF-16.
 */</span>
<span>static</span> <span>String</span> <span>breakIt</span><span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>original</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>"Can only break latin-1 Strings"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>char</span><span>[]</span> <span>chars</span> <span>=</span> <span>original</span><span>.</span><span>toCharArray</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// in another thread, flip the first character back</span>
  <span>// and forth between being encodable as latin-1 or not</span>
  <span>Thread</span> <span>thread</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Thread</span><span>(()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>chars</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>^=</span> <span>256</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>});</span>
  <span>thread</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// at the same time call the String constructor,</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>charAt</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>256</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span><span>original</span><span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
The broken Strings we can create this way have some interesting properties.

</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>String</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span><span>;</span>
<span>String</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>breakIt</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>);</span>

<span>// they are not equal to each other</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>));</span>
<span>// =&gt; false</span>

<span>// they do contain the same series of characters</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>Arrays</span><span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>toCharArray</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>toCharArray</span><span>()));</span>
<span>// =&gt; true</span>

<span>// compareTo does consider them equal (even though its javadoc</span>
<span>// specifies that "compareTo returns 0 exactly when the</span>
<span>// equals(Object) method would return true")</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>compareTo</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>));</span>
<span>// =&gt; 0</span>

<span>// they have the same length, and one startsWith the other,</span>
<span>// but not the other way around (because if it wasn't broken,</span>
<span>// a latin-1 string cannot start with a non-latin-1</span>
<span>// substring).</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>());</span>
<span>// =&gt; true</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>));</span>
<span>// =&gt; true</span>
<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>));</span>
<span>// =&gt; false</span></code></pre></figure><p>

Strange. I didn't expect this weird behaviour from such a fundamental Java class.

</p><h2>Spooky action at a distance</h2>

<p>
Just because we can, let's have some more fun with this.
We can not only create a broken String, we can also break a String <em>at a distance</em>, in another class.

</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>class</span> <span>OtherClass</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>startWithHello</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world"</span><span>.</span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>));</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>
If we write that in IntelliJ then it warns us that <em>Result of '"hello world".startsWith("hello")' is always 'true'</em>.
This code doesn't even take any input, but we can still make it print <code>false</code>, by injecting a broken "hello" into it, through interning:
We break a String containing hello before any other code has literally mentioned or explicitly interned it, and we intern that broken version.
That way, we have broken every <code>"hello"</code> String literal in our JVM.

</p><figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>breakIt</span><span>(</span><span>"hell"</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span><span>"o"</span><span>)).</span><span>intern</span><span>();</span>
<span>OtherClass</span><span>.</span><span>startWithHello</span><span>();</span> <span>// prints false</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2>Challenge: Empty or not?</h2>

<p>
Using our breakIt method, we can create an equivalent but not-actually-equal String of any latin-1 String.
But it doesn't work for the empty String, because that one doesn't have any characters to trigger the race condition.
Yet, we can still create a broken empty String. I'll leave that as a challenge to the reader.

</p><p>
Concretely:
Can you make a <code>java.lang.String</code> object, for which this is true: <code>s.isEmpty() &amp;&amp; !s.equals("")</code>.
No cheating: You're only allowed to use public APIs for this, e.g. no <code>.setAccessible</code> to access privates, no instrumentation.

</p><p>
If you find it, let me know <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7NQr97AA8R-4-NhaL4g1B3yGNkjXVLJqMM3aIcbJtMEn6-A/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>.
I'll update this page with submitted answers later.
