    <div><pre>This commit makes the DNS resolution code better suited for both
filtering on cname and ip address. The change allows early availability
of ip address so that `ipaddress=` option can be matched at
onBeforeRequest time.

As a result, it is now possible to block root document using
`ipaddress=` option -- so long as an ip address can be extracted
before first onBeforeRequest() call.

Caveat
------

the ip address used is the first one among the list of ip
addresses returned by dns.resolve() method. There is no way for uBO
to know which exact ip address will be used by the browser when
sending the request, so this is at most a best guess. The exact IP
address used by the browser is available at onHeadersReceived time,
and uBO will also filter according to this value, but by then the
network request has already been sent to the remote server.

Possibly a future improvement would make available the whole list
of ip addresses to the filtering engine, but even then it's impossible
to know with certainty which ip address will ultimately be used by the
browser -- it is entirely possible that the ip address used by the
browser might not be in the list received through dns.resolve().</pre></div>

Three years later, Graham stepped down as president of the company and crowned Altman as his successor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It soon became clear that the Y Combinator island wasn’t big enough to contain Altman’s ambitions. In 2015, while still president of the company, he co-founded a non-profit called OpenAI and became, along with Elon Musk, its co-chair. Within a few years, Altman and Musk were having disagreements—over, for example, who was alpha male. Musk left the OpenAI island and Altman settled in to run it.</p><p><span>I don’t think I’d be good at parachuting into cannibal-inhabited islands and securing political control of them, but I imagine that, if I </span><em>were</em><span> good at it, I’d follow this algorithm:&nbsp;</span></p><p>Be extremely nice and accommodating for a while, and gradually win the trust of the natives, who will thus cede increasing amounts of influence to you, until you have so much influence that you can drop the act and reveal your true ambitions. At that point you can eat them.</p><p>In this light, it’s worth revisiting Altman’s congressional testimony in May of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT had captured the world’s attention. He was a picture of humility and cooperation. He professed acute awareness of AI’s dangers and encouraged the regulation of OpenAI and other such companies. For a CEO to issue this kind of invitation was so unusual that it became the headline of the New York Times story about the hearings.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png" width="845" height="154" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:154,&quot;width&quot;:845,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:30269,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, who had chaired the hearings, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/technology/sam-altman-ai-regulations.html" rel="">said</a><span>, “It’s so refreshing. He was willing, able, and eager.”</span></p><p>Not to mention pure of heart! When one senator asked Altman if he made a lot of money from AI, he replied, “No. I’m paid enough for health insurance. I have no equity in OpenAI… I’m doing this because I love it.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward to now:</p><p><span>This week California’s governor </span><a href="https://time.com/7026653/gavin-newsom-ai-safety-bill-sb-1047/" rel="">vetoed</a><span> an AI regulation bill that OpenAI opposed even though the bill had been watered down to a point where Anthropic, OpenAI’s rival, had dropped its initial opposition. And last week, with OpenAI poised to close an investment round that will bring in $6.5 billion at a valuation of $150 billion, we </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-remove-non-profit-control-give-sam-altman-equity-sources-say-2024-09-25/" rel="">learned</a><span> that the company plans to become a fully for-profit corporation (having converted to a quasi-for-profit in 2019). And Altman could now get equity in OpenAI—around $10 billion worth, according to one </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-25/openai-cto-mira-murati-says-she-will-leave-the-company?embedded-checkout=true" rel="">report</a><span>.</span></p><p>This last report, in particular, turned last week into a festival for Altman haters. Not content to just quote his congressional testimony about the irrelevance of money to his motivational structure, they circulated the video of it. Which really is worth watching, because you haven’t seen pious until you’ve seen Sam Altman do pious:</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nonzero.substack.com/p/sam-altman-goes-full-emperor?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://nonzero.substack.com/p/sam-altman-goes-full-emperor?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>I take issue with these Altman haters; I think they’re hating on the wrong part of Altman. What’s scary about him isn’t that he’s good at getting rich (he’s a billionaire even without any OpenAI equity), but that, as Graham told a journalist in 2016, “Sam is extremely good at getting powerful.” I think he’s using that power—in Silicon Valley and in Washington DC and in various centers of influence around the world—to put the AI industry, and the world, on a dangerous course. Sometimes you even get the impression that he’s chosen this course because it would give him more power, and the rest of us are just along for the ride.</p><p><span>How to describe this course? Though Altman (wisely) wouldn’t use this term for it, I’d say it boils down to </span><em>accelerationism</em><span>—the idea that, when it comes to technological change, and progress in AI in particular, faster is better. There was a time when Altman sounded like the opposite of an accelerationist. Consider the view he expressed in 2022:</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

Google</em></a>, ordering Google to effectively open up the Google Play app store to competition for three whole years. Google will have to distribute rival third-party app stores<em> within </em>Google Play, and it must give rival third-party app stores access to the full catalog of Google Play apps, unless developers opt out individually. </p><p>These were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128531/epic-google-proposed-injunction-remedies">Epic’s biggest asks</a>, and they might change the Android app marketplace forever — if they aren’t immediately paused or blocked on appeal. </p><p>And they’re not all that Epic has won today.</p><p>Starting November 1st, 2024, and ending November 1st, 2027, Google must also:</p><div><ul><li>Stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps distributed on the Google Play Store (the jury found that Google had illegally tied its payment system to its app store)</li><li>Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store</li><li>Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store</li><li>Let Android developers set their own prices for apps irrespective of Play Billing</li></ul></div><p>Google also can’t: </p><div><ul><li>Share app revenue “with any person or entity that distributes Android apps” or plans to launch an app store or app platform</li><li>Offer developers money or perks to launch their apps on the Play Store exclusively or first</li><li>Offer developers money or perks <strong>not</strong> to launch their apps on rival stores</li><li>Offer device makers or carriers money or perks to preinstall the Play Store</li><li>Offer device makers or carriers money or perks <strong>not </strong>to preinstall rival stores</li></ul></div><p>In <em>Epic v. Google</em>,<em> </em>Epic successfully argued that Google had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">created such a substantial array of deals with developers, carriers, and device makers</a> that it was nigh-impossible for rival stores to spring up. By blocking those sorts of deals, and proactively helping rival app stores, it’s possible some real competition to Google’s monopoly could now arrive.</p><p>Google will still have some control over safety and security as it opens up the Google Play Store to rival stores. The injunction says that Google can “take reasonable measures” that are “strictly necessary and narrowly tailored” and are “comparable” to how it currently polices the Google Play Store. Google will be able to charge a fee for that policing, too. Epic has repeatedly argued that Google should not be able to deter third-party app stores through policing, so it’s likely Epic and Google will keep butting heads over this.</p><p>Judge Donato is giving Google eight months from now to come up with a system, with a three-person technical committee jointly chosen by Epic and Google reviewing any disputes. That system will also come with a way for developers to opt out of being listed in rival Android app stores.</p><p>Epic didn’t quite get everything it asked for: it wanted the judge to crack open Google Play for six years, not three; allow users to sideload apps with a single tap; and for Google to stop being able to tie Android APIs to Google Play. </p><p>Why not six years? “The provisions are designed to level the playing field for the entry and growth of rivals, without burdening Google excessively,” writes Donato in his order. “As competition comes into play and the network effects that Google Play unfairly enjoys are abated, Google should not be unduly constrained as a competitor.”</p><p>Yet Amazon, of all companies, convinced Judge Donato that Google’s rivals need a helping hand. “Even a corporate behemoth like Amazon could not compete with the Google Play Store due to network effects,” writes Donato, citing a key piece of evidence from the trial: an internal Google presentation that suggested Amazon would struggle with the chicken-and-egg problem of attracting both users and apps. To date, the Amazon Appstore has not become a substantial competitor.</p><p>But with access to the Google Play catalog of apps, Donato argues, rival app stores will now have “a fighting chance of getting off the ground”.</p><p>Epic Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal">originally sued Google</a> on August 13th, 2020 — the very same day it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief">sued Apple, too</a>. The game developer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments">sprung a premeditated trap</a> on both tech giants by attempting to bypass their 30 percent fee on in-app purchases with a surprise update to its mega-popular game <em>Fortnite. </em>Both tech companies retaliated by kicking <em>Fortnite</em> off their app stores, only to be met by a coordinated #FreeFortnite action campaign and a pair of lawsuits accusing each of creating illegal monopolies.</p><p>The Apple case is already over, and Apple mostly won: the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039983/supreme-court-epic-apple-antitrust-case-rejected">Supreme Court rejected Epic’s final appeal</a> this January. The only thing Epic legally achieved there was an order dismantling Apple’s “anti-steering rules,” theoretically letting developers freely tell their customers how to bypass Apple’s payment systems. (I won’t discuss the Apple case more than this brief outline since I’m&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister/archives/38#:~:text=Ethics%20statement%2C%20June%202023%3A">ethically bound</a>.)</p><p>But the Google case took far longer to kick off, and it went very differently. I spent 15 days reporting live from the courtroom, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">I saw Epic show time and again</a> that Google was running scared, didn’t treat developers equally, and had something to hide. </p><p>The jury in <em>Epic v. Google</em> was thoroughly convinced: last December, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">it reached the unanimous verdict</a> that the Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service were an illegal monopoly and that many of the special deals it made with game developers and phone manufacturers were anticompetitive behavior.</p><div><p>“We’re going to tear the barriers down”</p></div><p>In August, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220491/epic-google-android-app-store-monopoly-remedies-hearing">Judge Donato warned</a> that Google would pay for its behavior. “We’re going to tear the barriers down, it’s just the way it’s going to happen,” he said. In remedy hearings, he rejected Google’s suggestions that meeting Epic’s demands would take too much work, cost too much money, or were impossible to arrange without taking substantial time.</p><p>It’s not yet clear whether Google will have to immediately follow the court’s demands, even though the permanent injunction will take effect November 1st. Google already promised to appeal the verdict, and it’s now apparently looking for an immediate stay — Google says it will ask to “<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">pause Epic’s requested changes” in this new blog post today</a>. </p><p>Like Apple, Google now hopes the appeals court will press pause on Judge Donato’s order while it tries its luck again. Apple spent years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826043/epic-apple-app-store-supreme-court-petition">delaying the anti-steering rules change</a> with its legal appeals.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker">Epic filed a second lawsuit against Google (and Samsung)</a> one week ago, arguing the companies were already attempting to sidestep this upcoming injunction by adding additional friction for third-party app stores. Since that case is now officially related to this one, Judge Donato will be hearing it as well.</p><p>Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve reached a major milestone in making any software run with WebAssembly.
Thanks to the newest release of Wasmer (4.4) and the Wasmer JS SDK (0.8.0) you can now run clang anywhere Wasmer runs!</p>
<p>This allows compiling C programs from virtually anywhere. Including Javascript and your preferred browser! (we tested Chrome, Safari and Firefox and everything is working like a charm).</p>
<p>For those eager to see it in action, head over to <a href="http://wasmer.sh/">wasmer.sh</a> to try a live demo (note: it requires a 100MB download):</p>
<pre><code># NOTE: this will download the clang package (100Mb), so it might take a while...
wasmer run clang/clang example.c -o example.wasm
wasmer run example.wasm
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: we <a href="https://x.com/wasmerio/status/1234903250249273344?lang=en">attempted running clang</a> few years ago, but because of WASI limitations we were unable to call <code>posix_spawn</code> which limited the usage and usability of clang in the browser, Firefox and Safari were not supported by then but are fully supported now.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Why is running <code>clang</code> with Wasmer useful, what use cases will enable?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can compile C code to WebAssembly easily just using the <code>wasmer</code> CLI: no toolchains or complex installations needed, install Wasmer and you are ready to go!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wasix.org/">WASIX</a> is now self-hosted meaning it can compile itself and any C programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can compile C projects directly from JavaScript! (Continue reading to learn how to use <code>clang</code> with the Wasmer JS SDK.)</p>
<p>We expect online IDEs to start adopting the SDK to allow their users compile and run C programs in the browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reproducible builds</strong> anywhere (using the same version of Wasmer)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enough with the tech talk—let’s see a demo!</p>
<p>Create a <code>donut.c</code> file with the following content (example taken from the awesome <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">Donut Math</a>):</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

             k;double sin()
         ,cos();main(){float A=
       0,B=0,i,j,z[1760];char b[
     1760];printf("\x1b[2J");for(;;
  ){memset(b,32,1760);memset(z,0,7040)
  ;for(j=0;6.28&gt;j;j+=0.07)for(i=0;6.28
 &gt;i;i+=0.02){float c=sin(i),d=cos(j),e=
 sin(A),f=sin(j),g=cos(A),h=d+2,D=1/(c*
 h*e+f*g+5),l=cos      (i),m=cos(B),n=s\
in(B),t=c*h*g-f*        e;int x=40+30*D*
(l*h*m-t*n),y=            12+15*D*(l*h*n
+t*m),o=x+80*y,          N=8*((f*e-c*d*g
 )*m-c*d*e-f*g-l        *d*n);if(22&gt;y&amp;&amp;
 y&gt;0&amp;&amp;x&gt;0&amp;&amp;80&gt;x&amp;&amp;D&gt;z[o]){z[o]=D;;;b[o]=
 ".,-~:;=!*#$@"[N&gt;0?N:0];}}/*#****!!-*/
  printf("\x1b[H");for(k=0;1761&gt;k;k++)
   putchar(k%80?b[k]:10);A+=0.04;B+=
     0.02;}}/*****####*******!!=;:~
       ~::==!!!**********!!!==::-
         .,~~;;;========;;;:~-.
             ..,--------,*/
</code></pre>
<p>We can run clang with Wasmer and compile it to WASI and WASIX (<em>just make sure <a href="https://docs.wasmer.io/install">you have Wasmer installed locally</a>!</em>):</p>
<pre><code>$ wasmer run clang/clang --dir=. -- -Wno-implicit-int donut.c -o donut.wasm
$ wasmer run donut.wasm
</code></pre>
<p>To run clang on your browser, you can try the following on <a href="https://wasmer.sh/">wasmer.sh</a> (we added <code>donut.c</code> to the <code>/home</code> dir so it’s easier to try):</p>
<pre><code>wasmer run clang/clang -Wno-implicit-int donut.c -o donut.wasm
wasmer run /home/donut.wasm
</code></pre>
<p>The exciting news is that the clang package can compile, not just the donut c example, but any <a href="https://github.com/wasix-org/wasix-libc/blob/main/examples">complicated examples</a> from WASIX.</p>
<p>And more importantly… it works fully in the browser! (and also via the Wasmer Javascript SDK, read below to check the example of how to run clang in any of your Javascript projects!)</p>
<p><img src="https://wasmer.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.wasmer.io%2Fimages%2Fclang-donut.original.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" alt="Donut compiled to Wasm in the browser"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the <code>clang/clang</code> package currently weights about 100Mb uncompressed (as it requires the clang binaries + the system libraries). We are working on reducing the size and also serving it in compressed format. So ideally you should just need to download ~30Mb to use clang with Wasmer: either in your local shell, in your browser or in your Javascript project!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Javascript SDK usage</h2>
<p>Do you want to use <code>clang</code> in your Javascript project? Thanks to our newly released <a href="http://wasmer.io/posts/introducing-wasmer-js-wdk">Wasmer JS</a> SDK you can do it easily, in both the browser and Node.js/Bun etc:</p>
<pre><code>
import {
  init,
  Wasmer,
  Directory
} from "https://unpkg.com/@wasmer/sdk@latest/dist/index.mjs";

await init();

const clang = await Wasmer.fromRegistry("clang/clang");
const project = new Directory();
await project.writeFile("example.c",
`#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
  printf("Hello World");
  return 0;
}
`);

let instance = await clang.entrypoint.run({
  args: ["/project/example.c", "-o", "/project/example.wasm"],
  mount: { "/project": project },
});
const output = await instance.wait();

if (!output.ok) {
  throw new Error(`Clang failed. Exit: ${output.code}:`);
}

// The generated wasm file from clang
let wasm = await project.readFile("example.wasm");

const example = await Wasmer.fromFile(wasm);
const result = await example.entrypoint.run();
const outputExample = await result.wait();

// This should be "Hello World"
console.log(outputExample.stdout);
</code></pre>
<p>You can find a working <code>index.html</code> file executing clang: <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js/blob/main/examples/clang-cdn/index.html">https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js/blob/main/examples/clang-cdn/index.html</a></p>
<h3>One last thing! 🪄</h3>
<p>Wasmer’s clang can even <strong>optimize the file for you automatically</strong> using <code>wasm-opt</code> under the hood (Clang automatically detects if <code>wasm-opt</code> is used, and it will be automatically called when optimizing the file)</p>
<pre><code>wasmer run clang/clang --use wasmer/wasm-opt --dir=. -- -o example.wasm -O2
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine using Emscripten without needing its toolchain installed—or even better, imagine running Emscripten in the browser. We've made this possible thanks to the <a href="https://wasix.org/"><strong>WASIX</strong></a> ecosystem 🎉.</p>
<h2>What’s coming next</h2>
<p>We are incredibly excited for this milestone, as it opens the door for many upcoming features that we are going to need in Wasmer and Wasmer Edge:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compiling <strong>native Python libraries</strong> directly from within WASIX. Imagine being able to have PIP compiling things in Wasm upon install, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>wasmer run python --entrypoint pip -- install numpy # This compiles numpy to WASIX, all within Wasmer processes
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using <strong><a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/py2wasm-a-python-to-wasm-compiler">py2wasm</a></strong> with a bundled compiler</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compiling <a href="https://medium.com/@elves.silva.vieira/javascript-achieves-breakthrough-performance-with-static-hermes-6286b0ac8ef7">Static Hermes</a> to WASIX, so we can generate native Wasm files from JS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New tooling? (any project depending on LLVM can now be easily compiled to WebAssembly!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the beginning of an awesome journey, we can't wait to see what you create next with this.</p>
<p>Feel free to give Wasmer a star if you liked the article or tell us how you are thinking on using the project:</p>

<p>Well, I guess I missed the memo, because <a href="https://jakelazaroff.github.io/htmx-spa/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">I used htmx to build a single-page app</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.github.io/htmx-spa/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">htmx spa</span>  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://jakelazaroff.github.io/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">jakelazaroff.github.io/htmx-spa/</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>.</p>
<p>It’s a simple proof of concept todo list.
Once the page is loaded, there is <em>no additional communication with a server</em>.
Everything happens locally on the client.</p>
<p>How does that work, given that htmx is focused on managing hypermedia exchanges over the network?</p>
<p>With one simple trick:<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-clickbait" id="user-content-fnref-clickbait" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup> the “server-side” code runs in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">service worker</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Service Worker API - Web APIs | MDN</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercept network requests, and take appropriate action based on whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, a service worker acts as a proxy between a webpage and the wider Internet.
It intercepts network requests and allows you to manipulate them.
You can alter requests, cache responses to be served offline or even create new responses out of whole cloth without ever sending the request beyond the browser.</p>
<p>That last capability is what powers this single-page app.
When htmx makes a network request, the service worker intercepts it.
The service worker then runs the business logic and generates new HTML, which htmx then swaps into the DOM.</p>
<p>There are a couple of advantages over a traditional single-page app built with something like React, too.
Service workers must use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">IndexedDB</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">IndexedDB API - Web APIs | MDN</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs.

The app also works offline, which doesn’t come for free but is pretty easy to add once the service worker is set up already.</p>
<p>Of course, service workers have a bunch of pitfalls as well.
One is the absolutely abysmal support in developer tools, which seem to intermittently swallow <code>console.log</code> and unreliably report when a service worker is installed.
Another is the lack of support for ES modules in Firefox, which forced me to put all my code (including a vendored version of <a href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">IDB Keyval</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://opengraph.githubassets.com/07f16bf35606046a6b0ae984536d6b4ffad2233d997114e353456a3b1973fe8b/jakearchibald/idb-keyval" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">GitHub - jakearchibald/idb-keyval: A super-simple-small promise-based keyval store implemented with IndexedDB</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">A super-simple-small promise-based keyval store implemented with IndexedDB - jakearchibald/idb-keyval</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>, which I included because IndexedDB is similarly annoying) in a single file.</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list!
I would describe the general experience of working with service workers as “not fun”.</p>

In spite of all that, the htmx single-page app works.

<p>This should look familiar if you’ve ever built a single-page app: the empty husk of an HTML document, waiting to be filled in by JavaScript.

<p>The interesting bit here is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, which uses htmx to set up the meat of the app:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hx-boost="true"</code> tells htmx to use Ajax to swap in the responses of link clicks and form submissions without a full page navigation</li>
<li><code>hx-push-url="false"</code> prevents htmx from updating the URL in response to said link clicks and form submissions</li>
<li><code>hx-get="./ui"</code> tells htmx to load the page at <code>/ui</code> and swap it in</li>
<li><code>hx-target="body"</code> tells htmx to swap the results into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element</li>
<li><code>hx-trigger="load"</code> tells htmx that it should do all this when the page loads</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically: <code>/ui</code> returns the actual markup for the app, at which point htmx takes over any links and forms to make it interactive.</p>
<p>What’s at <code>/ui</code>?
Enter the service worker!
It uses a small home-brewed Express-like “library” to handle boilerplate around routing requests and returning responses.
How that library actually works is beyond the scope of this post, but it’s used like this:</p>
<pre><code is:raw="">spa<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/ui"</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>_request<span>,</span> <span>{</span> query <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>When a <code>GET</code> request is made to <code>/ui</code>, this code…</p>
<ol>
<li>grabs the query string for the filter</li>
<li>saves the filter in IndexedDB</li>
<li>tells htmx to update the URL accordingly</li>
<li>renders the <code>App</code> “component” to HTML with the active filter and list of todos</li>
<li>returns the rendered HTML to the browser</li>
</ol>
<p><code>setFilter</code> and <code>listTodos</code> are pretty simple functions that wrap IDB Keyval:</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>(As before, we’ll skip some of the utility functions like <code>html</code>, which just provides some small conveniences when interpolating values.)</p>
<p><code>App</code> can be broken down into roughly three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>The filters form.
This renders a radio button for each filter.
When a radio button changes, it submits the form to <code>/ui</code>, which re-renders the app using the steps described above.
The<code>hx-boost</code> attribute from before intercepts the form submission and swaps the response back into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> without refreshing the page.</li>
<li>The todos list.
This loops over all the todos matching the current filter, rendering each using the <code>Todo</code> component.</li>
<li>The add todo form.
This is a form with an input that submits the value to <code>/todos/add</code>.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-get" id="user-content-fnref-get" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup>
<code>hx-target=".todos"</code> tells htmx to replace an element on the page with class <code>todos</code>; <code>hx-select=".todos"</code> tells htmx that rather than using the <em>entire</em> response, it should just use an element with class <code>todos</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at that <code>/todos/add</code> route:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>addTodo</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Pretty simple!
It just saves the todo and returns a response with the re-rendered UI, which htmx thens swap into the DOM.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at that <code>Todo</code> component from before:</p>

<p>First, the checkbox.
It triggers a <code>GET</code> request to <code>/todos/${id}/update</code> every time it’s checked or unchecked, with a query string <code>done</code> matching its current state; htmx swaps the full response into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s the code for that route:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>updateTodo</span><span>(</span><span>id<span>,</span> <span>{</span> text<span>,</span> done <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>await</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>"todos"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>todos <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    todos<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>todo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>todo<span>.</span>id <span>!==</span> id<span>)</span> <span>return</span> todo<span>;</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span>todo<span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>:</span> text <span>||</span> todo<span>.</span>text<span>,</span> <span>done</span><span>:</span> done <span>??</span> todo<span>.</span>done <span>}</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

spa<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/todos/:id/update"</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>_request<span>,</span> <span>{</span> params<span>,</span> query <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> updates <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>query<span>.</span>text<span>)</span> updates<span>.</span>text <span>=</span> query<span>.</span>text<span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>query<span>.</span>done<span>)</span> updates<span>.</span>done <span>=</span> query<span>.</span>done <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span><span>;</span>

  <span>await</span> <span>updateTodo</span><span>(</span>params<span>.</span>id<span>,</span> updates<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> html <span>=</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>filter</span><span>:</span> <span>await</span> <span>getFilter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>todos</span><span>:</span> <span>await</span> <span>listTodos</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span>html<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>(Notice that the route also supports changing the todo text. We’ll get to that in a minute.)</p>
<p>The delete button is even simpler: it makes a <code>DELETE</code> request to <code>/todos/${id}</code>.
As with the checkbox, htmx swaps the full response into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s that route:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>deleteTodo</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>await</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>"todos"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>todos <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> todos<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>todo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> todo<span>.</span>id <span>!==</span> id<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

spa<span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>"/todos/:id"</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>_request<span>,</span> <span>{</span> params <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>await</span> <span>deleteTodo</span><span>(</span>params<span>.</span>id<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> html <span>=</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>filter</span><span>:</span> <span>await</span> <span>getFilter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>todos</span><span>:</span> <span>await</span> <span>listTodos</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span>html<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>The final part is the todo text, which is made more complicated by the support for editing the text.
There are two possible states: “normal”, which just displays a simple <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with the todo text (I’m sorry that this isn’t accessible!) and “editing”, which displays an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> that allows the user to edit it.
The <code>Todo</code> component uses the <code>editing</code> “prop” to determine which state to render.</p>
<p>Unlike in a client-side framework like React, though, we can’t just toggle state somewhere and have it make the necessary DOM changes.
htmx makes a network request for the new UI, and we need to return a hypermedia response that it can then swap into the DOM.</p>
<p>Here’s the route:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getTodo</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> todos <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>listTodos</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> todos<span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>todo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> todo<span>.</span>id <span>===</span> id<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

spa<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/ui/todos/:id"</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>_request<span>,</span> <span>{</span> params<span>,</span> query <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> todo <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>getTodo</span><span>(</span>params<span>.</span>id<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>todo<span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>404</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> editable <span>=</span> query<span>.</span>editable <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> html <span>=</span> <span>Todo</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>...</span>todo<span>,</span> editable <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span>html<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>At a high level, the coordination between webpage and service worker looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>htmx listens for double-click events on todo text <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s</li>
<li>htmx makes a request to <code>/ui/todos/${id}?editable=true</code></li>
<li>The service worker returns the HTML for the <code>Todo</code> component that includes the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> rather than the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code></li>
<li>htmx swaps the current todo list item with the HTML from the response</li>
</ol>
<p>When the user changes the input, a similar process happens, calling the <code>/todos/${id}/update</code> endpoint instead and swapping the whole <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.
If you’ve used htmx, this should be a pretty familiar pattern.</p>
<p>That’s it!
We now have a single-page app built with htmx (and service workers) that doesn’t rely on a remote web server.

<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>So, this technically works.
Is it a good idea?
Is it the <em>apotheosis</em> of hypermedia-based applications?
Should we abandon React and build apps like this?</p>
<p>htmx works by adding indirection to the UI, loading new HTML from across a network boundary.
That can make sense in a client-server app, because it reduces indirection with regard to the <em>database</em> by colocating it with rendering.
On the other hand, the client-server story in a framework like React can be painful, requiring careful coordination between clients and servers via an awkward data exchange channel.</p>
<p>When all interactions are local, though, the rendering and data are <em>already</em> colocated (in memory) and updating them in tandem with a framework like React is easy and synchronous.
In this case, the indirection that htmx requires starts to feel more burdensome than liberatory.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-nojs" id="user-content-fnref-nojs" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">3</a></sup>
For fully local apps, I don’t think juice is worth the squeeze.</p>
<p>Of course, most apps aren’t <em>fully</em> local — usually, there’s a mix of local interactions and network requests.
My sense is that even in that case, <a href="https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">islands of interactivity</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ddxwdqwkr/image/upload/f_auto/v1633286240/patterns.dev/islandsarchitecture.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Islands Architecture</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The islands architecture encourages small, focused chunks of interactivity within server-rendered web pages</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://www.patterns.dev/img/favicon/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> is a better pattern than splitting your “server-side” code between the service worker and the actual server.</p>
<p>In any event, this was mostly an exercise to see what it might look like to build a fully local single-page app using hypermedia, rather than imperative or functional programming.</p>
<p>Note that hypermedia is a technique rather than a specific tool.
I chose htmx because it’s the hypermedia <del>library</del> <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/is-htmx-another-javascript-framework/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">framework</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://htmx.org/essays/is-htmx-another-javascript-framework/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">&lt;/&gt; htmx ~ Is htmx Just Another JavaScript Framework?</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">htmx gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext

    htmx is small (~14k min.gz’d), dependency-free, extendable, IE11 compatible &amp; has reduced code base sizes by 67% when compared with react</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://htmx.org/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">htmx.org/essays/is-htmx-another-javascript-framework/</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> <em>du jour</em>, and I wanted to stretch it as far as I could.
There are other tools like <a href="https://mavo.io/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Mavo</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://mavo.io/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://mavo.io/logo.svg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Mavo: A new, approachable way to create Web applications</span>  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://mavo.io/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">mavo.io</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> that explicitly focus on this use case, and indeed you can see that the <a href="https://mavo.io/demos/todo/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Mavo implementation of TodoMVC</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://mavo.io/demos/todo/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">To-Do List</span>  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://mavo.io/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">mavo.io/demos/todo/</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> is far simpler than what I’ve built here.
Better still would be some sort of HyperCard-esque app in which you could build the whole thing visually.</p>
<p>All in all, my little single-page htmx todo app was fun to build.
If nothing else, take this as a reminder that you can and should occasionally try using your tools in weird and unexpected ways!</p>

<p>htmx isn’t actually a required component of this architecture.
You could, in theory, build a fully client-side single-page app with no JavaScript at all (outside of the service worker) by simply wrapping every button in a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag and replacing the full page on every action.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="" height="1400" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/05/22/Chinese_hackers.png" width="2504"></p>
<p>Multiple U.S. broadband providers, including Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Lumen Technologies, have been breached by a Chinese hacking group tracked as Salt Typhoon, the Wall Street Journal reports.</p>
<p>The purpose of the attack appears to be for intelligence collection as the hackers might have had access to systems used by the U.S. federal government for court-authorized network wiretapping requests.</p>
<p>It is unclear when the intrusion occurred, but WSJ cites people familiar with the matter, saying that "for months or longer, the hackers might have held access to network infrastructure used to cooperate with lawful U.S. requests for communications data."</p>
<p>Salt Typhoon is the name that Microsoft gave to this particular China-based threat actor. Other cybersecurity companies are tracking the adversary as Earth Estries (Trend Micro), FamousSparrow (ESET), Ghost Emperor (Kaspersky), and UNC2286 (Mandiant, now part of Google Cloud).</p>
<h3>Capturing sensitive traffic</h3>
<p>According to the WSJ, the attack was discovered in recent weeks and is being investigated by the U.S. government and security experts in the private sector.</p>
<p>The impact of the attack&nbsp;- amount and type of observed and exfiltrated data - is still being assessed, people with information about the intrusion told WSJ.</p>
<p>“The hackers appear to have engaged in a vast collection of internet traffic from internet service providers that count businesses large and small, and millions of Americans, as their customers” - <a href="http://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wall Street Journal</a></p>
<p>Apart from breaching service providers in the U.S. Salt Typhoon may have hacked similar entities in other countries, too.</p>
<p>Salt Typhoon has been active since at least 2019 and is considered a sophisticated hacking group focusing on government entities and telecommunications companies typically in the Southeast Asia region.</p>
<p>Security researchers also found that the threat actor attacked hotels, engineering companies, and law firms in Brazil, Burkina Faso, South Africa, Canada, Israel, France, Guatemala, Lithuania, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The hackers usually obtain initial access to the target network by exploiting vulnerabilities, such as the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/more-hacking-groups-join-microsoft-exchange-attack-frenzy/" target="_blank">ProxyLogon vulnerabilities</a> in Microsoft Exchange Server (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065).</p>
<p>In previous attacks attributed to Salt Typhoon/Ghost Emperor, the threat actor used a custom backdoor called <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/09/23/famoussparrow-suspicious-hotel-guest/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SparrowDoor</a>, customized versions of the Mimikatz tool for extracting authentication data, and a Windows kernel-mode rootkit <a href="https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Demodex</a>.</p>
<p>Investigators are still looking for the initial access method for the recent attack. The WSJ says that one avenue being explored is gaining access to Cisco routers responsible for routing internet traffic.</p>
<p>However, a Cisco spokesperson told WSJ that the company was looking into the matter but had received no indication that Cisco networking equipment was involved in the breach.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer contacted AT&amp;T about the alleged breach and was told&nbsp;they "are not commenting on the WSJ report." Lumen also declined to comment.</p>
<p>Verizon has not responded to our emails, and we will&nbsp;update the story if we receive a reply.</p>
<p>Chinese APT hacking groups have been increasingly targeting U.S. and European networking devices and ISPs in cyberespionage attacks.</p>
<p>In August,&nbsp;cybersecurity researchers at Lumen's Black Lotus Labs disclosed that the Chinese threat actors known as "Volt Typhoon" exploited a zero-day flaw in Versa Director to steal credentials and breach corporate networks. During these attacks, the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-volt-typhoon-hackers-exploited-versa-zero-day-to-breach-isps-msps/" target="_blank">threat actors breached multiple ISPs and MSPs</a> in the U.S. and India, which is not believed to be related to the recent breaches.</p>
<p>In September, Black Lotus Labs and law enforcement <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flax-typhoon-hackers-infect-260-000-routers-ip-cameras-with-botnet-malware/" target="_blank">disrupted a massive Chinese botnet named "Raptor Train"</a> that compromised over&nbsp;260,000 SOHO routers, IP cameras with malware. This botnet was used by the "Flax Typhoon" threat actors for DDoS attacks and as a proxy to launch stealthy&nbsp;attacks on other organizations.</p>
<p>While these attacks have been attributed to different Chinese hacking groups, they are believed to operate under the same umbrella, commonly sharing infrastructure and tools.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2024/9/27/rails-8-beta1-no-paas-required">Rails 8 beta</a> has officially been released, bringing an exciting set
of features, bug fixes, and improvements. This version builds on the foundation
of
Rails 7.2,
while introducing new features and optimizations to make Rails development even
more productive and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Key highlights include an integration with Kamal 2 for hassle-free deployments, the
introduction of Propshaft as the new default asset pipeline, and extensive
ActiveRecord enhancements. Rails 8 also brings several SQLite integration upgrades
that make it a viable option for production use.</p>
<p>Let's dive in and explore everything that Rails 8 has to offer!</p>
<h2 id="effortless-deployments-with-kamal-2-and-thruster">Effortless Deployments with Kamal 2 and Thruster</h2>
<p>Rails 8 makes deploying your applications simple with
Kamal 2 and Thruster.</p>
<p><a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/">Kamal 2</a> reduces the need for reliance on managed cloud services and Platform as a Service (PaaS) platforms by
enabling quick and easy deployment to cloud VMs, bare metal servers, or VPS
environments in just minutes.</p>
<p>With a single command (<code>kamal setup</code>), you can set up a production-ready Rails
environment on a standard Linux box, making deployment both easy and
cost-effective.</p>
<p>Kamal 2 also integrates with <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/thruster">Thruster</a>, a custom proxy built specifically for
Rails that enables zero-downtime deployments, HTTP/2 support, automated SSL with
Let's Encrypt, Gzip compression, and easy hosting of multiple apps on a single
server — all without complex setup.</p>
<p>With Kamal 2 and Thruster, Rails 8 makes deploying apps easier than ever. And if
you prefer a different deployment setup, you can opt out using the
<code>--skip-kamal</code> flag to maintain your existing workflows.</p>
<h2 id="leaner-rails-deployments-with-solid-adapters">Leaner Rails Deployments with Solid Adapters</h2>
<p>One of the big improvements in Rails 8 is simpler deployments by reducing
the number of additional services needed to implement common web application
requirements.</p>
<p>Traditionally, if you required features like job queues, caching, and pub/sub
messaging, you'd use a combination of a database like PostgreSQL with Redis for
auxiliary functions.</p>
<p>With Rails 8, you can handle all these with just SQLite, thanks to three new
database-backed adapters: <a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_cable">Solid Cable</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_cache">Solid Cache</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_queue">Solid Queue</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Solid Cable</strong> is Rails' new default Action Cable adapter in production and
means you can drop the common dependency on Redis. It acts as the
pub/sub server, relaying messages between the app and connected clients using
fast polling through SQLite. Despite polling, Solid Cable's performance
is comparable to Redis in most situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solid Cache</strong> replaces the need for Redis by using disk storage instead of
RAM for caching. This approach allows for much larger, more cost-effective
caches that persist longer and handle more requests without sacrificing
performance. It also supports encrypted storage and retention policies to
meet privacy requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solid Queue</strong> replaces Redis for
<a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html">Active Job</a>
background processing, using the <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code> mechanism for
efficient job handling (compatible with PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite). It
includes essential features like concurrency control, retries, and recurring
jobs, and has proven itself at <a href="https://www.hey.com/">HEY</a>, where it now
manages 20 million jobs per day.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three adapters are designed around a simple idea: modern SSDs and NVMe
drives are fast enough to handle many tasks that previously required in-memory
solutions. By tapping into these speedy drives, Rails cuts out the need for
separate RAM-based tools like Redis.</p>

<h2 id="sqlite-is-ready-for-production">SQLite is Ready for Production</h2>
<p>Rails 8 takes SQLite from a lightweight development tool to a reliable choice
for production use, thanks to extensive work on the SQLite adapter and Ruby
driver.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the solid adapters discussed above, SQLite now has the
capability to power Action Cable, Rails.cache, and Active Job effectively,
expanding its role beyond just prototyping or testing environments.</p>
<p>Here are some key improvements to the SQLite integration in Rails 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-text search and virtual tables are now supported using
<code>create_virtual_table</code>.</li>
<li>The adapter now allows bulk insert fixtures for enhanced data seeding
performance.</li>
<li>Transactions default to <code>IMMEDIATE</code> mode to improve concurrency.</li>
<li>Enhanced error handling by translating <code>SQLite3::BusyException</code> into
<code>ActiveRecord::StatementTimeout</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-new-era-for-the-asset-pipeline-with-propshaft">A New Era for the Asset Pipeline with Propshaft</h2>
<p>Rails 8 also introduces <a href="https://github.com/rails/propshaft">Propshaft</a> as the
new asset pipeline default, replacing the long-standing
<a href="https://github.com/rails/sprockets">Sprockets</a> system. Sprockets served Rails
developers well for over a decade, but it was designed in a different era — before
the explosion of JavaScript build tools and modern browser improvements.</p>
<p>Propshaft reflects a simpler, modern approach to managing assets, built around
the core needs of today's developers. Its purpose is straightforward: to provide a
clear path for assets and apply digest stamps for caching.</p>
<p>Unlike Sprockets, which took on numerous additional tasks, Propshaft focuses
only on what's essential, fitting naturally with the new Rails philosophy of
keeping asset pipelines lean (while complex JavaScript handling is left to
specialized tools like Esbuild or Vite).</p>
<h2 id="built-in-authentication-made-simple">Built-In Authentication Made Simple</h2>
<p>Rails has been building the key components of authentication over the years,
from <code>has_secure_password</code> in Rails 5 to <code>normalizes</code>, <code>generates_token_for</code> and
<code>authenticate_by</code> in
<a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/02/15/whats-new-in-rails-7-1.html">Rails 7.1</a>.</p>
<p>With Rails 8, all these components come together to give you a straightforward
starting point for building a secure, session-based authentication system.</p>
<p>By running a single command, you can set up all the essentials for an
authentication system with database-backed sessions and password reset
functionality:</p>

<p>This command generates key files, including models, controllers, mailers, and
views:</p>

<p>This effectively puts you on the fast track to secure, production-ready
authentication. All that's left is to integrate a user sign-up flow
customized to your application's needs.</p>
<h2 id="new-script-folder-and-generator">New Script Folder and Generator</h2>
<p>Rails 8 introduces a new <code>script</code> folder dedicated to holding one-off or
general-purpose scripts, such as data migrations, cleanup tasks, or other
utility operations. This addition helps organize these scripts neatly, keeping
them separate from your main application logic.</p>
<p>To make script creation easier, a new script generator is available. You can
generate scripts with a simple command:</p>

<p>These commands create the corresponding script files, which you can then execute
with:</p>

<p>This streamlined approach keeps your application organized and makes handling
custom scripts more convenient and maintainable.</p>
<h2 id="a-slew-of-active-record-improvements">A Slew of Active Record Improvements</h2>
<p>Active Record has also seen major enhancements in Rails 8 to improve
performance, simplify migrations, improve troubleshooting, and provide better
support for complex database use cases.</p>
<p>Below are some of the key changes introduced in this latest version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rails 8 now distinguishes between <code>float4</code> and <code>float8</code> in PostgreSQL.</li>
<li><code>drop_table</code> now supports dropping multiple tables at once.</li>
<li>Support for PostgreSQL table inheritance and native partitioning has been
added.</li>
<li>Bulk inserts of fixtures are now supported to improve data seeding performance.</li>
<li>Migrating a fresh database now starts by loading the database schema before
running the migrations.</li>
<li><code>create_schema</code> and <code>drop_schema</code> operations are now reversible.</li>
<li>Rails 8 now requires MySQL 5.6.4 or later due to advancements like datetime
with precision.</li>
<li>Query log tags are enabled by default in development environments to trace SQL
statements back to the application code and identify which database is in use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Rails 8 introduces a range of impactful updates, from easier deployments with
Kamal and a modern asset pipeline to significant ActiveRecord enhancements and
improved production capabilities for SQLite.</p>
<p>These advancements not only boost developer productivity but also align with
modern best practices, allowing you to focus on building your application
instead of dealing with infrastructure complexities.</p>

			<h2>Richard P. Gabriel</h2>
		<h3>Lucid, Inc</h3>
		<p>{an excerpt from "Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big." [<a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WIB.html">html</a>]}</p>
		<h3>2.1 The Rise of <i>Worse is Better</i></h3>
		<p>I and just about every designer of Common Lisp and CLOS has had extreme exposure to the MIT/Stanford style of design. The essence of this style can be captured by the phrase <i>the right thing</i>. To such a designer it is important to get all of the following characteristics right:</p>
		<ul>
				<li>Simplicity -- the design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. It is more important for the interface to be simple than the implementation.
				</li><li>Correctness -- the design must be correct in all observable aspects. Incorrectness is simply not allowed.
				</li><li>Consistency -- the design must not be inconsistent. A design is allowed to be slightly less simple and less complete to avoid inconsistency. Consistency is as important as correctness.
				</li><li>Completeness -- the design must cover as many important situations as is practical. All reasonably expected cases must be covered. Simplicity is not allowed to overly reduce completeness.
			</li></ul>
			<p>I believe most people would agree that these are good characteristics. I will call the use of this philosophy of design the <i>MIT approach</i>. Common Lisp (with CLOS) and Scheme represent the MIT approach to design and implementation.</p>
			<p>The worse-is-better philosophy is only slightly different:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Simplicity -- the design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. It is more important for the implementation to be simple than the interface. Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design.
				</li><li>Correctness -- the design must be correct in all observable aspects. It is slightly better to be simple than correct.
				</li><li>Consistency -- the design must not be overly inconsistent. Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, but it is better to drop those parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances than to introduce either implementational complexity or inconsistency.
				</li><li>Completeness -- the design must cover as many important situations as is practical. All reasonably expected cases should be covered. Completeness can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality. In fact, completeness must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized. Consistency can be sacrificed to achieve completeness if simplicity is retained; especially worthless is consistency of interface.</li></ul>
			<p>Early Unix and C are examples of the use of this school of design, and I will call the use of this design strategy the <i>New Jersey approach</i>. I have intentionally caricatured the worse-is-better philosophy to convince you that it is obviously a bad philosophy and that the New Jersey approach is a bad approach.</p>
			<p>However, I believe that worse-is-better, even in its strawman form, has better survival characteristics than the-right-thing, and that the New Jersey approach when used for software is a better approach than the MIT approach.</p>
			<p>Let me start out by retelling a story that shows that the MIT/New-Jersey distinction is valid and that proponents of each philosophy actually believe their philosophy is better.</p>
			<p>Two famous people, one from MIT and another from Berkeley (but working on Unix) once met to discuss operating system issues. The person from MIT was knowledgeable about ITS (the MIT AI Lab operating system) and had been reading the Unix sources. He was interested in how Unix solved the PC loser-ing problem. The PC loser-ing problem occurs when a user program invokes a system routine to perform a lengthy operation that might have significant state, such as IO buffers. If an interrupt occurs during the operation, the state of the user program must be saved. Because the invocation of the system routine is usually a single instruction, the PC of the user program does not adequately capture the state of the process. The system routine must either back out or press forward. The right thing is to back out and restore the user program PC to the instruction that invoked the system routine so that resumption of the user program after the interrupt, for example, re-enters the system routine. It is called <i>PC loser-ing</i> because the PC is being coerced into <i>loser mode</i>, where <i>loser</i> is the affectionate name for <i>user</i> at MIT.</p>
			<p>The MIT guy did not see any code that handled this case and asked the New Jersey guy how the problem was handled. The New Jersey guy said that the Unix folks were aware of the problem, but the solution was for the system routine to always finish, but sometimes an error code would be returned that signaled that the system routine had failed to complete its action. A correct user program, then, had to check the error code to determine whether to simply try the system routine again. The MIT guy did not like this solution because it was not the right thing.</p>
			<p>The New Jersey guy said that the Unix solution was right because the design philosophy of Unix was simplicity and that the right thing was too complex. Besides, programmers could easily insert this extra test and loop. The MIT guy pointed out that the implementation was simple but the interface to the functionality was complex. The New Jersey guy said that the right tradeoff has been selected in Unix -- namely, implementation simplicity was more important than interface simplicity.</p>
			<p>The MIT guy then muttered that sometimes it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken, but the New Jersey guy didn’t understand (I’m not sure I do either).</p>
			<p>Now I want to argue that worse-is-better is better. C is a programming language designed for writing Unix, and it was designed using the New Jersey approach. C is therefore a language for which it is easy to write a decent compiler, and it requires the programmer to write text that is easy for the compiler to interpret. Some have called C a fancy assembly language. Both early Unix and C compilers had simple structures, are easy to port, require few machine resources to run, and provide about 50%-80% of what you want from an operating system and programming language.</p>
			<p>Half the computers that exist at any point are worse than median (smaller or slower). Unix and C work fine on them. The worse-is-better philosophy means that implementation simplicity has highest priority, which means Unix and C are easy to port on such machines. Therefore, one expects that if the 50% functionality Unix and C support is satisfactory, they will start to appear everywhere. And they have, haven’t they?</p>
			<p>Unix and C are the ultimate computer viruses.</p>
			<p>A further benefit of the worse-is-better philosophy is that the programmer is conditioned to sacrifice some safety, convenience, and hassle to get good performance and modest resource use. Programs written using the New Jersey approach will work well both in small machines and large ones, and the code will be portable because it is written on top of a virus.</p>
			<p>It is important to remember that the initial virus has to be basically good. If so, the viral spread is assured as long as it is portable. Once the virus has spread, there will be pressure to improve it, possibly by increasing its functionality closer to 90%, but users have already been conditioned to accept worse than the right thing. Therefore, the worse-is-better software first will gain acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing. In concrete terms, even though Lisp compilers in 1987 were about as good as C compilers, there are many more compiler experts who want to make C compilers better than want to make Lisp compilers better.</p>
			<p>The good news is that in 1995 we will have a good operating system and programming language; the bad news is that they will be Unix and C++.</p>
			<p>There is a final benefit to worse-is-better. Because a New Jersey language and system are not really powerful enough to build complex monolithic software, large systems must be designed to reuse components. Therefore, a tradition of integration springs up.</p>
			<p>How does the right thing stack up? There are two basic scenarios: the <i>big complex system scenario</i> and the <i>diamond-like jewel</i> scenario.</p>
			<p>The <i>big complex system</i> scenario goes like this:</p>
			<p>First, the right thing needs to be designed. Then its implementation needs to be designed. Finally it is implemented. Because it is the right thing, it has nearly 100% of desired functionality, and implementation simplicity was never a concern so it takes a long time to implement. It is large and complex. It requires complex tools to use properly. The last 20% takes 80% of the effort, and so the right thing takes a long time to get out, and it only runs satisfactorily on the most sophisticated hardware.</p>
			<p>The <i>diamond-like jewel</i> scenario goes like this:</p>
			<p>The right thing takes forever to design, but it is quite small at every point along the way. To implement it to run fast is either impossible or beyond the capabilities of most implementors.</p>
			<p>The two scenarios correspond to Common Lisp and Scheme.</p>
			<p>The first scenario is also the scenario for classic artificial intelligence software.</p>
			<p>The right thing is frequently a monolithic piece of software, but for no reason other than that the right thing is often designed monolithically. That is, this characteristic is a happenstance.</p>
			<p>The lesson to be learned from this is that it is often undesirable to go for the right thing first. It is better to get half of the right thing available so that it spreads like a virus. Once people are hooked on it, take the time to improve it to 90% of the right thing.</p>
			<p>A wrong lesson is to take the parable literally and to conclude that C is the right vehicle for AI software. The 50% solution has to be basically right, and in this case it isn’t.</p>
		<p>But, one can conclude only that the Lisp community needs to seriously rethink its position on Lisp design. I will say more about this later.</p>

<h2>Summary – Release Highlights<a href="#summary-release-highlights" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python 3.13 is the latest stable release of the Python programming
language, with a mix of changes to the language, the implementation
and the standard library.
The biggest changes include a new <a href="#whatsnew313-better-interactive-interpreter">interactive interpreter</a>,
experimental support for running in a <a href="#whatsnew313-free-threaded-cpython">free-threaded mode</a> (<span id="index-1"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/"><strong>PEP 703</strong></a>),
and a <a href="#whatsnew313-jit-compiler">Just-In-Time compiler</a> (<span id="index-2"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0744/"><strong>PEP 744</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Error messages continue to improve, with tracebacks now highlighted in color
by default. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functions.html#locals" title="locals"><code><span>locals()</span></code></a> builtin now has <a href="#whatsnew313-locals-semantics"><span>defined semantics</span></a> for changing the returned mapping,
and type parameters now support default values.</p>
<p>The library changes contain removal of deprecated APIs and modules,
as well as the usual improvements in user-friendliness and correctness.
Several legacy standard library modules have now <a href="#whatsnew313-pep594">been removed</a> following their deprecation in Python 3.11 (<span id="index-3"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/"><strong>PEP 594</strong></a>).</p>
<p>This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification
of all new features, but instead gives a convenient overview.
For full details refer to the documentation,
such as the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/index.html#library-index"><span>Library Reference</span></a>
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/index.html#reference-index"><span>Language Reference</span></a>.
To understand the complete implementation and design rationale for a change,
refer to the PEP for a particular new feature;
but note that PEPs usually are not kept up-to-date
once a feature has been fully implemented.

<section id="free-threaded-cpython">
<span id="whatsnew313-free-threaded-cpython"></span><h3>Free-threaded CPython<a href="#free-threaded-cpython" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>CPython now has experimental support for running in a free-threaded mode,
with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock"><span>global interpreter lock</span></a> (GIL) disabled.
This is an experimental feature and therefore is not enabled by default.
The free-threaded mode requires a different executable,
usually called <code><span>python3.13t</span></code> or <code><span>python3.13t.exe</span></code>.
Pre-built binaries marked as <em>free-threaded</em> can be installed as part of
the official <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/windows.html#install-freethreaded-windows"><span>Windows</span></a>
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/mac.html#install-freethreaded-macos"><span>macOS</span></a> installers,
or CPython can be built from source with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/configure.html#cmdoption-disable-gil"><code><span>--disable-gil</span></code></a> option.</p>
<p>Free-threaded execution allows for full utilization of the available
processing power by running threads in parallel on available CPU cores.
While not all software will benefit from this automatically, programs
designed with threading in mind will run faster on multi-core hardware.
<strong>The free-threaded mode is experimental</strong> and work is ongoing to improve it:
expect some bugs and a substantial single-threaded performance hit.
Free-threaded builds of CPython support optionally running with the GIL
enabled at runtime using the environment variable <span id="index-21"></span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_GIL"><code><span>PYTHON_GIL</span></code></a> or
the command-line option <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X"><code><span>-X</span> <span>gil=1</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>To check if the current interpreter supports free-threading, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-V"><code><span>python</span> <span>-VV</span></code></a>
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/sys.html#sys.version" title="sys.version"><code><span>sys.version</span></code></a> contain “experimental free-threading build”.
The new <code><span>sys._is_gil_enabled()</span></code> function can be used to check whether
the GIL is actually disabled in the running process.</p>
<p>C-API extension modules need to be built specifically for the free-threaded
build. Extensions that support running with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/glossary.html#term-GIL"><span>GIL</span></a> disabled should
use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/module.html#c.Py_mod_gil" title="Py_mod_gil"><code><span>Py_mod_gil</span></code></a> slot. Extensions using single-phase init should
use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/module.html#c.PyUnstable_Module_SetGIL" title="PyUnstable_Module_SetGIL"><code><span>PyUnstable_Module_SetGIL()</span></code></a> to indicate whether they support
running with the GIL disabled. Importing C extensions that don’t use these
mechanisms will cause the GIL to be enabled, unless the GIL was explicitly
disabled with the <span id="index-22"></span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_GIL"><code><span>PYTHON_GIL</span></code></a> environment variable or the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X"><code><span>-X</span> <span>gil=0</span></code></a> option.
pip 24.1 or newer is required to install packages with C extensions in the
free-threaded build.</p>
<p>This work was made possible thanks to many individuals and
organizations, including the large community of contributors to Python
and third-party projects to test and enable free-threading support.
Notable contributors include:
Sam Gross, Ken Jin, Donghee Na, Itamar Oren, Matt Page, Brett Simmers,
Dino Viehland, Carl Meyer, Nathan Goldbaum, Ralf Gommers,
Lysandros Nikolaou, and many others.
Many of these contributors are employed by Meta, which has
provided significant engineering resources to support this project.</p>

<span id="whatsnew313-jit-compiler"></span><h3>An experimental just-in-time (JIT) compiler<a href="#an-experimental-just-in-time-jit-compiler" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When CPython is configured and built using
the <code><span>--enable-experimental-jit</span></code> option,
a just-in-time (JIT) compiler is added which may speed up some Python programs.
On Windows, use <code><span>PCbuild/build.bat</span> <span>--experimental-jit</span></code> to enable the JIT
or <code><span>--experimental-jit-interpreter</span></code> to enable the Tier 2 interpreter.
Build requirements and further supporting information <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Tools/jit/README.md">are contained at</a>
<code><span>Tools/jit/README.md</span></code>.</p>
<p>The <code><span>--enable-experimental-jit</span></code> option takes these (optional) values,
defaulting to <code><span>yes</span></code> if <code><span>--enable-experimental-jit</span></code> is present
without the optional value.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code><span>no</span></code>: Disable the entire Tier 2 and JIT pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>yes</span></code>: Enable the JIT.
To disable the JIT at runtime, pass the environment variable <code><span>PYTHON_JIT=0</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>yes-off</span></code>: Build the JIT but disable it by default.
To enable the JIT at runtime, pass the environment variable <code><span>PYTHON_JIT=1</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>interpreter</span></code>: Enable the Tier 2 interpreter but disable the JIT.
The interpreter can be disabled by running with <code><span>PYTHON_JIT=0</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The internal architecture is roughly as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We start with specialized <em>Tier 1 bytecode</em>.
See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.11.html#whatsnew311-pep659"><span>What’s new in 3.11</span></a> for details.</p></li>
<li><p>When the Tier 1 bytecode gets hot enough, it gets translated
to a new purely internal intermediate representation (IR),
called the <em>Tier 2 IR</em>, and sometimes referred to as micro-ops (“uops”).</p></li>
<li><p>The Tier 2 IR uses the same stack-based virtual machine as Tier 1,
but the instruction format is better suited to translation to machine code.</p></li>
<li><p>We have several optimization passes for Tier 2 IR, which are applied
before it is interpreted or translated to machine code.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a Tier 2 interpreter, but it is mostly intended for debugging
the earlier stages of the optimization pipeline.
The Tier 2 interpreter can be enabled by configuring Python
with <code><span>--enable-experimental-jit=interpreter</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When the JIT is enabled, the optimized
Tier 2 IR is translated to machine code, which is then executed.</p></li>
<li><p>The machine code translation process uses a technique called
<em>copy-and-patch</em>. It has no runtime dependencies, but there is a new
build-time dependency on LLVM.</p></li>

<section id="defined-mutation-semantics-for-locals">
<span id="whatsnew313-locals-semantics"></span><h3>Defined mutation semantics for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functions.html#locals" title="locals"><code><span>locals()</span></code></a><a href="#defined-mutation-semantics-for-locals" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Historically, the expected result of mutating the return value of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functions.html#locals" title="locals"><code><span>locals()</span></code></a> has been left to individual Python implementations to define.
Starting from Python 3.13, <span id="index-25"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0667/"><strong>PEP 667</strong></a> standardises
the historical behavior of CPython for most code execution scopes,
but changes <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/glossary.html#term-optimized-scope"><span>optimized scopes</span></a>
(functions, generators, coroutines, comprehensions, and generator expressions)
to explicitly return independent snapshots of the currently assigned local
variables, including locally referenced nonlocal variables captured in closures.</p>
<p>This change to the semantics of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functions.html#locals" title="locals"><code><span>locals()</span></code></a> in optimized scopes also
affects the default behavior of code execution functions that implicitly
target <code><span>locals()</span></code> if no explicit namespace is provided
(such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functions.html#exec" title="exec"><code><span>exec()</span></code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functions.html#eval" title="eval"><code><span>eval()</span></code></a>).
In previous versions, whether or not changes could be accessed by calling
<code><span>locals()</span></code> after calling the code execution function was
implementation-dependent. In CPython specifically, such code would typically
appear to work as desired, but could sometimes fail in optimized scopes based
on other code (including debuggers and code execution tracing tools)
potentially resetting the shared snapshot in that scope.
Now, the code will always run against an independent snapshot of
the local variables in optimized scopes, and hence the changes will never
be visible in subsequent calls to <code><span>locals()</span></code>.
To access the changes made in these cases, an explicit namespace reference
must now be passed to the relevant function.
Alternatively, it may make sense to update affected code to use a higher level
code execution API that returns the resulting code execution namespace
(e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/runpy.html#runpy.run_path" title="runpy.run_path"><code><span>runpy.run_path()</span></code></a> when executing Python files from disk).</p>
<p>To ensure debuggers and similar tools can reliably update local variables in
scopes affected by this change, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_locals" title="frame.f_locals"><code><span>FrameType.f_locals</span></code></a> now
returns a write-through proxy to the frame’s local and locally referenced
nonlocal variables in these scopes, rather than returning an inconsistently
updated shared <code><span>dict</span></code> instance with undefined runtime semantics.</p>
<p>See <span id="index-26"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0667/"><strong>PEP 667</strong></a> for more details, including related C API changes
and deprecations. Porting notes are also provided below for the affected

<ul>
<li><p>The compiler now strips common leading whitespace

an external cancellation collides with an internal cancellation.
For example, when two task groups are nested
and both experience an exception in a child task simultaneously,
it was possible that the outer task group would hang,
because its internal cancellation was swallowed by the inner task group.</p>
<p>In the case where a task group is cancelled externally
and also must raise an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup" title="ExceptionGroup"><code><span>ExceptionGroup</span></code></a>,

This ensures that a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError" title="asyncio.CancelledError"><code><span>CancelledError</span></code></a> will be raised
at the next <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/expressions.html#await"><code><span>await</span></code></a>, so the cancellation is not lost.</p>
<p>An added benefit of these changes is that task groups now preserve
the cancellation count (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task.cancelling" title="asyncio.Task.cancelling"><code><span>cancelling()</span></code></a>).</p>

<ul id="pep667-porting-notes-py">
<li><p><a href="#whatsnew313-locals-semantics"><span>PEP 667</span></a> introduces several changes
to the semantics of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functions.html#locals" title="locals"><code><span>locals()</span></code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_locals" title="frame.f_locals"><code><span>f_locals</span></code></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functions.html#locals" title="locals"><code><span>locals()</span></code></a> in an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/glossary.html#term-optimized-scope"><span>optimized scope</span></a> now produces an
independent snapshot on each call, and hence no longer implicitly updates
previously returned references. Obtaining the legacy CPython behavior now
requires explicit calls to update the initially returned dictionary with the
results of subsequent calls to <code><span>locals()</span></code>. Code execution functions that
implicitly target <code><span>locals()</span></code> (such as <code><span>exec</span></code> and <code><span>eval</span></code>) must be
passed an explicit namespace to access their results in an optimized scope.
(Changed as part of <span id="index-58"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0667/"><strong>PEP 667</strong></a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functions.html#locals" title="locals"><code><span>locals()</span></code></a> from a comprehension at module or class scope
(including via <code><span>exec</span></code> or <code><span>eval</span></code>) once more behaves as if the comprehension
were running as an independent nested function (i.e. the local variables from
the containing scope are not included). In Python 3.12, this had changed
to include the local variables from the containing scope when implementing
<span id="index-59"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0709/"><strong>PEP 709</strong></a>. (Changed as part of <span id="index-60"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0667/"><strong>PEP 667</strong></a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Accessing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_locals" title="frame.f_locals"><code><span>FrameType.f_locals</span></code></a> in an
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/glossary.html#term-optimized-scope"><span>optimized scope</span></a> now returns a write-through proxy rather than a
snapshot that gets updated at ill-specified times. If a snapshot is desired,
it must be created explicitly with <code><span>dict</span></code> or the proxy’s <code><span>.copy()</span></code> method.
(Changed as part of <span id="index-61"></span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0667/"><strong>PEP 667</strong></a>.)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functools.html#functools.partial" title="functools.partial"><code><span>functools.partial</span></code></a> now emits a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/exceptions.html#FutureWarning" title="FutureWarning"><code><span>FutureWarning</span></code></a>
when used as a method.
The behavior will change in future Python versions.

for any failure to retrieve a username,

<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Maildir" title="mailbox.Maildir"><code><span>mailbox.Maildir</span></code></a> now ignores files with a leading dot (<code><span>.</span></code>).

files and directories if a pattern that ends with “<code><span>**</span></code>” is given,
rather than directories only.
Add a trailing slash to keep the previous behavior and only match directories.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/threading.html#module-threading" title="threading: Thread-based parallelism."><code><span>threading</span></code></a> module now expects the <code><span>_thread</span></code> module
to have an <code><span>_is_main_interpreter()</span></code> function.
This function takes no arguments and returns <code><span>True</span></code>
if the current interpreter is the main interpreter.</p>
<p>Any library or application that provides a custom <code><span>_thread</span></code> module
must provide <code><span>_is_main_interpreter()</span></code>,
just like the module’s other “private” attributes.

<ul>
<li><p><code><span>Python.h</span></code> no longer includes the <code><span>&lt;ieeefp.h&gt;</span></code> standard header. It was
included for the <code><span>finite()</span></code> function which is now provided by the
<code><span>&lt;math.h&gt;</span></code> header. It should now be included explicitly if needed. Remove
also the <code><span>HAVE_IEEEFP_H</span></code> macro.
(Contributed by Victor Stinner in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108765">gh-108765</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>Python.h</span></code> no longer includes these standard header files: <code><span>&lt;time.h&gt;</span></code>,
<code><span>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</span></code> and <code><span>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</span></code>. If needed, they should now be
included explicitly. For example, <code><span>&lt;time.h&gt;</span></code> provides the <code><span>clock()</span></code> and
<code><span>gmtime()</span></code> functions, <code><span>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</span></code> provides the <code><span>select()</span></code>
function, and <code><span>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</span></code> provides the <code><span>futimes()</span></code>, <code><span>gettimeofday()</span></code>
and <code><span>setitimer()</span></code> functions.
(Contributed by Victor Stinner in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108765">gh-108765</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>On Windows, <code><span>Python.h</span></code> no longer includes the <code><span>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</span></code> standard
header file. If needed, it should now be included explicitly. For example, it
provides <code><span>offsetof()</span></code> function, and <code><span>size_t</span></code> and <code><span>ptrdiff_t</span></code> types.
Including <code><span>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</span></code> explicitly was already needed by all other
platforms, the <code><span>HAVE_STDDEF_H</span></code> macro is only defined on Windows.
(Contributed by Victor Stinner in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108765">gh-108765</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>If the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/stable.html#c.Py_LIMITED_API" title="Py_LIMITED_API"><code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code></a> macro is defined, <code><span>Py_BUILD_CORE</span></code>,
<code><span>Py_BUILD_CORE_BUILTIN</span></code> and <code><span>Py_BUILD_CORE_MODULE</span></code> macros
are now undefined by <code><span>&lt;Python.h&gt;</span></code>.
(Contributed by Victor Stinner in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/85283">gh-85283</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>The old trashcan macros <code><span>Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_BEGIN</span></code> and <code><span>Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_END</span></code>
were removed. They should be replaced by the new macros <code><span>Py_TRASHCAN_BEGIN</span></code>
and <code><span>Py_TRASHCAN_END</span></code>.</p>
<p>A <code><span>tp_dealloc</span></code> function that has the old macros, such as:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>mytype_dealloc</span><span>(</span><span>mytype</span> <span>*</span><span>p</span><span>)</span>

    <span>PyObject_GC_UnTrack</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>);</span>
    <span>Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_BEGIN</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>);</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_END</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>should migrate to the new macros as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>mytype_dealloc</span><span>(</span><span>mytype</span> <span>*</span><span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject_GC_UnTrack</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>);</span>

    <span>...</span>
    <span>Py_TRASHCAN_END</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that <code><span>Py_TRASHCAN_BEGIN</span></code> has a second argument which
should be the deallocation function it is in. The new macros were
added in Python 3.8 and the old macros were deprecated in Python 3.11.

<ul id="pep667-porting-notes-c">
<li><p><a href="#whatsnew313-locals-semantics"><span>PEP 667</span></a> introduces several changes
to frame-related functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The effects of mutating the dictionary returned from
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/reflection.html#c.PyEval_GetLocals" title="PyEval_GetLocals"><code><span>PyEval_GetLocals()</span></code></a> in an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/glossary.html#term-optimized-scope"><span>optimized scope</span></a> have changed.
New dict entries added this way will now <em>only</em> be visible to
subsequent <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/reflection.html#c.PyEval_GetLocals" title="PyEval_GetLocals"><code><span>PyEval_GetLocals()</span></code></a> calls in that frame,
as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_GetLocals" title="PyFrame_GetLocals"><code><span>PyFrame_GetLocals()</span></code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/functions.html#locals" title="locals"><code><span>locals()</span></code></a>,
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/datamodel.html#frame.f_locals" title="frame.f_locals"><code><span>FrameType.f_locals</span></code></a> no longer access
the same underlying cached dictionary.
Changes made to entries for actual variable names and names added via
the write-through proxy interfaces will be overwritten on subsequent calls
to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/reflection.html#c.PyEval_GetLocals" title="PyEval_GetLocals"><code><span>PyEval_GetLocals()</span></code></a> in that frame.
The recommended code update depends on how the function was being used,
so refer to the deprecation notice on the function for details.</p></li>
<li><p>Calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_GetLocals" title="PyFrame_GetLocals"><code><span>PyFrame_GetLocals()</span></code></a> in an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/glossary.html#term-optimized-scope"><span>optimized scope</span></a>
now returns a write-through proxy rather than a snapshot
that gets updated at ill-specified times.
If a snapshot is desired, it must be created explicitly
(e.g. with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/dict.html#c.PyDict_Copy" title="PyDict_Copy"><code><span>PyDict_Copy()</span></code></a>),
or by calling the new <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/reflection.html#c.PyEval_GetFrameLocals" title="PyEval_GetFrameLocals"><code><span>PyEval_GetFrameLocals()</span></code></a> API.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>PyFrame_FastToLocals()</span></code> and <code><span>PyFrame_FastToLocalsWithError()</span></code>
no longer have any effect.
Calling these functions has been redundant since Python 3.11,
when <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_GetLocals" title="PyFrame_GetLocals"><code><span>PyFrame_GetLocals()</span></code></a> was first introduced.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>PyFrame_LocalsToFast()</span></code> no longer has any effect.
Calling this function is redundant now that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/c-api/frame.html#c.PyFrame_GetLocals" title="PyFrame_GetLocals"><code><span>PyFrame_GetLocals()</span></code></a>
returns a write-through proxy for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/glossary.html#term-optimized-scope"><span>optimized scopes</span></a>.</p></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>One morning in February, Katie Porter was sitting in bed, futzing around on her computer, when she learned that she was the target of a vast techno-political conspiracy. For the past five years, Porter had served in the House of Representatives on behalf of Orange County, California. She’d become famous—at least, C-<em>span</em> and MSNBC famous—for her eviscerations of business tycoons, often aided by a whiteboard that she used to make camera-friendly presentations about corporate greed. Now she was in a highly competitive race to replace the California senator Dianne Feinstein, who had died a few months earlier. The primary was in three weeks.</p><p>A text from a campaign staffer popped up on Porter’s screen. The staffer had just learned that a group named Fairshake was buying airtime in order to mount a last-minute blitz to oppose her candidacy. Indeed, the group was planning to spend roughly ten million dollars.</p><p>Porter was bewildered. She had raised thirty million dollars to bankroll her entire campaign, and that had taken years. The idea that some unknown group would swoop in and spend a fortune attacking her, she told me, seemed ludicrous: “I was, like, ‘What the heck is <em>Fairshake</em>?’&nbsp;”</p><p>Porter did some frantic Googling and discovered that Fairshake was a super <em>PAC</em> funded primarily by three tech firms involved in the cryptocurrency industry. In the House, Porter had been loosely affiliated with Senator Elizabeth Warren, an outspoken advocate of financial regulation, and with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But Porter hadn’t been particularly vocal about cryptocurrency; she hadn’t taken much of a position on the industry one way or the other. As she continued investigating Fairshake, she found that her neutrality didn’t matter. A Web site politically aligned with Fairshake had deemed her “very anti-crypto”—though the evidence offered for this verdict was factually incorrect. The site claimed that she had opposed a pro-crypto bill in a House committee vote: in fact, she wasn’t on the committee and hadn’t voted at all.</p><p>Soon afterward, Fairshake began airing attack ads on television. They didn’t mention cryptocurrencies or anything tech-related. Rather, they called Porter a “bully” and a “liar,” and falsely implied that she’d recently accepted campaign contributions from major pharmaceutical and oil companies. Nothing in the ads disclosed Fairshake’s affiliation with Silicon Valley, its support of cryptocurrency, or its larger political aims. The negative campaign had a palpable effect: Porter, who had initially polled well, lost decisively in the primary, coming in third, with just fifteen per cent of the vote. But, according to a person familiar with Fairshake, the super <em>PAC</em>’s intent wasn’t simply to damage her. The group’s backers didn’t care all that much about Porter. Rather, the person familiar with Fairshake said, the goal of the attack campaign was to terrify other politicians—“to warn anyone running for office that, if you are anti-crypto, the industry will come after you.”</p><p>The super <em>PAC</em> and two affiliates soon revealed in federal filings that they had collected more than a hundred and seventy million dollars, which they could spend on political races across the nation in 2024, with more donations likely to come. That was more than nearly any other super <em>PAC</em>, including Preserve America, which supports Donald Trump, and WinSenate, which aims to help Democrats reclaim that chamber. Pro-crypto donors are responsible for almost half of all corporate donations to <em>PAC</em>s in the 2024 election cycle, and the tech industry has become one of the largest corporate donors in the nation. The point of all that money, like of the attack on Porter, has been to draw attention to Silicon Valley’s financial might—and to prove that its leaders are capable of political savagery in order to protect their interests. “It’s a simple message,” the person familiar with Fairshake said. “If you are pro-crypto, we will help you, and if you are anti we will tear you apart.”</p><p>After Porter’s defeat, it became obvious that the super <em>PAC</em>’s message had been received by politicians elsewhere. Candidates in New York, Arizona, Maryland, and Michigan began releasing crypto-friendly public statements and voting for pro-crypto bills. When Porter tried to explain to her three children why she had lost, part of the lesson focussed on the Realpolitik of wealth and elections. “When you have members who are afraid of ten million dollars being spent overnight against them, the will in Washington to do what’s right disappears pretty quickly,” she recalls saying. “This was naked political power designed to influence votes in Washington. And it worked.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60545&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60545" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“And I’m saying <em>you</em> need to come look at <em>this</em>.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Roland High</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Porter’s defeat, in fact, was the culmination of a strategy that had begun more than a decade earlier to turn Silicon Valley into the most powerful political operation in the nation. As the tech industry has become the planet’s dominant economic force, a coterie of specialists—led, in part, by the political operative who introduced the idea of “a vast right-wing conspiracy” decades ago—have taught Silicon Valley how to play the game of politics. Their aim is to help tech leaders become as powerful in Washington, D.C., and in state legislatures as they are on Wall Street. It is likely that in the coming decades these efforts will affect everything from Presidential races to which party controls Congress and how antitrust and artificial intelligence are regulated. Now that the tech industry has quietly become one of the most powerful lobbying forces in American politics, it is wielding that power as previous corporate special interests have: to bully, cajole, and remake the nation as it sees fit.</p><p>Chris Lehane was just shy of thirty years old when he came up with the notion of “a vast right-wing conspiracy,” to explain Republican efforts to undermine Bill and Hillary Clinton. It was such an inspired bit of showmanship that Hillary Clinton adopted it as one of her signature lines. At the time, Lehane was a lawyer in the Clinton White House tasked with defending the Administration from charges of scandal, but he specialized in seizing control of the political conversation, finding colorful ways to put Republicans on defense. Tactics such as declaring that the President of the United States was the victim of a shadowy conservative cabal were so effective that the <em>Times</em> later declared Lehane to be the modern-day “master of the political dark arts.”</p><p>After serving in the White House, Lehane joined Al Gore’s Presidential campaign, as press secretary, and after Gore’s defeat he set up shop in San Francisco. Despite the size and the electoral significance of California, many campaign operatives viewed the state as a political backwater, because it was so far away from Washington. But Lehane, who had worked on the Telecommunications Act of 1996, was convinced that Silicon Valley was the future, and he quickly built a business providing his dark arts to wealthy Californians. When trial lawyers wanted to increase the state’s caps on medical-malpractice jury awards, they brought in Lehane, who helped send voters flyers that looked like cadaver toe tags, and produced ads implying that doctors might be performing surgery while drunk. A few years later, when a prominent environmentalist hired Lehane to campaign against the Keystone XL Pipeline, he sent activists into press conferences carrying vials of sludge from an oil spill; the sludge was so noxious that reporters fled the room. Then he hired one of the Navy <em>SEAL</em>s who had helped kill Osama bin Laden to talk to journalists and explain that if the pipeline were approved a terrorist attack could flood Nebraska with one of the largest oil spills in American history. Lehane explained to a reporter his theory of civil discourse: “Everyone has a game plan until you punch them in the mouth. So let’s punch them in the mouth.”</p><p>But Lehane’s efforts generally failed to impress the tech industry. For decades, Silicon Valley firms had considered themselves mostly detached from electoral politics. As one senior tech executive explained to me, until about the mid-twenty-tens, “if you were a V.C. or C.E.O. you might hire lobbyists to talk to politicians, or gossip with you, but, beyond that, most of the Valley thought politics was stupid.” Within a decade of Lehane’s move West, however, a new kind of tech company was emerging: so-called sharing-economy firms such as Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit. These companies were “disrupting” long-established sectors, including transportation, hospitality, and contract labor. Politicians had long considered it their prerogative to regulate these sectors, and, as some of the startups’ valuations grew into the billions, politicians began making demands on them as well. They felt affronted by companies like Uber that were refusing to abide by even modest regulations. Other companies tried a more conciliatory approach, but quickly found themselves mired in local political infighting and municipal bureaucracies. In any case, “not understanding politics became an existential risk,” another senior tech executive said. “There was a general realization that we <em>had</em> to get involved in politics, whether we wanted to or not.”</p><p>In 2015, San Francisco itself became the site of a major regulation battle, in the form of Proposition F, a ballot initiative to limit short-term housing rentals, which both sides acknowledged was an attack on Airbnb. The proposal had emerged from built-up frustrations: some San Franciscans complained that many buildings had essentially become unlicensed hotels, hosting hard-partying tourists who never turned off the music, didn’t clean up their trash, and—most worrying for city leaders—hadn’t paid the taxes that the city would have collected had they stayed at a Marriott. Other residents argued that Airbnb’s presence was making it harder to find affordable housing, because it was more profitable to rent to short-term visitors than to long-term tenants. Proposition F would essentially make it impossible for Airbnb to work with many homeowners for more than a few weeks a year. Early polling indicated that the initiative was popular. Numerous other cities had been considering similar legislation, and were eagerly watching to see if lawmakers in San Francisco—where Airbnb was headquartered—could teach them how to rein in the Internet giant, then worth some twenty-five billion dollars.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Airbnb’s executives, panicked, called Lehane and asked him to come to their headquarters; he showed up within minutes of their call, in the sweatpants and baseball jersey that he’d been wearing at his son’s Little League game. Lehane has the lean build of someone accustomed to athletic self-torture—he runs daily, often fifteen miles at a stretch, typically while sending oddly punctuated e-mails and leaving stream-of-consciousness voice mails—and he has a boyish crooked front tooth that offsets the effect of his receding hairline. To Airbnb’s leaders, he didn’t look like much of a political guru. But, once Lehane caught his breath, he launched into a commanding speech. You’re looking at this situation all wrong, he said. Proposition F wasn’t a crisis—it was an opportunity to change San Francisco’s political landscape, to upend a narrative. The key, he told executives, was to build a campaign against Proposition F as sophisticated as Barack Obama’s recent Presidential run, and to deploy insane amounts of money as a warning to politicians that an “Airbnb voter” existed—and ought not be crossed. He proposed a three-pronged strategy, and explained to executives that what politicians care about most is reëlection. If the company could show that being anti-Airbnb would make it harder for them to stay in office, they would fall in line. Lehane was soon named Airbnb’s head of global policy and public affairs.</p><p>His first step in this role was to mobilize Airbnb’s natural advocates: the homeowners who were profiting by renting out their properties, and the visitors who had avoided pricey hotel rooms by using the service. By the end of 2015, more than a hundred and thirty thousand people had rented or hosted rooms in San Francisco. Lehane recruited several former Obama-campaign staffers to lead teams who made tens of thousands of phone calls to Airbnb hosts and renters, warning them about Proposition F. The team members also urged hosts to attend town-hall meetings, talk to neighbors, and call local officials. During this period, the company—accidentally, it says—sent an e-mail to everyone who had ever stayed in a California Airbnb, urging them to contact the California legislature. The legislature was inundated with messages from around the world. The Senate president pro tem called Lehane to let him know that the message had been received, and to beg him to stop the onslaught. “I kind of wish we <em>had</em> done it on purpose,” someone close to that campaign told me.</p><p>The second part of Lehane’s strategy was to use large amounts of money to pressure San Francisco politicians. The company brought on hundreds of canvassers to knock on the doors of two hundred and eighty-five thousand people—roughly a third of the city’s population—and urge them to contact their local elected officials and say that opposing Airbnb was the equivalent of attacking innovation, economic independence, and America’s ideals. The relentless campaign posed a clear threat to the city’s Board of Supervisors: if an official supported Proposition F, Airbnb might encourage someone to run against him or her. “We said the quiet part out loud,” a campaign staffer said. “The goal was intimidation, to let everyone know that if they fuck with us they’ll regret it.” In all, Airbnb spent eight million dollars on the campaign, roughly ten times as much as all of Proposition F’s supporters combined. “It was the most ridiculous campaign I’ve ever worked on,” the staffer told me. “It was so over the top, so extreme. You shouldn’t be able to spend that much on a municipal election.” That said, the staffer loved her time at Airbnb: “It was the most money I’d ever earned working in politics.”</p><p>The third aspect of Lehane’s strategy was upending the debate over Proposition F by proposing alternative solutions. Otherwise, Lehane and Airbnb’s chief executive, Brian Chesky, believed, the company would face similar proposals in other cities. “You can’t just be against everything,” Lehane told the Airbnb board. “You have to be <em>for</em> something.” As a compromise gesture, Airbnb had voluntarily begun paying taxes on short-term stays within the city. It also offered to share some internal company data—such as the number of guests visiting the city each month—that would help local officials monitor the service’s impact on the community. What’s more, Airbnb eventually offered to build a Web interface that San Francisco officials could use to register hosts and track rental patterns. The solution was self-serving, in that it made the city dependent on Airbnb for monitoring Airbnb’s activities. But the proposals addressed many of the complaints that had prompted Proposition F. More important, they guaranteed San Francisco tens of millions of tax dollars annually. When Proposition F finally came to a vote, it was resoundingly defeated.</p><p>Airbnb’s approach to political conflict was in stark contrast with that of Uber, which had just become the most valuable startup in the world—and which, owing to its resistance to various taxi regulations, was soon under fire from multiple cities and nations. Airbnb’s tactics were designed to appeal to politicians’ higher ideals. After the Proposition F campaign, Lehane began working on a partnership with the S.E.I.U., one of the nation’s largest labor unions, to unionize the workers who cleaned Airbnb rentals. The plan never came together, but labor-friendly politicians in San Francisco and New York began viewing Airbnb as a potential ally.</p><p>To other political operatives, Lehane’s tactics hardly seemed groundbreaking. But within Silicon Valley his approach was a revelation. “It was a huge bang for a relatively small outlay,” a tech executive told me. “It turns out the R.O.I.”—return on investment—“on politics is way better than anyone suspected.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>After the defeat of Proposition F, San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors eventually agreed to many of Airbnb’s suggestions. By then, Lehane had moved on to other locations. He began similar Airbnb campaigns in dozens of other cities, including Barcelona, Berlin, New York, and Mexico City. When the U.S. Conference of Mayors convened in Washington, D.C., in 2016, Lehane was invited to speak after Michelle Obama. “Read my lips,” he told the gathering. “We <em>want</em> to pay taxes.” Airbnb soon had agreements with more than a hundred cities, and when local politicians proved intransigent—leaders in Austin, for instance, seemed immune to Airbnb’s overtures—the company simply went over their heads. In Texas, it persuaded the state legislature to make it hard for any municipality to ban short-term rentals. Today, Airbnb has agreements with thousands of cities.</p><p>A few years after Lehane joined Airbnb, a venture capitalist pulled him aside at a party and said, “It used to be, hiring the right C.F.O. was the most important thing to make sure a company goes public. But you’ve proved a political person is just as important.” Lehane, however, had had an even bigger insight. These campaigns had revealed that tech companies—particularly firms, like Airbnb, with platforms that connect people who might otherwise have trouble finding one another—were now potentially the most powerful cohort in politics. “At one point, organizations like labor or political parties had the ability to organize and really turn out large numbers of voters,” Lehane told me. Today, Internet platforms have the bigger reach; a tech company can communicate with hundreds of millions of people by pushing a button. “If Airbnb can engage fifteen thousand hosts in a city, that can have an impact on who wins a city-council race or the mayoralty,” Lehane told me. “In a congressional or Senate race, fifty thousand votes can make all the difference.” Of course, simply having a huge user base doesn’t guarantee that Airbnb can get everything it wants.&nbsp;Voters respond only to enticements that they find persuasive. But companies like Airbnb, Lehane understood, could make arguments faster, and more efficiently, than nearly any political party or other special-interest group, and this was a source of considerable power. “The platforms are really the only ones who can speak to everyone now,” Lehane said.</p><p>For the tech industry, the Trump years were a bewildering mess. The President attacked tech platforms for being biased against conservatives, and liberals railed against Silicon Valley’s social-media companies for propelling Trump into the White House. Tech executives declared their support for the industry’s many immigrants in the face of Trump’s Muslim ban and border separations; they also contended with walkouts and protests from employees over racial injustice, sexual harassment, and all-gender bathrooms—subjects that neither an engineering degree nor business school had prepared them for. When Joe Biden won the Presidency, in 2020, the Valley’s leaders were relieved. The Biden Administration seemed like a return to the Pax Obama, an era when tech was considered cool and politicians boasted of knowing Mark Zuckerberg. Biden’s victory also meant that Lehane, with his deep roots in the Democratic Party, was unquestionably Silicon Valley’s top political guru. Companies sought him out; employees loved that he was generous with credit and made politics fun. (Many former colleagues talk proudly about the nicknames that he bestowed upon them.) Most of all, he made the people he worked with feel like they were on a righteous quest. Peter Ragone, a prominent adviser to numerous Democratic politicians, told me that, among the handful of political consultants transforming Silicon Valley, “Chris is the tip of the spear. His capacity for processing information at speed is breathtaking.”</p><p>The Valley’s enthusiasm for Biden, however, was short-lived. The President quickly appointed three prominent tech skeptics—Gary Gensler, Lina Khan, and Jonathan Kanter—to oversee the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, respectively. Soon the government was suing or investigating Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and dozens of other companies. Some of those suits and inquiries had been initiated under Trump, but Biden’s S.E.C. found a particular target in the cryptocurrency industry. Gensler, an ally of Elizabeth Warren, filed more than eighty legal actions arguing that crypto firms or promoters had violated the law, most often by selling unregistered securities. Some of the executives being sued by the S.E.C. had contributed lavishly to the Democrats. Brad Garlinghouse, the C.E.O. of the crypto firm Ripple, who had been a fund-raising bundler for Obama, was among those under legal fire, and he clearly felt victimized. He told Bloomberg that the federal government was acting like “a bully,” and tweeted, “Dems continue to enable Gensler’s unlawful war on crypto—sabotaging the ability for American innovation to thrive. It’s no wonder the GOP has announced a pro-crypto stance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . Voters are paying attention.” (Last year, a federal judge upheld some portions of the S.E.C.’s case against Ripple and dismissed others.)</p><p>To certain people, the government’s approach felt oddly aggressive. One crypto executive told me she discovered that her bank accounts had been frozen—with no explanation—only when she tried to make a withdrawal to repair a catastrophic home-septic-system failure. Around this time, various regulatory agencies were warning banks about the risks posed by the crypto industry. When the executive’s accounts were later unfrozen—again, without a clear explanation—she was left wondering if the government’s goal was to intimidate the industry. (The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, said that it does not direct banks to freeze individual accounts.)</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26370&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26370" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>Cartoon by Michael Maslin</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>The Biden Administration’s oppositional stance, however, seemed warranted when, in 2022, FTX—the enormous crypto exchange and hedge fund led by Sam Bankman-Fried—imploded amid revelations that more than eight billion dollars had been misallocated or lost. Bankman-Fried had been a prolific political donor, and violating campaign-finance law was among the crimes for which he was arrested. Another crypto executive told me that, after the FTX scandal, many figures in the industry “just wanted to put our heads down and disappear,” adding, “The less people noticed us, the better.”</p><p>But among Silicon Valley’s most moneyed class retreat wasn’t an option. The powerful venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz had already raised more than seven billion dollars for crypto and blockchain investments. The “super angel” investor Ron Conway had poured millions of dollars into crypto firms through his venture fund. Lehane urged some of the largest crypto investors and companies, many of whom were bickering on Twitter, to instead form a coalition devoted to changing the public narrative. He began hosting private biweekly gatherings, known as the Ad-Hoc Group, where various collaborations were discussed. Eventually, a former partner at Andreessen Horowitz, Katie Haun, recommended that the large crypto firm Coinbase, where she was a board member, bring on Lehane as an adviser.</p><p>Lehane met with Coinbase’s co-founder Brian Armstrong and told him that, just as with Airbnb, what seemed like a crisis was actually an opportunity. “This is not the time to go quiet,” Lehane told him. “This is your chance to define your company and the industry, and prove you’re different from FTX.” In 2023, Lehane joined Coinbase’s Global Advisory Council. Twenty-five days later, the S.E.C. sued the firm.</p><p>Lehane established a war room with the primary goal of convincing politicians that the political consequences of being anti-crypto would be intensely painful. The person familiar with Fairshake, who was then an employee at Coinbase, told me, “It wasn’t really about explaining how crypto works, or anything like that. It’s about hitting politicians where they are most sensitive—reëlection.” Armstrong clarified this aim at a crypto conference in 2023. The goal, he said, was to ask candidates, “Are you with us? Are you against us? Are we going to be running ads for you or against you?”</p><p>Although Lehane’s basic strategy resembled the one he’d used at Airbnb, that campaign had been focussed on municipal issues and local political races. The crypto effort was national in scale, targeting Senate and House races—and potentially even the Presidential contest—and would require significantly more money. Lehane suggested to Armstrong that crypto firms set aside fifty million dollars for outreach. Let’s earmark a hundred million, Armstrong replied. Coinbase, Ripple, and Andreessen Horowitz donated more than a hundred and forty million dollars to Fairshake, the crypto super <em>pac</em>. Executives at other firms contributed millions more.</p><p>Lehane, collaborating closely with Fairshake, began crafting a pro-crypto message and helping to build a “grassroots” army. “We need to demonstrate there’s a crypto voter,” he told the Coinbase team. “There’s millions and millions of Americans who own this stuff. We need to prove they’ll vote to protect it.”</p><p>The Federal Reserve has said that in 2023 fewer than twenty million Americans owned cryptocurrencies. Polling indicates that the issue is not an electoral priority for many voters. One Coinbase staff member pointed out this discrepancy to Lehane, saying, “I don’t know if there <em>is</em> a crypto voter.”</p><p>“Then we’re going to make one,” Lehane replied.</p><p>Coinbase began loudly promoting the results of surveys reporting to show that fifty-two million Americans owned cryptocurrencies, and that many of them intended to vote to protect their digital pocketbooks. Those polls indicated that sixty per cent of crypto owners were millennials or Gen Z-ers, and forty-one per cent were people of color—demographics that each party was trying to woo. Lehane also quietly helped launch an advocacy organization, Stand with Crypto, which is advertised to Coinbase’s millions of U.S. customers every time they log in, and which urges cryptocurrency owners to contact their lawmakers and sign petitions. The group says that it currently has more than a million members. The Coinbase employee told me that Stand with Crypto would identify a city with a significant population of crypto enthusiasts, like Columbus, Ohio, and then inundate them with push notifications aimed at organizing town halls and rallies. The employee explained, “If you can get fifty or sixty people to show up, with good photo angles you can make it look like hundreds. In small states or close elections, that’s enough to convince a candidate they should be paranoid.”</p><p>This supposed army of crypto voters fed directly into the next stage of the assault: scaring politicians. Stand with Crypto built an online dashboard that assigned grades to U.S. senators and representatives—and to many of their challengers—which reflected their support for crypto. The scores seemed to inevitably be either “A (Strongly supports crypto)” or “F (Strongly against crypto),” though the data undergirding the grades were sometimes specious. “Most of them hadn’t really taken a side,” another Coinbase staffer told me. “So we’d, you know, look at speeches they’d given, or who they were friends with, and kind of make a guess. If you were friends with Elizabeth Warren, you were more likely to get an F.”</p><p>Nevertheless, Lehane insisted that Fairshake maintain a nonpartisan tone. The super <em>PAC</em> was careful to support an equal number of Democratic and Republican candidates, and, following Lehane’s advice, it planned to stay out of the 2024 Presidential race altogether. A venture capitalist who has advised the crypto industry told me that the group’s nonpartisan stance was essential, because, “if we want to get the right regulations in place, we have to get a bill through Congress, which means we need votes from both parties.” Moreover, Fairshake’s goal was to “create a nonpartisan cost for being negative on crypto and tech,” the venture capitalist added. “People need to know there are consequences.”</p><p>To make this point, Lehane and Fairshake wanted to find a contest in which the group’s spending was certain to attract national attention. Fairshake compiled a list of high-profile races, and near the top was the fight to replace Dianne Feinstein in California. The obvious target was Porter, whose strongest opponent in the Democratic primary was Representative Adam Schiff. California was reliably blue, and so, if Fairshake helped defeat Porter, the group wouldn’t get blamed for handing a seat to the Republicans. What’s more, California’s primary occurred on March 5th—early in the campaign season—which meant that Porter’s race would get lots of attention and Fairshake would have time to broadcast its involvement and petrify candidates in other states. Because Porter was friendly with Elizabeth Warren, she could be painted—fairly or not—as anti-crypto. Best of all, many polls indicated that Porter was unlikely to win the primary anyway, so if the super <em>PAC</em> “went in with a big spend, and made a big splash and she lost, Fairshake could take the victory lap regardless of whether it tipped the scales,” the Coinbase employee said. The calculation was prescient: Fairshake’s spending helped doom Porter in the primary, and the general election appears to be a lock for Schiff (who got an A from Stand with Crypto). As another political operative put it, “Porter was a perfect choice because she let crypto declare, ‘If you are even <em>slightly</em> critical of us, we won’t just kill you—we’ll kill your fucking family, we’ll end your career.’ From a political perspective, it was a masterpiece.” Porter will be out of government at the end of this year.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>After Porter’s defeat, many politicians who had once treated crypto with disdain or hostility suddenly became fans. In May, two months after Porter’s defenestration, a pro-crypto bill came up for a vote in the House. In previous years, similar bills had languished amid tepid Republican support and strong Democratic opposition. The new bill—known as the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act—was openly opposed by President Biden. But it sailed through the House, with nearly unanimous Republican backing and seventy-one votes from Democrats. The Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, recently joined a Crypto4Harris virtual town hall and promised that passing the legislation this year is “absolutely possible,” adding, “Crypto is here to stay.” The Democratic senator Sherrod Brown—a longtime crypto critic—is running for reëlection in Ohio, where Fairshake has directed forty million dollars to ads in support of his opponent; Brown has lately been tempering his public criticisms of the industry. Earlier this year, crypto donors indicated that they might get involved in Montana’s Senate race, where the incumbent Democrat, Jon Tester, once a crypto skeptic, is facing a difficult fight. Soon afterward, Tester voted to weaken S.E.C. oversight of cryptocurrencies, earning him the unusual grade of “C (Neutral on crypto).” It looks like Fairshake will stay out of Montana as long as Tester keeps voting the right way. A similar dynamic occurred in Maryland: after the super <em>PAC</em> threatened to take sides in the Democratic Senate primary there, both major candidates proclaimed their pro-crypto bona fides.</p><p>In total, Fairshake and affiliated super <em>PAC</em>s have already spent more than a hundred million dollars on political races in 2024, including forty-three million on Senate races in Ohio and West Virginia, and seven million on four congressional races, in North Carolina, Colorado, Alaska, and Iowa. Three and half million dollars was used to help vanquish two left-wing representatives who were members of the so-called Squad: Jamaal Bowman, of New York, and Cori Bush, of Missouri. Of the forty-two primaries that Fairshake has been involved in this year, its preferred candidate has won eighty-five per cent of the time. The super <em>PAC</em>’s latest filings indicated that it had more than seventy million dollars to spend in the remainder of the election cycle. Its donations to political candidates are on par with those of the oil-and-gas industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and labor unions.</p><p>Just as Airbnb sought to change the conversation around Proposition F by proposing various concessions—paying taxes and sharing data—the crypto industry has become a vocal proponent of a seemingly solutions-oriented fix: new regulations for cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. Critics, however, say that these proposals are self-serving. A central dispute between the crypto industry and regulators concerns whether cryptocurrencies are securities—akin to, say, a share of Apple, the sale of which is governed by strict investor-protection laws—or commodities, like a bushel of corn, which can be sold with very little government involvement. Most fiat currencies—that is, those issued by governments—are used primarily to buy such things as food and clothing, rather than to gamble on the rise and fall of exchange rates. Cryptocurrencies, in contrast, are often difficult—or, in some cases, impossible—to use for purchasing physical goods, and they are frequently held by speculators solely as a wager that their value will rise. There are several thousand cryptocurrencies in existence. A few—most notably, Bitcoin and Ether—are considered commodities. The statuses of most of the rest are up for debate.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60629&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60629" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Now, to demonstrate that he has come of age, Jeffrey will open a childproof bottle of acetaminophen in front of all his friends and family.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Patrick McKelvie</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Many within the industry want Congress to pass regulations that would treat mainstream cryptocurrencies as commodities, which are overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a relatively sleepy agency that most people have never heard of—and that tends to be less belligerent than the S.E.C. If the C.F.T.C. becomes the primary regulatory body for crypto, it’s likely that the stream of lawsuits and fines against large crypto companies will slow or cease. More important, selling Dogecoin (the cryptocurrency associated with a Shiba Inu dog), Dentacoin (“the only cryptocurrency by dentists, for dentists”), or CumRocket (cryptocurrency for the pornography aficionado) would become significantly less risky, and more profitable.</p><p>People in the government think that this would be disastrous. “A lot of these tokens, frankly, have no real utility, no actual use, and they’re just for gambling or scamming people,” an official familiar with the S.E.C.’s thinking told me. “We already have regulations in place that have protected investors in these kinds of situations for decades. Crypto just doesn’t want to abide by them. If your entire business plan is asking ‘Can we get Kim Kardashian to tweet about us?’ and then taking people’s money, the government needs to be involved.”</p><p>In fact, convincing average Americans that the crypto industry is a wholesome, customer-friendly place has been a tough sell: polls indicate that most people do not consider the crypto sector to be safe. Lehane’s colleagues within the industry have therefore shifted their tactics slightly. Getting Congress to pass friendly legislation is still a priority, but this push is now being presented as being in service of much loftier aims: protecting innovation, entrepreneurialism, and America’s future.</p><p>In July, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, of the Andreessen Horowitz venture fund, made a ninety-one-minute video accusing President Biden of weakening America. Andreessen said to Horowitz, “There’s been a brutal assault on a nascent industry that I’ve just—I’ve never experienced before. I’m in total shock that it has happened.” Horowitz replied, “They’ve basically subverted the rule of law to attack the crypto industry.” These and other government actions, they said, threatened to doom America’s economy, technological superiority, and military might. And Biden, by refusing to embrace various tech-industry proposals, was allowing China to leap ahead. “The future of technology, and the future of America, is at stake,” Horowitz declared. The two men were so concerned, they said, that they had no choice but to endorse Donald Trump in 2024. (They also noted that, under Biden, billionaires like themselves might have to pay more in taxes. But that issue received less airtime.)</p><p>To people inside the crypto industry, the video—which received a huge amount of attention, prompting online co-signs from Elon Musk and various other titans—was a masterstroke. As the Coinbase employee put it, “Now you’ve got Andreessen and Musk and all these other rich, powerful guys saying that crypto is part of a bigger debate. It’s about an attack on American innovation and progress and the future of the country! It changed the conversation from ‘Is cryptocurrency a scam?’ to ‘Does Biden even care about middle-class entrepreneurs?’&nbsp;”</p><p>Even though Lehane opposes Trump’s candidacy, and had nothing to do with the video, Andreessen and Horowitz’s move was right out of the Lehane playbook. Lehane had done such a good job teaching the Valley how to play politics that others could now mimic his gambits. In July, Lehane joined Coinbase’s board of directors. “Chris is a genius,” the Coinbase employee said. “I don’t know how he comes up with this stuff, but he can change reality. He makes magic happen.”</p><p>The annual conference for Bitcoin enthusiasts isn’t an event at which politicians usually appear. The affair often draws more than twenty-five thousand people, many of them distrustful of government. Wandering around the sea of booths, you can get a free vodka shot at 10 <em>a.m</em>. or discuss “tax-avoidance strategies” that fall somewhere between fraud and fantasy. People sell Edward Snowden T-shirts and crypto-themed board games. It’s a safe haven for enthusiasts of Panties for Bitcoin. But when the event took place in Nashville, in July—at a venue just a few blocks from the Redneck Riviera bar, where women were offering to lift their shirts in exchange for some of “that bit stuff”—it was teeming with political luminaries. There were eight senators, nearly a dozen representatives, and countless candidates for national and state office, some of whom launched into impromptu speeches whenever the techno music paused. The star attraction, however, was Donald Trump.</p><p>The event’s appearance on the Presidential campaign circuit—and Trump’s willingness to spend one of his campaign days in a state he’s guaranteed to win—confirmed that the crypto campaign initiated by Lehane was having an effect. When Trump gave a speech before a standing-room-only crowd in orange wigs and “Make Bitcoin Great Again” hats, he pledged, “On Day One, I will fire Gary Gensler”—the S.E.C. head. This prompted a standing ovation and choruses of pro-Trump chants. A man standing near me FaceTimed his wife and insisted that she watch the speech, even though she was in the delivery room where their grandchild was being born.</p><p>Trump’s embrace of crypto was a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn. As President, he had tweeted that he was “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies, which “are not money” and “can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.” He continued, “We have only one real currency in the USA. It is called the United States Dollar!” Later, he said that Bitcoin “just seems like a scam.” But after leaving office Trump began seeking out new revenue sources, such as selling non-fungible tokens—a type of digital content hosted on the blockchain. This earned him a reported $7.2 million in 2023. Trump was convinced. His current Presidential campaign was among the first to accept cryptocurrency donations. He recently announced that—presumably in exchange for compensation—he’d become the “chief crypto advocate” for World Liberty Financial, a company led, in part, by an entrepreneur who’d reportedly sold marijuana and weight-loss products. Before Trump took the stage in Nashville, he hosted a “roundtable” fund-raiser with crypto investors, many of whom paid more than eight hundred thousand dollars to attend. Conference organizers have said that Trump raised twenty-five million dollars there.</p><p>When Trump spoke at the conference, it was clear that he had been, in the parlance of Bitcoin fans, “orange-pilled.” He promised that, if elected, he would direct the federal government to hold billions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency reserves. The U.S., he proclaimed, would become the “crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world!” Trump began echoing the crypto campaign’s talking points. “If we don’t do it, China is going to be doing it!” he said.</p><p>You might think Trump’s newfound veneration of Bitcoin would have delighted Lehane. It didn’t. Rather, it suggested that his campaign might be working a bit <em>too</em> well. As with Airbnb, Lehane doesn’t want the crypto industry to become firmly associated with either Democrats or Republicans, because then it will be impossible to pass legislation around it. And virtually any policy championed by Trump becomes a partisan matter by default.</p><p>President Biden’s announcement, in July, that he was dropping out of the race seemed to offer the crypto industry an opportunity for a reset with the Democrats. The ascension of Vice-President Kamala Harris, a Californian with a tech-friendly record, raised the possibility of balancing the partisan scales. In a September speech about her economic plans as President, Harris pledged that the U.S. would “remain dominant in A.I. and quantum computing, blockchain, and other emerging technologies.” The détente seems to be working: on October 4th, Ben Horowitz, the venture capitalist who had appeared in the video attacking Biden, told his employees that he and his wife would be making a personal donation to “entities who support the Harris Walz campaign”—in no small part because some private conservations he’d had with Harris and her team made him “very hopeful” that, as President, she’d abandon Biden’s “exceptionally destructive” crypto policies. Lehane, for his part, has donated thirty-five thousand dollars to Harris’s campaign (and nothing to Trump’s).</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In the meantime, however, the crypto coalition that Lehane helped to build has begun fraying—a victim of the same partisan divides that plague the rest of the nation. In August, Ron Conway, the California power broker who had given half a million dollars to Fairshake, e-mailed the super <em>PAC</em>’s other funders, including Andreessen and Armstrong, to complain that the campaign was alienating Democratic lawmakers. “How short sighted and stupid can you possibly be,” he wrote. Fairshake’s donations to unseat Senator Brown in Ohio were, Conway said, a “slap in the face” to Schumer. “NOT ONE PERSON BOTHERED TO GIVE ME A HEADS UP THAT YOU WERE DOINIG THIS,” he continued, proving that billionaires also ignore spell-check. “We have two factions: a moderate faction and a Donald Trump faction (Brian and Marc).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have been working too long with people who [do] not share common values and that is unacceptable.” He went on, “Because of your selfish hidden agendas it is time for us to separate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will I no longer compromise myself by associating or helping.”</p><p>Republican leaders began making parallel complaints. When Andreessen and crypto executives joined a Republican congressional retreat in Jackson Hole this past summer, attendees expressed fury over the fact that Fairshake had spent money on ads supporting the Democratic candidates in the Arizona and Michigan Senate races—contests that might well decide which party takes control of the chamber.</p><p>Whether or not Lehane’s coalition holds together, one thing is clear: Silicon Valley has become part of a tradition that stretches back to Boss Tweed. Tech has learned how to politick. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, the industry is mastering the world’s second-oldest profession by studying the techniques of the first. Tech’s money and emerging political savvy mean that its interests—crypto, the sharing economy, ungoverned social media—are here to stay. For the S.E.C., Silicon Valley’s turn has sparked something close to terror. “If crypto wins, you’re going to see financial firms suddenly saying their products are on the blockchain, and they’ll drive billions through that loophole,” the official familiar with the S.E.C.’s thinking told me. “We saw this happen with savings and loans, and with mortgage derivatives, and with regional banks, and it always ends badly. Something’s going to blow up, and a lot of people are going to get hurt.” Even the people who have worked on Lehane’s campaign aren’t certain that they’re doing the right thing. “Yeah, the Valley is more sophisticated now, but that doesn’t mean it’s good for the public,” the Coinbase staffer told me. “The public gives zero shits if crypto is a security or a commodity. What’s really important to them—How do I protect myself? How do I know which coin is safe?—that’s not part of the conversation. This isn’t enlightened debate and discussion. This is about using money to be a bully, so everyone knows you’re the scariest ones on the playground.”</p><p>There are two ways of looking at Silicon Valley’s new political sophistication. The first is that it is a manifestation of how a modern democracy is supposed to work. As Peter Ragone, the prominent Democrat consultant, put it, “I’d rather have people getting involved and getting their hands dirty—being willing to talk about regulation and saying their opinions in public—than a situation like the past, where all the rich guys cut deals in back rooms.” Many of America’s proudest political battles—the fights for marriage equality, universal suffrage, environmental protections—succeeded only because they were backed by supporters with deep pockets and fierce tenacity, advantages that the tech industry also has. And no amount of money can decide an election unless the voters agree with the agenda. “You don’t get to take office unless you have a majority, or close to a majority, of people agreeing with you, no matter how rich you are,” Ragone said. In this view, tech-industry proponents, like many Americans, have simply learned to advocate for a cause, build a coalition, and make sure that their voices are heard.</p><p>The other way of viewing the Valley’s political exertions is as a symptom of systemic rot—as proof that American governance and legislation have become so perverted by money that it is nearly impossible for people other than billionaires to further their agendas. This dynamic can be seen as particularly dangerous given that the U.S. economy has dumped lavish riches on a tiny group of disaffected, defiantly unaccountable technologists. As many critics of Silicon Valley see it, today’s startup founders and venture capitalists are, like the nouveaux riches of previous eras, using their wealth for selfish aims. In doing so, they have revealed themselves to be as ruthless as the robber barons and industrial tyrants of a century ago—not coincidentally, the last time that income inequality was as extreme as it is today.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28467&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28467" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>Cartoon by Seth Fleishman</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Lehane, for his part, acknowledges that our political system is flawed, but he believes he’s making it better. He’s been successful, he told me, only because he’s worked with so many talented colleagues devoted to building a better, fairer world. “For me, it’s always been about ‘Can you give the little guy a much bigger knife to cut a much bigger piece of the economic pie?’&nbsp;” he said. As he sees it, Airbnb fought large hotel chains so that teachers and nurses could earn extra money by renting out their empty bedrooms. Coinbase has given people a way to sidestep the big banks and their onerous fees. Many entrenched industries have used politics to benefit themselves at the public’s cost. It’s only fair, Lehane argues, to let Internet upstarts fight for their agenda; he says his advocacy is rooted in a passionate belief that tech, if regulated wisely, can help the powerless get their share.</p><p>Of course, this mission has also made Lehane very wealthy. (He declined to disclose precisely <em>how</em> wealthy.) “But, at the risk of being incredibly hubristic, there’s a lot of places I could have gone to make money,” he said. What motivates him, he added, is a righteous battle. His X profile features a photograph of him in boxing gloves, grimacing mid-punch.</p><p>In August, OpenAI, the artificial-intelligence giant, announced that it had hired Lehane as its vice-president of global affairs. Unlike the battles that he’s fought at Airbnb and Coinbase, where the ideological lines of combat have been easy to define, the political fights over artificial intelligence are murkier and more nascent. There are numerous stakeholders with competing interests within the tech industry itself. Marc Andreessen, for one, has called for little to no additional regulation of underlying A.I. technologies, because, he wrote in a jeremiad last year, hampering the development of technology that might benefit humanity “is a form of murder.” In other words, “any deceleration of AI will cost lives.” He left it unsaid that creating regulations would also likely make it more difficult for him and other venture capitalists to find fast-growing companies to invest in, thereby denying them profits.</p><p>On the opposing side is a contingent of A.I. engineers who believe that their creations may soon become powerful enough to exterminate most of humanity. Regulation, therefore, is urgently needed to insure that only the most enlightened technologists can practice this mysterious alchemy. The technologists pushing these arguments, inevitably, place themselves among those enlightened few, and their “more responsible” visions of A.I. development often align with the business plans of their own startups.</p><p>Somewhere in the middle is Lehane and OpenAI. The company made an opening salvo in July, when its chief executive, Sam Altman, published, with Lehane’s support, an op-ed in the Washington <em>Post</em> which portrayed the fight around A.I. regulations as one pitting democracies against authoritarian regimes. “The bottom line is that democratic AI has a lead over authoritarian AI because our political system has empowered U.S. companies, entrepreneurs, and academics,” Altman wrote. But that lead is not guaranteed, he continued, and it can be protected only if Congress passes regulations that encourage important software advances—like OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot—and also prioritize “rules of the road” and “norms in developing and deploying AI.” OpenAI, Altman indicated, is prepared to accept substantial constraints on data security and transparency, and it supports the creation of a government agency to regulate A.I. development and use.</p><p>This rhetoric may sound high-minded, but—not surprisingly—Altman’s position is also somewhat self-interested. The company’s smaller rivals would probably find such rules and norms expensive and cumbersome, and therefore have a harder time complying with them than OpenAI would. The op-ed was also an example of Lehanian reframing: instead of talking about big A.I. companies competing with small startups, or about the inevitable tensions between rapid technological leaps and slower but safer progress, Altman recast the A.I. battle as one between good and evil. And Silicon Valley, in this story line, is the home of virtuous superheroes.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Some observers of the A.I. industry find this perspective cynical. Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at Brown, is a co-author of the White House’s “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights,” which urges regulations on data privacy and transparency, and protections against algorithmic discrimination. He told me, “You notice OpenAI doesn’t want to talk about its alleged theft of copyrighted materials, which is definitely anti-democratic and, if true, definitely anti-American.” (ChatGPT was developed by inhaling texts from the Internet without paying—or, for the most part, crediting—their authors; OpenAI claims that this is fair use.) What’s more, Altman’s reframing elides important issues that democratic nations might disagree on, such as what kinds of privacy regulations ought to govern A.I., and who should pay for the environmental costs of A.I. data centers.</p><p>But Lehane’s strategy of putting Altman forward as a strong political voice guarantees that OpenAI, and the A.I. industry as a whole, will continue to influence the American political conversation for years to come. Venkatasubramanian told me, “The goal is to get a seat at the table, because then you have influence over how things turn out.” The A.I. industry’s influence is already being felt in state capitals. Workday, a giant human-resources software company, has been lobbying in several states to add what could be a subtle loophole to legislation about “automated decision tools” in the workplace. Companies that, like Workday, sell A.I.-enhanced software for hiring employees would essentially be immune from lawsuits over racial discrimination, or other biases, unless a litigant could prove that A.I. was the “controlling” factor behind the rejection of a candidate. “It all comes down to just one word in the legislation,” Venkatasubramanian said. “One word makes all the difference, and if you are at the table, and involved in the conversation, you can nudge that word into the legislation, or out of it.”</p><p>Even Lehane admits that the A.I. campaign is in its early stages. The exact pressure points aren’t quite clear yet. Alliances and enmities are constantly shifting. What is certain, though, is that Silicon Valley will continue to bully and woo politicians by deploying money—and its giant user base—as a lure and a weapon.</p><p>Things could change: the robber barons of the Gilded Age were eventually brought down; twentieth-century industrial tyrants were, over time, shamed into retreat. The most well-known tech companies—Google, Apple, Meta, and Amazon—have become bêtes noires to people on both the right and the left. (So far, though, this seemingly hasn’t done much to harm profits, or to cow executives.) Democracy, in all its mess and glory, may prevail. The only fixed truth about technology is that change is inevitable. Most of the tech industry “has run independent of politics for our entire careers,” Andreessen wrote when he announced that his political neutrality was over. Going forward, he would be working against candidates who defied tech. As Andreessen saw it, he didn’t have a choice: “As the old Soviet joke goes, ‘You may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you.’&nbsp;”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<em>the elite hacking tool they don't want you to know you already own</em></p>
<p>Before you can write an exploit, you need a bug. When there are no bugs, we have to get creative—that's where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_injection">Fault Injection</a> comes in. Fault injection can take many forms, including software-controlled data corruption, power glitching, clock glitching, electromagnetic pulses, lasers, and more.</p>
<p>Hardware fault injection is something that typically requires specialized (and expensive) equipment. The costs stem from requiring a high degree of precision in terms of both <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> the fault is injected. There are many valiant attempts at bringing down the costs, with notable projects ranging from the RP2040-based <a href="https://github.com/newaetech/chipshouter-picoemp">PicoEMP</a>, all the way to <a href="https://blog.fraktal.fi/laser-fault-injection-for-the-masses-1860afde5a26">"Laser Fault Injection for The Masses"</a>. (The RP2040 crops up a lot due to its low cost combined with the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/what-is-pio/">"PIO"</a> peripheral, which can do I/O with tight timings and latency)</p>
<p>A while back I read about using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezo_ignition">piezo-electric</a> <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/01/29/blast-chips-with-this-bbq-lighter-fault-injection-tool/">BBQ Igniter</a> coupled to an inductor as a low-budget tool for electro-magnetic fault injection (EMFI), and I was captivated. I wondered, how far can you take such a primitive tool? At the time, the best thing I could come up with was exploiting a software implementation of AES running on an Arduino, using <a href="https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/Deadpool/blob/master/README_dfa.md">DFA</a>—it worked!</p>
<p>But I wasn't fully satisfied. I wanted to exploit something more "real," but I was out of ideas for the time being.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, and the announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2 is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fjp352/photos_of_switch_2_factory_prototypes_have_leaked/">on the horizon</a>. We anticipate the Switch 2 will run largely the same system software as the Switch 1, and we're all out of software bugs. So, I was inspired to brush up on my hardware exploitation skills, and revisited my thoughts on low-budget EMFI.</p>
<h2 id="the-test-subject"><a href="#the-test-subject">The Test Subject</a></h2>
<p>Like any self-respecting hacker, I own a pile of junk laptops. I picked out a Samsung S3520, equipped with an Intel i3-2310M CPU and 1GB of DDR3 RAM. Manufactured in 2011, it's new enough that it can comfortably run a lightweight desktop Linux distro (I picked Arch), but crappy enough that I wasn't worried about bricking it.</p>
<p><strong>My goal is to write a local-privilege-escalation exploit that works based on injected hardware faults.</strong></p>
<p>I decided that the most physically vulnerable part of the laptop was the DDR bus that connects the DRAM memory to the rest of the system.</p>
<p>If you've ever looked at a laptop memory module (SODIMM), you'll notice it has a whole lot of pins. Among them are 64 "DQ" pins (numbered DQ0 to DQ63) that transfer data bits in either direction (read or write). I figured that if I could inject faults on one of these pins, I could do <em>something</em> interesting.</p>

<em>If I counted right, this corresponds to pin 67, aka DQ26</em></p>
<p>It's just one resistor (15 ohms) and one wire, soldered to DQ26. The wire acts like an antenna, picking up any nearby EM interference and dumping it straight onto the data bus. The resistor (which might be entirely unnecessary) is just there to make sure that the interference isn't so great as to disturb normal operation of the memory—I only want glitches to happen on-demand, not all the time.</p>

<em>Ignore the random electrical tape; this laptop has been through a lot.</em></p>
<p>I found that clicking a regular piezo-electric lighter (no inductor coils needed) in the vicinity of the antenna wire was enough to reliably induce memory errors, shown here under memtest. Note that the errors shown both correspond to bit 29 being flipped.</p>
<p>Why bit 29, when I soldered to DQ26? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure; either I miscounted the pins or my laptop's motherboard swaps some of the data lines around. As far as I can tell, swapping data lines like that <em>is</em> allowable (it can make signal routing easier).</p>
<p>We don't have much control over <em>when</em> we inject the fault (to the resolution of my finger's reaction speed), but whenever it happens we can be fairly certain it will always flip the same bit of any particular 64-bit read or write.</p>
<h2 id="exploiting-bitflips-in-cpython"><a href="#exploiting-bitflips-in-cpython">Exploiting Bit-flips in CPython</a></h2>
<p>As a starting point, I wanted to try writing a "sandbox escape" exploit for CPython. This is purely academic since CPython isn't even sandboxed in the first place and you can just do <code>os.system("/bin/sh")</code>, but I needed something easy to get started with and I'm already familiar with CPython's internals. My explanation for this exploit is going to be a bit hand-wavey because the specifics aren't that interesting, it's the overall strategy that I want to convey.</p>
<p>For exploiting CPython, I actually used a wire soldered to DQ7 instead of the DQ26 pictured earlier, for reasons that will become more obvious shortly.</p>
<p>CPython objects live on a garbage-collected heap. An object has a header that contains its refcount, then a pointer to its type object, followed by other type-specific fields. There are two object types of particular interest to us, <code>bytes</code> and <code>bytearray</code>. <code>bytes</code> objects are immutable and <code>bytearray</code> objects are mutable.</p>
<p>A <code>bytes</code> object has a length field, followed by the data itself (as part of the same heap allocation).</p>
<p>A <code>bytearray</code> object has a length field followed by a <em>pointer</em> to the actual data storage buffer.</p>
<p>The core idea of my exploit strategy is to instantiate a <code>bytes</code> object that contains a fake <code>bytearray</code> structure within it. The fake <code>bytearray</code> object is just data, we can't <em>do</em> anything with it, but if we trick CPython into giving us a reference (pointer) to this fake object, then we can construct an arbitrary memory read/write primitive (since we chose the <code>bytearray</code>'s length and pointer fields ourselves).</p>
<p>So how do we get a reference to the fake object? Recall that our initial "exploit primitive" is the ability to flip bit 7 of a 64-bit word. This is equivalent to either adding or subtracting 128 (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>7</mn></msup></mrow></math>) from a pointer. If our fake <code>bytearray</code> object was at an offset of +128 bytes within the <code>bytes</code> object, then glitching a pointer to the <code>bytes</code> object will transform it into a pointer to the crafted <code>bytearray</code> object (with 50% probability).</p>
<p>So the big question is, how do we glitch that specific pointer, as opposed to everything else? If we accidentally glitch some important data we'll probably crash the whole OS, which is obviously not good.</p>
<p>Something important to remember is that we're glitching the memory <em>bus</em>, not the memory <em>contents</em> (as in something like <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html">Rowhammer</a>). We only glitch the read and write operations, the data "at rest" is mostly safe. The solution here is to spam memory accesses of the pointer we want to glitch. If 99% of bus activity is saturated with exploitable operations, then a randomly timed glitch has (in theory) a 99% chance of landing somewhere we want it to.</p>
<p>If we read the same pointer in a loop, almost nothing would happen. This is because the CPU caches the data to avoid unnecessary DRAM accesses (cache is fast, DRAM is comparatively slow and high-latency).</p>
<p>My solution was to fill up a big array (larger than the 3MiB cache this CPU has) with references to the same object. Then I can access the array items sequentially in a loop, forcing the CPU to fetch them from DRAM each time, and check to see if their value changed. The inner loop looks like this:</p>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><div><pre><span></span><span># "victim" is the prepared `bytes` object described earlier</span>
<span>spray</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>victim</span><span>,)</span> <span>*</span> <span>0x100_0000</span> <span># I actually use a tuple instead of an array, same idea</span>

<span>for</span> <span>obj</span> <span>in</span> <span>spray</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>obj</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>victim</span><span>:</span> <span># under non-glitchy conditions, this is always false</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Found corrupted ptr!"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>assert</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>)</span> <span>is</span> <span>bytearray</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>Most of the time this won't work, so the whole thing is done from inside another big loop, until it does work (or until the system crashes 🙃).</p>

<p>A "glitched" pointer is shown in red, which is now able to access the fake bytearray object. The glitch itself could occur during <em>either</em> a write or a read, the net result is the same either way. The rest of the exploit isn't especially interesting; I set up a repeatable read/write primitive and then craft a Function object that jumps to shellcode. You can see the full source <a href="https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/dram_emfi/blob/ccd7f254e0a2bc8ba02708d6228ea03e16330de7/ddr3_dq7.py">here</a>. The script also has an option (the <code>TESTING</code> variable) to induce simulated bit-flips through software, which is useful for testing without any hardware setup.</p>
<h2 id="exploiting-bitflips-in-linux"><a href="#exploiting-bitflips-in-linux">Exploiting Bit-flips in Linux</a></h2>
<p>Now that we've warmed up, it's time for a proper security boundary crossing. Can we get from an unprivileged Linux user, to root? There are three core concepts we need to understand first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory caching (which I already touched on)</li>
<li>Virtual Memory and Page Tables</li>
<li>The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="memory-caching"><a href="#memory-caching">Memory Caching</a></h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, DRAM is (relatively) slow and high-latency. So the CPU has on-die caches, which are faster. These caches have multiple tiers (L1, L2, L3) with different size/locality/latency trade-offs, but for our purposes we only have to care about the L3 cache (the largest layer, 3MiB in this case). If data currently resides in cache (a "cache hit"), the CPU won't need to access DRAM to read it. If there's a "cache miss" on the other hand, the CPU will have to reach out to DRAM.</p>
<p>The smallest unit of memory from the caching perspective is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3947435">"cache line"</a>, and on my laptop that's a 64-byte chunk. That means that if you read even a single byte that isn't cached, a whole 64-byte DRAM read operation takes place. You may recall that the DRAM data bus itself was only 64 <em>bits</em> wide, which means the read happens in a "burst" of 8 sequential accesses.</p>
<p>The precise policy the CPU uses to decide which data to keep in the cache, and when to "evict" it, is effectively a vendor-proprietary secret. But as a reasonable approximation we can model it as a LRU cache: least-recently-used cache lines get evicted first.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-memory"><a href="#virtual-memory">Virtual Memory</a></h3>
<p>Back in the old days, simple CPUs like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">MOS 6502</a> had a "flat" address space. If your program tried to read from address <code>0xcafe</code>, then the CPU would physically set the 16-bit address bus pins to <code>0xcafe</code> (<code>0b1100101011111110</code>) and read back a byte from that location.

<em>My 6502 computer, built many years ago (the USB-C port is a contemporary addition). Note the D0-D7 data pins and A0-A15 address pins.</em></p>
<p>Fast forward a number of years, and we want to run more than one program at once on our CPUs. Furthermore, each program should be tricked into believing it has the whole address space all to itself. This is useful for a lot of reasons, including that it stops one process from being able to clobber another process's memory (accidentally or otherwise).</p>
<p>In the modern era, we call this trick Virtual Memory. Virtual Memory means that there's a layer of indirection between the address a program tries to access (the virtual address), and the underlying physical address space. Each process can have its own virtual-&gt;physical mappings, keeping different processes isolated from each other.</p>
<p>On x86-64 (and most other modern architectures), this indirection is implemented using the concept of <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging">Paging</a>.</p>
<p>The virtual address space is split up into 4KiB <em>Pages</em>, and a tree-structured hierarchy of <em>Page Tables</em> dictates how the CPU (specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit">MMU</a>) decodes virtual addresses and maps them onto physical pages. On this platform there are 4 layers of Page Tables. Officially the 4 layers all have different names, but I'm going to call them "level 3" to "level 0", with level 3 being the root of the tree. A Page Table is itself a 4KiB page, containing an array of 512 Page Table Entries (PTEs), each a 64-bit structure. A PTE either points to the physical address of the next-level Page Table (in the case of levels 3 to 1), or the physical address of the "destination" page (in the case of level 0).</p>
<p>The physical address of the root page table is stored in the CR3 CPU register.</p>

<p>The only part that we need to care about is the address portion, in the middle. When you mask off all the flag bits, you're left with a physical memory address (since pages are 4K-aligned, the low bits are always zero).</p>
<p>For a probably-better explanation along with some diagrams, check out <a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/page-tables/">this article</a> from "Writing an OS in Rust" (note that they number the levels 4 to 1, which is probably more conventional 😅).</p>
<h3 id="the-translation-lookaside-buffer"><a href="#the-translation-lookaside-buffer">The Translation Lookaside Buffer</a></h3>
<p>If the process of traversing page tables to resolve a virtual address sounds expensive, that's because it is. That's where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer">TLB</a> comes in. It's a specialized piece of hardware inside the CPU that efficiently caches virtual-to-physical page mappings. The TLB has a finite size, and I don't actually know the size for my laptop but from what I can tell, it's somewhere on the order of 1024 entries (note that each entry corresponds to a whole page-sized mapping).</p>
<h2 id="exploit-strategy"><a href="#exploit-strategy">Exploit Strategy</a></h2>
<p>My exploit strategy was inspired by elements of Mark Seaborn's <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html">Rowhammer exploit</a>. The main goal is to get a Page Table for our own process mapped into user-accessible memory. Once we have that, we can modify the PTEs within it to grant ourselves access to arbitrary physical memory, which is essentially the keys to the kingdom.</p>
<p>Rather than try to control the layout of structures in physical memory (A physical-memory version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_feng_shui">heap feng shui</a>, I suppose?), my strategy is to fill up (aka "spray") as much of physical memory as possible with level-0 page tables. In practice I fill exactly 50% of physical memory.</p>
<p>Once the spray is complete, I sit in a loop trying to access a bunch of R/W mappings in a way that bypasses the TLB (because the number of mappings exceeds the TLB size), forcing a page table traversal on each access. I want to glitch the memory bus during that traversal in order to corrupt bit-29 of a level-0 PTE read. If I'm lucky (with about 50% odds) the glitch will offset the physical address that the PTE points to, making it point to one of the level-0 page tables that we sprayed earlier.</p>
<p>This should theoretically work with bit-flips in any bit position between 29 (corresponding to a 512MiB offset) and 12 (corresponding to a 4KiB offset). It just matters that the PTE ends up pointing "somewhere else," and because we've filled up ~50% of physical memory with exploitable page tables, we have a good chance of success. Therefore, soldering the antenna wire perhaps isn't totally necessary, if you can generate strong enough electromagnetic interference (although you'd have much higher chances of crashing or even bricking the whole system that way).</p>

<p>Each of the blocks in this diagram represent a 4K page of physical memory. Their locations within memory are more or less random, and aren't relevant to the exploit logic. What does matter is what points to what. The glitched PTE (in red) is supposed to point to the R/W page, but now it points to another level-0 page table, providing access to it <em>as if</em> it were a regular R/W page. In practice there are thousands more of these level-0 pages, and the glitched PTE could've ended up pointing to any one of them, but I can only fit so many on the diagram.</p>
<p>So how do I spray so many level-0 page tables?</p>
<p>First, I create a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html">memfd</a>, which is a relatively modern Linux feature. It fills the same role as the <code>/dev/shm/</code> file in Mark Seaborn's exploit, but without having to touch the filesystem at all. Then I use the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a> syscall to map this same buffer into memory, many times over. I use the <code>MAP_FIXED</code> option to force each mapping to be 2MiB-aligned in virtual memory, which guarantees the creation of a new level-0 page table each time. Linux has a ~<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>16</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math> limit to the number of mappings (VMAs, Virtual Memory Areas) that each process is allowed, so I make each mapping 32MiB long. This means each one generates 16 level-0 page tables. Although each mapping takes up 32MiB of virtual memory space, the PTEs all point to the exact same underlying physical pages. The physical memory cost of each mapping consists <em>only</em> of the level-0 page tables, and therefore I can spray as many of them as I want, until memory is full.</p>
<p>As I said before, we attempt to access the R/W mappings in a loop, waiting for a fault to happen. We can detect a fault because an unexpected value will come back, and if it was successful then the data should look like a PTE. If so, we now have R/W access to a page table. The next step is to figure out which virtual address this page table corresponds to. I do this by modifying the PTE to point at physical address 0 (which is an arbitrary choice, any address should work really) and then scanning the R/W mappings again to see which one changed, if any.</p>
<p>The MMU won't immediately "notice" edits to the PTE, because the virtual-&gt;physical address mappings are cached by the TLB. Every time we change it, we need to flush the TLB. There's no direct way of doing this from userspace (that I know of?) so instead I just access a few thousand of the R/W mappings in a loop, forcing the TLB to fill up with new values and evict the old ones.</p>
<p>At this point, we have full read/write access to all of physical memory! There are a bunch of strategies we could use from this point onwards, and again I took inspiration from the Rowhammer exploit. I open the <code>/usr/bin/su</code> executable (which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid">setuid root</a>) nominally in read-only mode (I don't have write permissions!) and mmap the first page of it. Then, I scan through all of physical memory until I find that same page. Once I've found the physical page, I have full write access to it, and I replace it with my own tiny (&lt;4KiB) ELF <a href="https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/dram_emfi/blob/ccd7f254e0a2bc8ba02708d6228ea03e16330de7/payload/gimme_shell.c">program</a> that spawns a root shell. This effectively poisons Linux's page cache.</p>
<p>The next time someone (me) tries to invoke the <code>su</code> binary, Linux knows it already has the first page in memory and doesn't try to read it from disk again. So it re-uses that cached page, and starts executing our injected ELF instead. Game over!</p>
<p>My injected ELF also flushes the page cache (<code>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</code>), so the <em>next</em> time someone invokes <code>su</code> it functions normally again.</p>
<p>My full exploit source can be found <a href="https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/dram_emfi/blob/ccd7f254e0a2bc8ba02708d6228ea03e16330de7/linux_x86_64_lpe.c">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a demo video (sorry it's a bit blurry):</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X_D8BwEhuno?si=zjesyWpvSoxQm4hj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>I was unusually lucky on this run, normally it takes several clicks of the lighter to get a good glitch. Not shown are the several previous attempts that crashed the whole system! I'm not sure what the overall exploit reliability is, I haven't tried to measure it rigorously. When the laptop's screen is off and I'm SSHed in it feels like it's around 50%. But when I'm at a graphical shell like in the demo, it's maybe closer to 20% reliability. This system has integrated graphics, so perhaps the GPU's memory accesses interfere with the exploit. There are also various background services running (pipewire, sshd, systemd stuff etc.), and swap is enabled too. I wanted it to be a fairly realistic desktop Linux environment, and disabling all these things would probably increase reliability.</p>
<p>If the laptop had more RAM installed, I'd be able to fill an even higher percentage of it with page tables, which should also increase the overall exploit reliability.</p>
<h2 id="practical-uses"><a href="#practical-uses">Practical Uses</a></h2>
<p>As cool as my Linux LPE is, I already had root on that laptop because it's mine. Is there anything more "useful" we can do with it?</p>
<p>I'm not much of a PC gamer (more of a Nintendo fanboy), but I'm always irked when I see "anti-cheat" software that uses technologies like TPM to restrict the software you're allowed to run on the rest of your system. Perhaps a reliable EMFI Windows LPE would let gamers take back control of their PCs without interfering with TPM attestation status.</p>
<p>Imagine a future where "Gaming RAM" sticks have a RP2040 on board to automate the whole exploit (and also drive the RGB LEDs, of course).</p>
<p>There's a similar story with Android devices and SafetyNet/Play Integrity checking, although fitting a glitching modchip into a phone would be more of a challenge.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts"><a href="#thoughts">Thoughts</a></h2>
<p>On a conceptual level, I've known about page tables and TLBs for a long time. But even when working on low-level performance optimizations, that knowledge has never actually <em>mattered</em> to me (Caching on the other hand becomes relevant all the time!) But in this exploit, all of it absolutely does matter, and it's been very satisfying to finally test that theoretical knowledge.</p>
<p>Actually seeing and interacting with the structures that maintain the illusion of virtual memory felt a bit like escaping the matrix.</p>
<h2 id="open-questions"><a href="#open-questions">Open Questions</a></h2>


<ul>
<li>Does it work on DDR4, DDR5? (I don't see any reason why not!)</li>
<li>Does it work on ARM? (Likewise)</li>
<li>To what extent do the various types of ECC mitigate this? (DDR5 Link-ECC in particular)</li>
<li>What's the simplest way to trigger similar faults electronically? (say, with an RP2040)</li>
<li>Can you use this to break out of a hypervisor?</li>
<li>Can I write a Webkit exploit with this?</li>
<li>Can I write a Nintendo Switch kernel exploit with this?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to be looking into these in the future—stay tuned!</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to thank JEDEC for paywalling all of the specification documents that were relevant to conducting this research.</p>

                The now-demolished Agbogbloshie Scrapyard in Accra, Ghana, once received about 15,000 tons of electronic waste each year, making it one of the largest e-waste processing sites in Africa.

   <p>When he was just 18 years old, Emmanuel Akatire traveled about 500 miles from his home in Zorko, Ghana, to Accra, the nation’s capital, to find the only work he could — sifting through vast piles of discarded electronics to find valuable scrap metal. A week’s worth of painstaking, often dangerous work, earns him the equivalent of about 60 U.S. dollars.</p>   <p>“I started doing scrap work around 2021 — after I lost both my parents — to provide for the rest of my family,” he told Muntaka Chasant, a photojournalist in Ghana. “There’s no electricity in my community, no development there,” he said. So he came to Accra, which has become a major dumping ground for the globe’s used electronics.</p>   
   <p>For years, a site called Agbogbloshie in Accra was one of the largest e-waste processing sites in Africa, getting 15,000 tons of discarded phones, computers and other used electronics each year. Many Western media outlets depicted the site as a public health and environmental tragedy, rife with toxic chemicals that leach into the water and poison the air. While that’s undoubtedly true, it’s not the full story, according to a new collaborative photojournalism project.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-24997">

   <p>The project, called <a href="https://www.fondationcarmignac.com/en/ANAS-AREMEYAW-ANAS-MUNTAKA-CHASANT-and-BeNeDICTE-KURZEN/"><u>E-Waste in Ghana: Tracing Transboundary Flows</u></a>, which won this year’s <a href="https://www.fondationcarmignac.com/"><u>Fondation Carmignac</u></a> photojournalism award, aims to capture both the positive and negative aspects of e-waste. </p>   <p>“The world cannot throw all its garbage here, it has truly negative consequences on the people,” says Anas Aremeyaw Anas, an investigative journalist in Ghana who co-led the project. “But there are positive aspects of sending us e-waste,” he says, as it’s sparked a dynamic, informal recycling economy in the country that, while often dangerous, can also help lift people like Emmanuel Akatire out of poverty.</p>   <p>Globally, e-waste is an enormous problem. In 2022, humans discarded about <a href="https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling"><u>62 million tons</u></a> of used electronics, enough to fill a line of trucks that spans the equator. But there’s opportunity too, as those trucks contain over <a href="https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling"><u>$91 billion of valuable metals</u></a>, the U.N. estimates, though people like Akatire who do the dangerous recycling work reap the smallest share of those potential profits.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-24921">

   <p>E-waste falls into two broad buckets: functional and non-functional. The line between them can be fuzzy, as what’s still usable or repairable to one person may not be to another, but the distinction is important. International laws prohibit trafficking of non-functional e-waste containing toxic substances, but the United Nations sees trading functional e-waste as beneficial, as it can lengthen the lifespan of a product.</p>   
   <p>The project found that exporters often fail to separate functional from non-functional e-waste. “If you have a container full of TV screens, how on earth are you going to verify each and every one of them to make sure that they are functioning,” says photojournalist Bénédicte Kurzen, a co-author of the project. As a result, both kinds of e-waste get stuffed into container ships that make their way to low- and middle-income countries like Ghana.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-24923">

   <p>Formally, Ghana prohibits the import of many forms of hazardous e-waste material. But the team found that a well-placed bribe can get port officials to look the other way. As a result, informal e-waste sites are growing across Ghana’s coast. There, both functional and non-functional e-waste get dumped into vast piles that are encroaching on residential areas. Thousands of “pickers” come to these sites, picking through the rubbish to separate items that might be repaired from waste that could contain valuable minerals.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-24925">

                An 18-year-old holding a hammer and a TV walks over pile of e-waste. Collecting e-waste to salvage can be dangerous work. Cuts, burns and other injuries are common, and e-waste sites are often blanketed in noxious fumes.

   <p>Many of the pickers are climate migrants from an area of Ghana known as the “Upper East,” says project co-author Chasant, where warming temperatures are upending traditional farming practices. “This area has the highest unemployment rate among young people,” he says. They come to e-waste sites to earn money during the dry season, Chasant says, which they bring back to the Upper East. “There’s a whole generation of young people that are building their society from e-waste work.”</p>   <p>It’s fraught, precarious work. To separate valuable minerals, like copper wire or iron, from useless plastic, pickers often burn the trash, producing noxious fumes. Burns, cuts and other injuries are common. E-waste workers — many of whom are children, the team found — are at risk of exposure to over <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-06-2021-soaring-e-waste-affects-the-health-of-millions-of-children-who-warns"><u>1,000 harmful chemicals</u></a>, according to the World Health Organization, including lead, mercury and brominated flame retardants, which are linked to higher rates of diseases like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24529398/"><u>cancer and diabetes</u></a>.</p>   
   <p>Bernard Akanwee Atubawuna, a 21-year-old picker from Upper East, died while doing scrap work, says Chasant. His cause of death is unknown, but “Akanwee was a sickle-cell carrier and should never have been anywhere near fires/picking. But his parents said it was the only way he supported them. He sent his sister to learn a trade. He was also helping the parents to build a house back in the Upper East — all from picking.”</p>   <div id="resg-s1-24926">

   <p>The harms extend beyond the dumps themselves. “There are many communities that have run to a halt as a result of the devastating effects of the poisonous gases that are inhaled,” says Anas. Heavy metals seep into the soil and water too, which can have profound health effects on local communities. “When people start burning, the poisonous fumes lead to people relocating.”</p>   <div id="resg-s1-24929">

   <p>A burgeoning recycling and repair industry has risen up alongside those harms. The team documented informal marketplaces, where vendors sell scores of busted cell phones to buyers looking to repair circuit boards or extract their precious metals. On Zongo Lane in Accra, the reporters say, hundreds of small, independent shops sell used or repaired equipment, ranging from televisions to computers.</p>   <p>“In Africa, people still have this thing of repairing is important. Don't throw it away. You can still do things about it,” says Kurzen. In Western countries, people view these objects as much more disposable, she says, which is helping fuel the growth of e-waste worldwide.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-24927">

   <p>The most valuable minerals extracted from Ghana’s e-waste often don’t stay in Ghana. Many of the most valuable items get cherry picked and sent to more advanced smelters in Europe or Asia, the team found. “People are dismantling these items in toxic environments, and then the few piles that contain incredibly valuable minerals are going to be re-exported,” says Kurzen.</p>   
   <p>She and her colleagues hope that the project prompts people to re-examine their relationship to the electronics in their lives. The few years we spend with a new phone represents just a blip in the story of the materials that power it, Kurzen says. “Those materials are traveling worldwide,” she says, “These [devices] we hold in our hands come at the expense of somebody, somewhere in the world. Nothing comes for free.”</p>   <p><em>Jonathan Lambert is a Washington, D.C.-based freelance journalist who covers science, health and policy.</em><br></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/03/bytedance-tiktok-bytespider-scraper-bot/">https://fortune.com/2024/10/03/bytedance-tiktok-bytespider-scraper-bot/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41764670">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>ByteDance looks like it’s eager to make up for lost time when it comes to scraping the web for data needed to train its generative AI models.</p><div>



<p>The China-based parent company of video app TikTok released its own web crawler or scraper bot, dubbed Bytespider, sometime in April, according to research from Kasada, a company that specializes in bot management for companies with online data. The existence of the bot was also confirmed by Dark Visitors, which monitors scraper bots.</p>



<p>ByteDance’s bot has quickly become one of the most, if not the single most, aggressive scrapers on the internet, the research shows. It’s scraping data at a rate that’s many multiples of other major companies, such as (<a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/">Google</a>, Meta, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a>, OpenAI, and Anthropic, which use <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/20/meta-external-agent-new-web-crawler-bot-scrape-data-train-ai-models-llama/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/20/meta-external-agent-new-web-crawler-bot-scrape-data-train-ai-models-llama/">their own scraper bots</a> to help create and improve their large language or multimodal models, known as LLMs or LMMs.</p>



<p>Sam Crowther, the CEO of Kasada, said since Bytespider showed up, it’s been scraping data at about 25 times the rate of GPTbot, which scrapes data for OpenAI’s ChatGPT platform and underlying models, for instance. Bytespider has been scraping at 3,000 times the rate of ClaudeBot, from Anthropic, which operates the Claude platform.</p>



<p>As the months have gone by, Bytespider has become even more aggressive, according to Kasada. Data shows huge spikes in scraping activity from Bytespider over each of the last six weeks.</p>



<p>Representatives of TikTok and ByteDance did not respond to emails seeking comment.</p>



<p>ByteDance’s aggressive scraping comes despite the possibility of TikTok being banned in the U.S in the coming months. President Joe Biden has signed legislation that requires ByteDance to sell TikTok, due to national security concerns, or shut it down.</p>



<p>The Bytespider bot, much like those of OpenAI and Anthropic, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-anthropic-ai-ignore-rule-scraping-web-contect-robotstxt" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-anthropic-ai-ignore-rule-scraping-web-contect-robotstxt" rel="noopener">does not respect robots.txt</a>, the research shows. Robots.txt is a line of code that publishers can put into a website that, while not legally binding in any way, is supposed to signal to scraper bots that they cannot take that website’s data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web scraping goes back decades, mainly by search engines to gather links to web pages. But the rise of generative AI tools has added a new dimension and made the practice a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/07/12/generative-ai-copyright-lawsuits-silverman-openai-google-meta/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/07/12/generative-ai-copyright-lawsuits-silverman-openai-google-meta/">prime source of lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/27/gen-ai-ethics-original-sins-data-theft-labor-exploitation-environmental-impact/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/27/gen-ai-ethics-original-sins-data-theft-labor-exploitation-environmental-impact/">controversy</a>. People and organizations whose work has been scraped argue their copyright is being infringed in the process. All of the models that underly generative AI tools were trained on massive amounts of online data, effectively everything available on the web, particularly written information. Tech companies use scraper bots to essentially copy it all for all for free and put it into their datasets.</p>



<p>“It’s like they’re trying desperately to catch up,” Crowther said of the aggressive scraping being done by Bytespider. Just last year, ByteDance was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003151/bytedance-china-openai-microsoft-competitor-llm" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003151/bytedance-china-openai-microsoft-competitor-llm" rel="noopener">reportedly so far behind</a> in the generative AI race that it was using OpenAI to help build ByteDance’s own LLM, which is against OpenAI’s terms of service. Earlier this year, ByteDance released a chat-based LLM <a href="https://fortune.com/asia/2024/05/22/china-ai-llm-price-war-discounts-bytedance-alibaba-baidu-iflytek/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/asia/2024/05/22/china-ai-llm-price-war-discounts-bytedance-alibaba-baidu-iflytek/">called Duabo</a>, but work on that model would have been completed prior to the accumulation of more recent training data scraped by Bytespider.</p>



<p>It’s “clear” that ByteDance is at work on a new LLM, according to one person familiar with the company. As for what ByteDance plans to do with a new LLM, a person familiar with the company’s ambitions said one goal has to do with the search function for TikTok.</p>



<p>Last week, TikTok released an update to its current search function focused on <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/introducing-search-ads-campaign?redirected=1&amp;ab_version=control&amp;agp_template_id=7400238737994547218" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://ads.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/introducing-search-ads-campaign?redirected=1&amp;ab_version=control&amp;agp_template_id=7400238737994547218" rel="noopener">keywords for ads</a>, basically allowing advertisers to search in real time for words that are trending on TikTok. It allows marketers to build an ad with relevant keywords that would ostensibly help the ad show up on the screens of more users.</p>



<p>A new AI model with data on more recent internet trends and topics could expand and improve TikTok’s search environment further, according to the person familiar with the company’s ambitions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Given the audience and the amount of use, TikTok with a search environment that is a completely biddable space with keywords and topics, that would be very interesting to a lot of people spending a ton of money with Google right now,” the person said.</p>

It gets even harder if you don't understand how people with disabilities use computers.

With ARIA DevTools you see your website the way screen readers present it to the blind users. All page elements are presented according to their explicit or implied ARIA roles. This includes headings, images, tables and form items beyond others.

It's now easy to spot missing ARIA labels, misused ARIA roles, and incomplete keyboard support. This makes testing and development of accessible websites easier.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>When Charlie Kelly</span> first messaged saying he wouldn’t make it home that night, his partner wasn’t happy. It was September 6, 2023, a Wednesday, and the 56-year-old, a keen hillwalker, had left the house that he shared with Emer Kennedy in Tillicoultry, near the Scottish city of Stirling, before she went to work. His plan was to climb Creise, a 1,100-meter-high peak overlooking Glen Etive, the remote Highland valley made famous by the James Bond film <em>Skyfall.</em></p><p>The weather was unusually mild for the season, and Kelly thought he might even have time to “bag” a second Munro, as the Scottish mountains above 3,000 feet are known. In his time off work as a forensic psychologist for the Scottish Prisons Service, he had been ticking off the peaks steadily. “He had this book he would mark them in,” Kennedy remembers. “But we were due to go on holiday in two and a half weeks, so this was the last Munro he was going to do before the winter set in.”</p><p>Hiking wasn’t something that Kennedy was particularly keen on herself. When the pair had first met four and a half years previously, they’d bonded over a shared love of Celtic Football Club, and their “extremely quirky” sense of humor. She’d fallen in love with Kelly’s brain—his encyclopedic knowledge of all things football, Robert the Bruce, and Doctor Who. He loved the fact that she laughed at “his terrible jokes,” she says. But he also appreciated the fact that she encouraged him in passions they didn’t share. “One of the last things he said to me the night before was, ‘You let me be me,’” she says.</p><p>So when Kelly told her he wouldn’t make it off the hill before nightfall, Kennedy was worried, but she trusted that he knew what he was doing. “Charlie was a very resourceful person,” she says. “At work, he was a trained negotiator, for when prisoners took hostages or went up on the roof. He generally didn’t take risks.” Kelly reassured her that there wasn’t any need to call for help. He had packed extra food, had plenty of water and enough warm clothes. He’d just wait for it to get light and walk down.</p><p>At work on the Thursday, Kennedy checked her phone whenever she had a break. Kelly had checked in before dawn and sent further cheery messages whenever he had reception. At around 8 pm, with the sun starting to set, he wrote to say his battery was running low, but she needn’t worry: He could see the lights of the Glencoe Ski Center, where he’d parked his car. There was still plenty of daylight left to reach it, he said. “It’ll take me about half an hour.” That was the last anyone heard from Charlie Kelly alive.</p><p>In the days following Kelly disappearance, Glencoe Mountain Rescue launched what they later described as a “Herculean” search effort, using sniffer dogs, quad bikes, multiple helicopters, and drones equipped with infrared and conventional camera equipment. The search involved professionals from the Coastguard, Police Scotland, and the Royal Air Force, as well as dozens of highly trained volunteers from 10 different Mountain Rescue (MR) teams. Often, there were as many as 50 people on the hill at a time. On Saturday, September 9, they found his backpack. But after that, nothing.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The breakthrough, when it came, was more than six weeks later. Dan Roach and David Binks, two MR team members from the Lake District, in northern England, had been following the news of the ongoing search online. In their spare time, they’d been developing a new piece of piloting and image analysis software, designed to help drones find missing people more effectively. After two years of work, involving what Binks calls “some hideous maths,” they had what they believed was a working prototype.</p><p>“I’d heard this search was going on,” Binks says, “and I kept thinking this would be quite a good place to try and test the system out. Then Dan phoned me while I was on my way home from holiday. He’d had the same idea.” The pair contacted Glencoe MR and asked if they could help. “I don’t think they thought anything was going to come of it,” says Binks. But by that point, they’d tried every other tool at their disposal. “So they were happy for us to try.”</p><p>On October 24, Binks, Roach, and Dan Parsons, a friend and fellow MR team member of Roach’s, who had helped with early testing, traveled to Glencoe. They met up with their local MR counterparts, launched two drones, and found Charlie Kelly’s body within the first hour.</p><div data-testid="feature-large-callout"><figure><p><span><p>Mountain rescue volunteers are often called out to find missing hikers, and drones have become an essential part of search and rescue plans</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Tom McNally</span></p></figure></div><p><span>Mountain Rescue in</span> the UK is often referred to as the country’s fourth emergency service. But unlike the police, fire brigade, or ambulance services, it is staffed entirely by volunteers. The country’s upland areas are covered by a patchwork of teams made up of locals from all walks of life. Each team operates as a separate registered charity, responsible for its own fundraising, training, and equipment.</p><p>This decentralized structure has its advantages, according to Mike Park, the elected CEO of MR England &amp; Wales, an umbrella body that helps improve cooperation between teams. “But the negative side is it can bring a lot of individualistic, ‘we know best’ type attitudes,” he says. Park is the former leader of Cockermouth MR in the Lake District—Roach and Parsons’ team—and a volunteer himself for “coming up to 42 years.” He explains that MR members—the majority of whom are men—sometimes get a bit too tribal about their areas of expertise, and new ideas take longer to spread than he would like. “There’s this old culture where it’s like you’ve got to do 20 years before you’re allowed to be listened to,” he says.</p><p>When consumer camera drones first became widely available in the early 2010s, their usefulness in search and rescue situations seemed self-evident. They would allow teams to cover vast areas, for a fraction of the cost of a helicopter. But Roach, an early enthusiast who’d used drones for photography work, wasn’t convinced. A keen climber, with long, curly hair and a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pedro-pascal-interview-last-of-us-mandalorian/">Pedro Pascal mustache</a>, he joined Cockermouth MR a decade ago and is still one of the team’s younger members at 34. “Everyone thought, ‘This is going to be brilliant because I can see things.’ But then they realized you have to be very close to the thing that you want to see, and you have to be able to see it on a very small controller.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>If you’re trying to find a needle in a haystack, having an aerial view of the haystack doesn’t necessarily help. Instead, Roach argued that they should be taking advantage of drones’ ability to fly preprogrammed flight paths and trying to automate the search process as far as possible. Among MR’s old guard, however, he faced an uphill battle to get his ideas heard. “I remember one MR conference at Leeds University, where Dan shows up with his long hair and his skateboard,” Mike Park says, “and someone asked if he’d walked into the wrong place—they thought he was a student who’d come back a week early.”</p><p>Frustrated by people’s refusal to listen, Roach pressed on regardless, with the help of his friend and fellow volunteer Dan Parsons. As well as being a similar age, Parsons, 33, had a background in forestry and had previously used drones for surveying purposes. The pair of them set about testing off-the-peg piloting and photography software. They also found a program that could pick out pixels of particular colors, like the red of a hiker’s jacket. “In the end we had this extremely tech-heavy, very janky system,” Roach remembers. “It worked, but it wasn’t pretty. You had three different bits of software that you had to engage to search.” It wasn’t until Roach met David Binks, a retired software developer who volunteers with Duddon &amp; Furness MR, which covers an area about 30 miles south of Cockermouth, that the idea really began to take shape. Roach spoke about his attempts to automate drone searches at a meeting of Lake District pilots and remembers Binks collaring him afterward. “He said, ‘I hadn’t thought about it like that. Let’s chat.’”</p><p>They make for an unusual pairing. Roach, “the ideas guy,” exudes a Tiggerish enthusiasm, whereas Binks is a far quieter presence, with an engineer’s analytical brain. At 57, Binks is more than 20 years older, but crucially, he had experience not just of writing software, but software that had been widely adopted by MR. Starting in 2007, he’d built a program called MR Maps, which allowed teams to track their members in near real time, based on regular pings from their radios. In an era before GPS-enabled smartphones or handheld devices were standard, it proved a game-changer. After initial meetings in late 2021 and early 2022, Binks decided the best way to build Roach’s idea was as an add-on to MR Maps.</p><figure><p><span><p>Thanks to new image-analysis software, humans can be more easily located among even dense foliage and rocky ground.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Tom McNally</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“I knew how the maths would work, from my background working in simulation software for offshore oil platforms and wind farms,” Binks says. “So I knew it was possible. But I did a lot of nights where, well, I’d start at 9 in the morning, and before I realized, it would be 3 in the morning, and I’d just been at it all day.” Perhaps betraying its homemade origins, and the fact that it was written using C++, the resulting software has what Roach describes as “a Windows 95 aesthetic.” But the basic interface belies an impressive level of sophistication.</p><p>Their main challenge, Binks explains, was threefold. “Part one is flying the drone in a way that photographs the ground in the most effective way.” The camera has to point straight down, and every inch of ground must feature in multiple frames, so that objects can’t be obscured by the angle of a wall or rock. “We have a 55 percent overlap, so one object should be in nine frames, on average,” Binks says. The preprogrammed flight paths are plotted automatically, at whatever height the pilot chooses, using the 2-meter by 2-meter <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/lidar/">lidar</a> data that underpins the contours of the UK’s Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, the official maps of the UK government (which OS supplies to MR for free). The software also tells the pilot where to stand to avoid losing the line of sight with the drone as it flies—a legal requirement in the UK.</p><p>“The second aspect of the software is calculating the grid reference of any particular pixel on an image,” Binks explains, “which you can do using rotational vectors, working out where they intersect with the ground.” The third element, Binks says, “is actually analyzing the images to work out what’s interesting.”</p><p>Roach and Parsons’ “janky” off-the-peg version involved inputting the specific colors that you wanted to search for, but Binks, crucially, realized it would be easier to flip that on its head. “So I tell it to count the number of pixels of any particular color, and then highlight clusters of colors that are unusual.” The red of a hiker’s jacket would still stand out on a grassy background, Binks explains, “but if the image is all rocks, then green would be a more unusual color.”</p><p>The system is designed to operate entirely offline, allowing it to be used in remote locations. This means the images have to be downloaded from the drone after each flight, but the analysis can be done in the field, with clusters of unusual-colored pixels flagged for human review while the drone moves on to the next search zone. “There are a lot of false positives, but it doesn’t take long for a human to go through them,” Binks says. “Usually it’s funny-colored moss, or rocks, or a sheep,” Roach says. “But every now and again, it’s a person.”</p><figure><p><span><p>Operators can plot out areas for the drones to focus on and can create automated flight paths to search.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Tom McNally</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>The wild, boulder-strewn</span> hinterland behind the Glencoe Ski Center provided a near-perfect proving ground for MR Maps’ new capabilities. Between the top of the lifts and the single-track road that snakes its way down to a dead end in Glen Etive, there’s very little except rocks, dun-colored tussocks, and the occasional deer. “The ground here is quite complex,” explains Brian Brathurst, one of Glencoe MR’s deputy team leaders, with an accent and a level of understatement that betrays his Zimbabwean origins. “There’s a lot of boulder fields, there’s a lot of gully systems, and you could walk within five or 10 meters of somebody and not see them.”</p><p>As the search reached the end of its second week, the chances of finding Kelly alive dwindled, and the intensity of the efforts was inevitably dialed down. “Sadly, people have their lives to lead,” Brathurst says. “But on our patch, we don’t tend to give up on these things. We were out every free day we had. For those six weeks, there was always somebody out—people finishing work in the afternoon and going and exploring areas that hadn’t been searched. It never really stopped.”</p><p>When Binks, Roach, and Parsons arrived, they were well briefed. “Without the work Glencoe had done, there’s no way we’d be able to do what we did,” Binks says. With the two Dans operating one drone, and Binks handling another, they divided up the most promising-sounding search areas between them and headed out to different starting points. Despite all the work they’d put into the software, they were nervous. “We’d found our coats in fields and simulated it,” remembers Parsons, “but we’d never found anything that we didn’t know we’d already put there.”</p><p>David started flying his first search zone, “Area A.” But about 10 minutes into the flight, the drone started to disappear out of sight. Annoyed that it had already gone wrong, he called it back and made a mental note to tweak the software. “I thought, OK, fine, I’ll do Area B now. But while it’s doing that, I’ll check what I’ve got from Area A.” He started cycling through the flagged photos, and suddenly, there it was. “Two of the images had Mr. Kelly in them,” remembers Binks. “I was stunned.”</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><p>Dan Parsons, David Binks, and Dan Roach, creators of the MR Maps–enabled drones.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Tom McNally</span></p></figure></div><p>When Glencoe’s recovery team reached the spot, they found Kelly had fallen a distance of several meters, suffering fatal head and chest injuries. There is no way of knowing precisely when he’d died, according to Brathurst. But there were combine harvesters working further up the valley on the evening of September 7. Because of Kelly’s last message, Binks says, we think he maybe made a beeline straight to those lights thinking it was the Ski Center, and fell in the process. But we’ll never know exactly.”</p><p>What was clear was that Kelly was nowhere near where he thought he was. Despite this, the area where he was eventually found had been searched extensively. But Kelly had fallen into a gully, obscuring the line of sight of rescuers on the ground. The muted colors of his clothing, meanwhile, had made him all but impossible to see from the air. “He was wearing a lightish brown top and dark blue trousers,” Binks explains. “To the human eye that’s really hard to pick out. But to the computer, it’s just totally different to the surroundings—and so it stands out like a sore thumb.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Brathurst himself was one of the volunteers who had searched that area on foot. “We literally walked within probably 20 or 30 meters of him,” he says. And yet they’d not seen a thing.</p><div data-testid="feature-large-callout"><figure><p><span><p>Even for experienced hikers, the outdoors can be a dangerous place.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Tom McNally</span></p></figure></div><p><span>If finding Charlie</span> Kelly in the first area they searched involved a good deal of luck, it also showed the powerful potential of MR Maps. The software has proved its usefulness in multiple other searches in the months since, mostly by helping eliminate areas of interest. “Dan likes to boast that we have a 100 percent hit rate,” Parsons says. “Although we’ve only found one person, we’ve never flown over an area where someone was and not found them yet.”</p><p>So far, the software has been used mostly in the Lake District. But with Mike Park’s encouragement, Roach, Parsons, and Binks have been assisting other teams across the country too, when requested. When the celebrated British TV doctor <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1dd7ekyrpyo">Michael Mosley</a> went missing on the island of Symi in Greece, Park even had conversations with his Greek counterparts about the trio flying out to help. “It actually looked like perfect terrain for this system, because it was rocky, and this can see around all the rocks,” Binks says. In the end, Mosley was found before they could deploy, but it’s easy to see how their software could reduce the agonizing wait for families like Mosley’s—as well as the burden for those with boots on the ground.</p><p>In the UK, MR is facing mounting pressure. “The number of callouts has been increasing for years,” says Ian Bunting, operations director for the umbrella body MR England &amp; Wales, “but we’ve seen a massive leap since <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/covid-19/">Covid</a>.” Hiking and other outdoor activities became hugely popular when team sports were banned, he says, and with foreign travel off limits, the country’s national parks saw a surge in visitor numbers. “On the back of that, you’ve got the rise of social media,” Bunting says, which has helped publicize particular spots.</p><p>Cockermouth, Dan Roach and Parsons’ team in the Lake District, attended a record number of callouts last year. In North Wales, the Llanberis MR team, which covers Yr Wyddfa, the area’s highest peak, warned publicly that their team members were risking “burnout” after attending more than 300 incidents in 2023—up from just 100 in 2008. As a volunteer for 30 years with Edale MR in the Peak District, Bunting says the burden can be significant. “There are people in my team who attended over 100 incidents on their own,” he says. “With training, equipment checks, and everything, I was up to 600 hours last year.”</p><p>“The bottom line is that people are volunteers,” Bunting acknowledges, “and the beauty about being a volunteer is you can say no. But the other thing about volunteering is generally the kind of people who volunteer <em>don’t</em> say no.” Against this backdrop, any tool that helps reduce the time spent searching is a welcome addition to the MR toolkit, he says. Binks and Roach’s program wouldn’t necessarily be needed in the majority of callouts, where the location of the person is known. But its potential to cut the hours spent on resource-sapping “formal searches” (which make up between 10 and 15 percent of annual callouts according to figures shared with WIRED by MR England &amp; Wales) is huge.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Globally, the market for search and rescue drones is worth around $4 billion, according to Lucintel, a market research firm. But despite their product’s myriad possible uses in mountainous regions around the world, Binks and Roach have zero interest in commercializing it. In the UK, Binks has always made MR Maps free for anyone involved in search and rescue. This includes the police, and several forces have started experimenting with the drone add-on. “It’s going to be used for search, so I’m quite happy with that,” Binks says.</p><p>“I’ve never really been interested in monetizing it,” he says. Instead, his motivation is simple. “I just quite enjoy the problem-solving aspects.” And in the end, he points out, the only real development cost was his, Roach’s, and Parsons’ time—which is something they, like thousands of other MR volunteers across the UK, are happy to give to help those in need.</p><figure><p><span><p>David Binks’ MR Maps software originally let rescue team members track “pings” from their radios.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Tom McNally</span></p></figure><p><span>When two uniformed</span> police officers knocked on Emer Kennedy’s door in late October 2023, they simply said, “You know why we’re here,’” she remembers. She’d been hoping against hope that the outcome would be different. But after six weeks, she says, he “main panic was are they going to find him before winter comes in?” And if not, would they ever find him?</p><p>People traveled from far and wide for Charlie Kelly’s funeral. Professional associates from across the country. University friends from around the world. The Pogues played as his coffin was carried out, and a collection was taken for charity—with the proceeds going to the Glencoe MR team.</p><p>“Even though they do it on a voluntary basis, they’re incredible professionals,” says Kennedy. “If that Mountain Rescue team hadn’t come up with that software and hadn’t been willing to test it out there … ” She leaves the thought hanging. In the end, she says, “I’m just glad we have closure. It means his kids can have a life. And you know, we got to say goodbye—his friends and family got to say goodbye.”</p><p><em>This article appears in the November/December 2024 issue of</em> <em>WIRED UK magazine.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://aarol.dev/posts/go-contentlength/">https://aarol.dev/posts/go-contentlength/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41762468">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Published 06.10.2024</span></p><p>Anyone who has implemented a simple HTTP server can tell you that it is a really simple protocol. Basically, it’s a text file that has some specific rules to make parsing it easier.</p><p>All HTTP requests look something like this: <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>GET /path HTTP/1.1<span>\r\n</span>
</span></span><span><span>Host: aarol.dev<span>\r\n</span>
</span></span><span><span>Accept-Language: en,fi-FI<span>\r\n</span>
</span></span><span><span>Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate<span>\r\n</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>\r\n</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The first line is the “request line”, and it has the requested method, path and HTTP version.
The following lines are headers, each terminated with “carriage return” and “line feed” characters. There is also an extra CRLF at the end, to mark the end of the header section. After that, there is the message body which can whatever data you want to send.</p><p>Here is a simple Go program to demonstrate this, using a raw TCP socket for the client:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When I tried this, I got the following response:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="http"><span><span><span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span> <span>200</span> <span>OK</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>Date</span><span>:</span> <span>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 14:51:13 GMT</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>Content-Length</span><span>:</span> <span>12</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>text/plain; charset=utf-8</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>Hello</span> <span>world!</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>One interesting thing about this is the header <code>Content-Length</code>, which has a value of 12. That’s exactly the length of <code>"Hello world!"</code> in UTF-8. In the above Go code, writing the response happens in two parts: first we write<code>"Hello"</code>, then we write <code>" world!"</code>. Notice that we didn’t need to call any function to write the headers, but they are still in the response. In Go’s http package, a status of 200 and the headers are automatically written if <code>w.Write()</code> is called before <code>w.WriteHeader()</code>. Any calls to <code>w.WriteHeader()</code> after that are useless and will output a warning.</p><p>Remember that in HTTP, the headers are always written <em>before</em> the body. How is it possible that before writing “Hello” to the connection, the server already knows how long the response will be? What if I wanted to write one “Hello”, and then a thousand exclamation marks after that? Or a million? Does the server need to know how long every response is before sending it? It would mean that every response needs to be kept in memory for the entire duration of the handler.</p><p>I wanted to figure this out, and I didn’t have to look too deep. I found this <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/2f507985dc24d198b763e5568ebe5c04d788894f/src/net/http/server.go#L1630C1-L1663C22">amazing comment</a> in the standard library’s <code>net/http/client.go</code> file. Basically, it says that if the response is small enough to fit into one “chunking buffer”, the length can be calculated very easily, and sent all at once. If the response is bigger than the buffer, it is sent in chunks. What does this mean in practice? I’ve modified the above code to demonstrate it:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

Clever!</p><p>The first line of the response data is now a number “800”. Why 800? As it turns out, the number is actually a hexadecimal number, <code>0x800</code> is 2048 in base 10.

In Go, trailers need to be explicitly declared before sending them:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"GET /test"</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>(<em>This is part of a series on the design of a language. See the list of posts <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/#zest">here</a></em>.)</p>
<p>Many 'scripting' languages use a hashmap for their default associative data-structure (javascript objects, python dicts, etc). Hashtables have a lot of annoying properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#Hash_flooding">hash flooding</a>. </li>
<li>If protected against hash flooding by random seeds, the iteration order becomes non-deterministic which is annoying for snapshot testing, reproducible builds, etc.</li>
<li>May have to rehash on insert, which produces terrible worst-case latencies for large hashmaps.</li>
<li>Repeatedly growing large allocations without fragmentation is difficult on wasm targets, because virtual memory tricks are not available and pages can't be unmapped.</li>
<li>Vector instructions on wasm are limited and there are no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set">AES instructions</a>. This makes many hash functions much slower.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ordered data-structures like b-trees don't have any of these disadvantages. They are typically slower than hashmaps, but I was surprised to find fairly wide variation in people's expectations of how much slower. So let's compare:</p>
<ul>
<li>rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html">std::collections::HashMap</a> with siphash</li>
<li>rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html">std::collections::BTreeMap</a></li>
<li>zig's <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/hash_map.zig">std.HashMap</a> with siphash</li>
<li>zig's <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/hash_map.zig">std.HashMap</a> with wyhash</li>
<li>My own <a href="https://github.com/jamii/maps/blob/main/bptree.zig">bptree</a> with various compile-time options for different experiments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microbenchmarks-are-hard">microbenchmarks are hard</h2>
<p>Let's start with the dumbest possible benchmark - fill a map with uniformly distributed random integers, measure how many cycles takes to lookup all those integers, and take the mean over many iterations.</p>

<p>That makes btrees look pretty bad. Much worse, in fact, than the <a href="https://github.com/Rufflewind/bench-maps/">other benchmark</a> that several people pointed me at, where at similar sizes btree lookups are only ~2x slower than hashmaps. But don't worry, we can reproduce that too:</p>

<p>All we did differently was average over one lookup at a time instead of over many, but somehow that made the hashmaps 2-3x slower!</p>
<p>Both of these benchmarks are pretty bad, so let's make better versions of both before trying to explain the differences. I only did this for the zig data-structures, because I am lazy.</p>
<p>First, rather than looking the keys up in the same order we inserted them, we'll precompute a random sample (with replacement):</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span>const</span><span> keys_hitting </span><span>= </span><span>try</span><span> map.allocator.</span><span>alloc</span><span>(Key</span><span>, </span><span>@max</span><span>(batch_size</span><span>,</span><span> count))</span><span>;
</span><span>var</span><span> permutation </span><span>= </span><span>XorShift64</span><span>{}</span><span>;
</span><span>for </span><span>(keys_hitting) </span><span>|*</span><span>key</span><span>| </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> i </span><span>=</span><span> permutation.</span><span>next</span><span>() </span><span>%</span><span> count</span><span>;
</span><span>    key</span><span>.* =</span><span> keys[i]</span><span>;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then rather than measuring a single lookup at a time, we'll measure a batch of 256 lookups to amortize out the overhead of the rdtscp instruction and pull the panics out of the measurement:</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span>for </span><span>(0</span><span>..</span><span>@divTrunc</span><span>(keys_hitting.len</span><span>,</span><span> batch_size)) </span><span>|</span><span>batch</span><span>| </span><span>{

<p>Now we make one tiny tweak. Instead of iterating through the batch in order, we'll use the value we just looked up to pick the next key.</p>

<p>Now we have two benchmarks with the exact same batch size and the exact same instructions to execute. The only difference is that in <code>lookup_hit_chain</code> we've introduced a data dependency between each iteration of the loop - we need to know <code>value</code> before we know what to lookup next. This prevents successful speculative execution of the next loop iteration.</p>

<p>The wyhash hashmap halves it's lookup time in <code>lookup_hit_batch</code> vs <code>lookup_hit_chain</code> but the btree doesn't benefit at all. I don't understand the limits to speculative execution at all, but let's make some mildly informed guesses.</p>
<p>At 2^16 keys the whole dataset is about 1mb, which fits comfortably in L2 but is much bigger than L1. Each hashmap lookup costs 1 or maybe 2 L2 cache lookups, each of which have ~20 cycle latency. The wyhash <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/3b465ebec59ee942b6c490ada2f81902ec047d7f//lib/std/hash/wyhash.zig#L110-L113">fast path for u64</a> is only a handful of instructions with no branches:</p>

</span><span>bench[0x101474d] &lt;+61&gt;: retq
</span></code></pre>
<p>So while we're waiting for one cache lookup we can start hashing the next key (if we can predict what it is) and maybe even get started on the next cache lookup.</p>
<p>The btree at 2^16 keys has 4 levels. There are typically 15-16 keys per node when inserting random keys, so we'll expect to do around 32 comparisons on average before finding our key. The body of that search loop looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>bench[0x10121b0] &lt;+16&gt;: cmpq   %rdx, (%rdi,%rax,8)
</span><span>bench[0x10121b4] &lt;+20&gt;: jae    0x10121c2                 ; &lt;+34&gt; at bptree.zig
</span><span>bench[0x10121b6] &lt;+22&gt;: addq   $0x1, %rax
</span><span>bench[0x10121ba] &lt;+26&gt;: cmpq   %rax, %rsi
</span><span>bench[0x10121bd] &lt;+29&gt;: jne    0x10121b0                 ; &lt;+16&gt; [inlined] bench.less_than_u64 + 9 at bench.zig:159:5
</span></code></pre>
<p>So 5 instructions, including two branches, per comparison. At least 160 instructions and 64 branches for the whole lookup.</p>
<p>The 16 keys take up 2 cachelines, so we'll average 1.5 cache lookups for each linear key search, plus 1 cache lookup to hit the child/values array. 10 cache lookups in total for the whole btree lookup. Each of those cache lookups depends on the previous lookup so it'll be hard to speculate correctly, but prefetching might help within a single node. If every cache lookup hit L2 in strict series we'd expect ~200 cycles, but probably some of the earlier nodes are in L1.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's leave that rabbit hole alone for now. It's enough to notice that hashmaps benefit from speculative execution between multiple lookups and btrees don't.</p>
<p>We can roughly think of <code>lookup_hit_batch</code> as measuring throughput and <code>lookup_hit_chain</code> as measuring latency. All the other benchmarks I've seen only measure one or the other, which starts to explain the disagreement over btree vs hashmap performance.</p>
<h2 id="string-keys">string keys</h2>
<p>Btrees do a lot of key comparisons. If the keys are integers then they are stored in the btree node, so it doesn't matter too much. But for strings keys we potentially pay for a cache lookup for every comparison.</p>

<p>Completely random strings is actually pretty unlikely and unfairly benefits the btree, which typically only has to compare the first character of each string to find that they are not equal. But real datasets (eg urls in a log) often have large common prefixes. We can see the difference if we make the first 16 characters constant:</p>

<p>Hashmaps don't care, but the btree is really hurting.</p>
<p>If we're just supporting strings we can optimize for this case by storing the length of the common prefix within each node. But it's hard to imagine how to generalize that to arbitrary types. What if the key is a tuple of strings? Or a small set?</p>

<p>The overall ratios are fairly similar, although wyhash seems to have been penalized a little relative to siphash.</p>
<p>Neither the hash functions nor the table scan generates vector instructions at all, even when comparing strings. And, uh, now that I think to look, they don't generate vector instructions on x86 either. So I guess that's a non-issue.</p>
<h2 id="btree-tuning">btree tuning</h2>
<p>I implemented both btrees and b+trees. I didn't see much difference between them for insert/lookup, so I preferred the b+tree for the easier/faster implementation of scans and range queries.</p>
<p>The rust btreemap fixes the max key count per node to 11. For all the workloads I've tried the sweet spot seems to be to fix the node size to 512 bytes, which is 31 keys for u64 and 20 keys for strings. </p>
<p>Allowing leaves and branches to have different sizes didn't help.</p>
<p>I gained a small speedup by manually laying out the node like <code>key_count, keys, values/children</code>. Zig by default prefers to put <code>key_count</code> at the end of the struct to avoid padding, but we always read the key_count first so it's nice to get some keys on the same cacheline. Maintaining this optimization across different architectures was annoying though, so I rolled it back and it's not reflected in the tests above.</p>
<p>The rust btreemap <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/55a22d2a63334e0faff0202b72a31ce832b56125/library/alloc/src/collections/btree/search.rs#L223">switches on Ordering</a>. I got a small boost from instead using <code>less_than</code> during the search and calling <code>equal</code> afterwards. For a lookup at 2^16 keys we'll expect to call <code>less_than</code> 32 times and <code>equal</code> once, so it's worth paying for the extra call to <code>equal</code> in exchange for tightening up the inner search loop.</p>
<p>I use tried various different binary searches. The best was this 'branchless' variant:</p>

<p>Linear search was still faster in most benchmarks though, even with ludicrously large node sizes.</p>
<p>I also tried a btree variant I saw in some paper where leaves are left unsorted and keys are always inserted at the end of the leaf. This saves some memcopying in the common case, but having to sort the leaf before splitting negates the benefit.</p>
<h2 id="outcome">outcome</h2>
<p>All the benchmarks above are basically best case scenarios, where we're doing a lot of lookups in a row. If we were just doing one lookup in the middle of some other work then the btree might not be in cache at all and each of those 2.5 cache lookups per level are going all the way to main memory. That's catastrophic. Whereas an open-addressed hashmap will typically only hit 1 or 2 cachelines per lookup regardless of size.</p>
<p>And while btrees avoid many of the performance edge cases of hashmaps, they also have some cliffs of their own to fall off as comparisons get more expensive and touch more memory, as we saw with the random-ish strings above.</p>
<p>I haven't measure space usage yet, but we can expect it to be worse for btrees. For random keys the typical node occupancy is 50%, minus per-node overhead like key_count, whereas I've been running the zig hashmaps at 80%. So we can guesstimate the btrees will use &gt;60% more memory.</p>
<p>Space usage is really bad for small maps too. I'd need to add some extra tweaks to allow the btree root node to start small and grow, rather than paying the full 512 bytes for a map with only 1 key.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm unconvinced that it's worth exploring btrees further. I'll stick to hashmaps and I'll either iterate in insertion order or I'll require sorting entries before iterating. But if anyone else likes the look of this rabbit hole I left some other ideas untouched:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the hash function part of the stable api for the compiler. Use an open-addressed hashtable that preserves hash order. Solve hash flooding without seeding the hash eg by falling back to a tree.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie">Hash-array mapped tries</a> have similar O(log(n)) cacheline behaviour to btrees. But if we used open-addressed hashtables at the leaves we could keep the nesting depth pretty low.</li>
<li>In-memory LSMs with incremental merging work pretty well in differential dataflow, but still have this O(log(n)) cacheline behaviour. But maybe with a hashmap as secondary index lookups might be reasonable, and we can consider slow inserts the price to pay for not rehashing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="miscellanea">miscellanea</h2>
<p>All the experiments here are using:</p>
<ul>
<li>rustc 1.77.2</li>
<li>zig 0.14.0-dev.1694+3b465ebec</li>
<li>wasmtime-cli 20.0.2</li>

<ul>
<li>efficiency cores disabled</li>
<li>scaling governer set to performance</li>
<li>turbo mode disabled</li>

</ul>
<p>Usually I would also use cset to pin experiments to a shielded core, but it seems that recent systemd versions have broken that workflow and I haven't figured out a replacement yet.</p>
<p>The rest of the benchmark setup can be found in <a href="https://github.com/jamii/maps">jamii/maps</a>. I measured more than just lookups, but btrees have similar performance for every operation due to having to find a key first.</p>
<p>Cache latency numbers came from <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/intelr-memory-latency-checker.html">mlc</a> and roughly match claims I found online.</p>
