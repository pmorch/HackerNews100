<p>2024-04-03</p>

<p>I’ve received numerous complaints via email, social media, and forums regarding a website that poses a significant threat to our community. The site in question is <code>https://notepad.plus/</code> which appears prominently when users google for “download Notepad++”.</p>

<p><img src="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/assets/images/downloadNppGoogling.png"></p>

<p>Some users have mistakenly believed that <code>https://notepad.plus/</code> is the official Notepad++ website. This confusion has led to frustration and potential security risks.</p>

<p>Despite declaring itself an “<em>unofficial fan website created for general information/educational purposes only</em>”, this site harbors a hidden agenda. It is riddled with malicious advertisements on every page. These advertisements aim to deceive unsuspecting Notepad++ users into clicking on them, generating profits for the site owners.</p>

<p>The true purpose of <code>https://notepad.plus/</code> becomes evident when we recognize that it seeks to divert traffic away from the legitimate Notepad++ website, notepad-plus-plus.org. By doing so, it compromises user safety and undermines the integrity of our community.</p>

<h3 id="action-needed-report-the-parasite-site">Action Needed: Report the Parasite Site</h3>

<p>We urgently request your assistance in reporting this malicious website. By doing so, you contribute not only to the protection of the Notepad++ community but also to the preservation of a safe internet environment for all users.</p>

<p>Please use the following link to report <code>https://notepad.plus/</code> as a harmful site:<br>
<a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_badware/?hl=en" target="blank"><strong>Report malicious software</strong></a></p>

<p>Your vigilance matters. Let’s stand together to safeguard our community and maintain a secure online ecosystem.</p>

<p>Thank you for your prompt action.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The SUSE security team restricts the installation of system wide D-Bus
services and Polkit policies in openSUSE distributions and derived SUSE
products. Any package that ships these features needs to be reviewed by us
first, before it can be added to production repositories.</p>

<p>In November, openSUSE KDE packagers approached us <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1217076">with a long list of KDE
components</a> for an upcoming KDE6 major release. The packages
needed adjusted D-Bus and Polkit whitelistings due to renamed interfaces or
other breaking changes. Looking into this many components at once was a unique
experience that also led to new insights, which will be discussed in this
article.</p>

<p>For readers that are new to D-Bus and/or Polkit, the following sections offer
a summary to get a better idea about these systems.</p>

<h2 id="d-bus-overview">D-Bus Overview</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/">D-Bus message bus system</a> provides a defined way to implement
remote procedure calls in applications. On Linux it is usually only used
locally, although the D-Bus specification also allows for operation over the
network.</p>

<p>A D-Bus service is a program that provides one or more interfaces that can be
invoked by clients to obtain information, trigger operations and so on. The
D-Bus specification defines a set of data types that can be passed to and
returned from D-Bus method calls.</p>

<p>D-Bus applications reach each other by connecting to a shared bus of which
there exist two predefined types: the system bus and the session bus. Services
that perform system wide tasks connect to the system bus. These services often
run as <code>root</code> or as dedicated service users. A session bus, on the other hand,
is created for each (graphical) user session, and only applications running
with the privileges of the logged-in user can connect to it. No special
privileges are involved with the session bus. Its main purpose is to provide a
defined API for session wide services, like a desktop search engine.</p>

<h2 id="polkit-overview">Polkit Overview</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/polkit.8.html">Polkit</a> is an authorization framework that allows (privileged)
applications to decide whether a user in the system is allowed to perform a
specific action. These actions allow for a more fine-grained authorization
model when compared to a plain <code>root</code> vs. non-<code>root</code> decision. Examples could be
an action to enable a Bluetooth device in the system, or to mount a removable
storage device.</p>

<p>A Polkit policy configuration file declares actions used by a certain
application domain and the authentication requirements for it. When an actor
in the system asks an application that uses Polkit to perform an action, then
this application in turns asks the system-wide Polkit daemon whether this
actor is privileged to do so. Depending on the context this can, for example,
lead to a password prompt being displayed in a user’s graphical session to
authorize the operation.</p>

<p>Polkit is independent of D-Bus, but the combination of both is a very common
pattern. Other manners in which Polkit can be used is in setuid-root binaries
or via the sudo-like <code>pkexec</code> utility.</p>

<h2 id="security-relevance-of-d-bus-and-polkit">Security Relevance of D-Bus and Polkit</h2>

<p>The typical setup of D-Bus and Polkit is as follows: a system daemon is
running with full root privileges and registers a service on the D-Bus system
bus. An unprivileged user that is logged into a graphical session asks the
daemon via D-Bus to perform an activity. This triggers the Polkit
authentication process to determine whether the caller is allowed to do this.</p>

<p>Security-wise, there is quite a number of things that can go wrong in this
scenario. The following sections investigate typical issues that can arise.</p>

<h3 id="covering-all-privileged-code-paths">Covering all Privileged Code Paths</h3>

<p>The system daemon actually needs to implement the Polkit authorization check
properly for every sensitive D-Bus method it offers. Polkit is not something
that is magically turned on, but the privileged component needs to identify
all the code paths that need to be protected by it.</p>

<p>Some applications deliberately offer a mix of unauthenticated and
authenticated D-Bus methods. In these cases it can sometimes be hard to keep
all the possible side effects and outcomes in mind, which can lead to security
issues when something is overlooked.</p>

<h3 id="acting-as-root-on-behalf-of-unprivileged-users">Acting as root on Behalf of Unprivileged Users</h3>

<p>The privileged D-Bus service component often needs to act on behalf of an
unprivileged client. An example could be mounting a file system in the
caller’s home directory, or processing a file provided by the caller. This is
a classic crossing of privilege boundaries. Developers of such services are
often not aware of the problems that can arise, especially when accessing user
controlled paths as <code>root</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a privileged D-Bus service stores data from multiple users in a
shared system directory, then information leaks can occur by storing files with
too open permissions, or by mixing up different user contexts.</p>

<h3 id="the-integration-of-polkit-can-be-hard">The Integration of Polkit can be Hard</h3>

<p>Polkit has its own nomenclature and design principles that one needs to get
into, to fully understand it. Apart from this, even if Polkit is correctly
asked for permissions, the privileged service still needs to correctly
evaluate the result. A typical mistake that can happen in this area is when a
privileged service <em>does</em> ask Polkit correctly for authentication, but the
result is simply ignored and the privileged operation continues regardless.</p>

<h3 id="everybody-can-access-the-d-bus-system-bus">Everybody can Access the D-Bus System Bus</h3>

<p>By default, all local users can access the D-Bus system bus and talk to most
of the privileged services. Individual D-Bus service configuration files can
limit the scope of users that are allowed to invoke a D-Bus service’s methods.
This setup is the exception, however, as the majority of D-Bus services is
accessible to all users.</p>

<p>This increases the attack surface notably, as not only an interactive user
account that is running an authorized local session can talk to these
services, but also e.g. the <code>nobody</code> user account. These days, many system
daemons running on the network only have limited privileges or even use
dynamically allocated users provided by systemd. If one of these network
daemons with low privileges can be exploited, then weaknesses in privileged
D-Bus system services can offer the possibility to further escalate
privileges.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons why, as part of a defense-in-depth strategy, the
SUSE security team looks closely also into these components that aren’t
directly attached to the network.</p>

<h2 id="the-kde-kauth-framework">The KDE KAuth Framework</h2>

<p>The KDE desktop environment is a heavy user of D-Bus services both on the
system and on the session bus. It adds further abstractions on top of D-Bus
and on top of Polkit. The base component for this is the <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kauth/html/">KAuth
framework</a>. KAuth generates D-Bus configuration files and some
glue code to integrate D-Bus and Polkit into KDE applications. In KAuth, a
privileged D-Bus service running as <code>root</code> is called a KAuth helper.</p>

<p>We performed a <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1217178">dedicated follow-up review</a> of it for the KDE6
release. A former member of the SUSE security team had found <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1036244">a major security
flaw</a> in this glue code in 2017. Since the audit at the time was
comprehensive, we did not expect to find any major issues in the core
authorization logic anymore, and in fact we didn’t.</p>

<h2 id="problematic-use-of-qvariantmap-serialized-data">Problematic use of QVariantMap Serialized Data</h2>

<p>A peculiarity of KAuth is that, instead of the native D-Bus data types, only
binary blob objects are transferred on D-Bus level, that are based on the
<code>QVariantMap</code> data type offered by the Qt framework.</p>

<p>During the review we noticed that the implementation of this feature in KAuth
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kauth/-/blob/4e94f01d3a191861c8095f673d70291dc225f23e/src/backends/dbus/DBusHelperProxy.cpp#L218">is a bit shaky</a>, since potentially attacker controlled data
is processed during Qt data type deserialization, before the actual D-Bus
function callbacks are even invoked. In 2019, the upstream authors
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kauth/-/commit/fc70fb0161c1b9144d26389434d34dd135cd3f4a">had already identified this problem</a>, that can lead
to side effects like image data being deserialized, where actually only
strings and integers are expected. The KAuth code currently meddles with
internal Qt framework state to prevent such side effects.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-generated-d-bus-drop-in-configuration-snippets">Problems with generated D-Bus drop-in Configuration Snippets</h2>

<p>Only late in our review efforts we realized that a change introduced with the
KDE6 release of KAuth leads to <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1220215">overly open D-Bus configuration files being
generated</a>. Per-package configuration snippets for
D-Bus are installed in “/usr/share/dbus-1/system.d”. These configuration files
serve as a kind of firewall configuration for the D-Bus system bus. They
define who is allowed to register a D-Bus service for a certain interface and
also who is allowed to talk to it.</p>

<p>Here is a proper example taken from systemd-network’s “org.freedesktop.network1.conf”:</p>

<div><pre><code>&lt;busconfig&gt;
        &lt;policy user="systemd-network"&gt;
                &lt;allow own="org.freedesktop.network1"/&gt;
        &lt;/policy&gt;

        &lt;policy context="default"&gt;
                &lt;allow send_destination="org.freedesktop.network1"/&gt;
                &lt;allow receive_sender="org.freedesktop.network1"/&gt;
        &lt;/policy&gt;
&lt;/busconfig&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>This allows only the dedicated service user “systemd-network” to register the
D-Bus interface “org.freedesktop.network1”, while any other users in the
system may talk to it.</p>

<p>The KAuth KDE6 release candidate generated this configuration instead:</p>

<div><pre><code>&lt;policy context="default"&gt;
  &lt;allow send_destination="*"/&gt;
&lt;/policy&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>The ramifications of this can easily be overlooked: this states that everybody
is allowed to talk to everything on the D-Bus system bus. It also affects
other D-Bus services that should not be influenced by the drop-in
configuration snippet shipped for individual KDE packages. While most D-Bus
services running on the system bus are “public”, i.e. everybody is allowed to
talk to them, some services follow a different security model in which only
dedicated users are allowed to interact with the service. We identified 
<a href="https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag/blob/v0.17/ratbagd/org.freedesktop.ratbag1.conf">ratbagd</a> as one such D-Bus service that would be
negatively affected by this defect in KAuth. This shows that the security
posture of unrelated packages is at stake. Luckily we identified this
issue in time before the KDE6 release was finished, and the issue was fixed
before it reached production systems. We also checked any non-KDE D-Bus
configuration files we ship on openSUSE Tumbleweed for the same issue, but
luckily found no further files containing this issue.</p>

<p>These side effects are also in some sense shortcomings of the D-Bus
configuration scheme, since developers of a specific D-Bus service don’t
expect that their configuration file has a global influence. A similar issue
exists for <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1180525">logrotate</a> where settings in drop-in
configuration files in “/etc/logrotate.d” can influence global settings that
affect the complete system. This can lead to hard to find bugs in both cases,
D-Bus and logrotate, because the outcome also depends on the order in which
the configuration file snippets are parsed.</p>

<h2 id="legacy-fontinst-d-bus-service">Legacy fontinst D-Bus service</h2>

<p>Most of the KDE components that we have been requested to look into for the
KDE6 release had already been reviewed by us in recent years. A few of them
are legacy packages though, since they were already in stock when we
introduced packaging restrictions for D-Bus and Polkit. At the time we didn’t
have enough resources to check all of them in one go.</p>

<p>One such legacy component <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1217186">we encountered</a> while looking into
the KDE6 release was the “org.kde.fontinst.service” which is part of the
“plasma6-workspace” package. What we found there is a single D-Bus method
“org.kde.fontinst.manage” that actually multiplexes a whole range of
sub-methods, based on a “method” string input parameter. This is bad design
since it undermines the D-Bus protocol, and thus makes the individual method
calls less visible and less manageable. This is reinforced by the fact that
also only a single Polkit action is used to authenticate all the sub-methods.
This way there is only an all-or-nothing setting for the various code paths
that are hidden behind this single D-Bus method call.</p>

<p>The available sub-methods in this service nearly make up a generic file system
I/O layer, especially when we remember that this service is running with full
root privileges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>install: this can be used to copy arbitrary file paths to arbitrary
locations, the new files end up with mode 0644.</li>
  <li>uninstall: this allows to remove arbitrary file paths, as long as their
parent directories have a writable bit set.</li>
  <li>move: this allows to move arbitrary paths complete with new owner uid and
group gid to arbitrary new locations.</li>
  <li>toggle: this takes raw XML that also seems to specify font paths that are
to be enabled or disabled.</li>
  <li>removeFile: does what is says on the label; another way to remove files.</li>
  <li>configure: saves modified font directories and invokes a small bash script
<code>fontinst_x11</code> that prepares font directories and triggers a font refresh at
the X server.</li>
</ul>

<p>The core business logic of the fontinst service should be managing system wide
fonts provided in the system. To achieve this, ideally only the necessary high
level logical operations should be offered like: Install a font from provided
data, remove a system font by name. Copying, removing and moving arbitrary
files is way outside of the scope of what this service is supposed to do.</p>

<p>The single Polkit action “org.kde.fontinst.manage” requires <code>auth_admin_keep</code>
authorization by default i.e. anybody that wants to invoke this method needs
to provide admin credentials. Still, if an admin decides to lower these
requirements, because users should be able to e.g. install new fonts in the
system, then this interface does not only allow that, but also allows to gain
full root privileges by copying arbitrary files around (e.g. by creating a new
“/etc/shadow” file).</p>

<p>This service requires a larger redesign. KDE upstream was not able to come up
with that in time for the KDE6 release. We hope that it will still happen
though, as the API is in a rather worrying state.</p>

<h2 id="woes-with-unexpected-polkit-settings">Woes with “unexpected” Polkit Settings</h2>

<p>The situation in the fontinst service regarding the <code>auth_admin</code> setting is a
common pattern that we see when reviewing D-Bus services and Polkit actions.
Developers believe that requiring <code>auth_admin</code> authentication for a Polkit
action is enough to justify overly generic APIs or unsafe file system
operations carried out as <code>root</code>. In some cases it might be justifiable to say
that an action should never have weaker authentication requirements than
<code>auth_admin</code>, since it otherwise causes uncontrollable security issues. One
should not forget that Polkit is a <em>configurable</em> authentication framework,
though. There are default settings shipped by applications, but system
integrators and admins are allowed to change these requirements.</p>

<p>The (open)SUSE Linux distributions are the only ones we know of, that offer a
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_Documentation#Configuration_of_Polkit_Settings">defined mechanism</a> for admins to override the
Polkit defaults for individual actions via profiles and overrides. This works
via the <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/polkit-default-privs">polkit-default-privs</a> package. Our experience
with this shows that upstream developers mostly neither consider the security
consequences of lowering the Polkit authentication requirements, nor test what
happens when the authentication requirements are raised for hardening
purposes. Raised authentication requirements lead to additional password
prompts, and some applications implement workflows involving Polkit actions
that lead to very unfortunate behaviour in such cases.</p>

<p>A common example of this is a package manager like Flatpak, that attempts to
acquire Polkit authentication for a repository refresh action upon login into
a graphical session. The developers only test this with the default <code>yes</code>
Polkit authentication requirement, which makes this authentication process
invisible to users. When raising this to <code>auth_admin</code>, then suddenly a password
prompt pops up during login and users are confused and annoyed. There are ways
to deal with this: for example, services using Polkit can ask it whether an
action can be authorized without user interaction. If this is not the case,
then a package manager could choose <em>not</em> to refresh repositories just now.
Also multiple actions can be authenticated in groups using the
“org.freedesktop.policykit.imply” annotation to avoid multiple password
prompts coming up for a single workflow.</p>

<p>It is understandable that the configuration management of many different
Polkit configurations is hard to test for upstream developers. Increased
awareness of the general problems in this area would help to avoid these
issues in the first place. It seems that developers just want to “cram in”
authentication into their software, though, and stop thinking about it once
they’re done. Granted, Polkit and D-Bus are far from simple when you’re new to
them. Still, every authentication procedure should be given careful thought.
The take home lessons for developers implementing Polkit should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Polkit is a <em>configurable</em> authentication framework and the settings
intended by developers might not be what actually happens during runtime.</li>
  <li>When modelling Polkit actions, one should take advantage of the possibility
to make them fine grained, to allow users to fine tune the requirements for
individual activities.</li>
  <li>Each Polkit authorization that happens in an application should be given
some thought in both directions: what happens if the authentication
requirement is lowered and what happens if it is raised?</li>
  <li>Another aspect that hasn’t been discussed yet is the topic of authentication
messages shown to the user. They should clearly state what exactly is being
authorized in a form that non-technical users can understand. Polkit also
supports placeholders in messages to fill in runtime information, like a file
that is being operated on. Sadly, this feature is used very rarely in
practice.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problematic-file-system-operations-in-sddm-kcm6">Problematic File System Operations in sddm-kcm6</h2>

<p>This component is a KDE Configuration Module (KCM) for the SDDM display
manager. It contains a D-Bus service “org.kde.kcontrol.kcmsddm.conf”. We
reviewed it already in the past and <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1217188">did so again</a> for the
KDE6 release. The service has two major problems, discussed in the following
sections.</p>

<h2 id="unsafe-operations-on-file-system-paths-provided-by-the-unprivileged-d-bus-client">Unsafe Operations on File System Paths Provided by the Unprivileged D-Bus Client</h2>

<p>Multiple of the D-Bus methods provided by the sddm-kcm6 KAuth helper expect
file system paths as input parameters. Such passing of paths to privileged
D-Bus services is another problematic pattern that is often encountered. In
the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/sddm-kcm/-/blob/Plasma/6.0/sddmauthhelper.cpp?ref_type=heads#L30"><code>openConfig()</code></a> function, the provided path to a <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/sddm-kcm/-/blob/Plasma/6.0/sddmauthhelper.cpp?ref_type=heads#L280">SDDM
theme configuration file</a> will be created by the helper, if
necessary.  If it already exists, then a <code>chmod()</code> of the path to mode <code>0600</code>
is performed, which is also following symlinks. To see how this can be
problematic, consider what happens if “/etc/shadow” is passed as theme
configuration path.</p>

<p>Operating as <code>root</code>, on files that are under control of an unprivileged user, is
notoriously hard to get right, and requires careful use of lower level system
calls. Often developers aren’t even aware of this problem. KDE components have
had a number of problems in this area in the past. We believe this has
deeper roots, namely in the design of the Qt framework’s file system API, which
on the one hand doesn’t allow full control over the lower level system calls
(owed to the fact that Qt is also a platform abstraction layer), and on the
other hand does not document exactly what can be expected of its APIs
in this regard. Furthermore the Qt framework itself isn’t aware of the fact
that it runs as root, possibly operating on files owned by other users. The Qt
libraries are designed for implementing feature rich GUI applications and
don’t really consider handling untrusted input, operating with raised
privileges and crossing privilege boundaries.</p>

<p>An elegant way to avoid the path access issue in the first place is by not
passing file paths, but already opened file descriptors over D-Bus. This is
possible since D-Bus uses UNIX domain sockets internally, and they can be used
to pass file descriptors. So instead of passing a string from client to
service suggesting “Open this file, trust me, it’s fine”, the client passes a
file descriptor, opened using its own low privileges, to the privileged
service. With this, many path access issues are gone in an instant. There
are cases that still require care, however, for example if recursive file
system operations need to be carried out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the KAuth framework used by KDE <a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kauth/-/issues/3#note_826581">shows a limitation in
this area</a>. Since the KAuth helper’s D-Bus API only
transfers binary blobs that result from serializing <code>QVariantMap</code>, there
is currently no possibility to pass an open file descriptor.</p>

<h2 id="changes-in-configuration-files-owned-by-the-sddm-service-user">Changes in configuration files owned by the <code>sddm</code> service user</h2>

<p>The other problem is not found in the D-Bus API, but in the implementation of
the <code>sync()</code> and <code>reset()</code> D-Bus methods. Once any input parameters from the
client are processed, the helper operates in the home directory belonging to
the <code>sddm</code> service user. Here is some condensed code taken from the reset()
and sync() functions:</p>

<div><pre><code>// from SddmAuthHelper::reset()
QString sddmHomeDirPath = KUser("sddm").homeDir();
QDir sddmConfigLocation(sddmHomeDirPath + QStringLiteral("/.config"));
QFile::remove(sddmConfigLocation.path() + QStringLiteral("/kdeglobals"));
QFile::remove(sddmConfigLocation.path() + QStringLiteral("/plasmarc"));
QDir(sddmHomeDirPath + "/.local/share/kscreen/").removeRecursively();
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>// from SddmAuthHelper::sync()
QString sddmHomeDirPath = KUser("sddm").homeDir();

QDir sddmCacheLocation(sddmHomeDirPath + QStringLiteral("/.cache"));
if (sddmCacheLocation.exists()) {
    sddmCacheLocation.removeRecursively();
}

QDir sddmConfigLocation(sddmHomeDirPath + QStringLiteral("/.config"));

if (!args[QStringLiteral("kscreen-config")].isNull()) {
    const QString destinationDir = sddmHomeDirPath + "/.local/share/kscreen/";
    QSet&lt;QString&gt; done;
    copyDirectoryRecursively(args[QStringLiteral("kscreen-config")].toString(), destinationDir, done);
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>A compromised <code>sddm</code> service user can exploit these operations to its advantage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it can cause a denial-of-service by e.g. placing directory symlinks
to have the D-Bus service operate in completely different file system
locations. This attack is limited though, since the final path components
used in removal calls need to match, like <code>kscreen</code>.</li>
  <li>it can cause the “kscreen-config” to be copied to arbitrary locations by
placing a symlink in “~/.local/share/kscreen”.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make these operations safe, it would be best to temporarily drop privileges
to the <code>sddm</code> user.</p>

<h2 id="going-forward-from-here">Going Forward from Here</h2>

<p>KDE upstream was not able to come up with a redesign of this D-Bus service in
time for the KDE6 release. In this instance, the unsafe operations in the <code>sddm</code>
user’s home directory would formally even justify assignment of a CVE. Since
all the D-Bus methods are guarded by <code>auth_admin</code> Polkit authentication
requirements, the issues can at least not be exploited in default installations.</p>

<h2 id="kwalletmanager-pseudo-authentication-to-protect-the-configuration">KWalletManager: Pseudo-Authentication to Protect the Configuration</h2>

<p>KWalletManager is KDE’s password manager. It features a GUI and, as one would
expect, runs in the context of the graphical user session of a logged-in user.
It ships a “savehelper” service that offers a single D-Bus method
“org.kde.kcontrol.kcmkwallet5.save”. So what does a service helper running as
<code>root</code> need to save here? Let’s look <a href="https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kwalletmanager/-/blob/master/src/konfigurator/savehelper.cpp">at the implementation</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>ActionReply SaveHelper::save(const QVariantMap &amp;args)
{
    Q_UNUSED(args);
    const qint64 uid = QCoreApplication::applicationPid();
    qDebug() &lt;&lt; "executing uid=" &lt;&lt; uid;
    return ActionReply::SuccessReply();
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turning this piece of code carefully to all sides will lead to the insight
that it does <em>nothing</em>. We <a href="https://invent.kde.org/utilities/kwalletmanager/-/issues/4">asked upstream</a> to remove
this unused helper, but we’ve been told that this is not a mistake, but on
purpose. They want to protect against the following attack scenario: a user
leaves their computer alone and unlocked, a random person gets by and, of all
things, wants to change KWalletManager’s settings. To prevent this from
happening, the GUI is asking the service helper to authenticate the action
requiring Polkit’s <code>auth_self</code> authorization, and doesn’t continue if this
fails.</p>

<p>This cannot stop a real attacker, though, since the KWalletManager
configuration is stored in the unprivileged user’s home directory and can
still be edited directly, or using a modified version of KWalletManager that
simply does not ask for this authentication. Not to talk about <em>all the other
things</em> that an attacker could do in such a situation. So where should one
draw a line to stop? We don’t even see this as a hardening, it is fake security
and confusing. If such a fake authentication is really needed then at least a
way should be found to implement it, without requiring an authentication helper
running as <code>root</code> that does nothing. Upstream seems to disagree, but we asked our
packagers to remove this logic from our packaging via patches.</p>

<h2 id="improvements-in-drkonqi">Improvements in DrKonqi</h2>

<p>DrKonqi is KDE’s crash handling utility. These days, it interacts with
systemd-coredump to access core dumps of applications. Our <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1203493">previous 2022
review</a> of it led to <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/12/21/3">a finding in
systemd-coredump itself</a>. In the meantime DrKonqi
obtained additional D-Bus service logic to copy a private core dump (e.g. from
a process that was running as <code>root</code>) into the session of an unprivileged user
for analysis.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/drkonqi/-/blob/Plasma/6.0/src/coredump/polkit/main.cpp?ref_type=heads#L34">implementation of this</a> is unusual for a KDE component
in so far as it doesn’t rely on KAuth: it directly uses the Qt framework’s D-Bus
and Polkit facilities. The likely reason for this is the shortcoming of KAuth
with regard to passing file descriptors, as discussed above. The single
<code>excavateFromToDirFd()</code> D-Bus method actually accepts a file descriptor.
It is supposed to be a file descriptor referring to a directory under control
of the unprivileged caller, where the selected core dump is to be copied to.
Even though this means that DrKonqi cannot benefit from the common framework
features of KAuth, it is security-wise a good example of how to improve the
robustness of a D-Bus service running as <code>root</code> and operating in the file
system.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even with file descriptors issues can arise, as this example
also shows. The permission handling for directories is different from regular
files. Directories generally can only be opened in read-only mode
(<code>O_RDONLY</code>). Write permissions are only checked at the time a write attempt
is made, like when calling <code>renameat()</code> in the case of the DrKonqi helper.
This is too late. The unprivileged caller can open just any directory it has
read access for and pass it to the D-Bus service. The D-Bus service running as
<code>root</code> will now happily create new files in the directory even if the caller
doesn’t have any write permissions for it.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1220190#c6">constructive discussion</a> discussion going on
with upstream that led to various improvements in detail in this D-Bus service
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/drkonqi/-/merge_requests/217">that are about to be merged</a>. The issue with the dir file
descriptor was only found late in the process, but hopefully a solution for
the problem will be found soon.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>D-Bus and Polkit have their share of complexities that need to be understood
and managed well. This is important as a defense in depth measure even beyond
the local security of a Linux system. Putting additional layers on top, like in
the KAuth framework, can cause long-term problems, as can be seen from the lack
of support for passing file descriptors with the current KAuth API.</p>

<p>It was helpful that our KDE packagers and upstream approached us early about
the KDE6 release candidate and the changes it introduces. In some areas, like
the badly generated D-Bus KAuth configuration files, upstream quickly reacted
and applied fixes, thus avoiding that the problematic code was ever released
in a production version of KDE6. In other areas, like the legacy fontinst
D-Bus service or the sddm-kcm D-Bus service, the complexity of fixing API
issues has obviously been too high for upstream to come up with something
better in time. We decided not to ask for CVE assignments for the findings in
these services, since the attack vectors are not reachable to regular users in
the default Polkit configuration.</p>

<p>By now most KDE6 packages should have reached openSUSE Tumbleweed and can be
used in production.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>When I started</span> working from home in the late 1980s as a freelance technical writer, I was clearly an outlier. Even contractors mostly went into the office in those days. Over time, though, that slowly changed, and the pandemic — along with generationally shifting views on work-life balance — accelerated worker sentiment away from going into a formal office every day, even if some CEOs wish it weren’t so.</p>
<p>Today, 14% of U.S. workers work at home full time (including me), and that number is expected to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/business/hr-payroll/remote-work-statistics/">increase to 20% by next year</a>, according to data published by USA Today. In total, 58% of white collar employees want flexibility in their work schedules to work at home a few days a week, per that same USA Today data. Yet, we are continually getting post-pandemic mixed messages about returning to the office.</p>
<p>Some companies like <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/ibm-orders-more-employees-to-spend-time-in-the-office">IBM</a> and Amazon have been pushing hard to get people back to the office, with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reportedly telling employees if they wanted to stay remote, it probably <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-return-to-office-mandate-or-face-consequences/">wouldn’t work out well</a> for them. Wayfair, the Boston-based online furniture company, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/wayfair-layoffs-focused-on-remote-workers-9ec2f037">concentrated on remote workers </a>over in-office folks in a layoff earlier this year, according to a WSJ report.</p>
<p>Big tech CEOs like Jassy and Elon Musk have been pushing back hard against remote work; Musk called it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/elon-musk-work-from-home-morally-wrong-when-some-have-to-show-up.html">“morally wrong”</a> for some people to work at home while service workers had to show up. Meanwhile <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-bloomberg-implies-remote-workers-golfing-must-return-to-office-2023-9">Michael Bloomberg suggested</a> remote workers weren’t actually working, but playing golf (which honestly sounds like projecting to me). Even Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, whose company pushed the notion of a digital HQ during the pandemic, began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/19/benioffs-reported-slack-statement-muddles-message-about-salesforces-view-of-wfh/">preaching about a return to the office</a>, blaming working from home for lack of productivity, especially among new employees.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of executive energy being directed against working from home and toward working in the office. Some have suggested that it’s because these companies have invested heavily in office buildings and need people to fill them. Maybe it’s just a need to have the employees in front of managers for control purposes, or they genuinely believe that workers are more productive in the office. Whatever the reason, they seem quite committed to getting back to the office.</p>
<p>Do they have a point? Will workers be more productive under the watchful eye of their managers sitting in cubicles instead of the comfort of their homes? Perhaps more importantly to results-driven CEOs, will their companies make more money? Research from the University of Pittsburgh Katz School of Business published earlier this year <a href="https://business.pitt.edu/return-to-office-mandates-dont-improve-employee-or-company-performance/">suggests not necessarily</a>.</p>
<p>“Our findings are consistent with employees’ concerns that managers use RTO (return to office mandates) for power grabbing and blaming employees for poor performance. We provide evidence that RTO mandates hurt employee satisfaction but do not improve firm performance,” the report found.</p>
<p>Karen Mangia, president and chief strategy officer at the Engineered Innovation Group, who has studied and written extensively about remote work, says she was surprised to find that workers tended to value flexibility over place; it wasn’t so much where you needed to be, so much as your ability to control when you worked, to maintain a proper work-life balance.</p>
<p>“All of the research I’ve been looking at shows the same thing: that employees who have some degree of flexibility over where and when they work, are reporting higher levels of employee engagement. That is the group of people that is demonstrating to be more engaged and more productive,” she said.</p>
<p>What’s more, Mangia has found that those companies forcing employees to go back to the office are unsurprisingly having to deal with more employee burnout. “The argument so many times behind this return to office mandate is that employees will be more productive because we can collaborate in person and, and things get done. Well, being burnt out and sustaining a burnout level is the opposite of being more productive,” she said.</p>
<p>There are also good reasons to encourage hiring more remote employees, including access to a much broader and diverse employee base than you could get from one geographical location.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a big Midwestern consumer packaged goods company say ‘we’re finding all sorts of talent. Whereas before we insisted all employees must be local or must be in the city, now we’ve opened it up more broadly, and we got way better candidates. We don’t ever want to go back and we’re going to open that up permanently,’” said Dion Hinchcliffe, an analyst at Constellation Research, who has been watching this trend for a long time.</p>
<p>The next debate is how much, if any, time should employees be required to spend in the office and for what reasons. There are many tech companies that are leaving it up to their employees to decide where they want to work, and it seems to work quite well.</p>
<p>Gitlab is a prime example of a company that has been fully remote from the day it was founded a decade ago. Other tech companies with a flexible approach include Dropbox, Atlassian and Okta, none of which require a specific number of days in the office.</p>
<p>As for startups, anecdotally the vast majority of founders I speak to are remote first. Hinchcliffe says this is part of a shift to a decentralized workplace where startups in particular avoid the regular overhead of having an office. Instead they often rent space in the WeWork model to get together with customers, press and analysts, or each other, as needed.</p>
<p>Mangia says that the one worker demographic that does tend to struggle in all-virtual environments is new hires out of college, who benefit from being in an office. “When you have new-hire employees, especially early in their career, they do ramp up faster and report a better experience with a lower degree of burnout when they can come into a place where there are other people to help them,” she said, giving some credence to what Benioff was saying.</p>
<p>Even the most ardent work-from-home advocates understand there will be times when there is value in getting together for team building, to meet customers or to collaborate and brainstorm in person, but in spite of the cries from big CEOs, employees have tasted this flexibility, and it’s going to be hard to get the genie back in the bottle. For now, it continues to be a debate between labor and management about where and how work gets done.</p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte">VTE</a> (Virtual TErminal library) is the library underpinning various GNOME terminal emulators.
It provides a GTK widget that shows a terminal view, which is used in apps like <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-terminal">GNOME Terminal</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/console">Console</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/raggesilver/blackbox">Black Box</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix">Tilix</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator">Terminator</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis">Ptyxis</a>, and others.
It also powers embedded terminals in <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-builder">Builder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/workbenchdev/Workbench">Workbench</a>.</p>
<p>Over the GNOME&nbsp;46 cycle, VTE has seen a <em>lot</em> of performance improvements.
Christian Hergert mentioned some of them in his blog posts <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/chergert/2023/10/03/vte-performance-improvements/">about VTE</a> and <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/chergert/2024/03/25/gnome-45-46-retrospective/">about his work in GNOME&nbsp;46</a>.
But how much did the performance actually improve?
What should you, the user, expect to <em>feel</em> after installing a fresh <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> 40 update and launching your favorite terminal?</p>
<p>Let’s measure and find out!
If you don’t have time for measuring, you can <a href="https://bxt.rs/blog/just-how-much-faster-are-the-gnome-46-terminals/#input-latency-tests">skip</a> straight to the finding out.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-we-measuring">What Are We Measuring? <a href="https://bxt.rs/blog/just-how-much-faster-are-the-gnome-46-terminals/#what-are-we-measuring">#</a></h2><p>There is no shortage of ways to define “performance”, especially when it comes to terminal emulators.
One of the more tangible metrics is <em>input latency</em>.
Roughly, it describes how quickly the program reacts to your actions: how much time passes from the moment you press a key on your keyboard to the change in color of the pixels on your monitor.
Apps with low input latency feel snappy, whereas apps with high input latency can feel sluggish.</p>
<p>When the input latency is small-ish, you can get used to it and think it feels <em>fine</em>.
However, comparing lower and higher input latency together (for example, by switching between two apps and typing in both) can make it quite noticeable.
If you’ve ever heard people say they can’t go back to a 60&nbsp;Hz monitor after trying out 144&nbsp;Hz, that’s a similar effect (and input latency is partially responsible).</p>
<p>So, how do you measure it?</p>
<h3 id="measuring-input-latency">Measuring Input Latency <a href="https://bxt.rs/blog/just-how-much-faster-are-the-gnome-46-terminals/#measuring-input-latency">#</a></h3><p>There are tools like <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/typometer/">Typometer</a> that measure the input latency in software by detecting key press events and recording the screen to detect a change in pixel color.
This can work reasonably well but requires fiddling with your setup to make sure you’re not accidentally introducing any biases.
For example, a screen capture API may return the new pixel colors a few milliseconds before or after they are shown on the monitor, depending on the system setup, and you need to be aware of this when trying to measure something to a millisecond precision.</p>
<p>I’ve got something more interesting, a hardware input latency tester!
It consists of a light sensor attached to a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html">Teensy</a> board, which in turn is plugged into the computer via USB.</p>

<p>I should really get around to writing a full blog post about this latency tester, but for now, you should read <a href="https://thume.ca/2020/05/20/making-a-latency-tester/">this post by Tristan Hume</a> about building a similar device.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
I used that post as a reference for building mine, but I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/YaLTeR/8e8bd0cddb324a9e372b32e742ff992a">my own firmware</a> and analysis scripts (these I am <em>not</em> sharing until they are less of an utter mess).</p>
<p>The main benefit of such a device is that it allows you to measure a full end-to-end input latency, including processing time in the kernel, the compositor, the application, and then the response time of the monitor itself.
You are measuring what you really see and feel, excluding only the keyboard firmware (since the latency tester sends key press events directly over USB).
There’s also very little extra load on the system, especially compared to using something like a screen capture API.</p>
<p>Here’s a gist of how it works.
The light sensor is aimed at a specific, small area on the monitor, which will be affected by the key press (in our case, a specific character cell in the terminal).
The board sends a key press over USB (for example, Space) and starts monitoring the light sensor readings.
As soon as it detects a jump in the light amount, it releases the key.
Then, it presses a second key (for example, Backspace) and waits for the light to change back.
Now we’re back to square one; the firmware waits a randomized amount (to prevent “snapping” to the monitor refresh rate) and repeats the experiment.</p>
<p>During all of this process, the board dumps light sensor readings over a serial port as fast as it can manage (I’m getting about 35,500 readings per second with my current board and firmware).
On the computer, I save all of this data into a file for offline analysis with Python code.
This analysis code finds the timestamp where the light starts to change, and subtracts it from the timestamp of the key press, to get one input latency measurement.</p>
<p>I then aggregate the measurements and plot them with <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">seaborn</a>.
Here’s an example of what the result looks like:</p>

<p>The small black dots represent the individual measurements.
As in, every dot shows a real amount of time that had passed between one key press and the corresponding change in light on the sensor.
There are 120 of these dots since I repeat each test 120 times.</p>
<p>Looking at the dots can confirm that the data is sensible.
We expect the bulk of the measurements to be spread uniformly across an interval roughly the size of one monitor repaint cycle.
This is because monitors generally repaint at a constant rate, and pressing a key at a random point in time should land us in a random point of the repaint cycle.
We get the lowest latency if the application renders a new frame in response right in time for the monitor to show it.
And we get the highest latency when the application finishes rendering a new frame <em>just</em> missing the monitor deadline, having to wait one extra repaint cycle for the pixel colors to change.</p>
<p>In the example above, the dots are spread over 7–8&nbsp;ms, which is about equal to the ~6.94&nbsp;ms refresh cycle of my 144&nbsp;Hz monitor.</p>
<p>High outliers in the dots, or a larger spread, indicate lag or slowness of the application under test: some key presses are taking longer than others to process.</p>
<p>We do not expect to see any gaps between dot clusters.
They would usually indicate aliasing with the monitor repaint cycle, or some frame scheduling bug in the compositor.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The box shows statistics over the individual measurements:</p>
<ul>
<li>median (a measurement perfectly “in the middle” with half of the measurements lower and half of the measurements higher),</li>
<li>lowest and highest measurement,</li>
<li>25th and 75th percentiles (with 25% and 75% of the measurements lower than the line, respectively).</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, you can compare applications by their spread, then by the median latency, and also look if there are any outliers.</p>
<p>With all that said, we’re <em>almost</em> ready to look at some results.
I just need to tell you what exactly I was measuring the latency of.</p>
<h2 id="test-setup">Test Setup <a href="https://bxt.rs/blog/just-how-much-faster-are-the-gnome-46-terminals/#test-setup">#</a></h2><p>I did all tests on this system:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-7-series/legion-7-gen-7-%2816-inch-amd%29/len101g0017">Lenovo Legion 7 Gen 7 AMD</a> with Ryzen 7 6800H CPU and Radeon RX 6700M dGPU (using the dGPU exclusively via the MUX switch).</li>
<li>Monitor: <a href="https://www.acer.com/il-en/monitors/gaming/nitro-xv0/pdp/UM.JX0EE.V01">Acer Nitro XV320QU</a>, 2560×1440, 144&nbsp;Hz, using 100% scale.</li>
<li>Host: Fedora&nbsp;40 Silverblue Beta, Mesa&nbsp;24.0.4.</li>
<li>Compositor: raw Mutter&nbsp;46.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is raw Mutter, you may ask?
Well, Mutter is the compositor that GNOME Shell builds on top of.
Turns out, you can start Mutter on its own, without GNOME Shell, by switching to a different VT and running a command like <code>mutter --display-server -- alacritty</code>.
This gives you a very bare-bones environment that is only really meant for testing.
It is, however, quite useful for benchmarking, as it represents something close to a zero-overhead GNOME Shell ideal case.</p>
<p>I’m testing several terminal applications.
In the order of appearance on the plots, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a>: not VTE-based; serves as a baseline of sorts, because it is consistently one of the fastest terminals according to <a href="https://mastodon.online/@YaLTeR/110837121102628111">all of my prior tests</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/console">Console</a>: GTK&nbsp;4, the default terminal in GNOME.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/tree/0.76.0/src/app">VTE Test App</a>: GTK&nbsp;4, a test terminal that lives in the VTE repository.</li>

</ul>
<p>Since the intention is to compare GNOME&nbsp;45 to GNOME&nbsp;46, I used <a href="https://containertoolbx.org/">toolb<span>\0</span>x</a> containers with Fedora&nbsp;39 and Fedora&nbsp;40 to install and run all terminals above, as packaged by Fedora with no extra tweaks.</p>
<p>I ran the terminals one by one and put their windows in the top left corner of the monitor.
The mouse cursor was outside the window for all tests.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="input-latency-tests">Input Latency Tests <a href="https://bxt.rs/blog/just-how-much-faster-are-the-gnome-46-terminals/#input-latency-tests">#</a></h2><p>The first test is simple: I run <code>cat &gt; /dev/null</code> to get an input field with no readline or similar processing, and then I measure how long it takes for the terminal to move its block cursor one cell to the right after pressing Space.</p>
<p>This is meant to test the best possible scenario for the terminal, with the least overhead.</p>
<p>This is what the test process looks like:</p>

<p>Alacritty, which is our baseline, did not change from F39 to F40, as expected.</p>
<p>But look at the massive improvement on all of the VTE terminals!
They went from <em>quite bad</em> to pretty much on par with Alacritty, even the GTK&nbsp;3 GNOME Terminal is very close.</p>
<p>The main change that caused this much improvement is likely <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/commit/c17d9c6b4571be0ab55c3818d9125233553bb7ee">this one by Christian</a> that moves away from a 40&nbsp;Hz VTE repaint timer to drawing every frame, synchronized with the monitor, as any self-respecting GTK widget should do.</p>
<p>Console has a few outliers which are <em>maybe</em> caused by its process tracking, but those are nothing new (they may be looked into for GNOME&nbsp;47).</p>
<p>For the next test, I constructed a more realistic case.
I took <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/dotfiles/tree/d3976398058f2f5b6eee57c7e656ee8e7f098ac5/common/.config/_nvim_latency">a snapshot of my neovim setup</a> and opened the README from <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis">Ptyxis</a>.
I then strategically replaced a square of text with Unicode full-block characters to provide a bright “landing pad” for the light sensor.</p>
<figure>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The test consists of repeatedly pressing Ctrl+D and Ctrl+U to scroll the text buffer down and up in neovim.
The light sensor alternates between an empty line (dark) and the full-block landing pad (bright).
The neovim setup has a bunch of bells and whistles, so the terminal gets to have fun drawing the various underlines, undercurls, gutter icons, and the statusline.</p>
<p>This is what the test process looks like:</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>The massive improvement is clear on this test too, and our GNOME&nbsp;46 terminals are still pretty much on par with Alacritty!</p>
<p>Finally, let’s take a closer look at all Fedora&nbsp;40 results on one plot:</p>
<p><a href="https://bxt.rs/blog/just-how-much-faster-are-the-gnome-46-terminals/all-f40.png">
    <img src="https://bxt.rs/blog/just-how-much-faster-are-the-gnome-46-terminals/all-f40.png" alt="">
</a>
</p>
<p>This plot shows how much of a latency toll the neovim test takes compared to a simple <code>cat</code>, but the latency increase is similar across all terminals.</p>
<h2 id="vtebench">vtebench <a href="https://bxt.rs/blog/just-how-much-faster-are-the-gnome-46-terminals/#vtebench">#</a></h2><p>I also ran Alacritty’s <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench">vtebench</a> suite across the same set of applications and configurations.
This is a fully automated benchmark that measures something <em>completely different</em> from input latency: PTY read and parsing performance.
<del>It has also proven quite capable at finding <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/2747">crashes</a> in VTE.</del></p>
<p>Here’s what vtebench’s README has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This benchmark is not sufficient to get a general understanding of the performance of a terminal emulator. It lacks support for critical factors like frame rate or latency. The only factor this benchmark stresses is the speed at which a terminal reads from the PTY. If you do not understand what this means, please do not jump to any conclusions from the results of this benchmark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The repaint duration can and does affect the results of this test, especially for terminals that read and parse PTY on the same thread as they run their repaint logic, like VTE.</p>
<p>This is what one of the vtebench benchmarks looks like:</p>

        <p>To avoid making this plot even busier, I drew the green arrows on only one of the benchmarks.
As you can see, other benchmarks show a similar trend.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>VTE from GNOME&nbsp;46 shows some welcome improvements here too, although a lot more varied, and not quite on par with Alacritty (which renders in a separate thread from reading and parsing).
These improvements likely come from the many other optimizations that happened in VTE during the GNOME&nbsp;46 cycle.</p>
<p>Note that I omitted two benchmarks from these results: <code>dense_cells</code> and <code>unicode</code>.
They are the main stress tests of vtebench that hit the terminal really hard.
Unfortunately, VTE still struggles with them and shows a huge spread, which pushes the rest of the results down and makes the plot less readable.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="https://bxt.rs/blog/just-how-much-faster-are-the-gnome-46-terminals/#conclusion">#</a></h2><p>VTE had a round of massive performance improvements in GNOME&nbsp;46 which manifest as something you can really feel during normal terminal use.
The input latency is down to almost matching the fastest terminals, even in a non-trivial neovim setup with lots of complexity on screen.</p>
<p>The remaining difference, at least on these test cases, is close to negligible.
Some of it can be explained by VTE doing a bit more extra work for accessibility (enabled in GNOME Terminal and currently disabled in the GTK&nbsp;4 terminals), scrollbar calculations, and other features.</p>
<p>If you’ve been avoiding VTE-based terminals due to <em>sluggishness</em> and input lag, now is the time to give them another chance.
Just make sure you’re running VTE&nbsp;0.76, which includes all of this goodness.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to the VTE maintainers and contributors for making this a reality, and congratulations on an awesome release!</p>
<p>P.S. If you’re curious about Ptyxis or the behavior of GTK’s NGL vs. NVK vs. GL renderers, they all perform similarly to the F40 VTE Test App results shown above.
I did more extensive benchmarks of these a month ago, you can find them <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/-/snippets/6439">here</a>.</p>

<div role="text">
<p>Spotify has officially demonetised all tracks with under 1,000 streams. The new policy came into effect for all artists in 1st April 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The revised revenue scheme was <a href="https://djmag.com/news/spotify-confirms-new-royalty-policy-eliminating-payments-tracks-under-1000-streams">announced last year</a>, and means music will only be included in the royalty pool calculation if it passes a threshold of 1,000 plays in the preceding 12 months. According to a Spotify <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/modernizing-our-royalty-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer external nofollow">blog post</a>, 99.5% of all streams on the platform are of tracks that have above that many plays, with the platform claiming that these tracks will now earn more as a result.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div role="text">
<p>Additionally, Spotify now requires a minimum number of unique listeners for royalties to apply. This attempt to stop "further manipulation by bad actors" targets people using automatic and artificial plays to ramp up stream counts. Meanwhile, "functional" genres, such as white noise, are being targeted, too. Whereas before these types of recordings could generate income from as little as 30 seconds of play, this has now been increased to two minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the change has been met with anger and frustration from some corners of the music industry. This week, United Musicians and Allied Workers shared a post on X which suggested those numbers could be wildly overstated,&nbsp;arguing that 86% of all content on Spotify will now fail to meet the criteria for royalties based on play count.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div role="text">
<p>United Musicians and Allied Workers recently&nbsp;spearheaded the Make Streaming Pay initiative, demanding fairer revenue split for artists using platforms including Spotify and Apple Music. The campaign is behind a new <a href="https://djmag.com/news/living-wage-musicians-bill-aims-increase-streaming-royalties-artists">Living Wage For Musicians Bill</a>, which was introduced to US congress in March and aims to "ensure that artists and musicians can build sustainable careers in the digital age". You can find out more about this <a href="https://weareumaw.org/make-streaming-pay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer external nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While political and public pressure for better royalty payments grows, Spotify is looking to bring in more revenue to plug its own shortfall. Since going public on the stock market in 2018, the company has lost money every year. Just this week, it was reported that the streaming giant has confirmed intentions to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/spotify-is-changing-how-it-charges-customers-with-new-plans-and-prices?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=240403&amp;utm_campaign=author_18846812&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer external nofollow">revise and increase its pricing.</a></p>
<p>Between $1 and $2 will be added to monthly bills for customers in several territories,&nbsp;including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan, <em>Bloomburg&nbsp;</em>reports. This is said to cover the cost of audiobooks, added to the platform late-2023. More recently, <a href="https://djmag.com/tech/spotify-adds-video-learning-content-music-performance-and-production">video learning content</a> was introduced to further diversify the offering. A&nbsp;new basic tier package will be rolled out for those who do not want to access audiobooks, the first of several updated pricing options. This news led to a 4.6% jump in Spotify's share value, although it's unclear what the long-term impact will be.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Enabling OCR Support</strong>:</p>
<p dir="auto">PyMuPDF will already contain all the logic to support OCR functions. But it additionally does need Tesseract’s language support data, so installation of Tesseract-OCR is still required.</p>
<p dir="auto">The language support folder location must be communicated either via storing it in the environment variable "TESSDATA_PREFIX", or as a parameter in the applicable functions.</p>
<p dir="auto">So for a working OCR functionality, make sure to complete this checklist:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Install Tesseract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Locate Tesseract’s language support folder. Typically you will find it here:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Windows: <code>C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tessdata</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unix systems: <code>/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/5/tessdata</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Set the environment variable TESSDATA_PREFIX</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Windows: <code>setx TESSDATA_PREFIX "C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tessdata"</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unix systems: <code>declare -x TESSDATA_PREFIX= /usr/share/tesseract-ocr/5/tessdata</code></p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html">over 25 years</a>, <code translate="no" dir="ltr">sRGB</code>
(standard red green blue) has been the only color
<a href="#what_is_a_color_gamut">gamut</a> for CSS gradients and colors, with color space
offerings within it like <code translate="no" dir="ltr">rgb()</code>, <code translate="no" dir="ltr">hsl()</code> and hex. It is the most common color
gamut capability amongst displays; a common denominator. We've grown <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/css#colors">very accustomed to specifying colors within this gamut</a>.</p>

<p>As displays become more capable of showing a wide range of colors, CSS needs a
way to specify colors from within these wider ranges. The current color formats
have no language for wide color ranges.</p>

<p>If CSS never updated, it would be stuck in the 90s color ranges forever, forced
never to match the wide gamut offerings found in images and video.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3Gpk5dbCk">Trapped</a>, only showing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-gamut_RGB_color_space">30% of the colors the human eye can see</a>. Thank CSS <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4">Color Level 4</a> for helping us escape this trap;

gamuts and color spaces, joining Safari who's had support for <code translate="no" dir="ltr">display-p3</code> since
2016. CSS can now support HD (high definition) displays, specifying colors from
HD gamuts while also offering color spaces with specializations. This guide will
explain how you can start to take advantage of this new world of color.</p>

<p>In supporting browsers, there's 50% more colors to pick from! You thought 16
million colors sounded like a lot, wait until you see how many colors some of
these new spaces can show. Also, think about all those gradients that
<a href="#less_banding_thanks_to_16-bit_color">banded</a> because there wasn't enough
bit-depth, that's resolved too.</p>

<p><strong>In addition</strong> to more colors, <a href="https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/#:%7E:text=most%20vivid%20colors%20the%20screen%20can%20display">arguably the most vivid colors the display is capable of</a>,
new color spaces provide unique tools and methods for managing and creating
color systems. For example, before now we had HSL and its "lightness" channel,
which was the best web developers had. Now in CSS, we have LCH's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_Colors_and_Luminance#light_and_luminance">"perceptual lightness</a>."</p>

<p>Furthermore, gradients and mixing get some upgrades: color space support, hue
interpolation options, and less banding. The following image shows some of the
mixing upgrades. The top two color mixes are in sRGB. The bottom two color mixes
are in display p3. Display p3 has more vivid color and the mixes result in
complete black and white in the middle. Where sRGB looks a bit desaturated and
the mixes in the middle aren't complete black or white results.</p>

<p>This guide will cover where color has been, where it is going, and how CSS will
enable and support web developers to manage color.</p>

<h2 id="overview" data-text="Overview" tabindex="-1">Overview</h2>

<p>The problem with color and the web is that CSS is not high definition ready,
while the displays most folks have in their pockets, laps or mounted on walls
are wide gamut, high definition color ready. The color capability of displays
grew faster than CSS, now CSS is here to catch up.</p>

<p>There's much more than just "more colors" too. By the end of this article you'll
be able to specify more colors, enhance gradients, and pick the best color
spaces and color gamuts for each task.</p>

<h3 id="what_is_a_color_gamut" data-text="What is a color gamut?" tabindex="-1">What is a color gamut?</h3>

<p>A gamut represents the size of something. The phrase "millions of colors" is a
comment about the gamut of a display, or the range of colors it has to choose
from. In the following image, three gamuts are compared, and the larger the size
the more colors it offers.</p>

<p><img src="https://developer.chrome.com/static/docs/css-ui/high-definition-css-color-guide/image/color-gamuts-are-compared-57eaaa929ab9e.png" alt="Color gamuts are compared side by side as a triangle shape.
  sRGB is the smallest and Rec2020 is the largest." width="800" height="343"></p>

<p>A color gamut can also have a name. Like a basketball versus a baseball or a
vente coffee cup versus a grande; a name for the size can help people
communicate. Learning these color gamut names helps you communicate and quickly
understand a range of colors.</p>

<p>This article will introduce you to seven new gamuts, all with wider range than
sRGB, and describe their different features to help you choose which to use:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#srgb">sRGB</a></li>
<li><a href="#a98_rgb">RGB 98</a></li>
<li><a href="#display_p3">Display p3</a></li>
<li><a href="#rec2020">Rec2020</a></li>
<li><a href="#prophoto_rgb">ProPhoto</a></li>

</ul>



<h3 id="human_visual_gamut" data-text="Human visual gamut" tabindex="-1">Human visual gamut</h3>

<p>Color gamuts are often compared against the human visual gamut; the entirety of
color we believe the human eye can see. HVS is often portrayed with a

<p>The outermost shape is what we can see as humans, and the inner triangle is the
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">rgb()</code> functions range, aka the sRGB color space.</p>

<p>As you saw triangles above, comparing gamut sizes, so will you find triangles
below. This is the industry's way of communicating about color gamuts and
comparing them.</p>

<h3 id="what_is_a_color_space" data-text="What is a color space?" tabindex="-1">What is a color space?</h3>

<p>Color spaces are arrangements of a gamut, establishing a shape and a method of
accessing colors. Many are simple 3D shapes like cubes or cylinders. This color
arrangement determines which colors are next to each other, and how accessing
and interpolating colors will work.</p>

<p>RGB is like a rectangular color space, where colors are accessed by specifying
coordinates on 3 axes. HSL is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_model#Cylindrical-coordinate_color_models">cylindrical color space</a>,
where colors are accessed with a hue angle and coordinates on 2 axes</p>

<h3 id="color_gamut_and_color_space_summary" data-text="Color gamut and color space summary" tabindex="-1">Color gamut and color space summary</h3>

<p>A color space is a mapping of colors where a color gamut is a range of colors.
Consider a color gamut as a total of particles and a color space as a bottle
made to hold that range of particles.</p>

<p>Here's an interactive visual of what I mean. Point, drag and zoom around in this
demo of color spaces filled with color particles. Then change the color space,
or color model as they call it in this demo, to see a visualization of other
spaces.</p>



<ul>
<li>Use <strong>color gamuts</strong> to talk about a range of colors, like low range or narrow
gamut versus high range or wide gamut.</li>
<li>Use <strong>color spaces</strong> to talk about arrangements of color, syntax used to specify a
color, manipulate color and interpolate through color.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/">CSS Color 4</a> outlines a bunch of new
features and tools for CSS and color. First, a recap of where color was before
these new features. Then an overview of the new color spaces, syntaxes and
tools.</p>

<p>The following Codepen shows all the new and old color syntaxes together:</p>



<h3 id="a_review_of_the_classic_color_spaces" data-text="A review of the classic color spaces" tabindex="-1">A review of the classic color spaces</h3>

<p>Since the 2000s, you have been able to use the following for any CSS properties
that accept a color as a value: hexadecimal (hex numbers), <code translate="no" dir="ltr">rgb()</code>, <code translate="no" dir="ltr">rgba()</code>, by
name like <code translate="no" dir="ltr">hotpink</code>, or with keywords like
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#currentcolor_keyword"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">currentColor</code></a>.
Around 2010, depending on your browser, CSS could use
<a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_hsl"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">hsl()</code></a> colors. Then in 2017,
<a href="https://caniuse.com/css-rrggbbaa">hex with alpha</a> appeared. Last, only
recently, <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_hwb"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">hwb()</code></a> started getting
support in browsers.</p>

<p><strong>All of these classic color spaces reference color within the same gamut, sRGB.</strong></p>

It allows specifying an amount between 0 and 255 or as a percentage 0 to 100.
This syntax was around before some syntax normalization was in the
specifications, so you'll see comma and no-comma syntaxes in the wild. Moving
forward, commas are no longer required.</p>

<p>The first space of this post to introduce syntax for accessing colors outside
the RGB gamut! It is also the first to make it very easy to create out of gamut
color for a display. This is because <strong>any CIE space colors (lch, oklch, lab,
oklab) are capable of representing the entire human visible color spectrum</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_chromaticity_diagram">This colorspace is modeled after human vision</a> and offers
syntax to specify any of those colors and more. The LCH channels are lightness,
chroma and hue. Hue being an angle, like in HSL and HWB. Lightness is a value
between 0 and 100, but not like HSL's lightness, it's a special, “perceptually
linear”, human-centric lightness. Chroma is similar to saturation; can range
from 0 to 230 but is also technically unbounded.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Predictable color manipulation thanks to being perceptually linear, mostly (see <a href="#oklch">oklch</a>).</li>
<li>Uses familiar channels.</li>
<li>Often has vibrant gradients.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Easy to go out of gamut.</li>
<li>On rare occasions the gradient may need an adjustment middle point to prevent hue shift.</li>

linear lightness (L) dimension. The A and B in LAB represent the unique axes of

it adds yellow, where negative values are toward blue.</p>

<p>This color space is <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">corrective</a> to
LCH. And like LCH, (L) continues to represent perceptually linear lightness, C
for chroma and the H for hue.</p>

<p>This space feels familiar if you've worked with
HSL or LCH. Pick an angle on the color wheel for H, choose a lightness or
darkness amount by adjusting L, but then we have chroma instead of saturation.
They're fairly identical except that adjustments to lightness and chroma tend to
come in pairs, or else it can be easy to ask for high chroma colors that go
outside of a target gamut.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No surprises when working with blue and purple hues.</li>
<li>Perceptually linear lightness.</li>
<li>Uses familiar channels.</li>
<li>High dynamic range.</li>
<li>Has a modern <a href="https://oklch.evilmartians.io/">color picker</a> - by Evil Martians.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Easy to go out of gamut.</li>
<li>New and relatively unexplored.</li>
<li>Few color pickers.</li>

<p>The display P3 gamut and color space have become popular since Apple supported
them since 2015 on their iMac. Apple also supported display-p3 <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/6682/improving-color-on-the-web/">in web pages via CSS since 2016</a>, five
years ahead of any other browser. If coming from sRGB, this is a great color
space to begin working within as you move styles to a higher dynamic range.</p>

<ul>
<li>Great support, considered the baseline for HDR displays.</li>
<li>50% more colors than sRGB.</li>

<p>The CIE XYZ color space encompasses all colors that are visible to a person with
average eyesight. This is why it is used as a standard reference for other color
spaces. Y is luminance, X and Z are possible chromas within the given Y
luminance.</p>

<p>The difference between d50 and d65 is the white point, where d50 uses the d50
white points and d65 uses the d65 white point.</p>

<p>Transitioning from one color to another is found in animation, gradients and
color mixing. This transition is typically specified as a starting color and an
ending color, where the browser is expected to interpolate between them.
Interpolate in this case means to generate a series of in-between colors to
create a smooth transition instead of an instant one.</p>

<p>With a gradient, the interpolation is a series of colors along a shape. With
animation it's a series of colors over time.</p>

notice the differentiating color spaces and use the default color space <code translate="no" dir="ltr">oklab</code>.
You may think the browser would use lch as the color space, since that's the
first color, but it doesn't and that's why I show a second comparison gradient
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">.lch</code>. The <code translate="no" dir="ltr">.lch</code> gradient is a gradient from the lch color space.</p>

<h5 id="less_banding_thanks_to_16-bit_color" data-text="Less banding thanks to 16-bit color" tabindex="-1">Less banding thanks to 16-bit color</h5>

<p>Before this color work, all colors were saved in <strong>one 32-bit integer</strong> to
represent all four channels; red, green, blue and alpha. This is 8-bits per
channel and 2^ 24 possible colors (ignoring alpha). 2 ^ 24 = 16,777,216,
"millions of colors."</p>

<p>After this color work, <strong>four 16-bit floating point values</strong>, each channel has
its own float instead of being lumped together. This is 64-bits of data total,
resulting in many more than millions of colors.</p>

<p>This work is required to support HD color. This increases the amount of color
information that can be stored, which has a nice side effect of meaning there's
more colors for the browser to use in a gradient.</p>

<p>Gradient banding is when there aren't enough colors to create a smooth gradient
and "strips" of color become visible. Banding is heavily mitigated with the
upgrade to higher resolution color.</p>

<p>The shortest distance between two points is always a straight line. With color
interpolation, browsers take the short route by default. Consider a scenario
where there are two points in an HSL color cylinder. A gradient acquires its
color steps by traveling along the line between the two points.</p>

<p>The above gradient line goes straight between the greenish color to the reddish
color, passing through the center of the color space. While the above is great
to help with initial understanding, it's not exactly what happens. Here is the
gradient in the following Codepen, and it's clearly not white in the middle like
the mock demonstration showed.</p>



<p>The middle area of the gradient has lost its vibrance though. This is because
the most vibrant colors are at the edge of the color space shape, not in the
center where the interpolation traveled near. This is commonly referred to as
the "<a href="#specifying_more_gradient_stops_to_avoid_the_dead_zone">dead zone</a>." There
are a few ways to fix or work around this.</p>

<h5 id="specifying_more_gradient_stops_to_avoid_the_dead_zone" data-text="Specifying more gradient stops to avoid the dead zone" tabindex="-1">Specifying more gradient stops to avoid the dead zone</h5>

<p>A technique for avoiding the dead zone today is to add additional color stops in
the gradient that intentionally guide the interpolation to stay within the
vibrant ranges of a color space. It is literally a work around, as the
additional stops help it work around the dead zone.</p>

<p>There's a <a href="https://www.learnui.design/tools/gradient-generator.html">gradient tool</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/erikdkennedy">Erik Kennedy</a> that calculates additional color
stops for you, to help you avoid the dead zone even in color spaces that tend to
gravitate towards it. Using it, passing the same colors from the first example
but changing the color interpolation to HSL, it produces this:</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">linear-gradient(90deg, #94e99c, #99e789, #ace67d, #c4e472, #e2e366, #e2bf5a, #e1934e, #e06242);
</code></pre>

</figure>

<p>With guided stop points, the interpolation is no longer a straight line, but
appears to curve around the dead zone, helping maintain saturation, resulting in
a much more vibrant gradient.</p>



<p>While the tool does a great job, <strong>what if you could have similar or greater
control right from CSS?</strong></p>

<h5 id="directing_the_color_interpolation" data-text="Directing the color interpolation" tabindex="-1">Directing the color interpolation</h5>

<p>In Color 4, the ability to control the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-interpolation">hue interpolation</a> strategy
was added and is a new way around (:wink:) the dead zone. Think about a hue
angle and consider a 2 stop gradient that only changes the angle, going hue
shifting from <code translate="no" dir="ltr">140deg</code> to <code translate="no" dir="ltr">240deg</code> for example.</p>



<h6 id="shorter_vs_longer_hue_interpolation" data-text="Shorter vs longer hue interpolation" tabindex="-1">Shorter vs longer hue interpolation</h6>

<p>The gradient will by default take the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-shorter"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">shorter</code></a> route it can unless
you specify for it to take the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-longer"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">longer</code></a> route. Hue
interpolation options direct the angle rotation, like telling someone to turn
left instead of right (heh, Zoolander):</p>

<p><img src="https://developer.chrome.com/static/docs/css-ui/high-definition-css-color-guide/image/the-same-gradient-circle-ee0da812abfa3.png" alt="The same gradient circle visual as before, but this time there is an
  inner circle drawn that shows the long way vs the short way." width="389" height="388"></p>

<p>In the above visual example of hue interpolation distances, the short path and
the long path are simulated to illustrate the difference. The short distance has
less hues between it because it's traveled through the least amount of distance
possible, where the long distance will have traveled over more hues.</p>

<h6 id="increasing_vs_decreasing_hue_interpolation" data-text="Increasing vs decreasing hue interpolation" tabindex="-1">Increasing vs decreasing hue interpolation</h6>

<p>There are two more hue interpolation strategies in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4">Color 4</a>, but they are exclusive for cylindrical
color spaces. Staying with the two colors from the previous examples, the visual
now shows how increasing and decreasing works.</p>



<p>The above Codepen used <a href="https://colorjs.io/">ColorJS</a> to demonstrate the
expected result. The CSS you would write to achieve the same effect without a
Javascript library would be:</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">.longer-hue-interpolation-in-css {
  background: linear-gradient(
    to right in hsl longer hue,
    hsl(180deg 100% 75%),
    hsl(240deg 100% 75%)
  );
}

.decreasing-hue-interpolation-in-css {
  background: linear-gradient(
    to right in hsl decreasing hue,
    hsl(180deg 100% 75%),
    hsl(240deg 100% 75%)
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>To close out hue interpolation, here's a fun playground where you can change the
hue between 2 color stops and see the effects of a hue interpolation choice as
well as how color spaces change gradient results. The effects can be very
different; consider this as four new tricks just went into your color toolbelt.</p>



<h4 id="gradients_in_different_color_spaces" data-text="Gradients in different color spaces" tabindex="-1">Gradients in different color spaces</h4>

<p>Each color space, given its unique shape and color arrangement, will result in a
different gradient. Look at the examples below, especially at "blue to white."
Look at how each color space handles that differently. Notice how many go purple
in the middle, that's called a "hue shift" during interpolation.</p>

<p>Image shown is only 1 of many examples from the Codepen. It's worth trying
Canary or Safari Tech Preview to see these for yourself.</p>

<p>Some gradients in these spaces will be more vibrant than others or travel less
through <a href="#specifying_more_gradient_stops_to_avoid_the_dead_zone">dead zones</a>.
Spaces like <code translate="no" dir="ltr">lab</code> pack colors together in a way optimized for saturation, as
opposed to spaces optimized for humans to write color in like <a href="#hwb"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">hwb()</code></a>.</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">.hwb {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, hwb(250 10% 10%), hwb(150 10% 10%));
}
.lab {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, lab(30 59.4 -96), lab(80 -64 36.2));
}
</code></pre>


<p>The above demo, while subtle in the results, does show more consistent
interpolation with lab. The syntax of lab isn't simple to read though, there's
negative numbers that are very unfamiliar when coming from rgb or hsl. Good
news, we can use hwb for a familiar syntax but ask for the gradient to be
interpolated entirely within another color space, like oklab.</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">.hwb {
  background: linear-gradient(in hwb to right, hwb(250 10% 10%), hwb(150 10% 10%));
}
.lab {
  background: linear-gradient(in oklab to right, hwb(250 10% 10%), hwb(150 10% 10%));
}

<p>This example uses the same colors in hwb but specifies the color space for
interpolation to either hwb or oklab. <code translate="no" dir="ltr">hwb</code> is a great colorspace for high
vibrance but possible dead zones or bright spots (see the cyan hot spot in the
top example). oklab is great for perceptually linear gradients that stay
saturated. This feature is a lot of fun as you can try on a few different color
spaces to see which gradient you like best.</p>

<p>Here's a Codepen experimenting with gradients and color spaces, mixing and
matching strategies to explore the possibilities. Even a transition from black
to white is different in each color space!</p>

<h3 id="gamut_clamping" data-text="Gamut clamping" tabindex="-1">Gamut clamping</h3>

<p>There exist scenarios where a color may ask for something outside of a gamut.
Consider the following color:</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">rgb(300 255 255)
</code></pre>
<p>The maximum for a color channel in the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">rgb</code> color space is <code translate="no" dir="ltr">255</code>, but here
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">300</code> was specified for red. What happens? Gamut clamping.</p>

<p>Clamping is when extra information is simply removed. <code translate="no" dir="ltr">300</code> will become <code translate="no" dir="ltr">255</code>
internally to the color engine. The color has now been clamped within its space.</p>

<h3 id="choosing_a_color_space" data-text="Choosing a color space" tabindex="-1">Choosing a color space</h3>

<p>Many folks, after learning about these color spaces and their effects, feel
overwhelmed and want to know which "one" to choose. From my studies and
experience, I don't see one color space as the single one for all my tasks. Each
has moments when they produce the desired outcome.</p>

<p><strong>If there was one best space, then there wouldn't be so many new spaces being
introduced.</strong></p>

<p>However, I can say that the CIE spaces—<code translate="no" dir="ltr">lab</code>, <code translate="no" dir="ltr">oklab</code>, <code translate="no" dir="ltr">lch</code> and <code translate="no" dir="ltr">oklch</code>—are my
starting places. If the outcome of them isn't what I'm looking for, then I'll go
test other spaces. For mixing colors and creating gradients, I agree with the
default spec choice of <code translate="no" dir="ltr">oklab</code>. For color systems and overall UI colors, I like
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">oklch</code>.</p>

<p>Here are a couple articles where folks have shared their updated color
strategies given these new color spaces and features. For example, Andrey Sitnik
has gone all in on <code translate="no" dir="ltr">oklch</code>, maybe they'll convince you to do the same:</p>

<h2 id="migrating_to_hd_css_color" data-text="Migrating to HD CSS color" tabindex="-1">Migrating to HD CSS color</h2>

<p>There are two main strategies for updating your web project color to support
wide gamut displays:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Graceful degradation</strong><br>Use the new color spaces and let the browser and
operating system figure out which color to show based on display capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong><br>Use <code translate="no" dir="ltr">@supports</code> and <code translate="no" dir="ltr">@media</code> to assess the
capabilities of the user's browser, and if conditions are met, provide wide
gamut colors.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If a browser doesn't understand <code translate="no" dir="ltr">display-p3</code> color:</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">color: red;
color: color(display-p3 1 0 0);
</code></pre>
<p>If a browser does understand <code translate="no" dir="ltr">display-p3</code> color:</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">color: red;
color: color(display-p3 1 0 0);
</code></pre>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to each. Here's a quick list of pros and
cons:</p>

<p><strong>Graceful degradation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>The simplest route.</li>
<li>The browser will gamut map or clamp to sRGB if not a wide gamut display,
therefore the responsibility is on the browser.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>The browser may gamut clamp or gamut map to a color you don't love.</li>
<li>The browser may not understand the color request and fail entirely. However
this can be mitigated by specifying the color twice, letting the cascade
fallback to the previous color it does understand.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>More control with managed color fidelity.</li>
<li>An additive strategy that doesn't affect the current colors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>You need to manage two separate color syntaxes.</li>
<li>You need to manage two separate color gamuts.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="checking_for_gamut_and_color_space_support" data-text="Checking for gamut and color space support" tabindex="-1">Checking for gamut and color space support</h3>

<p>The browser allows checking for support for wide gamut capabilities and color
syntax support from CSS and JavaScript. The exact gamut of colors the user has
is not made available, a generalized answer is provided so user privacy is
maintained. The exact color space support is made available though, as it's not
specific to capabilities of the user's hardware like gamut is.</p>

<p>This helps authors visually differentiate between HD colors and non-HD colors.
It's especially helpful when working with the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">color()</code> function and the new
color spaces because they're capable of producing both non-HD and HD colors. If
you want to check which gamut your color is in, pop up the color picker and see!</p>

<h4 id="converting_colors" data-text="Converting colors" tabindex="-1">Converting colors</h4>

<p>DevTools has been able to convert colors between supported formats like hsl,
hwb, rgb and hex for many years. <code translate="no" dir="ltr">shift + click</code> on a square color swatch in the
Styles pane to perform this conversion. The new color tools don't just cycle
through conversions, they yield a popup where authors can see and pick the
conversion they want.</p>

<p>When converting, it's important to know if the conversion was clipped to fit the
space. DevTools now have a warning icon to the converted color that alerts you
to this clipping.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion" data-text="Conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Non-sRGB color spaces on the web are in their early days but I believe we'll see
an increase in usage from designers and developers over time. Knowing which
color space to build a design system on, for example, is a strong tool to be in
a creators toolbelt. Each color space offers unique features and a reason it was
added to the CSS specification, and it is ok to start small with these and add
as needed.</p>

<p>Enjoy playing with these new color toys! More vibrance, consistent manipulations
and interpolations and overall deliver a more colorful experience to your users.</p>

    </div><p>Disturbed gut flora during the first years of life is associated with diagnoses such as autism and ADHD later in life. This is according to a study led by researchers at the University of Florida and Linköping University and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.02.035" target="_blank">published</a> in the journal <i>Cell</i>.</p>


                                        
                                                                                  
                                        
                                                                                                                                    <p>The study is the first forward-looking, or prospective, study to examine gut flora composition and a large variety of other factors in infants, in relation to the development of the children's nervous system. The researchers have found many biological markers that seem to be associated with future neurological development disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, communication disorder and intellectual disability.</p>
<p>"The remarkable aspect of the work is that these biomarkers are found at birth in cord blood or in the child's stool at one year of age over a decade prior to the diagnosis," says Eric W Triplett, professor at the Department of Microbiology and Cell Science at the University of Florida, U.S., one of the researchers who led the study.</p>
<p>The study is part of the ABIS (All Babies in Southeast Sweden) study led by Johnny Ludvigsson at Linköping University. More than 16,000 children born in 1997–1999, representing the general population, have been followed from birth into their twenties. Of these, 1,197 children, corresponding to 7.3%, have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, communication disorder or intellectual disability.</p>
<p>A large number of lifestyle and environmental factors have been identified through surveys conducted on several occasions during the children's upbringing. For some of the children, the researchers have analyzed substances in <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/umbilical+cord+blood/" rel="tag">umbilical cord blood</a> and bacteria in their stool at the age of 1.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <p>"We can see in the study that there are clear differences in the intestinal flora already during the first year of life between those who develop autism or ADHD and those who don't. We've found associations with some factors that affect gut bacteria, such as antibiotic treatment during the child's first year, which is linked to an increased risk of these diseases," says Ludvigsson, senior professor at the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences at Linköping University, who led the study together with Triplett.</p>
<p>Children who had repeated ear infections during their first year of life had an increased risk of being diagnosed with a developmental neurological disorder later in life. It is probably not the infection itself that is the culprit, but the researchers suspect a link to antibiotic treatment. They found that the presence of Citrobacter bacteria or the absence of Coprococcus bacteria increased the risk of future diagnosis.</p>
<p>One possible explanation may be that antibiotic treatment has disturbed the composition of the gut flora in a way that contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders. The risk of <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antibiotic+treatment/" rel="tag">antibiotic treatment</a> damaging the gut flora and increasing the risk of diseases linked to the immune system, such as type 1 diabetes and childhood rheumatism, has been shown in previous studies.</p>
<p>"Coprococcus and Akkermansia muciniphila have potential protective effects. These bacteria were correlated with important substances in the stool, such as vitamin B and precursors to neurotransmitters which play vital roles orchestrating signaling in the brain. Overall, we saw deficits in these bacteria in children who later received a developmental neurological diagnosis," says Angelica Ahrens, Assistant Scientist in Triplett's research group at the University of Florida and the first author of this study.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <p>The present study also confirms that the risk of developmental neurological diagnosis in the child increases if the parents smoke. Conversely, breastfeeding has a protective effect, according to the study.</p>
<p>In cord blood taken at the birth of children, the researchers analyzed the amounts of various substances from the body's metabolism, such as <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fatty+acids/" rel="tag">fatty acids</a> and amino acids. They also measured some harmful substances that come from outside, such as nicotine and environmental toxins. They compared substances in the umbilical cord blood of 27 children diagnosed with autism with the same number of children without a diagnosis.</p>
<p>It turned out that children who were later diagnosed had low levels of several important fats in the umbilical cord blood. One of these was linolenic acid, which is needed for the formation of omega 3 fatty acids that are anti-inflammatory and have several other effects in the brain.</p>
<p>The same group also had higher levels than the control group of a PFAS substance, a group of substances used as flame retardants and shown to negatively affect the immune system in several different ways. PFAS substances can enter the body via drinking water, food and the air we breathe.</p>
<p>It is not certain that the relationships that the research team found in the Swedish children can be generalized to other populations, but these issues need to be studied in other groups as well. Another question is whether gut flora imbalance is a triggering factor or whether it has occurred as a result of underlying factors, such as diet or antibiotics.</p>
<p>However, even when the researchers accounted for risk factors that might affect the gut flora, they found that the link between future diagnosis remained for many of the bacteria. This indicates that some of the differences in gut flora between children with and without future diagnosis are not explained by such risk factors.</p>
<p>The research is at an early stage and more studies are needed, but the discovery that many biomarkers for future developmental neurological disorders can be observed at an early age opens up the possibility of developing screening protocols and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/preventive+measures/" rel="tag">preventive measures</a> in the long term.</p>

    <div><p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C. — </strong>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced up to $10 million in funding to explore nickel extraction from soil using plants—a process known as phytomining—to establish a competitive domestic supply chain, supplement conventional mining methods, and reduce nickel imports. Managed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), this effort supports&nbsp; President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to strengthen domestic critical materials supply chains, enhance our economic and national security, and meet the growing demand for critical materials needed to ensure America leads the world in the emerging clean energy economy.</p><p>“In order to accomplish the goals laid out by President Biden to meet our clean energy targets, and support our economy and national security, it’s going to take all-hands-on-deck approach and innovative solutions,”&nbsp;<strong>said ARPA-E Director Evelyn N. Wang.</strong>&nbsp;“By exploring phytomining to extract nickel as the first target critical material, ARPA-E aims to achieve a cost-competitive and low-carbon footprint extraction approach needed to support the energy transition.”</p><p>Among the critical materials named in the DOE&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/doe-critical-material-assessment_07312023.pdf"><strong>Critical Materials Assessment</strong></a> (CMA), nickel serves as an ideal target to validate the viability of phytomining in the U.S. due to the large number of documented nickel hyperaccumulation (HA) plants. Nickel is used in the cathodes of lithium-ion batteries present in electric vehicles, consumer electronics, stationary storage, stainless steel, metallurgy, coatings, electroplating, and other alloys. Nickel is crucial to global clean energy technology supply chains and future demand is expected to grow.</p><p>The new ARPA-E Exploratory Topic announced today, <a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/exploratory-topics/phytomining"><strong>Plant HYperaccumulators TO MIne Nickel-Enriched Soils (PHYTOMINES)</strong></a>, seeks to spur the technological development of phytomining in the United States that could complement current and future domestic sources of nickel and catalyze phytomining of critical minerals beyond nickel.</p><p>The targeted outcomes of PHYTOMINES are:&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p><ul><li>Developing technologies that optimize the biotic systems which regulate the availability and uptake of nickel by hyperaccumulator plants.<o:p></o:p><ul><li>Technologies could be interventions in the soil or plant microbiome or the development of plant traits that enable the accumulation of nickel at an enhanced rate.

  <p>When a black hole and a neutron star merge</p>
  

  

  <p>On May&nbsp;29, 2023, the LIGO Livingston detector observed a mysterious signal, called GW230529. It originated from the merger of a neutron star with an unknown compact object, most likely an unusually light-weight black hole. With a mass of only a few times that of our Sun, the object falls into the “lower mass gap” between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics contributed to the discovery with accurate waveform models, new data-analysis methods, and sophisticated detector technology. Although this particular event was observed only because of its gravitational waves, it increases the expectation that more such events will also be observed with electromagnetic waves in the future.</p>

<p>For about 30 years, researchers have debated whether there is a mass gap separating the heaviest neutron stars from the lightest black holes. Now, for the first time, scientists have found an object whose mass falls right into this gap, which was thought to be almost empty. “These are very exciting times for gravitational-wave research as we delve into realms that promise to reshape our theoretical understanding of astrophysical phenomena dominated by gravity,” says Alessandra Buonanno, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam Science Park.</p><p>Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts neutron stars to be lighter than three times the mass of our Sun. However, the exact value of the maximum mass that a neutron star can have before collapsing into a black hole is unknown. “Considering electromagnetic observations and our present grasp of stellar evolution, there were expected to be very few black holes or neutron stars within the range of three to five solar masses. However, the mass of one of the newly discovered objects precisely aligns with this range,” Buonanno elaborates.</p><p>In recent years, astronomers have uncovered several objects whose masses potentially fit within this elusive gap. In the case of GW190814, LIGO and Virgo identified an object at the lower boundary of the mass spectrum. However, the compact object detected via the gravitational-wave signal GW230529 marks the first instance where its mass unequivocally falls within this gap.</p><h2>New observing run with more sensitive detectors and improved search methods</h2><p>The highly successful third observing run of the gravitational-wave detectors ended in spring 2020, bringing the number of known gravitational-wave events to 90. Before the start of the fourth observing run on May 24, 2023, the researchers made several improvements to the detectors to increase their sensitivity.</p><p>“Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) in Hannover, together with LIGO colleagues, have improved the laser sources of the LIGO detectors at the heart of the instruments,” explains Karsten Danzmann, Director at the Albert Einstein Institute and Director of the Institute for Gravitational Physics at Leibniz University Hannover. “They provide high-precision laser light with an output power of up to 125&nbsp;watts, with the same characteristics over very short and very long time scales.” Benno Willke, leader of the laser development group at the Albert Einstein Institute Hannover, adds: “The reliability and performance of the new solid-state laser amplifiers is amazing and I'm convinced that they will still be used in the next detector upgrade.”</p><p>But not only the hardware has been improved: the new observing run took advantage of an efficient waveform code infrastructure, and the accuracy, speed, and physical content of the waveform models developed at the Albert Einstein Institute Potsdam were improved, so that black-hole properties can be extracted in a few days.</p><h2>Fourth observing run starts with a bang</h2><p>Just five days after the launch of the fourth observing run, things got really exciting: on May&nbsp;29, 2023, the LIGO Livingston detector observed a gravitational wave that was published within minutes as signal candidate “S230529ay”. The result of this “online analysis”, which was performed almost in real time as the signal arrived, was that a neutron star and a black hole most likely merged about 650 million light-years from Earth. However, it is not possible to say exactly where the merger took place because only one gravitational-wave detector was recording scientific data at the time of the signal. Therefore, the direction from which the gravitational waves came could not be determined.</p><p>The researchers made sure that the signal was not a local disturbance in the LIGO Livingston detector, but actually came from deep space. “Among other things, we examined all the perturbations and random fluctuations of detector noise that resemble weak signals,” explains Frank Ohme, leader of a Max Planck research group at the Albert Einstein Institute Hannover. “GW230529 clearly stands out from this background and was consistently detected by several independent search methods. This clearly indicates an astrophysical origin of the signal.”</p><p>The astrophysicists also used GW230529 to test Einstein's general theory of relativity. “GW230529 is in perfect agreement with the predictions of Einstein's theory,” says Elise Sänger, a graduate student at the Albert Einstein Institute Potsdam who was involved in the study. “It provided some of the best constraints to date on alternative theories of gravity using LVK gravitational-wave events.”</p><h2>GW230529: Neutron star meets unknown compact object</h2>


<p>To determine the properties of the objects that orbited each other and merged,&nbsp; producing the gravitational-wave signal, astronomers compared data from the LIGO Livingston detector with two state-of-the art waveform models. “The models incorporate a range of relativistic effects to ensure the resulting signal model is as realistic and comprehensive as possible, facilitating comparison with observational data,” says Héctor Estellés Estrella, a postdoctoral researcher in the team at the Albert Einstein Institute Potsdam team who developed one of the models. “Among other things, our waveform model can accurately describe black holes swirling around in space-time at a fraction of the speed of light, emitting gravitational radiation across multiple harmonics,” adds Lorenzo Pompili, a PhD student at the Albert Einstein Institute Potsdam who also built the model.</p><p>GW230529 was formed by the merger of a compact object with 1.3 to 2.1 times the mass of our Sun with another compact object with 2.6 to 4.7 times the solar mass. Whether these compact objects are neutron stars or black holes cannot be determined with certainty from gravitational-wave analysis alone. However, based on all the known properties of the binary, astronomers believe that the lighter object is a neutron star and the heavier is a black hole.</p><p>The mass of the heavier object therefore lies confidently in the mass gap, which was previously thought to be mostly empty. None of the previous candidates for objects in this mass range have been identified with the same certainty.</p><h2>Scientists expect more observations of similar signals</h2><p>Of all the neutron star-black hole mergers observed to date, GW230529 is the one in which the masses of the two objects are the least different. Tim Dietrich, a professor at the University of Potsdam and leader of a Max Planck Fellow group at the Albert Einstein Institute, explains: “If the black hole is significantly heavier than the neutron star, no matter is left outside the black hole after the merger, and no electromagnetic radiation is emitted. Lighter black holes, on the other hand, can rip apart the neutron star with their stronger tidal forces, ejecting matter that can glow as a kilonova or a gamma-ray burst”.</p><p>The observation of such an unusual system shortly after the start of the fourth observing run also suggests that further observations of similar signals can be expected. The researchers have calculated how often such pairs merge and found that these events occur at least as often as the previously observed mergers of neutron stars with heavier black holes. Therefore, an afterglow in the electromagnetic spectrum should be observed more frequently than previously thought.</p><p>scientists can only make an educated guess as to how the heavier of the compact objects – most likely a lightweight black hole – in the binary that emitted GW230529 was formed. It is too light to be the direct product of a supernova. It is possible – but unlikely – that it was formed during a supernova, where material initially ejected in the explosion falls back and causes the newly formed black hole to grow. It is even less likely that the black hole was formed in the merger of two neutron stars. An origin as a primordial black hole in the early days of the universe is also possible, but not very likely. Finally, the researchers cannot completely rule out the possibility that the heavier object is not a light black hole, but an extremely heavy neutron star.</p><h2>The fourth observing run continues</h2><p>So far, a total of 81 significant signal candidates have been identified in the first half of the fourth observing run. GW230529 is the first of these that has now been published after detailed investigation. After a commissioning break of several weeks and a subsequent engineering run, the second half of O4, begins on April&nbsp;10. Both LIGO detectors, Virgo, and GEO600, will participate in the second half of the run.</p><p>While the observing run continues, researchers are analyzing the observational data from O4a and checking the remaining 80 significant signal candidates that have already been identified. The sensitivity of the detectors should be slightly increased after the break. By the end of the fourth observing run in February 2025, a similar number of new candidates are expected to be added, and the total number of observed gravitational-wave signals will soon exceed 200.</p><hr><h2>Gravitational-wave observatories</h2><p>LIGO is funded by the NSF, and operated by Caltech and MIT, which conceived and built the project.

        <p>A team of researchers has discovered the wreck of Ernest Shackleton’s <em>Endurance</em> vessel on the Antarctic sea floor. Carried out by the Endurance22 Expedition and&nbsp;<a href="https://endurance22.org/endurance-is-found">announced</a> this week by the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust, the exciting discovery puts an end to a century-old maritime mystery.</p>

<p>Scientists used submersibles to capture images and <a href="https://twitter.com/natgeo/status/1501456569619341313">video</a> of the shipwreck, which is protected as a historic site and will remain undisturbed, Henry Fountain reports for the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/climate/endurance-wreck-found-shackleton.html">New York Times</a>. </em>It rests 9,842 feet below the surface of the Weddell Sea, a pocket of the Southern Ocean east of the Antarctic Peninsula, reports Lilit Marcus for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/ernest-shackleton-endurance-shipwreck-found-scn/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>

<p>“We have made polar history with the discovery of Endurance, and successfully completed the world’s most challenging shipwreck search,” says expedition leader John Shears in a <a href="https://endurance22.org/endurance-is-found">statement</a>.</p>

<p><em>Endurance</em> was last seen in 1915, when Irish-British explorer Shackleton (1874-1922) and his 27 men watched in dismay as the ship sank into the icy depths. The crew's mission, as members of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, was a daring plan to reach the South Pole by traveling over the then-unmapped terrain of the East Antarctic.</p>

<p>Charismatic, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/magazine/drinking-ernest-shackletons-whisky.html">reckless</a> and obsessed with the South Pole, Shackleton was a major figure in what came to be known as the heroic age of Antarctic exploration in the early 20th century, “which included treks by Norwegian Roald Amundsen, who in 1911 was the first to reach the pole, and by Robert Falcon Scott, a Briton who died after reaching it a month later,” per the <em>Times</em>. Shackleton and his crew set off from South Georgia island in 1914 despite warnings from whalers that the ice conditions in Weddell Sea were some of the “worst in memory,” per the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/shackleton/the-expedition">American Natural History Museum</a>.</p>

      As spring arrived, ice began to crush the&nbsp;<em>Endurance</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>damaging it beyond repair.

</figure>
<p>Disaster struck in 1915 when the ship became trapped in the pack ice. For ten months, the immobilized vessel floated along while crew members camped on ice floes and waited for their surroundings to thaw. But as spring arrived in September, the pressure of the shifting ice began to warp, crush and twist the boat’s wooden frame.</p>

<p>By October, the ship had flooded beyond repair and all hopes of a return trip were lost, as Kieran Mulvaney reports for <em><a href="https://www.history.com/news/shackleton-endurance-survival">History.com</a></em>.</p>

<p>“She’s going, boys,” a crewmember reportedly cried in October as the hull was rent to pieces. “It’s time to get off.” The ship eventually slipped beneath the surface on November 21,1915.</p>

<p>Shackleton’s subsequent voyage to rescue his crew went down in history as one of the greatest examples of grit, leadership and luck in the annals of Antarctic expeditions. First, the crew survived a harrowing five days at sea to land three lifeboats at Elephant Island, where they set up a makeshift camp. Shackleton and five others then navigated a treacherous 800-mile journey&nbsp;on a small whaling boat to reach help on South Georgia island.</p>

<p>That open-sea journey, navigated by Capt. Frank Worsley, is considered “one of the epic small boat voyages ever undertaken across some of the steepest, harshest seas in the world,” according to scholar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAcxUhu8TI&amp;ab_channel=CambridgeUniversity">Julian Dowdeswell</a>. Thanks to Shackleton’s efforts and those of his crew, all 28 men survived and were rescued in 1917.</p>

<p>Biographers and historians have chronicled the details of the <em>Endurance </em>saga for years. But the precise location of the wreck of the <em>Endurance </em>itself remained a mystery—until now. With contemporary technology at their disposal and captain Worsley’s notes in hand, Endurance22 set out in February to discover the site of the <em>Endurance </em>wreck.</p>

<p>The team traveled aboard the <em>S.A. Agulhas II</em>, a South African icebreaker and polar research vessel. The $10 million project was funded by an anonymous private individual, according to the <em>Times</em>.</p>

<p>They&nbsp;searched for two weeks, using two submersible crafts to scan the sea floor in a 150-square-mile area. Researchers discovered the first signs of the shipwreck a few days ago, per the <em>Times. </em>The site where <em>Endurance&nbsp;</em>eventually sank turned out to be just four miles south of where Worsley, the ship’s captain, had predicted it lay, per CNN.</p>

<p>Cold Antarctic temperatures have kept the 144-foot, three-masted wooden ship in stunning condition, scientists report. Images reveal that the bold capital letters of the ship’s name are still intact and visible above the stern.</p>

<p>“Without any exaggeration this is the finest wooden shipwreck I have ever seen—by far,” marine archaeologist and expedition director Mensun Bound tells <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60662541">BBC News</a>’ Jonathan Amos.</p>

<p>“It is upright, well proud of the seabed, intact, and in a brilliant state of preservation,” Bound adds. “You can see a porthole that is Shackleton's cabin. At that moment, you really do feel the breath of the great man upon the back of your neck.”</p>

<p>Experts flocked to Twitter to express congratulations and offer analyses.

<p>Deep-sea polar biologist <a href="https://taylorlab.science/about-dr-michelle-taylor/">Michelle Taylor</a> of Essex University tells BBC News that the creatures, which include brittlestars and crinoids, are “all filter feeding from the cool deep waters of the Weddell Sea.”</p>

<p>Others described an ecstatic mood onboard when the team discovered the wreck. “I got goose bumps,” wrote <a href="https://www.awi.de/en/about-us/service/expert-database/stefanie-arndt.html">Stefanie Arndt</a>, a sea ice physicist who participated in the expedition, on <a href="https://twitter.com/arndt_st/status/1501455291308822529">Twitter</a>. When the wreck was first spotted, she was at work with fellow researchers on the ice nearby—“just where Shackleton’s men have been.”</p>

<p>“The footage is breathtaking,” Arndt added. “I am overwhelmed.”</p>

<p><em>diffoscope</em> tries to get to the bottom of what makes files or directories different. It will recursively unpack archives of many kinds and transform various binary formats into more human-readable form to compare them. It can compare two tarballs, ISO images, or PDF just as easily.</p>

<p><strong>Latest release</strong>: 263 (05 Apr 2024)</p>



<p>You can try it now using Docker:</p>

<div><pre><code>echo foo &gt; file1
echo bar &gt; file2
docker run --rm -t -w $(pwd) -v $(pwd):$(pwd):ro \
      registry.salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope file1 file2
</code></pre></div>
