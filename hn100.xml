<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="How Online Privacy Is Like Fishing"><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> recently <u><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/microsoft-says-it-caught-hackers-china-russia-iran-using-its-ai-tools-2024-02-14/" target="_blank">caught state-backed hackers</a></u> using its generative AI tools to help with their attacks. In the security community, the immediate questions weren’t about how hackers were using the tools (that was utterly predictable), but about how Microsoft figured it out. The natural conclusion was that Microsoft was spying on its AI users, looking for harmful hackers at work.<br></p><p>Some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39442429" target="_blank">pushed back</a> at characterizing Microsoft’s actions as “spying.” Of <em>course</em> cloud service providers monitor what users are doing. And because we expect Microsoft to be doing something like this, it’s not fair to call it spying.</p><p>We see this argument as an example of our shifting collective expectations of privacy. To understand what’s happening, we can learn from an unlikely source: fish.</p><p>In the mid-20th century, scientists began noticing that the number of fish in the ocean—so vast as to underlie the phrase “There are plenty of fish in the sea”—had started declining rapidly due to overfishing. They had already seen a similar decline in whale populations, when the post-WWII whaling industry nearly drove many species extinct. In whaling and later in commercial fishing, new technology made it easier to find and catch marine creatures in ever greater numbers. Ecologists, specifically those working in fisheries management, began studying how and when certain fish populations had gone into serious decline.</p><p>One scientist, <a href="https://oceans.ubc.ca/2023/05/19/daniel-pauly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daniel Pauly</a>, realized that researchers studying fish populations were making a major error when trying to determine acceptable catch size. It wasn’t that scientists didn’t recognize the declining fish populations. It was just that they didn’t realize how significant the decline was. Pauly noted that each generation of scientists had a different baseline to which they compared the current statistics, and that each generation’s baseline was lower than that of the previous one.</p><p>What seems normal to us in the security community is whatever was commonplace at the beginning of our <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/careers/">careers</a>.</p><p>Pauly called this “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_baseline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shifting baseline syndrome</a>” in a 1995 paper. The baseline most scientists used was the one that was normal when they began their research careers. By that measure, each subsequent decline wasn’t significant, but the cumulative decline was devastating. Each generation of researchers came of age in a new ecological and technological environment, inadvertently masking an exponential decline.</p><p>Pauly’s insights came too late to help those managing some fisheries. The ocean suffered catastrophes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery" target="_blank">complete collapse</a> of the Northwest Atlantic cod population in the 1990s.</p><p>Internet surveillance, and the resultant loss of privacy, is following the same trajectory. Just as certain fish populations in the world’s oceans have fallen 80 percent, from previously having fallen 80 percent, from previously having fallen 80 percent (ad infinitum), our expectations of privacy have similarly fallen precipitously. The pervasive nature of modern technology makes surveillance easier than ever before, while each successive generation of the public is accustomed to the privacy status quo of their youth. What seems normal to us in the security community is whatever was commonplace at the beginning of our careers.</p><p>Historically, people controlled their computers, and software was standalone. The always-connected cloud-deployment model of software and services flipped the script. Most apps and services are designed to be always-online, feeding usage information back to the company. A consequence of this modern deployment model is that everyone—cynical tech folks and even ordinary users—expects that what you do with modern tech isn’t private. But that’s because the baseline has shifted.</p><p>AI chatbots are the latest incarnation of this phenomenon: They produce output in response to your input, but behind the scenes there’s a complex cloud-based system keeping track of that input—both to improve the service and to <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/february-2023/the-new-bing-creating-value-for-advertisers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sell you ads</a>.</p><p>Shifting baselines are at the heart of our collective loss of privacy. The U.S. Supreme Court has long held that our right to privacy depends on whether we have a reasonable <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/expectation_of_privacy" target="_blank">expectation of privacy</a>. But expectation is a slippery thing: It’s subject to shifting baselines.</p><p>The question remains: What now? Fisheries scientists, armed with knowledge of shifting-baseline syndrome, now look at the big picture. They no longer consider relative measures, such as comparing this decade with the last decade. Instead, they take a holistic, ecosystem-wide perspective to see what a healthy marine ecosystem and thus sustainable catch should look like. They then turn these scientifically derived sustainable-catch figures into limits to be codified by regulators.</p><p>In privacy and security, we need to do the same. Instead of comparing to a shifting baseline, we need to step back and look at what a healthy technological ecosystem would look like: one that respects people’s privacy rights while also allowing companies to recoup costs for services they provide. Ultimately, as with fisheries, we need to take a big-picture perspective and be aware of shifting baselines. A scientifically informed and democratic regulatory process is required to preserve a heritage—whether it be the ocean or the Internet—for the next generation.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Keep in mind that 50% is a conservative number at the lowest end of the spectrum.&nbsp; This is assuming that your career is only going to last 10 years.&nbsp; The longer you work, the greater the difference will become over your lifetime.</p>

<p><b>Arguments for Changing Jobs</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/09/18/how-much-of-a-pay-raise-can-you-expect-in-2014/2832791/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/09/18/how-much-of-a-pay-raise-can-you-expect-in-2014/2832791/" aria-label="The average raise an employee can expect in 2014 is 3%.">The average raise an employee can expect in 2014 is 3%.</a> Even the most underperforming employee can expect a 1.3% raise. The best performers can hope for a 4.5% raise.&nbsp; But, the inflation rate is currently 2.1% calculated based on the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This means that your raise is actually less than 1%.&nbsp; This is probably sobering enough to make you reach for a drink.</p>
<p>In 2014, the average employee is going to earn less than a 1% raise and there is very little that we can do to change management’s decision. But, we can decide whether we want to stay at a company that is going to give us a raise for less than 1%. The average raise an employee receives for leaving is between a 10% to 20% increase in salary. Obviously, there are extreme cases where people receive upwards of 50%, but this depends on each person’s individual circumstances and industries.</p>





<p>Why are people who jump ship rewarded, when loyal employees are punished for their dedication? The answer is simple. Recessions allow businesses to freeze their payroll and decrease salaries of the newly hired based on “market trends.” These reactions to the recession are understandable, but the problem is that these reactions were meant to be “temporary.” Instead they have become the “norm” in the marketplace. More importantly, we have all become used to hearing about “3% raises” and we’ve accepted it as the new “norm."</p>
<p>John Hollon, former editor of Workforce.com, remembers when “<a href="http://www.tlnt.com/2012/11/08/remember-those-3-salary-increases-now-theyre-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www.tlnt.com/2012/11/08/remember-those-3-salary-increases-now-theyre-the-new-normal/" aria-label="5% was considered an average annual pay increase.">5% was considered an average annual pay increase.</a>” The amount of fear the media created surrounding the recession and its length has given companies the perfect excuse to shrink payroll and lower employee salary expectations in the long-run.</p>

<p>The world is desperate for skilled labor and companies around the globe are starving for talent.&nbsp; Companies can tout technology replacing labor, but it is only exacerbating the global shortage of human capital and skilled workers. This means that we as employees are positioned better than ever to leverage our abilities for increased pay.</p>

<p>Bethany Devine, a Senior Hiring Manager in Silicon Valley, <fbs-quotecard article-quote-card="" ticker="CA" exchange="NASDAQ" type="organization" natural-id="fred/company/742" closing-price="0.0" current-price="0.0" link="/companies/ca/" name="CA">

 </fbs-quotecard> and other Fortune 500 companies explains, “I would often see resumes that only had a few years at each company. I found that the people who had switched companies usually commanded a higher salary. The problem with staying at a company forever is you start with a base salary and usually annual raises are based on a percentage of your current salary. There is often a limit to how high your manager can bump you up since it's based on a percentage of your current salary. However, if you move to another company, you start fresh and can usually command a higher base salary to hire you. Companies competing for talent are often not afraid to pay more when hiring if it means they can hire the best talent. Same thing applies for titles. Some companies have a limit to how many promotions they allow each year. Once you are entrenched in a company, it may become more difficult to be promoted as you may be waiting in line behind others who should have been promoted a year ago but were not due to the limit. However, if you apply to another company, your skills may match the higher title, and that company will hire you with the new title. I have seen many coworkers who were waiting on a certain title and finally received it the day they left and were hired at a new company.”</p>
<p>Even more importantly, when I asked Devine her thoughts on employees who had remained in the same company for periods long past the two year mark, she explained that she did feel that some were “underpaid” or had the potential to earn more.</p>
<p>Jessica Derkis started her career earning $8 per hour ($16,640 annual salary) as the YMCA’s marketing manager.&nbsp; Over 10 years, she’s changed employers five times to ultimately earn $72,000 per year at her most recent marketing position.&nbsp; This is approximately a 330% increase over a 10 year career. &nbsp;Derkis’ most recent transition resulted in a 50% increase to her salary. &nbsp;Derkis’ is a great example of how “owning your career” can make a huge difference in your income and career path.</p>

<p><b>Arguments Against Changing Jobs</b></p>
<p>People are worried that “changing jobs too often” will reflect negatively on employee resumes. I can definitely understand this fear because everyone is always worried about being unmarketable. I will be the first to admit that it is possible that certain employers may look at a resume with multiple transitions as a negative and may even disqualify an applicant based on that alone.</p>
<p>But, the important question is whether the risk outweighs the reward. Christine Mueller, President of TechniSearch Recruiters, has had clients that “will not consider anyone who has had more than three jobs in the last 10 years, no matter the reason.” Even so, Mueller still recommends that an employee makes a transition every three to four years for maximum salary gains.&nbsp; Thus, the question is less about whether employees should jump ship, but how long they should they wait before jumping to maximize their salaries and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Brendan Burke, Director at <fbs-quotecard article-quote-card="" ticker="HW" exchange="NYSE" type="organization" natural-id="fred/company/97406" closing-price="0.0" current-price="0.0" link="/companies/headwaters/" name="Headwaters">
  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/headwaters/" target="_self" data-ga-track="InternalLink:/companies/headwaters/" aria-label="Headwaters">Headwaters</a> 
 </fbs-quotecard> MB, strongly disagrees with the “up-and-out culture.”&nbsp; He explains that “companies turn over great employees because they’re not organizationally strong enough to support rapid development within their ranks. In many cases, that is a recipe for discontinuity in service and product offerings as well as disloyalty in the ranks. As such, we take the opposite approach. Rather than force folks out after 24 months, we try to retain our junior and mid-level staff and develop them within the ranks.”</p>
<p>Mr. Burke is absolutely correct. Most companies are not equipped to “rapidly” promote and reward their best employees for a variety of reasons such as office politics. Everyone that has worked in the labor pool hates office politics, but understands that it is an unavoidable evil and is more often than not a major obstacle to rewarding talent.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve been talking about money a lot.&nbsp; Andrew Bauer, CEO of Royce Leather, explains that jumping ship can be “stressful.” Employees also need to consider their “quality of life, mental health, physical health and better moral standards.” Mr. Bauer is right. Money is important, but it must be balanced with everything else in your life. Monetary compensation is only one part of your life, and it should not dictate everything.</p>
<p>Jumping ship is a risk that we all need to weigh at a personal level.&nbsp; In my career, jumping ship is something I’ve done aggressively and frequently. I’ve never looked back and regretted my decisions because I’ve always felt that my skills deserved more. Hiring a single employee who is able to perform even 10% more efficiently is worth at least a 25% increase in salary. Companies spend a lot of money to pay recruiters, human resourcing to conduct background checks and the time of existing employees to hire and train new people. It’s always cheaper to just hire better people and pay them more.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
<p>It’s a fact that employees are underpaid. Instead of focusing on things we can’t control like the economy or management decisions, focus on the things we can. Employees can control their own salaries by aggressively negotiating their opportunities and being unafraid to ask for more.</p>
<p>Clearly, there will always be exceptions to the rule. Not everyone may be able to make this decision immediately, but every employee should consider the option. I don’t fault employers and businesses for the market because it’s their right and duty to maximize their profits.

  <p>We’re excited to announce Stable Audio Open, an open source model optimised for generating short audio samples, sound effects and production elements using text prompts. This release marks a key milestone as we further open portions of our generative audio capabilities to empower sound designers, musicians and creative communities.</p><p><strong>What is Stable Audio Open?</strong></p><p>Stable Audio Open allows anyone to generate up to 47 seconds of high-quality audio data from a simple text prompt. Its specialised training makes it ideal for creating drum beats, instrument riffs, ambient sounds, foley recordings and other audio samples for music production and sound design.</p><p>A key benefit of this open source release is that users can fine-tune the model on their own custom audio data. For example, a drummer could fine-tune on samples of their own drum recordings to generate new beats.</p>

  <p><strong>How is it Different from Stable Audio?</strong></p><p>Our commercial Stable Audio product produces high-quality, full tracks with coherent musical structure up to three minutes in length, as well as advanced capabilities like audio-to-audio generation and coherent multi-part musical compositions.&nbsp;</p><p>Stable Audio Open, on the other hand, specialises in audio samples, sound effects and production elements. While it can generate short musical clips, it is not optimised for full songs, melodies or vocals. This open model provides a glimpse into generative AI for sound design while prioritising responsible development alongside creative communities.</p><p>The new model was trained on audio data from FreeSound and the Free Music Archive. This allowed us to create an open audio model while respecting creator rights.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>At Coder we’re in the business of making cloud development environments awesome. When you are developing remotely, the speed and quality of the connection you have to your workspace is a big driver of the overall experience you’ll have. One important measure of how good your connection is:</p>
<p><strong>Throughput</strong> - the rate at which you can send or receive data across a network</p>
<p>Throughput is usually quoted in bits per second, and on modern internet networks, these range from a few millions of bits per second (Mb/s) to a few billions of bits per second (Gb/s).</p>
<p>You will really notice throughput differences when copying files to and from your workspace, or testing web applications that push heavy assets.</p>
<p>Coder v2.12, which we have just released, includes several networking improvements that together increase throughput dramatically: over 5x in some cases. Below is a comparison of throughput test results for 3 different versions of Coder, across 3 different AWS environments with different latencies. They are all based on t3.xlarge VM instances. Your throughput will vary based on many factors besides latency including the speed of your connection and network congestion.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717161538-frame-1.png"></p>
<p>The 60ms test is from us-east-1 to us-west-1, and is a typical latency you might experience connecting to a Coder Workspace relatively far from home, say, across the continental USA.</p>
<p>The 10ms test is from us-east-1 to us-east-2, and is a typical latency you might experience if you are connecting to a Coder Workspace within the same geographic region.</p>
<p>The 1ms test is within us-east-1, and is an extremely low latency connection you might only achieve if you are connecting to a Coder Workspace hosted by your company on-premise, within the same building or corporate campus.</p>
<p>The rest of this post is a deep-dive into how we achieved these throughput increases. Coder builds an end-to-end encrypted tunnel to your workspace, and as such the theoretical maximum throughput to your workspace will be slightly lower than that of the underlying network path due to tunnel overheads, but in our testing we found a significant contribution to reduced throughput was the performance of the embedded TCP stack.</p>
<h2>Wait, Coder Has an Embedded TCP Stack?</h2>
<p>The TCP stack is not something that most software engineers think about that often, even those that are working deep in the backend. Most application software, even server software, does not have a TCP stack embedded even though TCP is essential to the web and the majority of application protocols. The reason is simple: it’s handled in the OS! When you want to speak TCP you just ask the OS to open a socket for you.</p>
<p>So, why doesn’t Coder do that?</p>
<p>We are committed to keeping your data safe through end-to-end encryption and to making Coder easy to run across a wide variety of systems from client laptops and desktops to VMs, containers, and bare metal. If we used the TCP implementation in the OS, we’d need a way for the TCP packets to get from the operating system back into Coder for encryption. This is called a TUN device in unix-style operating systems and creating one requires elevated permissions, limiting who can run Coder and where. Asking for elevated permissions inside secure clusters at regulated financial enterprises or top secret government networks is at best a big delay and at worst a nonstarter.</p>
<p>Instead, Coder embeds the networking stack from gVisor. gVisor is a container runtime that reimplements the entire Linux ABI (syscalls) in Go, but we only need the networking for our purposes. gVisor is deployed extensively by Google in their Cloud offerings, so it is mature and stable, but in our testing, we find that it is not always optimized for our use case.</p>
<p>Google uses gVisor within the data center, where networks have high bandwidth and extremely low latency (hundreds of μs to few ms). Coder users have 10x to 100x more latency, and this can have a big difference in network throughput. We’ve had to make some changes both to how gVisor is configured and to gVisor itself to make it perform well for Coder users.</p>
<h2>A Tale of TCP Buffers</h2>
<p>The promise that a TCP socket makes is that it will deliver a stream of bytes for you, and it will handle reordered or dropped packets, so the receiving application gets your data in order.</p>
<p>TCP uses buffers both when sending and receiving data to handle this. When sending data, it keeps a copy of the data in the buffer until the other TCP stack explicitly acknowledges receipt, in case it needs to be retransmitted. When receiving data, it keeps out-of-order data in the buffer until the in-order data arrives.</p>
<p>TCP data is being tracked in the buffers, and can’t be deleted until it’s delivered in order to the receiving application, which takes some time (the latency). Because of this, the maximum theoretical throughput you can achieve with TCP is directly proportional to the buffer sizes, and inversely proportional to the latency.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717105039-throughput.png" width="128"></p>
<p>Where T is the throughput, C is some constant (approximately 1), B is the buffer size <sup>1</sup>, and L is the latency.</p>
<p>This might be a surprising result at first! We often explain packet switched networking with the analogy of the postal system. If I live in California and am writing letters to my friends in Texas and Florida, it’s easy to imagine that I could post as many letters as I want to them. Sure, the letters might take an extra day to reach my friend in Florida, but the rate at which I send them and the rate at which they could arrive shouldn’t be fundamentally limited by that delay.</p>
<p>The key here is that we’re ensuring reliable delivery. The postal system, in our little analogy, loses letters all the time and doesn’t even offer registered mail<sup>2</sup>. So, I have to keep copies of all my letters until my friends write back to say they got them. If I send 10 letters per day, and it takes 2 days to deliver to Texas (and 2 more days to get a reply), then I better have space for 40 letters. If I try to do the same for Florida, which takes 3 days each way, then I better have space for 60 letters, or risk losing some of the letters permanently.</p>
<p>Let’s see what this looks like in TCP. The Coder CLI includes a speedtest command to test throughput to your workspace, and can capture the TCP packets for analysis in Wireshark. (You will need the Tailscale Wireshark Lua plugin to decode the packet captures.) The following runs a 20 second upload test to my workspace named <code>dogfood2</code>.</p>
<pre><code>coder speedtest <span>--direction</span> up <span>--pcap-file</span> dogfood2-up-<span>00</span><span>.pcap</span> -t <span>10s</span> dogfood2</code></pre>
<p>Testing with Coder 2.9, I get something like:</p>
<pre><code>Starting a 10s upload test...
INTERVAL        THROUGHPUT         
0.00-1.28 sec   65.2983 Mbits/sec

<span>8.77-10.00 sec  54.3970 Mbits/sec  
-----------------------------------</span>
0.00-10.00 sec  55.3624 Mbits/sec</code></pre>
<p>I opened one of the packet capture files and asked Wireshark to plot the TCP window (green line) and number of unacknowledged bytes in flight (blue line).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717155989-tcp1.png"></p>
<p>The TCP window is, essentially, how much room the receiver has in its buffer, and the TCP sender is not allowed to send more unacknowledged data than this. When the receiver acknowledges some data, the blue line dips down and we send more. This shows us that the TCP throughput is being limited by the buffer sizes, not the underlying network bandwidth.</p>
<p>The TCP window hovers right around 512 KB, which is one half the default TCP receive buffer size in gVisor. The maximum TCP window is capped at half the buffer to allow for out of order segments and for data not yet delivered to the application.</p>
<p>Increasing the buffers gives the TCP stack the room it needs to track more data in flight, increasing throughput (dramatically in some cases).</p>
<p>On 2.10, which has increased TCP buffers, here is an example speedtest:</p>
<pre><code>Starting a <span>10</span>s upload test...

<h3>When Slow Start is Too Fast</h3>
<p>In my performance testing, after increasing buffer sizes I saw much improved throughput overall, but I noticed that my connection speed would often stutter in the first couple seconds.</p>
<p>Here is a Wireshark plot of the TCP throughput for my connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717156014-tcp2.png"></p>
<p>It shows the throughput ramping up in the first second or so, then coming to a screeching halt around 2 seconds, before recovering and stabilizing. This happens even though we never get close to saturating the TCP window we discussed in the last section.</p>
<p>While you’d hardly notice the issue downloading a 100MB file, this stutter would turn a 2 second page load into 3-4 seconds.</p>
<p>To understand what’s happening we need to dive a bit deeper into TCP and talk about congestion control. TCP congestion control algorithms moderate the amount of data a TCP connection sends to avoid overwhelming congested network links along the path. Avoiding this is both in our own selfish interest, since retransmitting dropped packets lowers our effective throughput, and in the common interest of the Internet as a whole because it allows different applications to share the network capacity.</p>
<p>TCP congestion control works by maintaining a second window variable in addition to the one updated by the receiver. The <em>congestion window</em> is an internal state variable that doesn’t appear in the TCP protocol at all. TCP stack takes the smaller of the send window and congestion window to determine an effective window that limits the amount of data it can send.</p>
<p>The full details of congestion control algorithms are beyond the scope of this blog post, but the central idea is that they detect congestion in the network and then update the congestion window, cutting its size in the face of congestion and slowly opening up the window when it seems the network can handle more.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717156008-tcp3.png"></p>
<p>When network links receive more data than they can carry, routers in the path respond to this congestion by dropping packets. TCP detects these packet drops through missed acknowledgements in the protocol. It resends the data, but also reduces the congestion window in response.</p>
<p>At the very start of a TCP connection, the sending stack doesn’t know anything about how much available bandwidth there is on the network path to the destination, so it starts the congestion window very small: just one packet’s worth of data. It does this to avoid dumping a ton of data into the network all at once and causing a cascade of dropped packets. This is called TCP Slow Start.</p>
<p>However, it does not stay slow for long! During TCP Slow Start, each acknowledged packet of data also increases the congestion window, causing 2 packets to be sent in response. This is an exponential increase in throughput–a doubling every round-trip time (RTT). You can see this in the Wireshark throughput plot above during the first second. When TCP detects congestion, it exits Slow Start, having dynamically discovered the current available bandwidth of the network path.</p>
<p>This exponential increase can often be too aggressive. If we depend on a dropped packet to detect congestion, it can take up to one RTT before we receive an indication. During that time, we double the amount of packets we send out into the network, and we might overshoot by a large amount. This is especially a problem for connections with large bandwidth and high latency, as this combination means a large number of packets are “in flight” in the network at any given time. Overshooting can cause a significant fraction of these in flight packets to be dropped. Multiple dropped packets cause a lot of problems for the TCP stack, including slamming the congestion window shut and increased CPU utilization as the stack has to compute which packets to resend. This is the stuttering I saw in my TCP connections.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I’m far from the first person to have noticed this problem. Researchers Ha &amp; Rhee described the issue and an algorithmic solution in their 2011 paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2011.01.014" target="_blank">Taming the elephants: New TCP slow start</a>. Their proposed algorithm, called HyStart (short for hybrid start), was eventually implemented in the Linux kernel and a slightly modified version (called HyStart++) implemented in Windows and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9406/" target="_blank">described in an RFC</a>. HyStart works by tracking slight variations in the round-trip-time to detect network congestion before packets are dropped.</p>
<p>gVisor, the TCP stack we use in Coder, had not implemented HyStart. Google uses gVisor in their data centers, and with extremely short RTTs between nodes, they hadn’t seen the stuttering TCP connections. But, they were very happy to accept a PR when I reached out, and so we implemented and <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/pull/10287" target="_blank">upstreamed HyStart to gVisor</a> earlier this spring. We are pleased to include an updated gVisor TCP stack with HyStart starting in Coder 2.12.</p>
<p>Here is a Wireshark plot of TCP throughput with HyStart implemented:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717156000-tcp4.png"></p>
<h3>Packets Lost Within</h3>
<p>Networking is a multi-step process with interacting components, many distributed across different locations, and the nature of such systems is that performance is generally limited by a single, slowest rate <em>limiting step</em>, or <em>bottleneck</em>. Furthermore, when you deal with the problem of a rate limiting step, by making it faster or working around it, the performance rapidly improves up to the limits of what was the second-slowest step.</p>
<p>And so, after dealing with TCP buffers and TCP slow start, we continued to examine Coder’s networking performance. We found that TCP throughput was limited by dropped packets, and that some of the packets were being dropped <em>inside</em> the Coder process before they were sent out on the wire!</p>
<p>Coder uses a modified version of Tailscale for networking. The packet-processing pipeline in this arrangement looks, schematically, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1717155994-tcp5.png"></p>
<p>Via some hacked logging, we determined that packets were being dropped in the Channel Endpoint – a software component that looks like a network interface to gVisor and allows WireGuard to read and write network packets like a TUN device.</p>
<p>The Channel Endpoint had an internal queue of packets and when the queue filled up, it dropped packets sent by gVisor’s TCP/IP stack. The Channel Endpoint was a component of gVisor, designed to implement a virtual network link, and dropping packets <em>is</em> what real network links do when they are filled up.</p>
<p>In some sense, this was a reasonable arrangement. If the gVisor stack can send data faster than WireGuard can encrypt, then <em>something</em> needs to put pressure on the stack to get it to back off, and as we discussed in the last section this is exactly what TCP congestion control is designed to do when it detects dropped packets.</p>
<p>However, this is all happening with the <em>same process</em> on a single node, not in some distributed system of interacting routers and switches that make up the Internet. In this context, dropping packets is a very heavyweight solution to the problem of putting back pressure on the TCP stack. Firstly, you have to wait for a network round trip to find out about dropped packets. Secondly, it increases work because you have to resend.</p>
<p>We can do much better, and in fact, Go already includes the data structure we need as a primitive: the buffered channel. A buffered Go channel allows writes to complete without blocking until the buffer is full, and then any further writes simply block until there is room in the channel. This blocks the gVisor stack from sending more data and gives WireGuard time to catch up. And, when WireGuard has caught up, gVisor can resume sending within microseconds, not milliseconds of network round trips. This simple fix doubles throughput on some connections in our test systems.</p>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
<p>I want to end this post by saying that although we have made big strides in the last few Coder versions, we don’t consider this network performance work done. While security of your data in transit is our top priority, we will continue to push for higher performance until we can say confidently that the bottleneck is the underlying network itself.</p>

<p><span><em><sup>1</sup> I’m glossing over the difference between the send buffer and the receive buffer here, and in the case where one is significantly smaller than the other, the maximum throughput is limited by the smaller one.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em><sup>2</sup> This is by design and is called the end-to-end principle. The services offered by the system are kept basic and lightweight, and if you want reliable delivery, or proof of delivery you build it into the protocols the endpoints speak.</em></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Researchers have discovered a major driver of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and several other immune disorders that affect the spine, liver and arteries, raising hopes for millions of people worldwide.</p><p>The breakthrough is particularly exciting because the newly found biological pathway can be targeted by drugs that are already used, with work under way to adapt them to patients with IBD and other conditions.</p><p>“What we have found is one of the very central pathways that goes wrong when people get inflammatory bowel disease and this has been something of a holy grail,” said Dr James Lee, the group leader of the genetic mechanisms of disease laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.</p><p>Lee added: “Even for pure, fundamental immunology this is a really exciting discovery. But to show this is dysregulated in people who get disease not only gives us a better understanding of the disease, it tells us this is something we can treat.”</p><p>More than half a million people in the UK have inflammatory bowel disease, the two main forms of which are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, with at least 7 million affected globally. They arise when the immune system attacks the bowel, causing an array of debilitating symptoms from abdominal pain and weight loss to diarrhoea and blood in stools. While medicines such as steroids can ease the symptoms, some patients require surgery to remove part of their bowel.</p><p>Lee’s research team “stumbled” on the discovery after investigating a “gene desert”, a stretch of DNA on chromosome 21 that does not code for proteins, which has previously been linked to IBD and other autoimmune diseases. Writing in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07501-1" data-link-name="in body link">Nature</a>, they describe how they found a section of DNA that behaves like a volume control for nearby genes. This “enhancer” was seen only in immune cells called macrophages where it boosted a gene called ETS2 and ramped up the risk of IBD.</p><figure id="a33feb6a-a809-46bc-a950-790f5d2e7f86" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:6,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Combining three healthy behaviours can lower IBS risk, study finds&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;a33feb6a-a809-46bc-a950-790f5d2e7f86&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/20/combining-three-healthy-behaviours-can-lower-ibs-risk-study-finds&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&quot;:true,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>Through gene editing experiments, the scientists showed that ETS2 is central to the inflammatory behaviour of macrophages and their ability to damage the bowel in IBD. “There’s been a search for some time for the central drivers of this pathogenic process, and this is what we’ve stumbled on,” said Lee, who is also a consultant gastroenterologist at the Royal Free hospital and UCL.</p><p>The same biological pathway is thought to drive other autoimmune disorders, including ankylosing spondylitis, which causes spine and joint inflammation in about one in 1,000 people worldwide, and rarer autoimmune diseases that affect the liver and arteries.</p><p>While there are no drugs that specifically target the ETS2 gene, the scientists identified a class of anticancer drugs called MEK inhibitors that they suspected would dampen the gene’s activity. In laboratory tests, the drugs performed as expected, reducing inflammation in gut samples from patients with IBD.</p><p>Because MEK inhibitors have side-effects in other organs, the scientists have begun work to adapt the medicine so it targets only a patient’s macrophages. This is done by creating a “conjugate” where the drug molecule is attached to a synthetic antibody that binds only to the target cells. “It’s safer because it’s more targeted and you can use a lower dose,” said Lee. “We have already developed the antibody conjugate, I have it sitting in my freezer.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-11" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Clinical trials are still needed to see whether the adapted drug reduces IBD and other autoimmune conditions, but because MEK inhibitors are already used in cancer patients, researchers hope that process could be swift and potentially completed within five years.</p><p>In further work, the scientists found that the ETS2 gene is at least half a million years old and was carried by neanderthals and other archaic humans. “It has been preserved over evolutionary history probably because it is important in early bacterial responses,” said Lee. “So you wouldn’t want to knock it out all together. You just need to turn down its activity by 50% and the effect of that may be enough.”</p><p>Ruth Wakeman at Crohn’s and Colitis UK said: “Crohn’s and colitis are complex, lifelong conditions for which there is no cure, but research like this is helping us to answer some of the big questions about what causes them. This research is a really exciting step towards the possibility of a world free from Crohn’s and colitis.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>One of the biggest sticking points of being a solo dev is maintaining motivation. I’ve been keeping a journal entry about how to hack my motivation, what works and what doesn’t. Here are the things that have worked.</p><h3 id="convert-external-sources-to-motivation">Convert external sources to motivation</h3><p>I’ve always known that I’m more extrinsically than intrinsically motivated, so I have a couple systems that help to give me bursts of external motivation. For example, the Money Bots, which pop up every time someone subscribes.</p><p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/motivation/money_bots.png"></p><p>I’m a push notification ascetic, but these pop up right on my home screen. It’s a small burst of motivation every time. There’s a bit of a hedonic treadmill effect; initially a single new subscriber was a massive hit of dopamine/energy, and that’s reduced over time, but they still fuel me.</p><p>In a similar vein, I signed up for a service that notifies me whenever someone mentions Chessbook. This is simultaneously useful for marketing, since engaging on socials can help a lot, but it’s also motivating whenever I see people talking (hopefully positively) about the thing I’ve built.</p><p>There’s also a <code>#pump-up</code> channel with a feed of milestones we’ve hit, like $X MRR, 2,000 discord users, churn rate &lt;6%, motivating stuff like that.</p><h3 id="leave-tasks-unfinished">Leave tasks unfinished</h3><p>I can’t overstate how much this one helps me. I try to leave a task 90% finished at the end of a working session. It feels slightly worse than closing out the work, but it makes starting the next day 10x easier. Having a quick win when I start coding is a massive boost, and it immediately gets me into the flow state. It can’t be <em>too</em> easy though, if all I have left is to run <code>git commit</code>, that’s not enough. Ideally it’s something where I know exactly what I need to do, that will take 5-10 minutes.</p><h3 id="use-the-thing-myself-as-much-as-possible">Use the thing myself, as much as possible</h3><p>I try to use my own product as much as I can. When someone submits a bug report about some jank, sometimes it’s easy to classify it as a small issue. Then I run into it myself, realize that it really affects the experience, and go fix it right away. Felt pain is way more salient than communicated pain.</p><p>To digress, this also gives me way better product ideas, the best ones I’ve had didn’t come from sitting down and thinking about what people may want, they came from realizing what I myself want.</p><h3 id="address-the-pain-instead-of-pushing-through">Address the pain, instead of pushing through</h3><p>There’s always some parts that suck. A neglected area of the codebase, dealing with third parties, releasing new versions of native apps, etc. If I know I’ll have to deal with one of these as part of a task, it can feel much harder to motivate myself to get started.</p><p>The trick, is that you can almost always make these less painful.</p><p>For example, recently I felt a lot of friction starting a new task because it needed 4+ new endpoints, and that always involved a lot of boilerplate. I have to write the types on the backend, write the same types on the frontend, make sure I get the payload correct, make sure I get the path correct, and nothing is type-checked so usually it doesn’t work the first time. So before starting, I found a RPC library called <a href="https://www.rspc.dev/">RSPC</a>, which generates types for me, and makes writing and calling a new backend function from the frontend almost as easy, and just as type-safe, as calling another async frontend function.</p><p>Not only did this remove the pain point, but I was actively excited to use this new system. I converted a source of friction into a motivation multiplier.</p><p>This is one that’s easy to forget if you’ve worked in bigger companies where you can’t address the pain points of day-to-day development. You’ve probably acquired a sense of futility in trying to address these things. There’s either deadlines to hit, or people to get sign-off from, or you need to write a technical doc on your approach before you get to try it. Being able to just go fix and improve whatever you want is one of the greatest points of being a solo dev, so remind yourself that you can take advantage of it at any time.</p><h3 id="do-nothing">Do nothing</h3><p>I get sucked into high-tech Skinner Boxes all the time. Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, etc. The best way I’ve found to get out of this is to do it in two steps. First I go from Reddit to doing nothing, then I get to work.</p><p>Going straight from Reddit to focused work is very hard, but doing nothing is much easier, and eventually your brain calms down and it doesn’t feel nearly as hard to start writing some code.</p><p>I really mean doing nothing; I’ll just sit in front of my screen for a few minutes and as if by magic, the consumption-fueled dopamine-overload fog will lift, and I can get excited about creation and problem-solving again.</p><h3 id="update-my-users">Update my users</h3><p>This is a two-for-one, I can both update my users, and motivate myself by looking back on progress. I often reach the end of the month, and find myself thinking “did I even get anything done?”, but then you can write your update for the month, and see that you did get a lot done.</p><p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/motivation/update.png"></p><p>Obviously this cuts both ways though, if you really didn’t get much done you’ll see that too, but facing the truth that you’re not getting enough done can be motivating too.</p><h3 id="get-a-partner">Get a partner</h3><p>This may seem contradictory to the title, but I only said solo <em>dev</em>. I have a partner, who’s way better at everything product/design/copy/etc.</p><p>I won’t list all the benefits of having a partner, but I now believe they’re essential, and in any future projects I’ll be making sure to find a partner that complements my skillset while being aligned on the problem. It’s a night and day difference.</p><p>The motivation piece here is mostly around accountability. It’s the same reason that people have gym partners, just having someone that expects you to show up can be powerful. Also if you have a weekly meeting and find you have nothing to talk about, you’re probably not getting enough done, and it’s a salient reminder.</p><p>The other piece is that your motivation and your partner’s motivation will ebb and flow, and it won’t happen in lock-step. It’s very helpful to have someone else still motivated about the project, when you’re not.</p><h3 id="no-zero-days-to-avoid-listless-guilt">No zero days, to avoid listless guilt</h3><p>Some days when I’m not getting anything done, I’ve got this lingering guilt that I’m having a “zero day”. This prevents me from fully enjoying whatever activity I’m doing. I’ve tried just giving myself permission to enjoy whatever I’m doing, but it just doesn’t work. Ostensibly I’m taking time off and recharging, but it doesn’t feel like that at all – it feels like pushing through. This can lead to a negative feedback loop, where I’m constantly trying to recharge, but just getting more tired.</p><p>I’ve found the only way is to get some good work done first, then I can be fully immersed in whatever fun slacking-off activity I dive into.</p><h3 id="if-ive-got-it-use-it">If I’ve got it, use it</h3><p>Sometimes I’ll be going to bed thinking about a problem, and get the motivation which comes in the moment of figuring things out. I could write it down and get to it in the morning, but most of the time I’ll just get up and work until 4am instead. This is also one of the great parts of being a solo dev. I don’t need to be up at 9am to be available on Slack, so I can use my motivation whenever it strikes me, even if that’s in the middle of the night.</p><p>This probably doesn’t generalize, but again this is more of a journal entry adapted into a blog post, than it is advice. I’ve always done better with the looser approach of trying to maximize the opportunities for flow state work, than forcing myself to work 9-5 every day, rain or shine.</p><h3 id="you-have-adhd-getting-yourself-to-work-shouldnt-be-this-hard">You have ADHD, getting yourself to work shouldn’t be this hard</h3><p>True 😄</p></div></article><div><p>Thanks for reading!

<p dir="auto">As a very enthusiastic foosball player, I've sunk countless hours into the game. As a programmer though, something about the idea of practice is fundamentally misguided. Repeating the same task over and over, in the hopes of slightly improving your marginal efficiency of it? It sounds ripe for automation.</p>
<p dir="auto">So I did that! Foosbar is a completely autonomous foosball table that is robotically controlled on one side of the table, while a human plays on the other. It is capable of defending, passing and taking shots. It has successfully mechanized all my joy out of the game, leaving me free to pursue <a href="https://github.com/misprit7/computerraria">more important and deeply fulfilling things</a> with my life.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vk13-on-the-m1-in-1-month.html">https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vk13-on-the-m1-in-1-month.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40585842">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"> <header><p>5 Jun 2024</p></header> <p>Finally, conformant Vulkan for the M1! The new “Honeykrisp” driver is the first <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/vulkan#submission_780">conformant Vulkan®</a> for Apple hardware on any operating system, implementing the full 1.3 spec without “portability” waivers.</p> <p>Honeykrisp is <strong>not yet released</strong> for end users. We’re continuing to add features, improve performance, and port to more hardware. <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/alyssa/mesa/-/tree/honeykrisp-20240506-2/src/asahi/vulkan?ref_type=heads">Source code</a> is available for developers.</p> <figure> <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/holocure.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/holocure.avif" alt="HoloCure running on Honeykrisp ft. DXVK, FEX, and Proton."></a>  </figure> <p>Honeykrisp is not based on prior M1 Vulkan efforts, but rather <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@gfxstrand">Faith Ekstrand</a>’s open source <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/introducing-nvk.html">NVK driver</a> for NVIDIA GPUs. In her words:</p> <blockquote> <p>All Vulkan drivers in Mesa trace their lineage to the Intel Vulkan driver and started by copying+pasting from it. My hope is that NVK will eventually become the driver that everyone copies and pastes from. To that end, I’m building NVK with all the best practices we’ve developed for Vulkan drivers over the last 7.5 years and trying to keep the code-base clean and well-organized.</p> </blockquote> <p>Why spend years implementing features from scratch when we can reuse NVK? There will be friction starting out, given NVIDIA’s desktop architecture differs from the M1’s mobile roots. In exchange, we get a modern driver designed for desktop games.</p> <p>We’ll need to pass a half-million tests ensuring correctness, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters">submit the results</a>, and then we’ll become conformant after 30 days of industry review. Starting from NVK and our OpenGL 4.6 driver… can we write a driver passing the Vulkan 1.3 conformance test suite <em>faster</em> than the 30 day review period?</p> <p>It’s unprecedented…</p> <p>Challenge accepted.</p> <h3 id="april-2">April 2</h3> <p>It begins with a text.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Faith… I think I want to write a Vulkan driver.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Her advice?</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Just start typing.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Thre’s no copy-pasting yet – we just add M1 code to NVK and remove NVIDIA as we go. Since the kernel mediates our access to the hardware, we begin connecting “NVK” to <a href="https://vt.social/@lina">Asahi Lina</a>’s kernel driver using code shared with OpenGL. Then we plug in our shader compiler and hit the hay.</p> <h3 id="april-3">April 3</h3> <p>To access resources, GPUs use “descriptors” containing the address, format, and size of a resource. Vulkan bundles descriptors into “sets” per the application’s “descriptor set layout”. When compiling shaders, the driver lowers descriptor accesses to marry the set layout with the hardware’s data structures. As our descriptors differ from NVIDIA’s, our next task is adapting NVK’s descriptor set lowering. We start with a simple but correct approach, deleting far more code than we add.</p> <h3 id="april-4">April 4</h3> <p>With working descriptors, we can compile compute shaders. Now we program the fixed-function hardware to dispatch compute. We first add bookkeeping to map Vulkan command buffers to lists of M1 “control streams”, then we generate a compute control stream. We copy that code from our OpenGL driver, translate the GL into Vulkan, and compute works.</p> <p>That’s enough to move on to “copies” of buffers and images. We implement Vulkan’s copies with compute shaders, internally dispatched with Vulkan commands as if we were the application. The first copy test passes.</p> <h3 id="april-5">April 5</h3> <p>Fleshing out yesterday’s code, <em>all</em> copy tests pass.</p> <h3 id="april-6">April 6</h3> <p>We’re ready to tackle graphics. The novelty is handling graphics state like depth/stencil. That’s straightforward, but there’s a <em>lot</em> of state to handle. Faith’s code collects all “dynamic state” into a single structure, which we translate into hardware control words. As usual, we grab that translation from our OpenGL driver, blend with NVK, and move on.</p> <h3 id="april-7">April 7</h3> <p>What makes state “dynamic”? Dynamic state can change without recompiling shaders. By contrast, static state is baked into shader binaries called “pipelines”. If games create all their pipelines during a loading screen, there is no compiler “stutter” during gameplay. The idea hasn’t quite panned out: many game developers don’t know their state ahead-of-time so cannot create pipelines early. In response, Vulkan has <u><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state.html">made</a></u> <u><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2.html">ever</a></u> <u><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3.html">more</a></u> <u><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_vertex_input_dynamic_state.html">state</a></u> <u><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library.html">dynamic</a></u>, punctuated with the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/you-can-use-vulkan-without-pipelines-today"><code>EXT_shader_object</code></a> extension that makes pipelines <em>optional</em>.</p> <p>We want full dynamic state and shader objects. Unfortunately, the M1 bakes random state into shaders: vertex attributes, fragment outputs, blending, even linked interpolation qualifiers. Like most of the industry in the 2010s, the M1’s designers bet on pipelines.</p> <p>Faced with this hardware, a reasonable driver developer would double-down on pipelines. DXVK would stutter, but we’d pass conformance.</p> <p>I am not reasonable.</p> <p>To eliminate stuttering in OpenGL, we make state dynamic with four strategies:</p> <ul> <li>Conditional code.</li> <li>Precompiled variants.</li> <li>Indirection.</li> <li>Prologs and epilogs.</li> </ul> <p>Wait, what-a-logs?</p> <p>AMD also bakes state into shaders… with a twist. They divide the hardware binary into three parts: a <em>prolog</em>, the shader, and an <em>epilog</em>. Confining dynamic state to the periphery eliminates shader variants. They compile prologs and epilogs on the fly, but that’s fast and doesn’t stutter. Linking shader parts is a quick concatenation, or long jumps avoid linking altogether. This strategy works for the M1, too.</p> <p>For Honeykrisp, let’s follow NVK’s lead and treat <em>all</em> state as dynamic. No other Vulkan driver has implemented full dynamic state and shader objects this early on, but it avoids refactoring later. Today we add the code to build, compile, and cache prologs and epilogs.</p> <p>Putting it together, we get a (dynamic) triangle:</p> <p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/hk-triangle.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/hk-triangle.avif" alt="Classic rainbow triangle"></a></p> <h3 id="april-8">April 8</h3> <p>Guided by the list of failing tests, we wire up the little bits missed along the way, like translating border colours.</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>/* Translate an American VkBorderColor into a Canadian agx_border_colour */</span></span>
<span><span>enum</span> agx_border_colour</span>

<span>   <span>...</span></span>
<span>   <span>}</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div> <p>Test results are getting there.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pass</strong>: 149770, <strong>Fail</strong>: 7741, <strong>Crash</strong>: 2396</p> </blockquote> <p>That’s good enough for <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake">vkQuake</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/vkquake.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/vkquake.avif" alt="Vulkan port of Quake running on Honeykrisp"></a><br> </p> <h3 id="april-9">April 9</h3> <p>Lots of little fixes bring us to a 99.6% pass rate… for Vulkan 1.1. Why stop there? NVK is 1.3 conformant, so let’s claim 1.3 and skip to the finish line.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pass</strong>: 255209, <strong>Fail</strong>: 3818, <strong>Crash</strong>: 599</p> </blockquote> <p>98.3% pass rate for 1.3 on our 1 week anniversary.</p> <p>Not bad.</p> <h3 id="april-10">April 10</h3> <p>SuperTuxKart has a Vulkan renderer.</p> <p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/hkr-stk.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/hkr-stk.avif" alt="SuperTuxKart rendering with Honeykrisp, showing Pepper (from Pepper and Carrot) riding her broomstick in the STK Enterprise"></a></p> <h3 id="april-11">April 11</h3> <p><a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/zink.html">Zink</a> works too.</p> <p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/hkr-stk-zink.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/hkr-stk-zink.avif" alt="SuperTuxKart rendering with Zink on Honeykrisp, same scene but with better lighting"></a></p> <h3 id="april-12">April 12</h3> <p>I tracked down some fails to a test bug, where an arbitrary verification threshold was too strict to pass on some devices. I filed a bug report, and it’s <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/VK-GL-CTS/commit/5fd73c841d775dff1ad52d8340d79dc120d64696">resolved</a> within a few weeks.</p> <h3 id="april-16">April 16</h3> <p>The tests for “descriptor indexing” revealed a compiler bug affecting subgroup shuffles in non-uniform control flow. The M1’s shuffle instruction is quirky, but it’s easy to workaround. Fixing that fixes the descriptor indexing tests.</p> <h3 id="april-17">April 17</h3> <p>A few tests crash inside our register allocator. Their shaders contain a peculiar construction:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span>condition<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span>   <span>while</span> <span>(</span>true<span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div> <p><code>condition</code> is always false, but the compiler doesn’t know that.</p> <p>Infinite loops are nominally invalid since shaders must terminate in finite time, but this shader is syntactically valid. “All loops contain a break” seems obvious for a shader, but it’s false. It’s straightforward to fix register allocation, but what a doozy.</p> <h3 id="april-18">April 18</h3> <p>Remember copies? They’re slow, and every frame currently requires a copy to get on screen.</p> <p>For “zero copy” rendering, we need enough Linux window system integration to negotiate an efficient surface layout across process boundaries. Linux uses “modifiers” for this purpose, so we implement the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier.html"><code>EXT_image_drm_format_modifier</code></a> extension. And by implement, I mean copy.</p> <p>Copies to avoid copies.</p> <h3 id="april-20">April 20</h3> <blockquote> <p><em>“I’d like a 4K x86 Windows Direct3D PC game on a 16K arm64 Linux Vulkan Mac.”</em></p> <p>…</p> <p><em>“Ma’am, this is a Wendy’s.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h3 id="april-22">April 22</h3> <p>As bug fixing slows down, we step back and check our driver architecture. Since we treat all state as dynamic, we don’t pre-pack control words during pipeline creation. That adds theoretical CPU overhead.</p> <p>Is that a problem? After some optimization, <a href="https://github.com/zmike/vkoverhead">vkoverhead</a> says we’re pushing 100 million draws per second.</p> <p>I think we’re okay.</p> <h3 id="april-24">April 24</h3> <p>Time to light up YCbCr. If we don’t use special YCbCr hardware, this feature is “software-only”. However, it touches a <em>lot</em> of code.</p> <p>It touches so much code that <a href="https://mohamexiety.github.io/posts/final_report/">Mohamed Ahmed</a> spent an entire summer adding it to NVK.</p> <p>Which means he spent a summer adding it to Honeykrisp.</p> <p>Thanks, Mohamed ;-)</p> <h3 id="april-25">April 25</h3> <p>Query copies are next. In Vulkan, the application can query the number of samples rendered, writing the result into an opaque “query pool”. The result can be copied from the query pool on the CPU or GPU.</p> <p>For the CPU, the driver maps the pool’s internal data structure and copies the result. This may require nontrivial repacking.</p> <p>For the GPU, we need to repack in a compute shader. That’s harder, because we can’t just run C code on the GPU, right?</p> <p>…Actually, we can.</p> <p>A little witchcraft makes GPU query copies as easy as C.</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>void</span> copy_query<span>(</span><span>struct</span> params <span>*</span>p, <span>int</span> i<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span>  <span>uintptr_t</span> dst <span>=</span> p<span>-&gt;</span>dest <span>+</span> i <span>*</span> p<span>-&gt;</span>stride<span>;</span></span>
<span>  <span>int</span> query <span>=</span> p<span>-&gt;</span>first <span>+</span> i<span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>p<span>-&gt;</span>available<span>[</span>query<span>]</span> <span>||</span> p<span>-&gt;</span>partial<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span>    <span>int</span> q <span>=</span> p<span>-&gt;</span>index<span>[</span>query<span>];</span></span>
<span>    write_result<span>(</span>dst, p<span>-&gt;</span>_64, p<span>-&gt;</span>results<span>[</span>q<span>]);</span></span>
<span>  <span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span>  <span>...</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div> <h3 id="april-26">April 26</h3> <p>The final boss: border colours, hard mode.</p> <p>Direct3D lets the application choose an arbitrary border colour when creating a sampler. By contrast, Vulkan only requires three border colours:</p> <ul> <li><strong><code>(0, 0, 0, 0)</code></strong> – transparent black</li> <li><strong><code>(0, 0, 0, 1)</code></strong> – opaque black</li> <li><strong><code>(1, 1, 1, 1)</code></strong> – opaque white</li> </ul> <p>We handled these on April 8. Unfortunately, there are two problems.</p> <p>First, we need custom border colours for Direct3D compatibility. Both <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk">DXVK</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton">vkd3d-proton</a> require the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_custom_border_color.html"><code>EXT_custom_border_color</code></a> extension.</p> <p>Second, there’s a subtle problem with our hardware, causing dozens of fails even without custom border colours. To understand the issue, let’s revisit texture descriptors, which contain a pixel <em>format</em> and a component reordering <em>swizzle</em>.</p> <p>Some formats are implicitly reordered. Common “BGRA” formats swap red and blue for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74924790/why-bgra-instead-of-rgba">historical reasons</a>. The M1 does not directly support these formats. Instead, the driver composes the swizzle with the format’s reordering. If the application uses a <code>BARB</code> swizzle with a <code>BGRA</code> format, the driver uses an <code>RABR</code> swizzle with an <code>RGBA</code> format.</p> <p>There’s a catch: swizzles apply to the border colour, but formats do not. We need to <em>undo</em> the format reordering when programming the border colour for correct results after the hardware applies the composed swizzle. Our OpenGL driver implements border colours this way, because it knows the texture format when creating the sampler. Unfortunately, Vulkan doesn’t give us that information.</p> <p>Without custom border colour support, we “should” be okay. Swapping red and blue doesn’t change anything if the colour is white or black.</p> <p>There’s an even <em>subtler</em> catch. Vulkan mandates support for a packed 16-bit format with 4-bit components. The M1 supports a similar format… but with reversed “endianness”, swapping red and <em>alpha</em>.</p> <p>That still seems okay. For transparent black (all zero) and opaque white (all one), swapping components doesn’t change the result.</p> <p>The problem is opaque black: <code>(0, 0, 0, 1)</code>. Swapping red and alpha gives <code>(1, 0, 0, 0)</code>. Transparent red? Uh-oh.</p> <p>We’re stuck. No known hardware configuration implements correct Vulkan semantics.</p> <p>Is hope lost?</p> <p>Do we give up?</p> <p>A reasonable person would.</p> <p>I am not reasonable.</p> <p>Let’s jump into the deep end. If we implement custom border colours, opaque black becomes a special case. But how? The M1’s custom border colours entangle the texture format with the sampler. A reasonable person would skip Direct3D support.</p> <p>As you know, I am not reasonable.</p> <p>Although the hardware is unsuitable, we control software. Whenever a shader samples a texture, we’ll inject code to fix up the border colour. This emulation is simple, correct, and slow. We’ll use dirty driver tricks to speed it up later. For now, we eat the cost, advertise full custom border colours, and pass the opaque black tests.</p> <h3 id="april-27">April 27</h3> <p>All that’s left is some last minute bug fixing, and…</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pass</strong>: 686930, <strong>Fail</strong>: 0</p> </blockquote> <p>Success.</p> <h3 id="the-future">The future</h3> <p>The next task is implementing everything that <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/blob/master/VP_DXVK_requirements.json">DXVK</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/blob/master/VP_D3D12_VKD3D_PROTON_profile.json">vkd3d-proton</a> require to layer Direct3D. That includes esoteric extensions like <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_transform_feedback.html">transform feedback</a>. Then <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX">open source x86 emulator</a> will run Windows games on <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux</a>.</p> <p>That’s getting ahead of ourselves. In the mean time, enjoy Linux games with our <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/conformant-gl46-on-the-m1.html">conformant OpenGL 4.6</a> drivers… and stay tuned.</p> <figure> <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/babystorm.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/babystorm.avif" alt="Baby Storm running on Honeykrisp ft.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    <p>A federal court jury in Seattle on Thursday ruled against Boeing in a lawsuit brought by failed electric airplane startup Zunum and awarded $81 million in damages  — which the judge has the option to triple.</p><p>Zunum alleged that Boeing, while ostensibly investing seed money to get the startup off the ground, stole Zunum’s technology and actively undermined its attempts to build a business.</p><p>It accused Boeing of “a targeted and coordinated campaign” to gain access to<br>its “business plan, market and technological analysis, and other trade secrets and proprietary information,” then using that to develop its own hybrid-electric plane design.</p><p>Zunum also accused Boeing of sabotaging its efforts to attract funding from aerospace suppliers Safran and United Technologies.</p><p>The jury found that Boeing had misappropriated Zunum’s trade secrets and breached its contract with the startup. </p><p>It also found that Boeing’s actions were “willful and malicious,” which opens the door for the judge to award triple damages plus legal costs in a case that has <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/collapsed-hybrid-electric-planemaker-zunum-sues-former-partner-boeing-alleging-misuse-of-trade-secrets/">already been running for more than four years</a>. </p>
<p>Boeing in a statement said it “respectfully disagrees with the jury’s verdict, which is not supported by the law or the facts. Boeing will pursue all available challenges to the judgment.”</p><p>Another part of the ruling awarded Zunum a further $12 million for Boeing’s alleged interference with Zunum’s relationship with Safran. And finally, the jury ruled the final award could be reduced by $20 million because Zunum failed to take action to mitigate the damage.</p><p>Taking all those amounts into consideration, U.S. District Judge James Robart&nbsp;could award Zunum a total of either $72 million or $235 million depending on his decision over tripling the basic damages.</p><h2>A Silicon Valley-style startup</h2><p>In 2017, Zunum, founded by Ashish Kumar and Matt Knapp, had <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/zunum-brings-silicon-valley-startup-style-to-electric-airplane-concept/">won funding from both Boeing and the state of Washington</a> for an ambitious plan to design and build a nine-seat hybrid-electric plane for city-to-city short-hop flights. </p><p>At its height, Zunum employed about 35 full-time employees at its Bothell headquarters, an additional 20 at Zunum’s electrical power facility in Elgin, Ill., near Chicago, and about 15 in Indianapolis, developing the plane’s ducted-fan propulsion system&nbsp;in a partnership with Purdue University. </p><p>But Zunum overpromised and failed to deliver. It never produced an airplane. It <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/local-electric-airplane-startup-zunum-runs-out-of-cash/">ran out of cash and collapsed in 2019</a>. </p>
<p>By then it had spent about $282,000 of a state grant and another $1.3 million from&nbsp;two investors: <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-launches-venture-capital-arm-invests-in-local-electric-airplane-firm/">Boeing’s Horizon X&nbsp;venture-capital division</a>&nbsp;and a venture-capital unit of New York-based airline JetBlue Airways.</p><p>In its response to the lawsuit, Boeing’s lawyers wrote that the story of Zunum’s demise was simply that of a typical failed startup.</p><p>“An ambitious startup’s reach exceeded its grasp, and investors fled,” Boeing’s filing states. “What preliminarily looked like an interesting investment prospect that promised a new hybrid electric or electric aircraft turned into a loss for Boeing.”</p><p>Rather than developing its own hybrid-electric design, Boeing said it developed only a “conceptual mock-up — a tool that Boeing used to evaluate the feasibility of the type of aircraft that Zunum hoped to build.”</p><p>The conclusion it drew from that mock-up was that “electric aircraft likely would not be economically viable for commercial passenger flights anytime soon.”</p><p>Boeing said other potential Zunum investors drew the same conclusion. It characterized the lawsuit as “Zunum’s latest attempt to extract more money from Boeing.”</p><p>Boeing has not publicly announced any proposal for its own version of a small hybrid-electric airplane.</p><p>The jury having sided with Zunum, Judge Robart will now decide the precise damages award and then Boeing will appeal. </p><p>The final outcome could still be some years away.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often described as being instances of foundation models - that is, models that transfer strongly across various tasks and conditions in few-show or zero-shot manner, while exhibiting scaling laws that predict function improvement when increasing the pre-training scale. These claims of excelling in different functions and tasks rely on measurements taken across various sets of standardized benchmarks showing high scores for such models. We demonstrate here a dramatic breakdown of function and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art models trained at the largest available scales which claim strong function, using a simple, short, conventional common sense problem formulated in concise natural language, easily solvable by humans. The breakdown is dramatic, as models also express strong overconfidence in their wrong solutions, while providing often non-sensical "reasoning"-like explanations akin to confabulations to justify and backup the validity of their clearly failed responses, making them sound plausible. Various standard interventions in an attempt to get the right solution, like various type of enhanced prompting, or urging the models to reconsider the wrong solutions again by multi step re-evaluation, fail. We take these initial observations to the scientific and technological community to stimulate urgent re-assessment of the claimed capabilities of current generation of LLMs, Such re-assessment also requires common action to create standardized benchmarks that would allow proper detection of such basic reasoning deficits that obviously manage to remain undiscovered by current state-of-the-art evaluation procedures and benchmarks.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/05/agile_failure_rates/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/05/agile_failure_rates/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40584901">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A study has found that projects adopting Agile practices are 268 percent more likely to fail than those that do not.</p>
<p>Even though the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.engprax.com/post/268-higher-failure-rates-for-agile-software-projects-study-finds">research</a> commissioned by consultancy Engprax could be seen as a thinly veiled plug for Impact Engineering methodology, it feeds into the suspicion that the Agile Manifesto <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/01/08/erik_meijer_agile_is_a_cancer_we_have_to_eliminate_from_the_industry/">might not be all it's cracked up to be</a>.</p>
<p>The study's fieldwork was conducted between May 3 and May 7 with 600 software engineers (250 in the UK and 350 in the US) participating. One standout statistic was that projects with clear requirements documented before development started were 97 percent more likely to succeed. In comparison, one of the four pillars of the Agile Manifesto is "Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation."</p>

    

<p>According to the study, putting a specification in place before development begins can result in a 50 percent increase in success, and making sure the requirements are accurate to the real-world problem can lead to a 57 percent increase.</p>

        


        

<p>Dr Junade Ali, author of Impact Engineering, said: "With 65 percent of projects adopting Agile practices failing to be delivered on time, it's time to question Agile's cult following.</p>
<p>"Our research has shown that what matters when it comes to delivering high-quality software on time and within budget is a robust requirements engineering process and having the psychological safety to discuss and solve problems when they emerge, whilst taking steps to prevent developer burnout."</p>

        

<p>The Agile Manifesto has been criticized over the years. The infamous UK Post Office Horizon IT system was an early large-scale project to use the methodology, although blaming an Agile approach for the system's design flaws seems a bit of a stretch.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/14/uk_developer_burnout/">Report: 83% of UK software engineers suffer burnout, COVID-19 made it worse</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/17/twilio_jeff_lawson_on_developers/">'Business folk often don't understand what developers do...' Twilio boss on the chasm that holds companies back</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/01/ibm_global_tech_services_uk_layoffs/">IBM warns Global Tech Services staff that 346 UK heads will roll in latest redundancy action</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/01/08/erik_meijer_agile_is_a_cancer_we_have_to_eliminate_from_the_industry/">Erik Meijer: AGILE must be destroyed, once and for all</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is also easy to forget that other methodologies have their own flaws. Waterfall, for example, uses a succession of documented phases, of which coding is only a part. While simple to understand and manage, Waterfall can also be slow and costly, with changes challenging to implement.</p>
<p>Hence, there is a tendency for teams to look for alternatives.</p>
<p>Projects where engineers felt they had the freedom to discuss and address problems were 87 percent more likely to succeed. Worryingly, workers in the UK were 13 percent less likely to feel they could discuss problems than those in the US, according to the study.</p>
<p>Many sins of today's tech world tend to be attributed to the Agile Manifesto. A neverending stream of patches indicates that quality might not be what it once was, and code turning up in an unfinished or ill-considered state have all been attributed to Agile practices.</p>

        

<p>One Agile developer criticized the daily stand-up element, describing it to <i>The Register</i> as "a feast of regurgitation."</p>
<p>However, while the Agile Manifesto might have its problems, those stem more from its implementation rather than the principles themselves. "We don't need a test team because we're Agile" is a cost-saving abdication of responsibility.</p>
<p>In highlighting the need to understand the requirements before development begins, the research charts a path between Agile purists and Waterfall advocates. ®</p>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/bartender/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bartender</a> is a popular Mac app that lets users customize and add new functions to the macOS Menu Bar. However, the app was recently acquired by new and unknown developers without disclosure, which raised concerns among current Bartender users.</p>



<h2 id="h-bartender-users-skeptical-of-new-app-owners">Bartender users skeptical of new app owners</h2>



<p>As shared in an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1d7zjv8/bartender_5_not_safe_anymore_warning_from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive Reddit thread</a>, many users only became aware that Bartender had been sold to another developer after MacUpdater sent out an alert about the update to version 5.0.52. </p>



<p>“MacUpdater Upgrade Explanation: The company and developer behind Bartender was replaced in a silent and dubious manner – updates to version 5.0.52 and newer are your own risk and responsibility,” the alert reads. Users were worried since the app’s creator hasn’t said a word about the acquisition, not even the new developer.</p>



<p>Following the repercussions, a Reddit user identified as “Ordinary_Delivery_79” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1d7zjv8/comment/l73h9gv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a comment</a> representing the “new owners of Bartender.” According to the user, the app was acquired from the original developer two months ago, and now the team is working on updating the app’s certificates to re-sign it with Apple.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, we should have notated it on the release notes but, since we could not update them retroactively, we included this fact on our blog &amp; shared it with users as they emailed us. We’ve collaborated closely with Ben to understand his vision for Bartender. Our goal is to implement many of the improvements he had planned and address any reported bugs from the past few months to enhance Bartender’s performance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even so, it still seems a bit suspicious that the new developers only introduced themselves after all the controversy. Some users said they didn’t trust the app’s new owners and uninstalled it. <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bartender’s official website</a> has no mention of the acquisition.</p>



<p>Future plans for the app remain unknown, but users have a right to know what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Despite originating in science fiction, warp drives have a concrete description in general relativity, with Alcubierre first proposing a spacetime metric that supported faster-than-light travel. Whilst there are numerous practical barriers to their implementation in real life, including a requirement for negative energy, computationally, one can simulate their evolution in time given an equation of state describing the matter. In this work, we study the signatures arising from a warp drive "containment failure", assuming a stiff equation of state for the fluid. We compute the emitted gravitational-wave signal and track the energy fluxes of the fluid. Apart from its rather speculative application to the search for extraterrestrial life in gravitational-wave detector data, this work is interesting as a study of the dynamical evolution and stability of spacetimes that violate the null energy condition. Our work highlights the importance of exploring strange new spacetimes, to (boldly) simulate what no one has seen before.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>A new report on old privacy incidents suggests that at least one Nintendo leak came from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/google/" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/google/">Google</a> employee showing off private <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/youtube/" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/youtube/">YouTube</a> videos to a friend.</p><p>The leak in question dates back to 2017, when images of a trailer for the then-untitled Yoshi's Crafted World hit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6gyd01/a_new_yoshi_game_probably_woolly_world_2_is_going/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6gyd01/a_new_yoshi_game_probably_woolly_world_2_is_going/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Reddit</a> shortly before the game's official reveal. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6gyd01/a_new_yoshi_game_probably_woolly_world_2_is_going/diu29u7/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6gyd01/a_new_yoshi_game_probably_woolly_world_2_is_going/diu29u7/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">comments</a>, the poster of that thread said "My friend work at google and he send this photo to me. It's a video that it's already in Nintendo channel and is going to be in public after the reveal." The image included an 'admin.youtube.com' URL, which certainly suggested that this particular call was coming from inside the house.</p><p>Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/google-contractor-used-admin-access-to-leak-private-nintendo-youtube-video/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.404media.co/google-contractor-used-admin-access-to-leak-private-nintendo-youtube-video/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">404 Media</a> has published a breakdown of several privacy incidents at Google based on internal reports at the company, including this one. The employee, apparently a former temporary contractor, was able to "download video with admin account, and shared unreleased Nintendo feature with friend," Google's internal report concluded. "GI interview concluded non-intentional. Reactive comm sent."</p><p>The community has long suspected that many notable leakers get their information from sources like unpublished YouTube videos, and this report would appear to confirm that - at least in this instance. Judging by the admin URL in the leak screenshot, I'd wager this particular leaker had no intentions of this image being widely spread. But then, you'd also hope that your friends are cautious enough to keep you shielded from Nintendo's ire, too.</p><p>Industry analyst Daniel Ahmad <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1797629349199483261" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1797629349199483261" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">says</a> he's "heard this is how a number of game leakers operate today still," but some of those leakers are quick to suggest they've got other sources. Prolific Nintendo leaker Pyoro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1797640723803803702" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1797640723803803702" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">says</a> they've provided info that couldn't be pulled from YouTube, for example. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/summer-game-fest-schedule-2024/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/summer-game-fest-schedule-2024/">Summer Game Fest schedule for 2024</a> coming up in hurry, there's certain to be a lot of interest in leakers and where their information is coming from over the next few days.</p><p>As for Google, though, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">404 Media</a> is reporting on some much more serious privacy breaches than leaked video game announcements. The report notes incidents between 2013 and 2018 where Google Street View transcribed and stored license plate information, where a Google speech service logged an "estimated 1K child speech utterances," and where subsidiary Waze leaked the trips and home addresses of users of its carpool app.</p><p>These reports, again, come from Google's internal review process, and the company says in a statement that "every one was reviewed and resolved at that time. In some cases, these employee flags turned out not to be issues at all or were issues that employees found in third party services."</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cJopebsdnmbDw25H8RHyfZ"><section><p>Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more</p></section></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/games-of-summer-game-fest-2024-publisher-predictions/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/games-of-summer-game-fest-2024-publisher-predictions/"><em>Predicting the games of Summer Game Fest 2024</em></a><em> is a lot easier when it's all leaking.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Members of the Legendary Computer Bugs Tribunal, honored guests, if I may have your attention? I would, humbly, submit a new contender for your esteemed judgment. You may or may not find it novel, you may even deign to call it a "bug," but I assure you, you will find it entertaining.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://www.nethack.org/"><em>NetHack</em></a>. It is one of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/ascii-art-permadeath-the-history-of-roguelike-games/">the all-time roguelike</a> games, and I mean that in the more strict sense of that term. The content is procedurally generated, deaths are permanent, and the only thing you keep from game to game is your skill and knowledge. I do understand that the only thing two roguelike fans can agree on is how wrong the third roguelike fan is in their definition of roguelike, but, please, let us move on.</p>
<h2><em>NetHack</em> is great for machine learning…</h2>
<p>Being a difficult game full of consequential choices and random challenges, as well as a "single-agent" game that can be generated and played at lightning speed on modern computers, <em>NetHack</em> is great for those working in machine learning—or <a href="https://underactuated.mit.edu/imitation.html">imitation learning</a>, actually, as detailed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09423">Jens Tuyls' paper</a> on how compute scaling affects single-agent game learning. Using Tuyls' model of expert <em>NetHack</em> behavior, Bartłomiej Cupiał and Maciej Wołczyk trained a neural network to play and improve itself using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>.
</p><p>By mid-May of this year, the two had their model consistently scoring 5,000 points by their own metrics. Then, on one run, the model suddenly got worse, on the order of 40 percent. It scored 3,000 points. Machine learning generally, gradually, goes in one direction with these types of problems. It didn't make sense.</p>
<p>Cupiał and Wołczyk tried quite a few things: reverting their code, restoring their entire software stack from a Singularity backup, and rolling back their <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">CUDA</a> libraries. The result? 3,000 points. They rebuild everything from scratch, and it's still 3,000 points.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><img alt="<em>NetHack</em>, played by a regular human." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/13863751533_64654db44e_o.png" width="821" height="506"><figcaption><p><em>NetHack</em>, played by a regular human.</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>… except on certain nights</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/cupiabart/status/1793930355617259811?s=46">detailed</a> in Cupiał's X (formerly Twitter) thread, this was several hours of confused trial and error by him and Wołczyk. "<span>I am starting to feel like a madman. I can't even watch a TV show constantly thinking about the bug," Cupiał wrote. In desperation, he asks model author Tuyls if he knows what could be wrong. He wakes up in Kraków to an answer:</span></p>
<p><span>"Oh yes, it's probably a full moon today."</span></p>
<p>In <em>NetHack</em>, the game in which the DevTeam has <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/The_DevTeam_Thinks_of_Everything">thought of everything</a>, if the game detects from your system clock that it should be a full moon, it will generate a message: "You are lucky! Full moon tonight." A full moon imparts <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Time">a few player benefits</a>: a single point added to Luck, and werecreatures mostly kept to their animal forms.</p>
<p>It's an easier game, all things considered, so why would the learning agent's score be lower? It simply doesn't have data about full moon variables in its training data, so a branching series of decisions likely leads to lesser outcomes, or just confusion. It was indeed a full moon in <span>Kraków</span> when the 3,000-ish scores started showing up. What a terrible night to have a learning model.</p>
<p>Of course, "score" is not a real metric for success in <em>NetHack</em>, as <a href="https://x.com/CupiaBart/status/1794614271281905955">Cupiał himself noted</a>. Ask a model to get the best score, and it will farm the heck out of early-stage monsters because it never gets bored. "<span>Finding items required for [ascension] or even [just] doing a quest is too much for pure RL agent," Cupiał wrote. Another neural network, <a href="https://github.com/maciej-sypetkowski/autoascend">AutoAscend</a>, does a better job of progressing through the game, but "even it can only solve sokoban and reach mines end," Cupiał <a href="https://x.com/CupiaBart/status/1794440727117668776">notes</a>.</span></p>
<h2>Is it a bug?</h2>
<p>I submit to you that, although <em>NetHack</em> responded to the full moon in its intended way, this quirky, very hard-to-fathom stop on a machine-learning journey was indeed a bug and a worthy one in the pantheon. It's not <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/worlds-first-computer-bug/">a Harvard moth</a>, nor a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jemorris/humor/500-miles">500-mile email</a>, but what is?</p>
<p>Because the team used <a href="https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html">Singularity</a> to back up and restore their stack, they inadvertently carried forward the machine time and resulting bug each time they tried to solve it. The machine's resulting behavior was so bizarre, and seemingly based on unseen forces, that it drove a coder into fits. And the story has a beginning, a climactic middle, and a denouement that teaches us something, however obscure.</p>
<p>The <em>NetHack</em> Lunar Learning Bug is, I submit, quite worth memorializing. Thank you for your time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Maps is sunsetting web access for its Timeline feature that allows users to view their location history.</li>
<li>The company is switching to an on-device approach that is more private and works on each phone independently.</li>
<li>After transitioning, users will be able to back up and restore their Timeline data to avoid losing it when switching devices.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>For years, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/current-location-google-maps-3100375/">Google Maps</a> has allowed users to track the locations they visit using its Timeline feature. The option works in the background and keeps track of users’ movement at all times. Those who opted in can view their location history on the web and in the Google Maps app. To keep users’ sensitive location data more private and secure, Google Maps will sunset web access for its Timeline feature in the coming months.</p><p>As per an <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-timeline-location-data-on-device-migration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Android Police</em></a> report, Google Maps has started emailing users about changes coming to the <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/14169818?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;oco=1#zippy=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timeline feature</a>. The company plans to sunset web access and switch to a more private, on-device approach. This would make Google Maps’ Timeline data unique to each connected phone — as the migration would deactivate the universal sync mechanism.</p><p>Once your account is ready to transition, Google Maps should alert you via email and a push notification. Through a dedicated button on the updated app, you’ll then be able to migrate your existing location history to the on-device database. If you take no action and miss the deadline, Google could purge some or all of your location history when it sunsets Timeline’s web access.</p><p>To help users retain their data in the long run, Google Maps has also introduced a new backup feature for Timeline. Users can rely on it to save encrypted copies of their location history on Google’s servers. They can then restore these backups in the Google Maps app when they switch to a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-phones-568001/">new phone</a>.</p><p>It’s currently unclear when Google Maps will completely kill Timeline’s web access. The company is seemingly assigning users different deadlines, with one being on December 1, 2024. Worry not, though, as Google won’t wipe your location history before alerting you in advance. So, if you haven’t been notified by the company yet, you can continue using the feature normally until further notice.</p><p><strong>Got a tip?

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration approved the commercial launch license for the fourth test flight of SpaceX's Starship rocket Tuesday, with liftoff from South Texas targeted for just after sunrise Thursday.</p>
<p>"The FAA has approved a license authorization for SpaceX Starship Flight 4," the agency said in a statement. "SpaceX met all safety and other licensing requirements for this test flight."</p>
<p>Shortly after the FAA announced the launch license, SpaceX confirmed plans to launch the fourth test flight of the world's largest rocket at 7:00 am CDT (12:00 UTC) Thursday. The launch window runs for two hours.</p>
<p>This flight follows three prior demonstration missions, each progressively more successful, of SpaceX's privately developed mega-rocket. The last time Starship flew—on March 14—it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/03/after-its-third-test-flight-spacexs-starship-could-soon-carry-satellites/">completed an eight-and-a-half minute climb into space</a>, but the ship was unable to maneuver itself as it coasted nearly 150 miles (250 km) above Earth. This <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/05/spacex-sets-next-starship-flight-date-will-focus-on-propulsion-and-landing/">controllability problem caused the rocket to break apart</a> during reentry.</p>
<p>On Thursday's flight, SpaceX officials will expect the ascent portion of the test flight to be similarly successful to the launch in March. The objectives this time will be to demonstrate Starship's ability to survive the most extreme heating of reentry, when temperatures peak at 2,600° Fahrenheit (1,430° Celsius) as the vehicle plunges into the atmosphere at more than 20 times the speed of sound.</p>
<p>SpaceX officials also hope to see the Super Heavy booster guide itself toward a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico just offshore from the company's launch site, known as Starbase, in Cameron County, Texas.</p>
<p>"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy," SpaceX wrote in an overview of the mission.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Last month, SpaceX completed a "wet dress rehearsal" at Starbase, where the launch team fully loaded the rocket with cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen propellants. Before the practice countdown, SpaceX test-fired the booster and ship at the launch site. More recently, technicians installed components of the rocket's self-destruct system, which would activate to blow up the rocket if it flies off course.</p>
<p>Then, on Tuesday, SpaceX lowered the Starship upper stage from the top of the Super Heavy booster, presumably to perform final touch-ups to the ship's heat shield, composed of 18,000 hexagonal ceramic tiles to protect its stainless-steel structure during reentry. Ground teams were expected to raise the ship, or upper stage, back on top of the booster sometime Wednesday, returning the rocket to its full height of 397 feet (121 meters) ahead of Thursday morning's launch window.</p>
<h2>The tick-tock of Starship’s fourth flight</h2>
<p>If all goes according to plan, SpaceX's launch team will start loading 10 million pounds of super-cold propellants into the rocket around 49 minutes before liftoff Thursday. The methane and liquid oxygen will first flow into the smaller tanks on the ship, then into the larger tanks on the booster.</p>
<p>The rocket should be fully loaded about three minutes prior to launch, and, following a sequence of automated checks, the computer controlling the countdown will give the command to light the booster's 33 Raptor engines. Three seconds later, the rocket will begin its vertical climb off the launch mount, with its engines capable of producing more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full power.</p>
<p>Heading east from the Texas Gulf Coast, the rocket will exceed the speed of sound in about a minute, then begin shutting down its 33 main engines around 2 minutes and 41 seconds after liftoff. Then, just as the Super Heavy booster jettisons to begin a descent back to Earth, Starship's six Raptor engines will ignite to continue pushing the upper portion of the rocket into space. Starship's engines are expected to burn until T+ 8 minutes, 23 seconds, accelerating the rocket to near-orbital velocity with enough energy to fly an arcing trajectory halfway around the world to the Indian Ocean.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>All of this will be similar to the events of the last Starship launch in March. What differs in the flight plan this time involves the attempts to steer the booster and ship back to Earth. This is important to lay the groundwork for future flights, when SpaceX wants to bring the Super Heavy booster—the size of the fuselage of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet—to a landing back at its launch pad. Eventually, SpaceX also intends to recover reusable Starships back at Starbase or other spaceports.</p>

<p>Based on the results of the March test flight, SpaceX still has a lot to prove in these areas. On that flight, the engines on the Super Heavy booster could not complete all the burns required to guide the rocket toward the splashdown zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The booster lost control as it plummeted toward the ocean.</p>
<p>Engineers traced the failure to blockage in a filter where liquid oxygen flows into the Raptor engines. Notably, a similar problem occurred on the second Starship test flight last November. The Super Heavy booster awaiting launch Thursday has additional hardware to improve propellant filtration capabilities, according to SpaceX. The company also implemented "operational changes" on the booster for the upcoming test flight, including to jettison the Super Heavy's staging ring, which sits between the booster and ship during launch, to reduce the rocket's mass during descent.</p>
<p>SpaceX has a lot of experience bringing back its fleet of Falcon 9 boosters. The company now boasts a streak of more than 240 successful rocket landings in a row, so it's reasonable to expect SpaceX will overcome the challenge of recovering the larger Super Heavy booster.</p>

<p>GitHub is ecstatic to unveil Arm<sup>Ⓡ</sup>-based Linux and Windows runners for GitHub Actions. This new addition to our suite of hosted runners provides power, performance and sustainability improvements for all your GitHub Actions jobs. Developers can now take advantage of Arm-based hardware hosted by GitHub to build and deploy their release assets anywhere Arm architecture is used. Best of all, these runners are priced at 37% less than our x64 Linux and Windows runners.</p>
<p>Customers are refactoring their applications to take advantage of the price and performance benefits of Arm architecture. These new runners provide power, performance, and sustainability improvements for all your GitHub Actions jobs and are designed to efficiently run large cloud-native workloads. Developers in every industry—from gaming to embedded mobile development—are able to take advantage of the performance these new runners offer.</p>
<p>These runners are fully managed by GitHub with an image built by Arm containing all the tools needed for developers to get started. They offer a power-efficient compute layer that can increase price-to-performance ratios, allowing customers to optimize compute costs to get more done within existing budgets while also reducing their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Previously, developers building on Arm within GitHub have had to self-host or utilize QEMU virtualization which is slower than running natively. Customers can now build, test, and deploy their web and application servers, open-source databases, containers, microservices, Java and .NET applications, AI applications, gaming, or media servers on the Arm architecture, bringing their entire CI/CD workflow onto one platform while also benefiting from the scale and speed gained from using GitHub-hosted runners.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We leveraged Arm runners to very quickly set up a workflow to build a Linux Arm64 binary for our open source Rust project, Spice.ai OSS, and it’s been rock-solid–we haven’t had any issues with it since we set it up. We’ve saved 2-3 days of engineering effort up front to set up our own runners, plus about 1-2 hours per week to maintain them ourselves.</p></blockquote><figcaption> - Phillip LeBlanc // Founder and CTO, Spice AI</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="github-and-arm-a-new-class-of-image">GitHub and Arm: A new class of image<a href="#github-and-arm-a-new-class-of-image" aria-label="GitHub and Arm: A new class of image"></a></h2>
<p>GitHub has partnered with Arm to provide the Ubuntu and Windows VM images for these runners, ensuring our customers can seamlessly start building on Arm. The Ubuntu 22.04 image is equipped with a full set of tools to jumpstart developers quickly on Arm runners and begin deploying Arm release assets as soon as possible, with plans to add developer tools to the Windows image and a new Ubuntu 24.04 image.</p>
<p>GitHub is excited to present these partner images to our customers. We are committed to partnering with the best technology providers on the market to provide a wide range of images for our customers to build on. These partnerships are focused on providing a best-in-class experience that can be leveraged across industries. We began this with our GPU runners, launched in April, by offering an image built by NVIDIA aimed at companies wanting to incorporate their MLOps practices into GitHub Actions. As we expand our GitHub-hosted runner fleet, we will continue to expand image options in parallel through close partnerships with industry-leading technology providers.</p>
<p>“Our longstanding partnership with GitHub is rooted in empowering shift-left software development and accelerating time to market while improving sustainability,” said Bhumik Patel, Director of Software Ecosystem Development, Infrastructure Line of Business at Arm. “The availability of Arm-hosted runners marks an important step toward more sustainable computing by enabling software developers with advanced CI/CD capabilities to develop the power-efficient and versatile Arm architecture for projects, from data centers and cloud to automotive, IoT, and much more.”</p>

<h2 id="sustainability-on-github-actions">Sustainability on GitHub Actions<a href="#sustainability-on-github-actions" aria-label="Sustainability on GitHub Actions"></a></h2>
<p>GitHub is committed to sustainability, and to helping customers on their journey to reduce their own carbon emissions. By using these new Arm-hosted runners, customers can lower their carbon footprint by running on machines that are proven to be more power efficient. Arm-based servers in the cloud have been shown to use 30-40% less power output for some of the most widely deployed workloads. [<a href="https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/insights/focus/will-java-run-more-sustainably-on-arms-architecture#:~:text=The%20higher%20power%20efficiency%20of,critical%20reporting%20metrics%20for%20corporations">Source</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2023/03/01/ampere-is-driving-sustainability-using-the-right-metricpower-at-the-rack/?sh=41e3613e2ed9">source</a>]</p>
<p>Arm technology has been shown to reduce heat generation and lower power consumption in data centers. To help understand your own impact, you can <a href="https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/eco-ci-energy-estimation">use this tool</a> to measure the energy consumption of each of your GitHub Actions workflow runs.</p>
<h2 id="get-started-using-arm-hosted-runners-today">Get started using Arm-hosted runners today!<a href="#get-started-using-arm-hosted-runners-today" aria-label="Get started using Arm-hosted runners today!"></a></h2>
<p>These runners are available to our customers on our GitHub Team and Enterprise Cloud plans. We expect to begin offering Arm runners for open source projects by the end of the year. Customers can begin using these runners today by creating an Arm runner in their organization/enterprise, and then updating the <code>runs-on</code> syntax in their GitHub Actions workflow file to call that runner name.
