<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p><strong><a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-diffusion/">Gemini Diffusion</a></strong>. Another of the announcements from Google I/O yesterday was Gemini Diffusion, Google's first LLM to use diffusion (similar to image models like Imagen and Stable Diffusion) in place of transformers.</p>
<p>Google describe it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional autoregressive language models generate text one word – or token – at a time. This sequential process can be slow, and limit the quality and coherence of the output.</p>
<p>Diffusion models work differently. Instead of predicting text directly, they learn to generate outputs by refining noise, step-by-step. This means they can iterate on a solution very quickly and error correct during the generation process. This helps them excel at tasks like editing, including in the context of math and code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key feature then is <em>speed</em>. I made it through the waitlist and tried it out just now and <em>wow</em>, they are not kidding about it being fast.</p>
<p>In this video I prompt it with "Build a simulated chat app" and it responds at 857 tokens/second, resulting in an interactive HTML+JavaScript page (embedded in the chat tool, Claude Artifacts style) within single digit seconds.</p>


<p>The performance feels similar to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/31/cerebras-coder/">the Cerebras Coder tool</a>, which used Cerebras to run Llama3.1-70b at around 2,000 tokens/second.</p>
<p>How good is the model? I've not seen any independent benchmarks yet, but Google's landing page for it promises "the performance of Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite at 5x the speed" so presumably they think it's comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, one of their least expensive models.</p>
<p>Prior to this the only commercial grade diffusion model I've encountered is <a href="https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/introducing-mercury">Inception Mercury</a> back in February this year.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: a correction from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44057820#44057939">synapsomorphy on Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diffusion isn't in place of transformers, it's in place of autoregression. Prior diffusion LLMs like <a href="https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/introducing-mercury">Mercury</a> still use a transformer, but there's no causal masking, so the entire input is processed all at once and the output generation is obviously different. I very strongly suspect this is also using a transformer.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
  

  <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>i went to a show in november of last year (it’s may right now) and ever since, i have tinnitus. i don’t recommend it.</p>

<p>i’ve been going to electronic music shows for a while and had been very careless with my ears - because it felt like i would always be okay. after the show, especially in the morning, you’d have the next-day tinnitus, but then it would go away.</p>

<p>of course, this one never went away. was i closer to the speakers that time, was the music louder, was it something about the frequencies. was it all of the accumulated careless listening.</p>

<p>i’ll say three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>if you attended a show at a venue that had cool lights, but it turned out that some people lost their sight because of the cool lasers there, the venue would be shut down, there would be an investigation, there would be lawsuits, etc.</p>

    <p>however, if you go to a venue today and the sound is so loud that people become permanently disabled because of that… as far as i know, nothing happens. why?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>i’ve been weirdly lucky in that - in addition to the tinnitus - it now physically hurts when there’s a loud sound. loud sounds didn’t use to hurt - so now, i am one of those people that plugs their ears when an emergency vehicle goes by with the siren blaring. plugging ears used to feel ridiculous to me (like, come on, it’s just a siren), but now it hurts and i get it.</p>

    <p>so there’s a blessing there of course (i <em>feel</em> when a sound is “too” loud), but i still wish i didn’t have tinnitus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some of my argentian friends and i joke about my very “dad” ways around them (it’s a love language, what do you want from me): i remind them to wear their helmets, and i myself have started to wear a reflective vest (in addition to a helmet) when biking. they call this “seguridad” which is both spanish for security and has “dad” at the end which is very funny. it’s a good nickname.</p>

    <p>so yeah, just to be that seguridad on you - do wear something in your ears when going to shows. do ride with a helmet. and absolutely don’t fuck around with lasers, especially the stupid green ones that people wave around. might as well wave an ak-47 around.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>it is frighteningly easy to permanently injure yourself and become disabled. and it will leave you with sadness and regret and you will keep wondering - was it inevitable. you might as well protect yourself.</p>

    <p><span>O</span>ne July afternoon in 2024, <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/">Ryan Williams</a> set out to prove himself wrong. Two months had passed since he’d hit upon a startling discovery about the relationship between time and memory in computing. It was a rough sketch of a mathematical proof that memory was more powerful than computer scientists believed: A small amount would be as helpful as a lot of time in all conceivable computations. That sounded so improbable that he assumed something had to be wrong, and he promptly set the proof aside to focus on less crazy ideas. Now, he’d finally carved out time to find the error.</p>
<p>That’s not what happened. After hours of poring over his argument, Williams couldn’t find a single flaw.</p>
<p>“I just thought I was losing my mind,” said Williams, a theoretical computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For the first time, he began to entertain the possibility that maybe, just maybe, memory really was as powerful as his work suggested.</p>
<p>Over the months that followed, he fleshed out the details, scrutinized every step, and solicited feedback from a handful of other researchers. In February, he finally <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17779">posted his proof online</a>, to widespread acclaim.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing. It’s beautiful,” said <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/home">Avi Wigderson</a>, a theoretical computer scientist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. As soon as he heard the news, Wigderson sent Williams a congratulatory email. Its subject line: “You blew my mind.”</p>
<p>Time and memory (also called space) are the two most fundamental resources in computation: Every algorithm takes some time to run, and requires some space to store data while it’s running. Until now, the only known algorithms for accomplishing certain tasks required an amount of space roughly proportional to their runtime, and researchers had long assumed there’s no way to do better. Williams’ proof established a mathematical procedure for transforming any algorithm — no matter what it does — into a form that uses much less space.</p>

    <p>What’s more, this result — a statement about what you can compute given a certain amount of space — also implies a second result, about what you cannot compute in a certain amount of time. This second result isn’t surprising in itself: Researchers expected it to be true, but they had no idea how to prove it. Williams’ solution, based on his sweeping first result, feels almost cartoonishly excessive, akin to proving a suspected murderer guilty by establishing an ironclad alibi for everyone else on the planet. It could also offer a new way to attack one of the oldest open problems in computer science.</p>
<p>“It’s a pretty stunning result, and a massive advance,” said <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/paul-beame/">Paul Beame</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Washington. “It’s a little bit less of a surprise that it’s Ryan doing this.”</p>
<h2><strong>Space to Roam</strong></h2>
<p>Williams, 46, has an open, expressive face and a hint of gray in his hair. His office, which looks out over the colorful spires of MIT’s Stata Center, is another illustration of the creative use of space. A pair of yoga mats have transformed a window ledge into a makeshift reading nook, and the desk is tucked into an oddly shaped corner, freeing up room for a couch facing a large whiteboard brimming with mathematical scribblings.</p>
<p>MIT is a long way from Williams’ childhood home in rural Alabama, where there was no shortage of space. He grew up on a 50-acre farm and first saw a computer at age 7, when his mother drove him across the county for a special academic enrichment class. He recalled being transfixed by a simple program for generating a digital fireworks display.</p>
<p>“It was taking a random color and sending it in a random direction from the middle of the monitor,” Williams said. “You couldn’t have predicted what picture you’re going to get.” The world of computers seemed a wild and wonderful playground, full of infinite possibilities. Young Williams was hooked.</p>
<p>“I was writing programs to myself, on paper, to be run on a future computer,” he said. “My parents didn’t really know what to do with me.”</p>

    <p>As he grew older, Williams advanced from imaginary computers to real ones. For his last two years of high school, he transferred to the Alabama School of Math and Science, a prestigious public boarding school, where he first encountered the theoretical side of computer science.</p>
<p>“I realized that there was a wider world of things out there, and that there was a way to think mathematically about computers,” he said. “That’s what I wanted to do.”</p>
<p>Williams was especially drawn to a branch of theoretical computer science called computational complexity theory. It deals with the resources (such as time and space) that are needed to solve computational problems such as sorting lists or factoring numbers. Most problems can be solved by many different algorithms, each with its own demands on time and space. Complexity theorists sort problems into categories, called complexity classes, based on the resource demands of the best algorithms for solving them — that is, the algorithms that run fastest or use the least amount of space.</p>
<p>But how do you make the study of computational resources mathematically rigorous? You won’t get far if you try to analyze time and space by comparing minutes to megabytes. To make any progress, you need to start with the right definitions.</p>
<h2><strong>Getting Resourceful</strong></h2>

<p>Those definitions emerged from the work of Juris Hartmanis, a pioneering computer scientist who had experience making do with limited resources. He was born in 1928 into a prominent Latvian family, but his childhood was disrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Occupying Soviet forces arrested and executed his father, and after the war Hartmanis finished high school in a refugee camp. He went on to university, where he excelled even though he couldn’t afford textbooks.</p>
<p>“I compensated by taking very detailed notes in lectures,” he recalled in a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1141880.1775727">2009 interview</a>. “There is a certain advantage to [having] to improvise and overcome difficulties.” Hartmanis immigrated to the United States in 1949, and worked a series of odd jobs — building agricultural machinery, manufacturing steel and even serving as a butler — while studying mathematics at the University of Kansas City. He went on to a spectacularly successful career in the young field of theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>In 1960, while working at the General Electric research laboratory in Schenectady, New York, Hartmanis met Richard Stearns, a graduate student doing a summer internship. In a pair of <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1965-117-00/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7/">groundbreaking</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5397244/">papers</a> they established precise mathematical definitions for time and space. These definitions gave researchers the language they needed to compare the two resources and sort problems into complexity classes.</p>

    <p>One of the most important classes goes by the humble name “P.” Roughly speaking, it encompasses all problems that can be solved in a reasonable amount of time. An analogous complexity class for space is dubbed “PSPACE.”</p>
<p>The relationship between these two classes is one of the central questions of complexity theory. Every problem in P is also in PSPACE, because fast algorithms just don’t have enough time to fill up much space in a computer’s memory. If the reverse statement were also true, the two classes would be equivalent: Space and time would have comparable computational power. But complexity theorists suspect that PSPACE is a much larger class, containing many problems that aren’t in P. In other words, they believe that space is a far more powerful computational resource than time. This belief stems from the fact that algorithms can use the same small chunk of memory over and over, while time isn’t as forgiving — once it passes, you can’t get it back.</p>
<p>“The intuition is just so simple,” Williams said. “You can reuse space, but you can’t reuse time.”</p>
<p>But intuition isn’t good enough for complexity theorists: They want rigorous proof. To prove that PSPACE is larger than P, researchers would have to show that for some problems in PSPACE, fast algorithms are categorically impossible. Where would they even start?</p>
<h2><strong>A Space Odyssey</strong></h2>
<p>As it happened, they started at Cornell University, where Hartmanis moved in 1965 to head the newly established computer science department. Under his leadership it quickly became a center of research in complexity theory, and in the early 1970s, a pair of researchers there, John Hopcroft and Wolfgang Paul, set out to establish a precise link between time and space.</p>

<p>Hopcroft and Paul knew that to resolve the P versus PSPACE problem, they’d have to prove that you can’t do certain computations in a limited amount of time. But it’s hard to prove a negative. Instead, they decided to flip the problem on its head and explore what you can do with limited space. They hoped to prove that algorithms given a certain space budget can solve all the same problems as algorithms with a slightly larger time budget. That would indicate that space is at least slightly more powerful than time — a small but necessary step toward showing that PSPACE is larger than P.</p>
<p>With that goal in mind, they turned to a method that complexity theorists call simulation, which involves transforming existing algorithms into new ones that solve the same problems, but with different amounts of space and time. To understand the basic idea, imagine you’re given a fast algorithm for alphabetizing your bookshelf, but it requires you to lay out your books in dozens of small piles. You might prefer an approach that takes up less space in your apartment, even if it takes longer. A simulation is a mathematical procedure you could use to get a more suitable algorithm: Feed it the original, and it’ll give you a new algorithm that saves space at the expense of time.</p>
<p>Algorithm designers have long studied these space-time trade-offs for specific tasks like sorting. But to establish a general relationship between time and space, Hopcroft and Paul needed something more comprehensive: a space-saving simulation procedure that works for every algorithm, no matter what problem it solves. They expected this generality to come at a cost. A universal simulation can’t exploit the details of any specific problem, so it probably won’t save as much space as a specialized simulation. But when Hopcroft and Paul started their work, there were no known universal methods for saving space at all. Even saving a small amount would be progress.</p>
<p>The breakthrough came in 1975, after Hopcroft and Paul teamed up with a young researcher named <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~valiant/">Leslie Valiant</a>. The trio devised a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/322003.322015">universal simulation procedure</a> that always saves a bit of space. No matter what algorithm you give it, you’ll get an equivalent one whose space budget is slightly smaller than the original algorithm’s time budget.</p>
<p>“Anything you can do in so much time, you can also do in slightly less space,” Valiant said. It was the first major step in the quest to connect space and time.</p>

<p>But then progress stalled, and complexity theorists began to suspect that they’d hit a fundamental barrier. The problem was precisely the universal character of Hopcroft, Paul and Valiant’s simulation. While many problems can be solved with much less space than time, some intuitively seemed like they’d need nearly as much space as time. If so, more space-efficient universal simulations would be impossible. Paul and two other researchers soon proved that they are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800113.803643">indeed impossible</a>, provided you make one seemingly obvious assumption: Different chunks of data can’t occupy the same space in memory at the same time.</p>
<p>“Everybody took it for granted that you cannot do better,” Wigderson said.</p>
<p>Paul’s result suggested that resolving the P versus PSPACE problem would require abandoning simulation altogether in favor of a different approach, but nobody had any good ideas. That was where the problem stood for 50 years — until Williams finally broke the logjam.</p>
<p>First, he had to get through college.</p>
<h2><strong>Complexity Classes</strong></h2>
<p>In 1996, the time came for Williams to apply to colleges. He knew that pursuing complexity theory would take him far from home, but his parents made it clear that the West Coast and Canada were out of the question. Among his remaining options, Cornell stood out to him for its prominent place in the history of his favorite discipline.</p>
<p>“This guy Hartmanis defined the time and space complexity classes,” he recalled thinking. “That was important for me.”</p>
<p>Williams was admitted to Cornell with generous financial aid and arrived in the fall of 1997, planning to do whatever it took to become a complexity theorist himself. His single-mindedness stuck out to his fellow students.</p>
<p>“He was just super-duper into complexity theory,” said <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/scott-aaronson">Scott Aaronson</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Texas, Austin, who overlapped with Williams at Cornell.</p>

                            <p>Williams grew interested in the relationship between space and time as an undergraduate, but never found an opportunity to work on it until last year.</p>

    <p>But by sophomore year, Williams was struggling to keep up in courses that emphasized mathematical rigor over intuition. After he got a middling grade in a class on the theory of computing, the teacher suggested he consider other careers. But Williams wouldn’t give up his dream. He doubled down and enrolled in a graduate theory course, hoping that a stellar grade in the harder class would look impressive on his grad school applications. The professor teaching that graduate course was Hartmanis, by then an elder statesman in the field.</p>
<p>Williams began attending Hartmanis’ office hours every week, where he was almost always the only student who showed up. His tenacity paid off: he earned an A in the course, and Hartmanis agreed to advise him on an independent research project the following semester. Their weekly meetings continued throughout Williams’ time in college. Hartmanis encouraged him to cultivate an individual approach to complexity research and gently steered him away from dead ends.</p>
<p>“I was deeply influenced by him then,” Williams said. “I guess I still am now.”</p>

<p>But despite earning a coveted graduate research fellowship from the National Science Foundation, Williams was rejected by every doctoral program he applied to. On hearing the news, Hartmanis phoned a colleague, then turned around and congratulated Williams on getting accepted into a yearlong master’s program at Cornell. A year later Williams again applied to various doctoral programs, and with that extra research experience under his belt, he found success.</p>
<p>Williams continued working in complexity theory in grad school and the years that followed. In 2010, four years after receiving his doctorate, he proved a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5959801">milestone result</a> — a small step, but the largest in decades, toward solving the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/complexity-theorys-50-year-journey-to-the-limits-of-knowledge-20230817/">most famous question in theoretical computer science</a>, about the nature of hard problems. That result cemented Williams’ reputation, and he went on to write dozens of other papers on different topics in complexity theory.</p>
<p>P versus PSPACE wasn’t one of them. Williams had been fascinated by the problem since he first encountered it in college. He’d even supplemented his computer science curriculum with courses in logic and philosophy, seeking inspiration from other perspectives on time and space, to no avail.</p>
<p>“It’s always been in the back of my mind,” Williams said. “I just couldn’t think of anything interesting enough to say about it.”</p>
<p>Last year, he finally found the opportunity he’d been waiting for.</p>
<h2><strong>Squishy Pebbles</strong></h2>
<p>The story of Williams’ new result started with progress on a different question about memory in computation: What problems can be solved with extremely limited space? In 2010, the pioneering complexity theorist Stephen Cook and his collaborators invented a task, called the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2642">tree evaluation problem</a>, that they proved would be impossible for any algorithm with a space budget below a specific threshold. But there was a loophole. The proof relied on the same commonsense assumption that Paul and his colleagues had made decades earlier: Algorithms can’t store new data in space that’s already full.</p>
<p>For over a decade, complexity theorists tried to close that loophole. Then, in 2023, <a href="https://www.falsifian.org/">Cook’s son James</a> and a researcher named <a href="https://iuuk.mff.cuni.cz/~iwmertz/">Ian Mertz</a> blew it wide open, devising <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3618260.3649664">an algorithm</a> that solved the tree evaluation problem using <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/catalytic-computing-taps-the-full-power-of-a-full-hard-drive-20250218/">much less space</a> than anyone thought possible. The elder Cook’s proof had assumed that bits of data were like pebbles that have to occupy separate places in an algorithm’s memory. But it turns out that’s not the only way to store data. “We can actually think about these pebbles as things that we can squish a little bit on top of each other,” Beame said.</p>

    <p>Cook and Mertz’s algorithm roused the curiosity of many researchers, but it wasn’t clear that it had any applications beyond the tree evaluation problem. “Nobody saw how central it is to time versus space itself,” Wigderson said.</p>
<p>Ryan Williams was the exception. In spring 2024, a group of students gave a presentation about the Cook and Mertz paper as their final project in a class he was teaching. Their enthusiasm inspired him to take a closer look. As soon as he did, an idea jumped out at him. Cook and Mertz’s method, he realized, was really a general-purpose tool for reducing space usage. Why not use it to power a new universal simulation linking time and space — like the one designed by Hopcroft, Paul and Valiant, but better?</p>
<p>That classic result was a way to transform any algorithm with a given time budget into a new algorithm with a slightly smaller space budget. Williams saw that a simulation based on squishy pebbles would make the new algorithm’s space usage much smaller — roughly equal to the square root of the original algorithm’s time budget. That new space-efficient algorithm would also be much slower, so the simulation was not likely to have practical applications. But from a theoretical point of view, it was nothing short of revolutionary.</p>

<p>For 50 years, researchers had assumed it was impossible to improve Hopcroft, Paul and Valiant’s universal simulation. Williams’ idea — if it worked — wouldn’t just beat their record — it would demolish it.</p>
<p>“I thought about it, and I was like, ‘Well, that just simply can’t be true,’” Williams said. He set it aside and didn’t come back to it until that fateful day in July, when he tried to find the flaw in the argument and failed. After he realized that there was no flaw, he spent months writing and rewriting the proof to make it as clear as possible.</p>
<p>At the end of February, Williams finally <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17779">put the finished paper online</a>. Cook and Mertz were as surprised as everyone else. “I had to go take a long walk before doing anything else,” Mertz said.</p>
<p>Valiant got a sneak preview of Williams’ improvement on his decades-old result during his morning commute. For years, he’s taught at Harvard University, just down the road from Williams’ office at MIT. They’d met before, but they didn’t know they lived in the same neighborhood until they bumped into each other on the bus on a snowy February day, a few weeks before the result was public. Williams described his proof to the startled Valiant and promised to send along his paper.</p>
<p>“I was very, very impressed,” Valiant said. “If you get any mathematical result which is the best thing in 50 years, you must be doing something right.”</p>
<h2><strong>PSPACE: The Final Frontier</strong></h2>
<p>With his new simulation, Williams had proved a positive result about the computational power of space: Algorithms that use relatively little space can solve all problems that require a somewhat larger amount of time. Then, using just a few lines of math, he flipped that around and proved a negative result about the computational power of time: At least a few problems can’t be solved unless you use more time than space. That second, narrower result is in line with what researchers expected. The weird part is how Williams got there, by first proving a result that applies to all algorithms, no matter what problems they solve.</p>
<p>“I still have a hard time believing it,” Williams said. “It just seems too good to be true.”</p>

                            <p>Williams used Cook and Mertz’s technique to establish a stronger link between space and time — the first progress on that problem in 50 years.</p>

    <p>Phrased in qualitative terms, Williams’ second result may sound like the long-sought solution to the P versus PSPACE problem. The difference is a matter of scale. P and PSPACE are very broad complexity classes, while Williams’ results work at a finer level. He established a quantitative gap between the power of space and the power of time, and to prove that PSPACE is larger than P, researchers will have to make that gap much, much wider.</p>
<p>That’s a daunting challenge, akin to prying apart a sidewalk crack with a crowbar until it’s as wide as the Grand Canyon. But it might be possible to get there by using a modified version of Williams’ simulation procedure that repeats the key step many times, saving a bit of space each time. It’s like a way to repeatedly ratchet up the length of your crowbar — make it big enough, and you can pry open anything. That repeated improvement doesn’t work with the current version of the algorithm, but researchers don’t know whether that’s a fundamental limitation.</p>
        
        
<p>“It could be an ultimate bottleneck, or it could be a 50-year bottleneck,” Valiant said. “Or it could be something which maybe someone can solve next week.”</p>
<p>If the problem is solved next week, Williams will be kicking himself. Before he wrote the paper, he spent months trying and failing to extend his result. But even if such an extension is not possible, Williams is confident that more space exploration is bound to lead somewhere interesting — perhaps progress on an entirely different problem.</p>
<p>“I can never prove precisely the things that I want to prove,” he said. “But often, the thing I prove is way better than what I wanted.”</p>

<p><strong>Made of plastic and embossed with a melody, these <a href="http://www.thevinylfactory.com/vinyl-factory-news/listen-to-tiny-vinyl-record-postage-stamps-that-were-used-to-send-letters-in-1972/" target="_blank">tiny record stamps</a> are among the strangest, most enchanting bits of vinyl out there. Chris May investigates how the Buddhist Kingdom of Bhutan came to produce the world’s “first talking stamps”.</strong></p>
<p>Quite possibly the smallest vinyl records that can still be played with a stylus, those of you after a set will be happy to know the stamps still sporadically appear on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/BHUTAN-Talking-Stamps-Gramophone-Records-With-Folk-Songs-And-Folk-Tales-/121793379895?hash=item1c5b737e37:g:Co4AAOSwaNBUf71F" target="_blank">eBay</a>, with prices pushed up by that geekiest of venn diagrams between stamp and record collectors.</p>
<p>Listen to a haunting version of the Bhutanese national anthem, as recorded from a stamp, below.</p>

<hr>
<p>If you’re looking to make a smart investment in vinyl, among the most promising items to look out for right now are a set of Bhutanese talking-stamps. Issued in 1972 in a set of seven, the stamps are miniature, one-sided, 33 1⁄3 rpm vinyl records playable on a standard turntable. You peeled off the backing paper and stuck them on an envelope or postcard. Content includes Bhutanese folk songs and histories of the country in English and Dzongkha, the local language. </p>
<p>For decades, the stamps were dismissed by the philatelic establishment as tacky novelties and were, correspondingly, as cheap as chips. In 1993, when they were first listed in the collectors’ bible, Scott’s Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, a mint condition set was valued at around £17, the equivalent of £28 at 2015 prices. But following their recent discovery by collectors of rare vinyl, particularly in the US, you will be lucky to pick a set up for less than £300. Some observers predict the price will double, or even triple, over the next few years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://www.thevinylfactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bhutanrecord001.jpg" alt="Bhutanrecord001" width="465" height="514" srcset="https://thevinylfactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bhutanrecord001.jpg 465w, https://thevinylfactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bhutanrecord001-320x354.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px"></p>
<p>Bhutan’s talking stamps were the invention of the American adventurer Burt Todd, who was born into a wealthy Pittsburgh steel-producing dynasty in 1924. Appropriately, this was the same year F. Scott Fitzgerald completed <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, for the globe-trotting, airplane-piloting, big game-hunting Todd resembled the novel’s protagonist. Todd’s many other quixotic ventures included setting up a rum-making distillery for the government of Fiji, and buying the Rolls-Royces belonging to Indian maharajas who had been impoverished by the loss of British subsidies when the country gained independence, reselling them on the international classic-car market. </p>
<p>After wartime service in the US Army Air Corps and keen to avoid, or at least delay, joining the family business, Todd opted to enrol at Oxford University. Lacking the required  qualifications, he was told that the only person who could authorise his enrolment was in rural Norway on his honeymoon. Todd flew to Norway, tracked the man down and enrolled. He graduated in 1949 with a degree in law.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://www.thevinylfactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bhutan_stamps2sdfsdfdsf.jpg" alt="bhutan_stamps2sdfsdfdsf" width="465" height="310" srcset="https://thevinylfactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bhutan_stamps2sdfsdfdsf.jpg 465w, https://thevinylfactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bhutan_stamps2sdfsdfdsf-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px"></p>
<p>At Oxford, one of Todd’s friends was Ashi Kesang Choden-Dorfi, the future queen of Bhutan. In 1951, Choden-Dorfi invited Todd to Bhutan for her wedding to King Jigme Dorji-Wangchuck. There were no airfields in Bhutan, and few roads, and Todd had to travel much of the way from India on foot and horseback. His account of the journey appeared in the December 1952 issue of National Geographic magazine. Two years later, he honeymooned in Bhutan.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s, Dorji-Wangchuck asked Todd to help Bhutan raise a $10m loan from the World Bank. Todd went to Washington to lobby the bank, but the loan was refused: Bhutan was in a border dispute with its larger neighbour India, with whom the bank wanted to keep on good terms. But an official suggested Bhutan raised the money by issuing postage stamps, as had other small countries such as Monaco.</p>

<p>In 1960, with a royal warrant to set up Bhutan’s stamp-issuing programme, Todd founded the Bhutan Stamp Agency. His programme started out conventionally with designs featuring such exotica as the Bhutanese royal crest, a yak, a maharaja, a Himalayan fortress, a soldier from the royal bodyguard and a Buddhist monastery. The designs were pretty but lacked enough novelty to get noticed on the world stamp-collecting market. Todd realised that to sell large numbers of stamps he needed a more attention-gaining approach. </p>
<p>Todd’s first innovation, in 1966, was a circular stamp marking the 40th anniversary of Dorji-Wangchuk’s coronation, using a heraldic design embossed in gold on rainbow-coloured paper. It sold well. Next up was a series of triangular stamps featuring the yeti, the Himalayas’ fabled abominable-snowman. In 1967 came a set of 3D stamps on the theme of the space exploration; Todd’s stamps showing astronauts and rockets were laminated on prismatic ribbed-plastic and gave a convincing 3D effect. Over 200,000 sets were sold. Other successful issues included a set of Buddhist banners printed on silk, a set of traditional sculptures die-stamped in plastic, perfumed stamps and stamps made out of steel foil. </p>

<p>The talking stamps were the crowning glory of Todd’s programme. The set consisted of a yellow on red design containing a capsule history of Bhutan in Dzongkha, a gold on green with the national anthem, a silver on blue with the history of Bhutan narrated by Todd in English, a silver on purple featuring a folk song, a silver on black with second folk song, a red on white with a third, and a black on yellow containing the English-language history and two of the folk songs. </p>
<p>Todd passed in 2006, but his flair for innovative stamp designs ran in the family. Shortly before he died, his daughter Frances notched up another first with a series of CD-ROM stamps carrying documentary videos about Bhutan.</p>

    <p data-block-key="ysb9i">Google AI Studio apps and generated code leverage a unique placeholder API key, allowing Google AI Studio to proxy all Gemini API calls. Consequently, when you share your app with Google AI Studio, all API usage by its users is attributed to their Google AI Studio free of charge usage, completely bypassing your own API key and quota. You can read more in our <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apps?source=faq">FAQ</a>.</p><p data-block-key="de0nv">This feature is experimental, so you should always check code before sharing your project externally.

    <p><em>TL;DR: Giving LLMs the full output of tool calls is costly and slow. Output schemas will enable us to get structured data, so we can let the LLM orchestrate processing with generated code. Tool calling in code is simplifying and effective.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>One common practice for working with MCP tools calls is to put the outputs from a tool back into the LLM as a message, and ask the LLM for the next step. The hope here is that the model figures out how to interpret the data, and identify the correct next action to take.</p>
<p>This can work beautifully when the amount of data is small, but we found that when we tried MCP servers with real-world data, it quickly breaks down.</p>
<h3 id="mcp-in-the-real-world">MCP in the real-world</h3><p>We use Linear and Intercom at our company. We connected to their latest official MCP servers released last week to understand how they were returning tool calls.</p>
<p>It turns out that both servers returned large JSON blobs in their text content. These appeared to be similar to their APIs, with the exception that the text content did not come with any pre-defined schemas. This meant that the only reasonable way to parse them was to have the LLM interpret the data.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lutra-2407-public/42067e56d7b5238d3d7432718f1224679a1a449711a2e406295a3aeb98108e63.png" alt="Linear MCP returns list of issues as a big JSON blob"></p>
<p>These JSON blobs are huge! When we asked Linear's MCP to list issues in our project, the tool call defaulted to returning only 50 issues, ~70k characters corresponding to ~25k tokens.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lutra-2407-public/dda9436e83214ae28c73b19ca4fdc43d81f5c1613a45ada3160dc4aaa048f07d.png" alt="ID fields become lots of tokens"></p>
<p>The JSON contains lots of <code>id</code> fields that take up many tokens, and are not semantically meaningful.</p>
<p>When using Claude with MCPs, it seems that the entire JSON blob gets sent back to the model verbatim.</p>
<p>This approach quickly runs into issues. For example, if we wanted to get the AI to sort all the issues by due date and display them, it would need to reproduce all the issues verbatim as output tokens! It'd be slow, costly, and could potentially miss data.</p>
<p>The data in our issues also often contained a lot of distracting information: steps to reproduce an issue, errors, maybe even prompts a user used, or instructions to follow up with a user. The model could fail to emit some of these data accurately, or even worse, deviate from the original instructions.</p>
<h3 id="data-vs-orchestration">Data vs Orchestration</h3><p>The core problem here is that we're confounding orchestration and data processing together in the same chat thread.</p>
<p>The "multi-agent" approach tries to address this by spinning up another chat thread ("agent") to focus only on the data processing piece. It performs better when carefully tuned, but it's still awkward when our data is already well structured.</p>
<p>If the MCP servers are already returning data in a JSON format, it seems much more natural to parse the data, and instead operate on the structured data. Back to our sorting example, rather than asking the LLM to reproduce the outputs directly, we could instead run a <code>sort</code> operation on the data, and return the new array. No hallucinations and this scales to any size of inputs.</p>
<h3 id="code-execution-as-data-processing">Code execution as data processing</h3><p>This sounds oddly familiar as we already have code interpreters with AI. When we start to bring code execution as a fundamental way to process data from MCP tools (<a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/codeact">Code Act</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents">Smol Agents</a>), this opens the door to scalable ways for AI models to work.</p>
<p><strong>Variables as memory.</strong> Instead of having an external memory system, the LLM can use variables (system memory) to store any data. Storing a memory is assigning a value to a variable, peeking at the variable is printing it, and the model can choose to pass the variable as an argument when calling another function. Even better, if the language used is well-typed, the model also leverages the schema.</p>
<p><strong>Tool chaining.</strong> Code can orchestrate multiple function calls: performing them in parallel or taking the outputs from one or more calls and using them as inputs into another. The dependencies between the function calls are implicitly represented via the computation graph the code represents. Importantly, the LLM is not required to regurgitate the data, and we have guarantees of completeness.</p>
<p><strong>Scalable processing.</strong> Transforming large amounts of data is naturally possible with code. The model can choose to use loops, or lean on libraries such as NumPy or pandas for large data transformations.</p>
<p>Code can also call other LLMs under the hood: you can have the LLM write code that calls LLMs for unstructured data processing (LLM-inception).</p>
<h3 id="is-mcp-ready">Is MCP ready?</h3><p>MCP specs already define input schemas, and they’ve just introduced  <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/371">output schemas</a>.</p>
<p>Once output schemas are widespread, we expect them to unlock use cases on large datasets: building custom dashboards, creating weekly reports on tickets completed, or having the autonomous agents monitor and nudge stalled issues forward.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-code-execution-hard">What makes code execution hard?</h3><p>The challenge now shifts to the MCP client side. Most execution environments today run in a tightly controlled sandbox; security is paramount as we're dealing with user-/AI-generated code.</p>
<p>Allowing an execution environment to also access MCPs, tools, and user data requires careful design to where API keys are stored, and how tools are exposed.</p>
<p>In our designs, we created sandboxed environments that are keyed with specific API access, the models are provided with documentation on how to call these APIs such that they are able send/retrieve information without ever seeing secrets.</p>
<p>Most execution environments are stateful (e.g., they may rely on running Jupyter kernels for each user session). This is hard to manage and expensive if users expect to be able to come back to AI task sessions later. A stateless-but-persistent execution environment is paramount for long running (multi-day) task sessions.</p>
<p>These constraints are creating what we think is a new category of runtimes - "AI runtimes" that use LLMs to orchestrate and perform tasks. We're still in the early phases of working out all the details for this code-execution approach, and we'd love feedback from anyone tackling similar problems. If you're interested in our approach, you can head to <a href="https://lutra.ai/">Lutra</a> to give it a try.</p>

    <p>Collaborative text editing is arguably the hardest feature to implement in a collaborative app. Even if you use a central server and a fully general solution to optimistic local updates (<a href="https://mattweidner.com/2024/06/04/server-architectures.html#1-server-reconciliation">server reconciliation</a>), text editing in particular requires fancy algorithms - specifically, the <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2024/06/04/server-architectures.html#challenge-text-and-lists">core of a text-editing CRDT or OT</a>.</p>

<p>Or rather, that’s what I thought until recently. This blog post describes an alternative, straightforward approach to collaborative text editing, without Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) or Operational Transformation (OT). By making text editing flexible and easy to DIY, I hope that the approach will let you create rich collaborative apps that are challenging to build on top of a black-box CRDT/OT library.</p>

<p>This post builds off of my previous post, <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2024/06/04/server-architectures.html">Architectures for Central Server Collaboration</a>, though I’ll recap ideas as needed to keep it self-contained. In particular, I’ll generally assume that your collaborative app has a central server. A <a href="#decentralized-variants">later section</a> extends the approach to decentralized/server-optional collaboration, revealing surprising links to several text-editing CRDTs.</p>

<p>As usual for collaborative text editing, any technique in this post can also be applied to general collaborative lists: ingredients in a recipe, a powerpoint filmstrip, spreadsheet rows and columns, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Sources:</strong> I learned the main idea of this approach from a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41100477">Hacker News comment</a> by <a href="https://x.com/wcools/">Wim Cools</a> from Thymer. It is also used by <a href="https://jazz.tools/docs/react/using-covalues/colists">Jazz’s CoLists</a>. I do not know of an existing public description of the approach - in particular, I have not found it in any paper on <a href="https://crdt.tech/papers.html">crdt.tech</a> - but given its simplicity, others have likely used the approach as well.
The extension to decentralized collaboration is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04263">OpSets: Sequential Specifications for Replicated Datatypes</a> by Martin Kleppmann, Victor B. F. Gomes, Dominic P. Mulligan, and Alastair R. Beresford (2018).</p>

<p><em>Recap of <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2024/06/04/server-architectures.html#challenge-text-and-lists">Architectures for Central Server Collaboration - Challenge: Text and Lists</a></em></p>

<p>Let’s start by focusing on one part of the collaborative text editing problem: submitting operations to the server. When a user types a word on their client device, we need to communicate this operation to the server, so that the server can update its own (authoritative) state.</p>

<p>It’s tempting to model the text as an array of characters and send operations to the server that operate on the array representation, like “insert ‘ the’ at index 17”. However, this fails when there are multiple concurrent editors, as shown in Figure 1:</p>

<p><a id="figure-1"></a>
<img src="https://mattweidner.com/assets/img/server-architectures/index_rebasing.png" alt="See caption"></p>
<p><i><b>Figure 1.</b> Bob submits the operation "insert ‘ the’ at index 17" to the central server. But before his edit arrives, the server applies Alice's concurrent operation "insert ‘ gray’ at index 3". So it no longer makes sense to apply Bob's operation at index 17; the server must "rebase" it to index 22.</i></p>

<p>The core problem we must solve is: <strong>What operations should clients send to the server, and how should the server interpret them, so that the server updates its own text in the “obvious” correct way?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This “index rebasing” challenge is best known for real-time collaborative apps like Google Docs, but technically, it can also affect non-real-time apps—e.g., a web form that inserts items into a list. The problem can even appear in single-threaded local apps, which need to transform text/list indices for features like inline comments and edit histories.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="issues-with-existing-solutions">Issues with Existing Solutions</h2>

<p>Existing solutions to this core problem fall into two camps, Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and Operational Transformation (OT). Roughly:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> (2005+) assign an immutable ID (<a href="https://mattweidner.com/2022/02/10/collaborative-data-design.html#position-def">“position”</a>) to each character and sort these IDs using a mathematical total order - often a tree traversal over a special kind of tree.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">OT</a> (1989+) directly “transforms” operations to account for concurrent edits. In the above example, the server’s OT subroutine would transform “insert ‘ the’ at index 17” against “insert ‘ gray’ at index 3”, yielding “insert ‘ the’ at index 22”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both CRDT and OT algorithms are used in practice. OT is used by Google Docs; the <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/">Yjs</a> CRDT library is used by numerous apps. I’ve personally spent several years thinking and writing about text-editing <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2022/02/10/collaborative-data-design.html#list-crdt">CRDTs</a> <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2022/10/21/basic-list-crdt.html">and</a> <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2023/04/13/position-strings.html">closely</a> <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2024/04/29/list-positions.html">related</a> algorithms. So why does this blog post introduce a different approach, and what makes it better?</p>

<p>The main issue with both CRDTs and OT is their <em>conceptual complexity</em>. Text-editing CRDTs’ total orders are subtle algorithms defined in academic papers, often challenging to read. OT algorithms must satisfy algebraic “transformation properties” that have quadratically many cases and are <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00071213/">frequently flawed</a> without formal verification.</p>

<p>Complicated algorithms lead to even more complicated implementations, and CRDT/OT implementations are notoriously difficult. Thus you often use them through libraries, implemented by experts, which you can’t customize without a similar level of expertise. Because collaboration is a full-stack concern, the libraries are also full-stack, taking over core parts of your application: they present as a networked black box that inputs operations and outputs state.</p>

<p>This monolithic, unmodifiable approach becomes a liability when your app requires features that the library author did not anticipate. For example, I would struggle to do any of the following with an existing text-editing CRDT or OT library:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Divide the state between disk and memory, only loading the necessary parts of a large document.</li>
  <li>Enforce sub-document permissions on the server, e.g., some users are only allowed to edit certain paragraphs or use specific formatting.</li>
  <li>Allow “suggested changes” in the style of Google Docs, either inline or next to the text. (I <a href="https://github.com/mweidner037/list-positions-demos/tree/master/suggested-changes">tried to implement this</a> with my own CRDT library, but got stuck because suggestions could migrate away from their target text - precisely because I had no control over the CRDT’s total order.)</li>
  <li>Store the text in a key-value representation that is easy to sync over an existing key-value store (e.g. Replicache), without merely storing the entire text as a blob or the entire operation history as an array.</li>
  <li>Support operations beyond insert/delete: moving text, document tree manipulations, paragraph splitting/merging, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>In contrast, the approach described in this blog post is dead simple. I hope that you will soon understand it well enough to do-it-yourself if you desire. Once that’s done, you can modify the internals and add features at will.</p>

<h2 id="the-approach">The Approach</h2>

<h2 id="main-idea">Main Idea</h2>

<p>The main idea of our approach is straightforward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Label each text character with a globally unique ID (e.g., a UUID), so that we can refer to it in a consistent way across time - instead of using an array index that changes constantly. That is, our core data structure has type <code>Array&lt;{ id: ID; char: string }&gt;</code>.</li>
  <li>Clients send the server “insert after” operations that reference an existing ID. E.g., in <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a> above, Bob’s operation would be “insert ‘ the’ after <code>f1bdb70a</code>”, where <code>f1bdb70a</code> is the ID of ‘n’ in ‘on’.</li>
  <li>The server interprets “insert after” operations literally: it looks up the target ID and inserts the new characters immediately after it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Verify for yourself that this approach would handle both of Figure 1’s edits in the “obvious” correct way.</p>

<h2 id="some-corrections">Some Corrections</h2>

<p>You may have noticed two small issues with the above description. Luckily, they are both easy to correct.</p>

<p>First, when Bob sends his operation to the server, he also needs to specify the new elements’ IDs: “insert ‘ the’ after <code>f1bdb70a</code> with ids […]”. In other words, he must tell the server what pairs <code>{ id, char }</code> to add to its internal list, instead of just the new characters. (Having Bob generate the IDs, instead of waiting for the server to assign them, lets him reference those IDs in subsequent “insert after” operations before receiving a response to his first operation.)</p>

<p>Second, it’s possible for Bob to send an operation like “insert ‘foo’ after <code>26085702</code>”, but before his operation reaches the server, another user concurrently deletes the character with ID <code>26085702</code>. If the server literally deletes its pair <code>{ id: "26085702", char: "x" }</code> in response to the concurrent operation, then it won’t know where to insert Bob’s text anymore. The server can work around this by storing IDs in its internal list even after the corresponding characters are deleted: the server’s state becomes a list</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>{</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>ID</span><span>;</span> <span>char</span><span>?:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span> <span>isDeleted</span><span>:</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, deleted entries don’t show up in the user-visible text.</p>

<p>In summary, our corrected approach for client -&gt; server communication is as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code>Client &amp; server text state: Each stores a list of characters labeled by IDs, including deleted IDs.
- Type: `Array&lt;{ id: ID; char?: string; isDeleted: boolean }&gt;`
- Corresponding text: `list.filter(elt =&gt; !elt.isDeleted).map(elt =&gt; elt.char).join('')`

Typing a character `char`:
1. Client looks up the ID of the character just before the insertion point, `before`.
2. Client generates a globally unique ID for the new character (e.g., a UUID): `id`.
3. Client sends the server the operation: "insert ${char} after ${before} with id ${id}".
4. Server applies this operation to its own state literally:
  a. Looks up `before` in its own list, including deleted entries.
  b. Inserts `{ id, char, isDeleted: false }` immediately after `before`'s entry in the list.

Deleting a character:
1. Client looks up the ID of the deleted character, `id`.
2. Client sends the server the operation: "delete the entry with id ${id}".
3. Server looks up the entry for `id` and sets `entry.isDeleted = true` if not already.
</code></pre></div>

<p>You probably still have practical concerns with the above approach: e.g., it’s inefficient to store a UUID for every character. I’ll discuss optimizations <a href="#helper-library-articulated">later</a>.</p>

<h2 id="client-side">Client Side</h2>

<p><em>Recap of <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2024/06/04/server-architectures.html#1-server-reconciliation">Architectures for Central Server Collaboration - Server Reconciliation</a></em></p>

<p>The approach described so far lets us send operations from clients to the server, updating the server’s state. We managed to solve the <a href="#core-problem">core problem</a> in a straightforward way, without combing through any CRDT or OT papers.</p>

<p>For true Google-Docs style collaborative text editing, we also want to let users see the effects of their own operations immediately, without waiting for a response from the server. That is, clients should be allowed to perform optimistic local updates.</p>

<p>Optimistic local updates cause trouble when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A client possesses pending local operations - operations that it performed locally but were not yet acknowledged by the server.</li>
  <li>Before receiving an acknowledgment for those operations, the client receives a new remote operation from the server, necessarily concurrent to its pending local operations.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="figure-2"></a>
<img src="https://mattweidner.com/assets/img/text-without-crdts/text_pending_local_operation.png" alt="See caption"></p>
<p><i><b>Figure 2.</b> Bob submits the operation "insert ‘ the’ after &lt;n's ID&gt;" to the central server. But before the server acknowledges his operation, he receives the remote operation "insert ‘ gray’ after &lt;e's ID&gt;". What state should Bob's client display, incorporating both the remote operation and Bob's pending local operation?</i></p>

<p>At this point, you might say: We have concurrent operations, received in different orders by the client and the server, who must ultimately end up in the same state. Doesn’t that mean we need a CRDT?</p>

<p>Luckily, the answer is no! There is a fully general solution to optimistic local updates, <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2024/06/04/server-architectures.html#1-server-reconciliation">server reconciliation</a>, which is in particular compatible with our “insert after” operations. Briefly, the way you update a client in response to a new remote operation <code>R</code> is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Undo all pending local operations. This rewinds the state to the client’s previous view of the server’s state.</li>
  <li>Apply the remote operation(s). This brings the client up-to-date with the server’s state.</li>
  <li>Redo any pending local operations that are still pending, i.e., they were not acknowledged as part of the remote batch.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://mattweidner.com/assets/img/server-architectures/server_reconciliation.png" alt="Starting in optimistic local state S+L1+L2+L3, Step 1 leads to state S, Step 2 leads to state S+R, and Step 3 leads to state S+R+L1+L2+L3."></p>

<p><i>The Server Reconciliation way to process a remote operation <code>R</code> in the presence of pending local operations <code>L1, L2, L3</code>.</i></p>

<!-- Step 1 could involve literal undo commands, using a local stack that records how to undo each pending local mutation. Or, you could store the app state as a persistent data structure and directly restore the state before the first pending local mutation. Or, the server could tell you the exact new state to use (= its own latest state), which you use directly as the result of step 2.

Either way, server reconciliation completes our straightforward approach to collaborative text editing. -->

<blockquote>
  <p>There is another strategy that is even simpler than server reconciliation: forbid clients from processing remote operations whenever they possess pending local operations. I learned of this strategy from <a href="https://docs.powersync.com/architecture/consistency">PowerSync</a>.</p>

  <p>For example, in <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>, Bob’s client would ignore the first message from the server, instead waiting for the server to process Bob’s message and send the resulting state. Once it receives that state, Bob’s client can directly overwrite its own state. Unless Bob has performed even more operations in the meantime - then his client needs to ignore the server’s second message and wait for a third, etc.</p>

  <p>Note that this strategy can led to unbounded delays if Bob types continuously or has high network latency, so it is not as “real-time” as server reconciliation.</p>

<h2 id="difference-from-crdts">Difference from CRDTs</h2>

<p>You may object that the above approach sounds a lot like a CRDT. It does share some features: in particular, its assignment of an ID to each character and its use of <code>isDeleted</code> markers (tombstones).</p>

<p>The difference is that our approach handles order in a straightforward and flexible way: clients tell the server to insert X after Y and it does exactly that, or whatever else you program it to do. This contrasts with text-editing CRDTs, in which IDs are ordered for you by a fancy algorithm. That ordering algorithm is what differs between the numerous text-editing CRDTs, and it’s the complicated part of any CRDT paper; we get to avoid it entirely.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>The previous section described the whole approach in what I hope is enough detail to start implementing it yourself (though first check out <a href="#helper-library-articulated">Articulated</a> below). Let’s now discuss consequences and extensions of the approach.</p>

<h2 id="concurrent-insertions">Concurrent Insertions</h2>

<p>With any collaborative text-editing algorithm, the most interesting theoretical question is: What happens when multiple users type in the same place concurrently?</p>

<p>For example, staring from the text “My name is”, suppose Charlie types “ Charlie”, while concurrently, Dave types “ Dave”. If Charlie’s operation reaches the server first, what is the final text?</p>

<p>Let’s check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Charlie’s operation says “insert ‘ Charlie’ after &lt;ID of ‘s’ in ‘is’&gt;”. The server processes this literally, giving the text “My name is Charlie”.</li>
  <li>Dave’s operation likewise says “insert ‘ Dave’ after &lt;ID of ‘s’ in ‘is’&gt;”. The server again processes this literally - inserting after the ‘s’ in ‘is’, irrespective of the concurrent text appearing afterwards - giving the text “My name is Dave Charlie”.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, concurrent insertions at the same place end up in the <em>reverse</em> of the order that the server received their operations. More generally, even without concurrency, insert-after operations with the same target ID end up in reverse order. For example, if Dave typed his name backwards as (e, left arrow, v, left arrow, a, left arrow, D), then each operation would be “insert after &lt;ID of ‘s’ in ‘is’&gt;”, and the resulting text would be the reverse of the server’s receipt order: Dave. (This might remind you of a popular CRDT. I’ll talk about that <a href="#decentralized-variants">later</a>.)</p>

<p>Observe that the concurrently-inserted words “ Charlie” and “ Dave” ended up one after the other, instead of becoming interleaved character-by-character (unlike <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3301419.3323972">some text-editing CRDTs</a>). That would work even if Charlie and Dave sent each character as a separate operation. Indeed, Dave inserts the ‘a’ in Dave after the ‘D’ (i.e., the insert-after operation references D’s ID), ‘v’ after ‘a’, etc.; so when the server processes these individual operations, it updates its state as</p>

<div><pre><code>"My name is D Charlie" -&gt; "My name is Da Charlie"
-&gt; "My name is Dav Charlie" -&gt; "My name is Dave Charlie"
</code></pre></div>

<p>in spite of the unexpected “ Charlie” afterwards.</p>

<p>The same cannot be said for backwards (right-to-left) insertions: if Dave and Charlie both typed their names with copious use of left arrow, and the server received those operations in an interleaved order, then the resulting text would also be interleaved. In practice, this could only happen if Charlie and Dave were both online simultaneously (so that their messages could be interleaved) but stubbornly ignored each other’s in-progress edits.</p>

<h2 id="flexible-operations">Flexible Operations</h2>

<p>So far, the only text-editing operations I’ve described are “insert after” and “delete”, which the server applies literally. However, the approach supports many more possible operations. In fact, thanks to <a href="#client-side">our use of server reconciliation</a>, the server has the flexibility to do essentially anything in response to a client operation - clients will eventually end up in the same state regardless. This contrasts with CRDT and OT algorithms, which only allow operations that satisfy strict algebraic rules.</p>

<p>For example, consider the concurrent insertion example from the previous section. The final result, “My name is Dave Charlie”, isn’t very reasonable, even though it satisfies a <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/hongseok.yang/paper/podc16-full.pdf">mathematical specification</a> for collaborative text-editing. A fancy server could do something more intelligent for insertions like Dave’s that are at the same place as a previously-received concurrent insertion. For example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ignore any such operation (treat it as a no-op).</li>
  <li>Add the IDs to the internal list, but mark them as deleted immediately. (This is a still no-op from the users’ perspective, but it allows the server to process future operations from Dave that reference his earlier IDs.)</li>
  <li>Insert the text, but apply special formatting to both words to flag them for review.</li>
  <li>Convert Dave’s edits to a “suggestion” displayed alongside the main text.</li>
  <li>Ask an LLM how to best fix the text. (Be warned that Dave’s client may have trouble rebasing any further optimistic operations on top of the resulting state.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Clients can also send operations with fancier semantics than “insert after” to better capture user intent - thus increasing the odds that the server’s eventual state is reasonable in spite of concurrent edits. A simple example is “insert before”, the reversed version of “insert after”. E.g., if a user creates a heading above a paragraph, their client could “insert before” the paragraph’s first character, to prevent the header from ending up in the middle of an unrelated addition to the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>Another example is a “fix typo” operation that adds a character to a word only if that word still exists and hasn’t already been fixed. E.g., the client tells the server: “insert ‘u’ after the ‘o’ in ‘color’ that has ID X, but only if the surrounding word is still ‘color’”. That way, if another user deletes ‘color’ before the fix-typo operation reaches the server, you don’t end up with a ‘u’ in the middle of nowhere. (This example avoids an issue brought up by <a href="https://www.moment.dev/blog/lies-i-was-told-pt-1">Alex Clemmer</a>).</p>

<p>You can even define operations whose insertion positions change once they reach the server. E.g., the server could handle concurrent insertions at the same position by reordering them to be alphabetical. Or, if you add “move” operations for drag-and-drop, then the server can choose to process “insert after” operations within the moved text in the obvious way - insert them within the moved text instead of at its original location. This contrasts with text-editing CRDTs and my own CRDT-ish libraries (<a href="https://mattweidner.com/2023/04/13/position-strings.html">position-strings</a> and <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2024/04/29/list-positions.html">list-positions</a>), which fix each character’s position in a global total order as soon as the user types it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of these flexible operations can technically be implemented on top of a CRDT, by having the server initiate its own operations after a client operation (e.g., apply “delete” operations to some text that it wants to ignore). However, I don’t know of CRDT implementations that support “insert before” operations, un-deleting IDs, or changing where an ID ends up in the list.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="formatting-rich-text">Formatting (Rich Text)</h2>

<p>Rich text enhances plain text with inline formatting (bold, font size, hyperlinks, …), among other features. To handle rich text in our approach, when a user formats a range of text, we of course want to translate the ends of that range into character IDs instead of indices: “apply bold formatting from ID X to ID Y”. (Or perhaps: “apply bold formatting from ID X inclusive to ID Y exclusive”, so that concurrent insertions at the end of the range are also bolded.)</p>

<p>When used alongside a rich-text editor such as ProseMirror, the server can apply such operations literally: look up the current array indices of X and Y, and tell the local ProseMirror state to bold that range of text. ProseMirror will take care of remembering the bold span so that, when the server later receives an insertion within the span, it knows to bold that text too. (Unless the server decides to otherwise, e.g., in response to an operation “insert ‘…’ after ID Z with bold set to false”.)</p>

<p>I believe this simple extension to our approach takes care of the tricky conflict-resolution parts of collaborative rich-text formatting. However, I still recommend reading the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/">Peritext essay</a> for insight into the semantics of collaborative rich-text - what operations clients should send to the server, and how the server should process them.</p>

<h2 id="decentralized-variants">Decentralized Variants</h2>

<p><em>More info in <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2024/06/04/server-architectures.html#appendix-from-centralized-to-decentralized">Architectures for Central Server Collaboration - Appendix: From Centralized to Decentralized</a></em></p>

<p>I’ve so far assumed that your app has a central server, which assigns a total order to operations (namely, the order that the server receives them) and updates its authoritative state in response to those operations.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a central server or your app is server-optional, you can instead assign an eventual total order to operations in a <em>decentralized</em> way. For example, order operations using <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2023/09/26/crdt-survey-3.html#lww-lamport-timestamps">Lamport timestamps</a>. Then treat “the result of processing the operations I’ve received so far in order” as the authoritative state on each client. Our approach’s per-character IDs and “insert after” operations work equally well with this decentralized, “non”-server reconciliation.</p>

<p>Technically, the resulting algorithm is a text-editing CRDT: it’s a decentralized, eventually consistent algorithm for collaborative text editing. I hope that it is easier to understand and implement than a typical text-editing CRDT - it involved no trees or mathematical proofs - and the above remarks on <a href="#flexible-operations">Flexible Operations</a> and <a href="#formatting-rich-text">Formatting</a> still hold in the decentralized setting.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, you might ask: if “non”-server reconciliation plus our “insert after” operations yields a text-editing CRDT, which CRDT is it? The answer is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you order operations using Lamport timestamps, the resulting list order is equivalent to RGA / Causal Trees. (RGA’s sibling sort - reverse Lamport timestamp order - corresponds exactly to the reverse-order behavior I described <a href="#concurrent-insertions">earlier</a>.)</li>
  <li>If you order operations using Lamport timestamps and add formatting operations like above, the resulting behavior is quite similar to <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/">Peritext</a>. (The Lamport timestamp order on formatting operations corresponds to Peritext’s Lamport-timestamp-ordered stack of formatting spans.)</li>
  <li>If you order operations using a topological sort - e.g., append them to an RGA list CRDT and use its list order - the resulting list order is equivalent to <a href="https://mattweidner.com/2022/10/21/basic-list-crdt.html">Fugue</a>. (The topological sort’s non-interleaving property corresponds to Fugue’s non-interleaving of backwards insertions.)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have not written out a proof of these claims in detail, but I’m happy to discuss my reasoning if you <a href="https://mattweidner.com/">contact me</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="helper-library-articulated">Helper Library: Articulated</h2>

<p>Recall that each device’s state in our approach is a list</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>{</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>ID</span><span>;</span> <span>char</span><span>?:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span> <span>isDeleted</span><span>:</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In practice, you often want to store the actual text elsewhere - e.g., as a ProseMirror state - so our approach really just needs a list</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>{</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>ID</span><span>;</span> <span>isDeleted</span><span>:</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few main tasks that you’ll perform on this list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Convert between IDs and their current array indices, so that you can talk to the text-editing UI (e.g. ProseMirror).</li>
  <li>Insert a new ID after a specified ID.</li>
  <li>Mark an ID as deleted.</li>
  <li>Convert the state to and from a serialized form for storage.</li>
</ol>

<p>A literal array is not great at any of these tasks. Tasks 1-3 take linear time, and the array’s memory and storage space are large - an entire object and UUID per character!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mweidner037/articulated/">Articulated</a> is a small npm library I made to help out. Its <code>IdList</code> data structure provides the same functionality as the above array, but with optimizations similar to those in popular text-editing CRDT libraries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IDs have the form <code>{ bunchId, counter }</code>, where <code>bunchId</code> is a UUID that can be shared between a “bunch” of IDs with varying <code>counter</code>. When IDs in a bunch appear alongside each other - e.g., in the common case of left-to-right insertions - <code>IdList</code> stores them as a single object in memory and in the serialized state.</li>
  <li>The core data structure is a B+Tree instead of an array, allowing <code>log</code> or <code>log^2</code> time method calls.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an added feature, IdList is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistent</a> data structure. This is great for server reconciliation: each client can cheaply store a copy of the latest state they received from the server alongside their optimistic state, making it trivial to rollback to the server’s last state when they receive a remote operation.</p>

<p>You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/mweidner037/articulated/#articulated">docs</a> and (very preliminary) <a href="https://github.com/mweidner037/articulated-demos">demos</a> to learn more. Or, read through the code for <a href="https://github.com/mweidner037/articulated/blob/master/test/id_list_simple.ts">IdListSimple</a> - it’s a simple, &lt; 300 SLOC implementation of IdList that omits its optimizations and persistence but is otherwise functionally identical (verified by fuzz tests).</p>

<p>I hope that, within the context of a server reconciliation architecture, Articulated can serve a similar purpose to an optimized CRDT library, but with the flexibility and other advantages described in this blog post.</p>

Microsoft Paint and Minesweeper are visible behind a black rectangular window that is empty except for graffiti-style text that says &quot;SIGNAL WAS HERE&quot;."></p><p>Signal Desktop now includes support for a new “Screen security” setting that is designed to help prevent your own computer from capturing screenshots of your Signal chats on Windows. This setting is automatically enabled by default in Signal Desktop on Windows 11.</p><p>If you’re wondering why we’re only implementing this on Windows right now, it’s because the purpose of this setting is to protect your Signal messages from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c">Microsoft Recall</a>.</p><p>First announced on May 20, 2024, Microsoft Recall takes screenshots of your apps every few seconds as you use your computer and then stores them in an easily searchable database. In Microsoft’s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/">own words</a>, its goal is to act as a sort of “photographic memory” for everything that you do on your computer. The words that other people chose to describe Recall upon its debut were decidedly less positive.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> After an intense <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-recall-off-default-security-concerns/">security backlash</a> and significant public outcry, Microsoft quickly pulled the feature.</p><p>It’s a one-year anniversary that nobody wants to celebrate, but Recall <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/microsoft-is-putting-privacy-endangering-recall-back-into-windows-11/">is back</a> and Signal is ready.</p><p>Although Microsoft made several adjustments over the past twelve months in response to critical feedback, the revamped version of Recall still places any content that’s displayed within privacy-preserving apps like Signal at risk. As a result, we are enabling an extra layer of protection by default on Windows 11 in order to help maintain the security of Signal Desktop on that platform even though it introduces some usability trade-offs. Microsoft has simply given us no other option.</p><h2 id="fade-to-black">Fade to Black</h2><p>If you attempt to take a screenshot of Signal Desktop when screen security is enabled, nothing will appear. This limitation can be frustrating, but it might look familiar to you if you’ve ever had the audacity to try and take a screenshot of a movie or TV show on Windows. According to Microsoft’s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/manage-recall#information-for-developers">official developer documentation</a>, setting the correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital Rights Management</a> (DRM) flag on the application window will ensure that “content won’t show up in Recall or any other screenshot application.” So that’s exactly what Signal Desktop is now doing on Windows 11 by default.</p><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/recall-drm-screenplay.jpg" alt="A stylized close-up crop of a movie screenplay that says &quot;INT. COPILOT+ PC MANUFACTURING FACILITY - NIGHT - METALLIC SHELVES in endless rows stretch into the darkness. Two figures crouch in the shadows. ALICE: DRM technology has been consistently used against us. BOB: It won't be the first time we've turned the tables. ALICE: My life has always felt like a movie.&quot;"></p><p>Apps like Signal have essentially no control over what content Recall is able to capture, and implementing “DRM” that works for you (not against you) is the best choice that we had. It’s like a scene in a movie where the villain has switched sides, and you can’t screenshot this one by default either.</p><h2 id="warning-shots">Warning Shots</h2><p>Microsoft has launched Recall without granular settings for app developers that would enable Signal to easily protect privacy, which is a glaring omission that limits our choices. Signal is using the tools that are available to us even though we recognize that there are many legitimate use cases where someone might need to take a screenshot. For example, some accessibility software (such as screen readers or magnification tools for people who are visually impaired) may not function correctly otherwise.</p><p>To help mitigate this issue, we made the setting easy to disable <em>(Signal Settings → Privacy → Screen security)</em>, but it’s difficult to accidentally disable. Turning off “Screen security” in Signal Desktop on Windows 11 will always display a warning and require confirmation in order to continue.</p><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/recall-warning.png" alt="A screenshot of a warning dialog box that says &quot;Disable screen security? If disabled, this may allow Microsoft Windows to capture screenshots of Signal and use them for features that may not be private.&quot;"></p><p>This setting is local to your computer and doesn’t apply to screenshots on other devices. If you are communicating with someone who uses a screen reader on macOS or Linux, for example, keeping screen security enabled on your side won’t prevent them from taking screenshots or adversely affect any accessibility software they may be using.</p><p>We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future. Apps like Signal shouldn’t have to implement “one weird trick” in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools. People who care about privacy shouldn’t be forced to sacrifice accessibility upon the altar of AI aspirations either.</p><h2 id="future-recallections">Future Recallections</h2><p>“Take a screenshot every few seconds” legitimately sounds like a suggestion from a low-parameter LLM that was given a prompt like “How do I add an arbitrary AI feature to my operating system as quickly as possible in order to make investors happy?” — but more sophisticated threats are on the horizon.</p><p>The integration of AI agents with pervasive permissions, questionable security hygiene, and an insatiable hunger for data has the potential to break <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/signal-president-meredith-whittaker-calls-out-agentic-ai-as-having-profound-security-and-privacy-issues/">the blood-brain barrier</a> between applications and operating systems. This poses a significant threat to Signal, and to every privacy-preserving application in general.</p><p>People everywhere rely on Signal to protect their communication, including human rights workers, governments, board rooms, militaries, and millions of individuals around the world for whom privacy is an existential matter. Apps like Signal must maintain their ability to prioritize security by default in a way that can be <a href="https://github.com/signalapp">publicly validated</a>. It’s imperative that privacy-preserving apps retain the ability to uphold these promises on every platform, including Microsoft Windows.</p><p>In order to do this, the ecosystem needs to do its part too. Operating system vendors, especially those who are shipping AI agents, need to ensure that the developers of apps like Signal always have the necessary tools and options at their disposal to reject granting OS-level AI systems access to any sensitive information within their apps.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ceo-zuckerberg-facebooks-5-core-values/">“Move fast and break things”</a> is going to be a tough habit for the tech industry to, well, break. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a> shouldn’t also stand for “Minimum Viable Precautions.” It’s ultimately up to companies like Microsoft to ensure that their platforms remain a suitable foundation for privacy-preserving applications like Signal. If that ever stops being the case, we’ll have to stop supporting those platforms.</p><p>Messaging apps are a window into your entire life. They’re where we share our favorite memories, fall in love, complain, smile, cry, and express who we really are. Given this reality, private messaging apps like Signal deserve to be treated with at least the same level of caution that’s afforded to a web browser’s private or incognito browsing window — which Microsoft has <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/filtering-apps-websites-and-sensitive-information-in-recall-a4c28bee-e200-4a4a-b60d-c0522b404a5b">already excluded from Recall by default</a>.</p><p>Screen security for Signal Desktop on Microsoft Windows is rolling out now, and enabled by default on Windows 11. We’d like to express our sincere appreciation to the Signal community for helping us test this release during the beta period. We couldn’t do this work without your support.</p></div></div>]]></description>

He views them as his AI chiefs of staff, delegating meeting prep, research and other tasks to the bots. “I’m an email typist,” Nadella jokes of his job, noting that Copilot is thankfully very good at triaging his messages.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>None of these tasks are things that require you to use AI. You can read your messages on Outlook and Teams without having them summarized — and I’d argue that a well-written email is one that doesn’t require a summary. Podcasts are not there "to be chatted about" with an AI. Preparing for meetings isn't something that requires AI, nor is research, unless, of course, <strong><em>you don't really give a shit about the actual content of what you're reading or the message of what you're saying, just that you are "saying the right thing."</em></strong></p><p>To be clear, I am deeply unconvinced that Nadella actually runs his life in this way, but if he does, Microsoft’s board should fire him immediately.</p><p>In any case, the article is rambling, cloying, and<u> </u><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/deepmind-mustafa-suleyman-google-allegations-bullying-settlements-2021-8?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>ignores Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's documented history of abusing his workers</u></a>. Ten custom agents that do what? What do you mean by "other tasks"? Why are these questions never asked? Is it because the reporters know they won't get an answer? Is it because the reporters are too polite to ask more probing questions, knowing that these anecdotes are likely entirely made up as a means to promote a flagging AI ecosystem that cost billions to construct, but doesn’t really seem to do anything, and the reporter in question doesn’t want to force Satya to build a bigger house of cards than he needs to.&nbsp;</p><p>Or is it because we, as a society, do not want to look too closely at the powerful? Is it because we've handed our economy to men that<a href="https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/satya-nadella-net-worth?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> get paid $79 million a year to do a job they can't seem to describe</u></a>, and even that, they would sooner offload to a bunch of unreliable AI models than actually do?</p><p>We live in the era of the symbolic executive, when "being good at stuff" matters far less than the appearance of doing stuff, where "what's useful" is dictated not by outputs or metrics that one can measure but rather the vibes passed between managers and executives that have worked their entire careers to escape the world of work. Our economy is run by people that don't participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don't experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/tss/"><u> their allegiance to shareholder value</u></a>.</p><p>I, however, believe the problem runs a little deeper than the economy, which is a symptom of a bigger, virulent, and treatment-resistant plague that has infected the minds of those currently twigging at the levers of power — and really, the only levers that actually matter.&nbsp;</p><p>The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/"><u>Rot Economy</u></a>, which is a useful description for how tech companies have voluntarily degraded their core products in order to placate shareholders, transforming useful — and sometimes beloved — services into a hollow shell of their former selves as a means of expressing growth. But it’s worth noting that this transformation isn’t constrained to the tech industry, nor was it a phenomena that occurred when the tech industry entered its current VC-fuelled, publicly-traded incarnation.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/tss/"><u>The Shareholder Supremacy</u></a>, I drew a line from an early 20th-century court ruling, to former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, to the current tech industry, but there’s one figure I didn’t pay as much attention to, and I regrettably now have to do so.</p><p>Famed Chicago School economist (and dweller of Hell) Milton Friedman<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> once argued in his 1970 doctrine</u></a> that those who didn’t focus on shareholder value were “unwitting pup­pets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades," and that any social responsibility — say, treating workers well, doing <em>anything</em> other than focus on shareholder value — is tantamount to an executive taxing his shareholders by "spending their money" on their own personal beliefs.</p><p>Friedman was a fundamentalist when it came to unrestricted, unfettered capitalism, and this zealotry surpassed any sense of basic human morality — if he had any — at times. For example, in his book, Capitalism and Friedman, he argued that companies should be allowed to discriminate on racial grounds because the owner might suffer should they be required to hire an equally or better-qualified Black person.&nbsp;</p><p>Bear in mind, this was written at the height of the civil rights movement, just six years before the assassination of Martin Luther King, and when America was rapidly waking up to the evils of racism and segregation (a process, I add, is ongoing and sadly not complete). This is a direct quote:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“...consider a situation in which there are grocery stores serving a neighborhood inhabited by people who have a strong aversion to being waited on by Negro clerks. Suppose one of the grocery stores has a vacancy for a clerk and the first applicant qualified in other respects happens to be a Negro. Let us suppose that as a result of the law the store is required to hire him. The effect of this action will be to reduce the business done by this store and to impose losses on the owner. If the preference of the community is strong enough, it may even cause the store to close. When the owner of the store hires white clerks in preference to Negroes in the absence of the law, he may not be expressing any preference or prejudice, or taste of his own. He may simply be transmitting the tastes of the community. He is, as it were, producing the services for the consumers that the consumers are willing to pay for. Nonetheless, he is harmed, and indeed may be the only one harmed appreciably, by a law which prohibits him from engaging in this activity, that is, prohibits him from pandering to the tastes of the community for having a white rather than a Negro clerk. The consumers, whose preferences the law is intended to curb, will be affected substantially only to the extent that the number of stores is limited and hence they must pay higher prices because one store has gone out of business.”</blockquote><p>Friedman was grotesque. I am not religious, but I hope Hell exists if only for him.&nbsp;</p><p>The broader point I’m trying to make is that neoliberalism is inherently selfish, believing that the free market should reign supreme, bereft of government intervention, regulation or interference, thinking that somehow these terms will enable "freedom" rather than a kind of market-dominated quasi-dictatorship where our entire lives are dominated by the whims of the affluent, and that there is no institution that can possibly push back against them.&nbsp;</p><p>Friedman himself makes the facile argument that economic freedom — which, he says, is synonymous with unfettered capitalism — is a necessary condition of unfettered political freedom. Obviously, that’s bollocks, although it’s an argument that’s proven persuasive with a certain class of people that are either intellectually or morally hollow (or both).</p><p>Neoliberalism also represents a kind of modern-day feudalism, dividing society based on whether someone is a shareholder or not, with the former taking precedence and the latter seen as irrelevant at best, or disposable at worst. It’s curious that Friedman saw economic freedom — a state that is non-interventionist in economic matters — as essential for political freedom, while also failing to see equality as the same.&nbsp;</p><p>I realize this is all very big and clunky, but I want you to understand how these incentives have fundamentally changed everything, and why they are responsible for the rot we see in our society and our workplaces. When your <em>only</em> incentive is shareholder value, and you raise shareholder value as a platonic ideal, <em>everything else </em>is secondary, including <em>the customer you are selling something to. Friedman himself makes a moral case for discrimination, because shareholder value — in his example, the store owner — matters more than racial equality at its most basic level.&nbsp;</em></p><p>When you care only about shareholder value, the only job you have is to promote further exploitation and dominance — not to have happy customers, not to make your company "a good place to work," not to make a good product, not to make a difference or contribute to anything other than further growth.</p><p>While this is, to anyone with a vapor of an intellectual or moral dimension, absolutely fucking stupid, it’s an idea that’s proven depressingly endemic among the managerial elite, in part because it has entered the culture, and because it is hammered across in MBA classes and corporate training seminars.&nbsp;</p><p>In simpler terms, modern business theory trains executives not to be good at something, or to make a company based on their particular skills, but to "find a market opportunity" and exploit it. The Chief Executive —<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ceo-replace-ai-job-employees-executives-save-money-salary-2023-9?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> who makes over 300 times more than their average worker</u></a> — is no longer a leadership position, but a kind of figurehead measured on their ability to continually grow the market capitalization of their company. It is a position inherently defined by its <em>lack</em> of labor, the amorphousness of its purpose and its lack of any clear responsibility.&nbsp;</p><p>While CEOs <em>do</em> get fired when things go badly, it's often after a prolonged period of decline and stagnancy, and almost always comes with some sort of payoff — and when I say "badly," I mean that growth has slowed to the point that even firing masses of people doesn't make things better.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>Sidebar: </strong>I also note that “fired” means something different when it comes to top execs. Excluding those fired due to criminal levels of malfeasance — like Robert Moffat, the man once tipped to be the next CEO of IBM, had he not been convicted of securities fraud and jailed for six months, thus losing nearly $85m in benefits — most ousted corporate leaders often enjoy generous severance packages, far beyond the usual “two weeks of pay and COBRA.” WeWork founder Adam Neumann’s $200m in cash and $225m in (now-worthless) stock is perhaps the most egregious example of this.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>We have, as a society, reframed all business leadership — which is increasingly broad, consisting of all management from the C-suite down — to be the equivalent of a mall cop, a person that exists to make sure people are working without having any real accountability for the work themselves, or to even understand the work itself.</p><p>When the leader of a company doesn't participate in or respect the production of the goods that enriches them, it creates a culture that enables similarly vacuous leaders on all levels. Management as a concept no longer means doing "work," but establishing cultures of dominance and value extraction. A CEO isn't measured on happy customers or even how good their revenue is today, but how good revenue might be <em>tomorrow</em> and whether those customers are paying them more. A "manager," much like a CEO, is no longer a position with any real responsibility — they're there to make sure you're working, to know enough about your work that they can <em>sort of </em>tell you what to do, but somehow the job of "telling you what to do" doesn't come with it any actual work, and the instructions don’t need to be useful or even meaningful.</p><p>Decades of direct erosion of the very concept of leadership means that the people running companies have been selected not based on their actual efficacy — especially as the position became defined by its lack of actual production — but on whether they resemble what a manager or executive is meant to look like based on the work that somebody else did.</p><p>That’s how someone like David Zaslav, a lawyer by trade and arguably the worst CEO in the entertainment industry, managed to become the head of Warner Brothers (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/03/02/discoverys-david-zaslav-reflects-on-jack-welchs-legacy.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>that, and kissing up to Jack Welch, who he called a “big brother” that “picked him up like a friend”</u></a>). It’s how Carly Fiorina — an MBA by trade — went on to become the head of HP, <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/09/21/carly-fiorina-hp-ceo-business-record/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>only to drive the company into a ditch where it stopped innovating</u></a>, and largely missed the biggest opportunities of the early Internet era. The three CEOs that followed (Mark Hurd (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/backlash-against-hewlett-packard-grows-it-seems-mark-hurd-fired-because-company-scared-of-bad-pr-over-bogus-sexual-harassment-allegation-2010-8?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>who was ousted after fudging expense reports to send money to a love interest</u></a> <em>and </em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wait-a-minute-why-does-mark-hurd-get-50-million-severance-when-he-lied-in-his-expense-reports-2010-8?ref=wheresyoured.at"><em><u>still got tens of millions of dollars in severance</u></em></a><em>)</em>, Leo Apotheker (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/business/leo-apotheker-may-have-been-worse-hp-chief-than-carly-fiorina.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>who the New York Times suggests may have been worse than Fiorina</u></a>), and Meg Whitman (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-top-7-ways-meg-whitman-is-failing-at-hp-2012-5?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>famous for being a terrible CEO at HP</u></a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/28/quibi-netflix-jeffrey-katzenberg-crash?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>co-founding doomed video startup Quibi</u></a>) similarly came from a non-tech background, and similarly did a shitty job, in part because they didn’t understand the company or the products or the customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Management has, over the course of the past few decades, eroded the very fabric of corporate America, and I'd argue it’s done the same in multiple other western economies, too.</p><p>I’d also argue that this kind of dumb management thinking also infected the highest echelons of politics across the world, and especially in the UK, my country of birth and where I lived until 2011, delivering the same kind of disastrous effects but at a macro level, as they impacted not a single corporate entity but the very institutions of the state. I’m not naive. I don’t think that the average politician is a salt-of-the-earth type, someone who did a normal job and then decided to enter politics. Especially not in the UK, where the trappings of class permeate everything, and we’re yet to shake off the noxious influence of the aristocracy and constitutionally-mandated hereditary privilege. Our political elite often comes from one of two universities (Oxford and Cambridge, the alma mater of 20% of current UK Members of Parliament) and a handful of fee-paying schools (like Eton, which is a hellmouth for the worst people to ever exist, and educated 20 of the UK’s 55 prime ministers).&nbsp;</p><p>The UK has never been an egalitarian society. And yet, things have changed markedly in the past few decades.The difference between now and then is that the silver-spooned elite was, whether because they believed it or because it was politically expedient, not totally contemptuous of those at the bottom of the economic ladder.&nbsp;</p><p>I was born in the midst of the Thatcher government, and my formative years were spent as British society tried to restructure itself after her reforms. Thatcher, famously, was an acolyte of the Friedman school of thought, and spent her nearly twelve years in office dismantling the state and pushing the culture towards an American-style individualism, once famously quipping that there was “no such thing as society.”&nbsp;</p><p>She didn’t understand how things worked, but was nonetheless completely convinced of the power of the market to handle what was the functions of the state — from housing to energy and water. The end result of this political and cultural shift was, in the long run, disastrous.&nbsp;</p><p>The UK has the smallest houses in the OECD, the <a href="https://www.pbctoday.co.uk/news/planning-construction-news/english-housing-is-worst-in-europe-report-finds/133243/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>smallest housing stock of any developed country</u></a>,&nbsp; and some of the worst affordability. The privatization of the UK’s water infrastructure meant that money that would previously go towards infrastructure upgrades was, instead, funnelled to shareholders in the form of dividends. As a result, Britain is literally unable to process human waste and is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-62631320?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>actively dumping millions of liters of human sewage into its waterways and coastline</u></a>. When Britain privatized its energy companies, the new management sold or <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/the-weekend-essay/2023/02/running-on-fumes-britain-squandered-gas-wealth?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>closed the vast majority of its gas storage infrastructure</u></a>. As a result, when the Ukraine War sparked, and natural gas prices surged, Britain had some of the smallest reserves of any country in Europe, and was forced to buy gas at the market prices — which were several times higher than their pre-war levels.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m no fan of Thatcher, and like Friedman, I too wish hell exists, if only for the both of them. I wrote the above to emphasize the consequences of this clueless managerial thinking on a macro level — where the impacts aren’t just declining tech products or white-collar layoffs, but rather the emergence of generational crises in housing, energy, and the environment. These crises were obvious consequences of decisions made by someone whose belief in the free market was almost absolute, and whose fundamentalist beliefs surpassed the actual informed understanding of those working in energy, or housing, or water.&nbsp;</p><p>As the legendary advertiser Stanley Pollitt once said, “bullshit baffles brains.” The sweeping changes we’ve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things — things of actual substance — matter nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>We live in a symbolic economy where we apply for jobs, writing CVs and cover letters to resemble a certain kind of hire, with our resume read by someone who doesn't do or understand our job, but yet is responsible for determining whether we’re worthy of going to the next step of the hiring process. All this so that we might get an interview with a manager or executive who will decide whether they think we can do it. We are managed by people <em>whose job is implicitly not to do work, but oversee it. </em>We are, as children (and young adults), encouraged to aspire to become a manager or executive, to "own our own business," to "have people that work for us," and the terms of our society are, by default, that management is <em>not a role you work at, so much as a position you hold — </em>a figurehead that passes the buck and makes far more of them than you do.</p><p>This problem, I believe, has poisoned the fabric of almost every part of modern business, elevating people that don't do work to oversee companies that make things they don't understand, creating substrates of management that do not do anything but create further distance from actually doing a job.</p><p>While some of you might automatically think I'm talking about Graeber's concept of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> Bullshit Jobs</u></a>, this is far, far bigger. The system as it stands selects people at all levels of management <em>specifically because they resemble the kind of specious, work-averse dullard that runs seemingly every company —</em> a person built to go from meeting to meeting with the vague consternation that suggests they're "busy."</p><p>As a result, the higher you get up in an organization, the further you get from the customer, the problem you've solving, and any of the actual work, and the higher up you get<em>, the more power you have to change the conditions of the business.</em> On some level, modern corporate power structures are a giant game of telephone where vibes beget further vibes, where managers only kind-of-sort-of understand what's going on, and the more vague one's understanding is, the more likely you are to lean toward what's good, or easy, or makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.</p><p>The system selects for people comfortable in these roles, creating org charts full of people that become harder and harder to justify other than "they've been here a while." They do not do "work" on the "product," and their answer as to why would be "what, am I meant to go down on the line and use a machine?" or "am I meant to call a customer and make a sale?" and the answer is yes, you lazy fucking piece of shit, you should do that once in a while, or at the very least go and watch or listen to somebody else do so, and do so regularly.</p><p>But that's not what a manager does, right? Management isn't <em>work, </em>it's about <em>thinking really hard</em> and <em>telling people what to do.</em> It's about <em>making the calls.</em> It's about "managing people," and that can mean just about anything, but often means "who do I take credit from or pass blame to," because modern management has been stripped of all meaning other than continually reinforcing power structures for the next manager up.</p><p>This system creates products for these people, because these people are more often than not the ones in power — they are your boss, your boss' boss, and their boss too. Big companies build products sold by specious executives or managers to other specious executives, and thus the products themselves stop resembling things that solve <em>problems</em> so much as they <em>resemble a solution</em>. After all, the person buying it — at least at the scale of a public company — isn’t necessarily the recipient of the final product, so they too are trained (and selected) to make calls based on vibes.</p><p>I believe the scale of this problem is society-wide, and it is, at its core, a destruction of what it means to be a leader, and a valorization of selfishness, isolationist thinking, turning labor into a faceless resource, which naturally leads to seeing customers in an equally faceless way, their problems generalized, their pain points viewed as parts of a powerpoint rather than anything that your company earnestly tries to solve or even really thinks about. And that assumes that said pain points are even considered to begin with, or not ignored in favor of a fictitious and purely hypothetical pain point.&nbsp;</p><p>People — be they the ones you're paying or paying you — become numbers. We have created and elevated an entirely new class of person, the nebulous "manager," and told decades-worth of children that's what they should aspire to, that the next step from doing a job is for us to tell other people to do a job, until we're able to one day tell <em>those</em> people how to do their job, with each rung on the corporate ladder further distancing ourselves from anything that interacts with reality.</p><p>The real breaking point is fairly simple: the higher up you go at a company, the further you are from problems or purpose. Everything is abstract — the people that work for you, the people you work for, and even the tasks you do.&nbsp;</p><p>We train people — from a young age! — to generalize and distance oneself from actual tasks, to aspire to doing managerial work, because managers are well-paid and "know what's going on," even if they haven't actually known what was going on for years, if they ever did so. This phenomenon has led to the stigmatization of blue-collar work (and the subsequent evisceration of practical trade and technical education across most of the developed world) in favor of universities. Society respects an MBA more than a plumber, even though the latter benefits society more — though I concede that both roles involve, on some level, shit, with the plumber unblocking it and the MBA spewing it.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>Sidebar: </strong>Hey, have you noticed how most of the calls for people to return to the office come not from people who actually do the jobs, but occupy managerial roles? More on that later.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>I believe this process has created a symbolic society — one where people are elevated not by any actual ability to do something or knowledge they may have, but by their ability to make the right noises and look the right way to get ahead. The power structures of modern society are run by <em>business idiots</em> — people that have learned enough to impress the people above them, because the business idiots have had power for decades. They have bred out true meritocracy or achievement or value-creation in favor of symbolic growth and superficial intelligence, because <em>real work is hard, and there are so many of them in power they've all found a way to work together.</em></p><p>I need you to understand how widespread this problem is, because it is why everything feels fucking <em>wrong.</em></p><hr><p>Think of the Business Idiot as a kind of con artist, except the con has become the standard way of doing business for an alarmingly large part of society.&nbsp;</p><p>The Business Idiot is&nbsp; the manager that doesn't seem to do anything but keeps being promoted, and<a href="https://x.com/levie/status/1919573650547622130?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> the chief executive officer of a public company that says boring, specious nonsense</u></a> about AI. They're the tenured professor that you wish would die, the administrator whose only job appears to be opening and closing their laptop, the consultant that can come up with a million reasons to charge you more money yet not one metric to judge their success by, the marketing executive that's worked exactly three years at every major cloud player but does not appear to have done anything, and the investor that invests "based on founders," but really means "guys that look at sound exactly like them."</p><p>These people are present throughout the private and public sector, and our governments too, and they paradoxically do nothing of substance, but somehow damage everything they touch. This isn’t to say our public and private sector is entirely useless — just that these people have poisoned so many parts of our power structures that avoiding them is impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our economy is oriented around them — made easier and more illogical for their benefit — because their literal only goal in life has been to take and use power. The Business Idiot is also an authoritarian, and will do whatever they need to — including harming the institution they work for, or those closest to them, like their co-workers or their community — as a means of avoiding true accountability or responsibility.</p><p>Decades of neoliberalism has incentivized their rise, because when you incentivize society to become <em>management</em> — to "manage or run a company" rather than do something for a reason or purpose — you are incentivizing a kind of corporate narcissism, one that bleeds into whatever field the person goes into, be it public or private. We go to college as a means of getting a job after college using the grades we got in college, rendering many students desperate to get the best grades they can versus "learn" anything, because our economy is riddled with power structures controlled by people that <em>don't know stuff and find it offensive when you remind them.</em></p><p>Our society is in the thrall of dumb management, and functions as such. Every government, the top quarter of every org chart, features little Neros who, instead of battling the fire engulfing Rome, are sat in their palaces strumming an off-key version of “Wonderwall” on the lyre and grumbling about how the firefighters need to work harder, and maybe we could replace them with an LLM and a smart sprinkler system.&nbsp;</p><p>Every institution keeps its core constituents and labor forces at arms-length, and effectively anything built at scale quickly becomes distanced from both the customer and laborer. This disconnection — or alienation — sits at the center of almost every problem I've ever talked about. Why would companies push generative AI in seemingly every part of their service, even though customers don't like it and it doesn't really work?</p><p>It's simple: they neither know nor care what the customer wants, barely know how their businesses function, barely know what their products do, and barely understand what their workers are doing, meaning that generative AI feels magical, because it does an impression of somebody doing a job, which is an accurate way of describing how most executives and middle managers operate.</p><hr><p>Let me get a little more specific.</p><p><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/reality-check/"><u>An IBM study based on conversations with 2,000 global CEOs</u></a> recently found that only 25% of AI initiatives have delivered their expected ROI over the last few years, and, worse still, "64% of CEOs surveyed acknowledge that the risk of falling behind drives investment in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization." 50% of respondents also found that "the pace of recent investments has left their organization with disconnected, piecemeal technology," <em>almost as if they don't know what they're doing and are just putting AI in stuff for no reason.</em></p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson recently decided to "shift from broad generative AI experimentation to a focused approach on high-value use cases"<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-pivots-its-ai-strategy-a9d0631f?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> according to the Wall Street Journal</u></a>, adding that "only 10 to 15% of use cases were driving about 80% of the value." Their last two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and Joaquin Duato) both have MBAs, with current CEO Duato's previous ten years at Johnson &amp; Johnson being "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaquinduato/details/experience/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>some sort of Chairman or Vice President</u></a>," and the previous two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and William Weldon) were both pharmaceutical sales and marketing people.&nbsp;</p><p>Fun fact about Alex Gorsky! During his first tenure at Johnson &amp; Johnson he led marketing of products<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/16/business/16drug.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> <strong>that deliberately underplayed some drugs' side effects and paid off the largest nursing home pharmacy in America to sell more drugs to old people</strong></u></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>The term "executive" loosely refers to a person who moves around numbers and hopes for the best. The modern executive does not "lead," but prod, their managers hall monitors for organizations run predominantly by people that, by design, are entirely removed from the business itself even <em>in</em> roles like marketing and sales, where CMOs and VPs bark orders without really participating in the process.</p><p>We talk eagerly about how young people in entry level jobs should "earn their stripes" by doing "grunt work," and that too is the neoliberal poison in the veins of our society, because, by definition, your very first experience of the workforce is working hard enough <em>so that you don't have to work as hard.</em></p><p>And anyway, the same managerial types who bitch about the entitlement and unrealistic expectations of young people are the same ones that also eviscerated the bottom rung of the career ladder — typically by offshoring many of these roles, or <em>consolidating</em> them into the responsibilities of their increasingly burned-out senior workers — or see AI as a way to eliminate what they see as an optional cost center, and not the future of their workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>Society berated people for "<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/quiet-quitting-and-the-death-of-office/"><u>quiet quitting</u></a>," a ghastly euphemism for “doing the job as specified in your employment contract,” in 2022 because journalism is enthralled by the management class, and because the management class has so thoroughly rewritten the concept of what "labor" means that people got called lazy for <em>literally doing their jobs</em>. The middle manager brain doesn't see a worker as somebody hired and paid for a job, but as an asset that must provide a return. As a result, if another asset comes along that could potentially provide a bigger return — like an offshore worker, or an AI agent — that middle manager won’t hesitate to drop them.&nbsp;</p><p>Artificial intelligence is the ultimate panacea for the Business Idiot — a tool that gives an impression of productivity with far more production than the Business Idiot themselves.<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bots-bust-servicenows-bill-mcdermott-makes-bet-ai?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> The Information reported recently</u></a> that ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott — the chief executive of a company with a market capitalization of over $200 billion, despite the fact that, like SalesForce, nobody really knows what it does&nbsp; — chose to push AI across his whole organization (both in product and in practice) based on the mental consideration I'd usually associate with a raven finding a shiny object:</p><blockquote>When ChatGPT debuted in November 2022, McDermott joined his executives around a boardroom table and they played with the chatbot together. From there, he made a quick decision. “Bill’s like, ‘Let me make it clear to everybody here, everything you do: AI, AI, AI, AI, AI,’” recalled Tzitzon, the ServiceNow vice chair.<p>To begin a customer meeting on AI, McDermott has asked his salespeople to do what amounts to their best impression of him: Present AI not as a matter of bots or databases but in grand-sounding terms, like “business transformation.</p><p>During the push to grow AI, McDermott has insisted his managers improve efficiency across their teams. He is laser-focused on a sales team’s participation rate. “Let’s assume you’re a manager, and you have 12 direct reports,” he said. “Now let’s assume out of those 12, two people did good, which was so good that the manager was 110% of plan. I don’t think that’s good. I tell the manager: ‘What did the other 10 do?’”</p></blockquote><p>You'll notice that all of this is complete nonsense. What do you mean "efficiency"? What does that quote even mean? 110% of plan? What're you on about? Did you hit your head on something Bill?</p><p>I'd wager Bill is concussion-free — and an example of a true Business Idiot — a person with incredible power and wealth that makes decisions not based on knowing stuff or caring about his customers, but on the latest shiny thing that makes him think "<em>line go up</em>." No, really, that's Bill McDermott's thing. Back in 2022,<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veteran-tech-exec-bullish-on-mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-172635544.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> he said to Yahoo Finance the metaverse</u></a> was "real" and that ServiceNow could help someone "create an e-mall in the metaverse" and have a futuristic store of some sort. One might wonder how ServiceNow provided that, and the answer is it didn't. I cannot find a single product that it’s offered that includes it.</p><p>Bill, like any of these CEOs, doesn't really <em>know stuff</em>, or even <em>do</em> stuff, he just <em>is. </em>The corporate equivalent of a stain on a carpet that nobody really knows how it got there, but hasn’t been removed. The modern executive is symbolic, and the media has — due to the large amount of Business Idiots running these outlets and middle managers stuffed into the editorial class — been trained to never ask difficult questions, such as "what the fuck are you talking about, Bill?" or even the humble "what does that mean?" or "how would you do that?" or saying "I'm not sure I understand, would you mind explaining?"</p><p>Perhaps the last part is the symptom of the overall problem. So many layers of editorial and managerial power are filled full of people that don't know anything, and there's never anyone crueler about ignorance than somebody that's ignorant themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Worse still, in many fields — journalism included — we are rarely rewarded for knowing things or being "right," but being right in the way that keeps the people with the keys from scraping them across our cars.&nbsp; We are, however, rewarded for saying <em>the right thing</em> at the <em>right time</em>, which more often than not means resembling our (white, male) superiors, speaking like our peers, and delivering results <em>in the way that makes everybody feel happiest.</em></p><hr><p>A great example of our vibes-based society was back in October 2021,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-new-anti-remote-propaganda-wants/"><u> where a Washington Post article written by two Harvard professors</u></a> rallied against remote work<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/microsofts-meaningless-remote-work/"><u> by citing a Microsoft-funded anti-remote study</u></a> and quoting 130-year-old economist Alfred Marshall about how "workers gather in dense clusters,"<a href="https://www.academia.edu/4446735/Race_and_Nation_in_Marshalls_Histories?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> ignoring the fact that Marshall was so racist they've had to write papers about it</u></a>,<a href="https://mises.org/wire/keynes-eugenics-race-and-population-control?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> how excited he was about eugenics</u></a>, <strong><em>or the fact he was writing about fucking factories.</em></strong></p><p>Remote work terrifies the Business Idiot, because it removes the performative layer that allowed them to stomp around and feel important, reducing their work to, well...work.<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-workers-prefer-remote-work-racist-office_l_60c8f805e4b0f7e7ccf59fa1?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> Office culture is inherently heteronormative and white</u></a>, and<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/report-black-women-less-likely-to-be-promoted-supported-by-their-managers?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> black women are less likely to be promoted by their managers</u></a>, and continuing the existence of "The Office" is all about making sure The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Removing the ability for the managerial hall monitors to look at you and try and work out what you're doing without ever really helping is a big part of being a manager — and if you're a manager reading this and saying you don't do this, I challenge you to talk to another person that doesn't confirm your biases.</p><p>The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Their existence holds up almost every public company, and remote work was the first time they willingly raised their heads. Google demanded employees return to the office in 2021 —<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-employees-angered-by-search-giants-hypocritical-remote-work-policies/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> but let one executive work remotely <em>from New Zealand</em></u></a><em> because absolutely none of the decisionmaking was done with people that actually do work.</em> While we can&nbsp; (well, you can, I'm not interested) debate whether <em>exclusively</em> working remote is as productive, the Return To Office push was almost entirely done in two ways:</p><ol><li>Executives demanding people return to the office.</li><li>Journalists asking executives if remote work was good or not, entirely ignoring the people <em>actually doing the work.</em></li></ol><p><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-anti-workforce/#:~:text=As%20I%20mentioned,and%20calls%20made."><u>The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and many, many other outlets</u></a> all fell for this crap because the Business Idiots have captured our media too, training even talented journalists to defer to power at every turn. When every power structure is stuffed full of do-nothing management types that have learned exactly as little as they need to as a means to get by, it's inevitable that journalism caters to them — specious, thoughtless reproductions of the powerful's ideas.</p><p>Look at the coverage of AI, or the<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/mark-zuckerberg-is-a-liar-and-hes/"><u> metaverse</u></a>, or<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-emperors-new-blockchain/"><u> cryptocurrency</u></a>, or<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/clubhouse-is-the-big-stinker-that/"><u> Clubhouse</u></a>. Look at how willingly reporters will accept narratives not based on practical experience or <em>what the technology can do</em>, but what the powerful (and the popular) are suddenly interested in. Every single tech bubble followed the same path, and that path was paved with flawed, deferential and specious journalism, from small blogs to the biggest mastheads.</p><p>Look at how reporters talk to executives — not just the way they ask things (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24158374/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-ai-search-gemini-future-of-the-internet-web-openai-decoder-interview?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>like Nilay Patel's 100+ word questions to Sundar Pichai</u></a> in his abominable interview), but the things they accept them saying, and the willingness reporters have to just accept what they're told. Satya Nadella is the CEO of a company with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. I have no idea how you, as a reporter, do not say "Satya, what the fuck? You're outsourcing most of your life to generative AI? That's insane!" or even "do you really do that?" and then asking further questions.</p><p>But that would get you in trouble. The editorial class <em>is</em> the managerial class now, and has spent decades mentoring young reporters to <em>not</em> ask questions, to <em>not </em>push back, to <em>believe </em>that a big, strong, powerful company CEO would never mislead them.<a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-miseducation-of-kara-swisher-ongweso?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> Kara Swisher's half-assed interviews</u></a> are considered "daring" and "critical" because journalism has, at large, lost its teeth, breeding reporters rewarded for knowing a little bit about a few things and punishing those who ask too many questions or refuse to fall in line.</p><p>The reason they don't want you to ask these questions is that the Business Idiot isn't big on answers. Editors that tell you not to push too hard are doing so because they know the executive likely won't have an answer. It isn't just about the PR person that trained them, but the fact that these men more often than not have only a glancing understanding of their underlying business.</p><p>Yet in the same way that Business Idiots penetrated every other part of society, they eventually found their way to journalism. While we can (and should) scream at<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-anti-economy/"><u> the disconnected idiots that ran Vice into the ground</u></a>, the problem is <em>everywhere</em>,<em> </em>because the Business Idiots aren't just at the top, but infecting the power structures underlying every newsroom.</p><p>While there are many really great editors, there are plenty more that barely understand the articles they edit, the stories they commission, or that make reporters pull punches for fear of advertiser blowback.</p><p>That, <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-myth-of-mentorship-and-how-weve/"><u>and mentorship is dead across effectively all parts of society</u></a>, meaning that most reporters (as with many jobs) learn by watching each other, which means they all make sure to not ask the rough questions, and not push too hard against the party/market/company messaging until everybody else does it.</p><p>And under these conditions, <em>Business Idiots thrive.</em></p><hr><p>The Business Idiot's reign is one of speciousness and shortcuts, of acquisition, of dominance and of theft. Mentoring people is something you do to pass on knowledge — it may make them <em>grateful</em> to you, but it ultimately, in the mind of a Business Idiot, creates a competitor or rival.&nbsp;</p><p>Investing in talent, or worker conditions, or even really <em>work</em> itself would require you to know what you're talking about, or actually do work, which doesn't make sense when you're talking to a worker. They're the ones who're meant to work! You're there to manage them! Yet they keep talking back — asking questions about the work you want them to do, asking <em>you</em> to step in and help on something — and all of that's so annoying. Just know the stuff already! Get it done! I have to go to lunch and then go back out to another lunch!&nbsp;</p><p>I believe this is the predominant mindset across most of the powerful, to the point that everything in the world is constructed to reaffirm their beliefs rather than follow any logical path. Our stock market is inherently illogical, driven not by whether a company is good or bad,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/"><u> but whether it can show growth</u></a>, even if said growth is horrifically unprofitable, and I'd argue it's because the market has no idea how to make <em>intelligent</em> decisions, just <em>complex</em> ones that mean that you don't really need to understand the business so much as you understand the associated vibes of the industry.</p><p>Friedman's influence and Reagan's policies have allowed our markets to be dominated by Business Idiocy, where a bad company can be a good stock because everybody (IE: other traders and the business press) likes how it looks, which allows the Business Idiots to continue making profit using illogical and partially-rigged market-making, with the business press helpfully pushing up their narratives.&nbsp;</p><p>This also keeps regular people from accumulating too much wealth — if regular people could set the tone for the markets as "a company that makes something people like and people pay them for it and they make more money than they spend," that might make things a little <em>too </em>even.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/coreweave-posts-sales-jump-in-first-quarter-since-ipo-d8eda266?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>It doesn't matter that CoreWeave quite literally does not have enough money for its capital expenditures and lost over $300m in the last quarter</u></a> because its<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/coreweaves-revenue-up-420-yoy-in-first-earnings-call-since-ipo/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> year-over-year growth was 420%</u></a>. It<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/core-incompetency/#:~:text=Problem%20Loan%20Number%202%3A%20DDTL%202.0"><u> doesn't matter that it has October loan payments that will crush the life out of the company either</u></a>. These narratives are fed to the media knowing that the media will print them, because thinking too hard about a stock would mean the Business Idiot had to think also, <em>and that is not why they are in this business.</em></p><p>The "AI trade" is the Business Idiot's nirvana — a fascination for a managerial class that long since gave up any kind of meaningful contribution to the bottom line, as moving away from the fundamental creation of value as a business naturally leads to the same kind of specious value that one finds from generative AI.</p><p>I’m not even saying that there’s no returns, or that LLMs don’t do anything, or even that there’s no possible commercial use for generative AI. They just don’t do enough, almost by design, and we’re watching companies desperately try and contort them into something, anything that works, pretending so fucking hard they’ll stake their entire futures on the idea. <em>Just fucking work, will you?</em> Agentforce doesn’t make any money, it sucks, but god damn is Marc Benioff going to make you bear witness.</p><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ai-giving-salesforce-boost?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Does it matter that Agentforce doesn't make Salesforce any money</u></a>? No! Because Benioff and Salesforce have got rich selling to fellow Business Idiots who then shove Salesforce into their organization without thinking about who would use it or how they'd use it other than in the most general ways. Agentforce was — and is — a fundamentally boring and insane product, charging $2 a conversation for a chatbot that, to quote The Information, provides customers with "...incorrect answers — AI hallucinations — while testing how the software handles customer service queries."</p><p>But this shit is <em>catnip</em> to the Business Idiot, because the Business Idiot ideally never has to deal with work, workers or customers. Generative AI doesn’t do enough to actually help us be better at our jobs, but it gives a good enough impression of something useful so that it can convince someone really stupid that doesn’t understand what you do that they don’t need you, sometimes.</p><p>A generative output is a kind of generic, soulless version of production, one that resembles exactly how a know-nothing executive or manager would summarise your work. OpenAI's "Deep Research" wows<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-ben-buchanan.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>professional Business Idiot Ezra Klein</u></a> because he doesn't seem to realize that part of research <em>is the research itself, not just the output</em>, as you <em>learn about stuff as you research a topic, allowing you to come to a conclusion.</em> The concept of an "agent" is the erotic dream of the managerial sect — a worker that they can personally command to generate product that they can say is their own, all without ever having to know or do anything other than the bare minimum of keeping up appearances, which is the entirety of the Business Idiot's resume.</p><p>And because the Business Idiot's career has been built on only knowing exactly enough to get by, they don't dig into Large Language Models any further than hammering away at ChatGPT and saying "we must put AI in everything<em> now.</em>" Yet the real problem is that for every Business Idiot selling a product, there are many more that will buy it, which has worked in the past for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies that<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/saaspocalypse-now/"> <u>grew fat and happy hocking giant annual contracts and continual upsells</u></a>, because CIOs and CTOs work for Business Idiot CEOs that demand that they "put AI in everything now," a nonsensical and desperate remit that's part growth-lust and part ignorance, borne of the fear that one gets when they're out of their depth.</p><p>Look at every single institution installing some sort of ChatGPT integration, and then look for the Business Idiot. Perhaps it's Cal State University Chanceller Mildred Garcia,<a href="https://www.calstate.edu/csu-system/news/Pages/CSU-AI-Powered-Initiative.aspx?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>who claimed</u></a> that giving everybody a ChatGPT subscription would "elevate...students' educational experience across all fields of study, empower [its] faculty's teaching and research, and help provide the highly educated workforce that will drive California's future AI-driven economy," a nonsensical series of words to justify<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jbyoder.org/post/3lpagmird5s2b?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>a $16.9 million-a-year single-vendor no-bid contract</u></a> to a product that is best known as either a shitty search engine or<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>a way to cheat at college</u></a>.</p><p>In some ways, Sam Altman is the Business Idiot's antichrist, taking advantage of a society where the powerful rarely know much other than what they want to control or dominate. ChatGPT and other AI tools are, for the most part, sold based on what they might do in the future to people that will never really use them, and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55L7HYUFg-c&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Altman has done well</u></a> to<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-ceo-altman-says-davos-future-ai-depends-energy-breakthrough-2024-01-16/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>manipulate</u></a>,<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/openai-ceo-sam-altman-ai-freedom-chatgpt/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>pester</u></a> and<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/31/tech/sam-altman-ai-risk-taker?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>terrify</u></a> those in power with the idea that they might miss out on <em>something.</em> Does anyone know what it is? No, they don't, because the powerful are Business Idiots too, willing to accept anything that somebody brings along that makes them feel good, or bad in a way that they can make headlines with.</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/05/04/governor-newsom-signs-blockchain-executive-order-to-spur-responsible-web3-innovation-grow-jobs-and-protect-consumers/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Hey, whatever happened to Gavin Newsom's Blockchain executive order</u></a>? Did that do anything?</blockquote><p>In any case, Altman's whole Sloppenheimer motif has worked wonders on the Business Idiots in the markets and global governments that fear what artificial intelligence could do, even if they can't really define artificial intelligence, or what it could do, or what they're scared of. The fear of China's "rise in AI" is one partially based on sinophobia, and partially based on the fact that China has their own Business Idiots willing to shove hundreds of millions of dollars into data centers.</p><p>Generative AI has created a reckoning between the Business Idiot and the rest of society, its forced adoption and proliferation providing a meager return for the massive investment of capital and the revulsion it causes in many people, not just in the Business Idiot's excitement in replacing them, but how <em>wrong the Business Idiot is.</em></p><p>While there are many people that dick around with ChatGPT, years since it launched we still can't find a clean way to say what it <em>does</em> or why it <em>matters</em> other than the fact that everybody agreed it did. The media, now piloted by Business Idiots, has found itself declawed, its reporters unprepared, unwilling and unsupported, the backbone torn out of most newsrooms for fear that being too critical is somehow "not being objective," despite the fact that <em>what you choose to cover objectively is still subjective.</em></p><p>Reporters still, to this day,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/"> <u>as these companies burn billions of dollars</u></a> to<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/"> <u>make an industry the size of the free-to-play gaming industry</u></a>, refuse to say things that bluntly because "the cost of inference is coming down" and "these companies have some of the smartest people in the world." They ignore the truth as it sits in front of them — <strong>that the combined annual recurring revenue of The Information's comprehensive database of every generative AI company is less than $10 billion,</strong> or <strong>$4 billion if you remove Anthropic and OpenAI.</strong></p><p>ChatGPT's popularity is the ultimate Business Idiot success story — the "fastest growing product in Silicon Valley history" that didn't grow because it was useful, or good, or able to do anything in particular, but because a media controlled by Business Idiots decided it was "the next big thing" and started talking about it nonstop since November 2022, guaranteeing that everybody would try it, even if even <strong>to this day</strong> the company can't really explain <em>what it is you're meant to use it for.</em></p><p>Much like the Business Idiot themselves, ChatGPT doesn't need to <em>do</em> anything specific. It just needs to make the right sounds at the right times to impress people that barely care what it does other than make them feel futuristic.</p><p>Real people — regular people, not Business Idiots, not middle managers, not executive coaches, not MBAs, not CEOs — have seen this for what it was early and often, but real people are seldom the ones with the keys, and the media — even the people writing good stuff — regularly fails to directly and clearly say what's going on.&nbsp;</p><p>The media is scared of doing the wrong thing — of "getting in trouble" with someone for "misquoting them" or "misreading what they said" — and in a society where in-depth knowledge is subordinate to knowing enough catchphrases, the fight often doesn't feel worth it even with an editor's blessing.</p><p>I also want to be clear that this goes far beyond <em>money.</em> Editors aren't just scared of advertisers being upset. They know that if narratives have to shift toward more critical, thoughtful coverage, they too will have to be more thoughtful and knowledgeable, which is rough when you are a Business Idiot and got there by editing the right people in a way that didn't help them in the slightest.</p><hr><p>Nothing about what I'm saying should suggest the Business Idiot is weak. In fact, Business Idiots are fully in control —<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/manager-work-life-changes/620096/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>we have too many managers</u></a>, and our most powerful positions are valorized for <em>not</em> knowing stuff, for having a <em>general</em> view that can "take the big picture," not realizing that a big picture <em>is usually made up of lots of little brush strokes.</em></p><p>Yet there are, eventually, consequences for everything being controlled by Business Idiots.</p><p>Our current society — an unfair, unjust one dominated by half-broken tech products that make their owners billions — is the real punishment wrought by growth, a brain drain in corporate society, one that leads it to doing illogical things and somehow making money. It doesn't make any fucking sense that generative AI got this big. The returns aren't there, the outcomes aren't there, and any sensible society would've put a gun to a ChatGPT and aggressively pulled the trigger.</p><p>Instead it's the symbolic future of capitalism — one that celebrates mediocrity and costs billions of dollars, every human work it can consume, and the destruction of our planet, all because everybody has kind of agreed that this is what they're all doing, with nobody able to give a convincing explanation of what that even is. Generative AI is revolting both in how overstated its abilities are and in how it continually tests how low a standard someone will take for a product, both in its outputs and in the desperate companies trying to integrate it into everything, and its proliferation throughout society and organizations is already fundamentally harmful.</p><p>We’re not just drowning in a sea of slop — we’re in a constant state of corporate AI beta tests, new “features” sprouting out of our products like new limbs that sometimes function normally but often attempt to strangle us. It’s unclear if companies forcing these products on us have contempt for us or simply don’t know what good looks like. Or perhaps it's both, with the Business Idiot resenting us for not scarfing down whatever they serve us, as that's what's worked before.&nbsp;</p><p>They don't really understand their customers — they understand <em>what a customer pays for </em>and <em>how a purchase is made</em>, you know, like the leaders of banks and asset managers during the subprime mortgage crisis didn't really think about whether people could <em>pay</em> those mortgages, just that they <em>needed a lot of them to put in a CDO.</em></p><p>The Business Idiot's economy is one built for other Business Idiots. They can only make things that sell to companies that must always be in flux — which is the preferred environment of the Business Idiot, because if they're not perpetually starting new initiatives and jumping on new "innovations," they'd actually have to interact with the underlying production of the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Does the software work? Sometimes! Do successful companies exist that sell like this? Sure! But look at today's software and tell me with a straight face that things <em>feel good to use.</em></p><p>And something like generative AI was inevitable: an industry claiming to change the world that never really does so, full of businesses that don’t function as businesses, full of flimflam and half-truths used to impress people who will likely never interact with it, or do so in only a passing way. By chasing out the people that actually build things in favour of the people that sell them, our economy is built on production puppetry — just like generative AI, and especially like ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p><p>These people are antithetical to what’s good in the world, and their power deprives us of happiness, the ability to thrive, and honestly any <em>true</em> innovation. The Business Idiot thrives on alienation — on distancing themselves from the customer and the thing they consume, and in many ways from society itself. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-destroyed-friendship-replace-ai-companions-loneliness-2025-5?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Mark Zuckerberg wants us to have fake friends</u></a>, <a href="https://www.inc.com/ben-sherry/sam-altman-says-ai-agents-will-transform-the-workforce-in-2025/91103146?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Sam Altman wants us to have fake colleagues</u></a>, and an increasingly loud group of executives salivate at the idea of replacing us with a fake version of us that will make a shittier version of what we make for a customer that said executive doesn’t fucking care about.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re building products for other people that don’t interact with the real world.

In a sense, the metaverse enables us to embed computing into the real world and to embed the real world into computing, bringing real presence to any digital space. For years, we’ve talked about creating this digital representation of the world, but now, we actually have the opportunity to go into that world and participate in it.”</blockquote><p>As Gralla notes, Nadella said Microsoft would be, “…beefing up development in projects such as its Mixed Reality Tool Kit MRTK, the virtual reality workspace project AltspaceVR (which it had bought back in 2017), its HoloLens virtual reality headset, and its industrial metaverse unit, among others,” before <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosemariemiller/2023/02/14/microsofts-industrial-metaverse-aspirations-can-wait/?sh=49b8c11a140a&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>firing all 100% members of its industrial Metaverse core team</u></a> <a href="https://redmondmag.com/articles/2023/01/24/microsoft-cuts-mixed-reality-toolkit-team-and-plans-to-end-altspacevr.aspx?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>along with those behind MRTK</u></a> and <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/microsoft-social-vr-xr-interface-layoffs/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>shutting down AltSpace VR (which it acquired in 2017)</u></a> in 2023, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259369/microsoft-hololens-2-discontinuation-support?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>before discontinuing HoloLens 2 entirely in 2024</u></a>.</p><p>Nadella was transparently copying <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/mark-zuckerberg-is-a-liar-and-hes/"><u>Meta and Mark Zuckerberg’s ridiculous “metaverse”</u></a> play, and <em>absolutely nothing happened to him as a result.</em> The media — outlets like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>The Verge</u></a> and independents like <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/microsoft-and-the-metaverse/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Ben Thompson</u></a> — happily boosted the metaverse idea when it was announced and conveniently forgot it the second that Microsoft and Meta wanted to talk about AI (no, really, both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24134370/mark-zuckerberg-meta-interview-llama-3-ai-assistant-race?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>The Verge </u></a>and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/interviews-with-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-and-cto-kevin-scott-about-the-ai-platform-shift/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Ben Thompson</u></a> were ready and waiting) without a second’s consideration about what was previously said.&nbsp;</p><p>A true Business Idiot never admits wrongdoing, and the more powerful the Business Idiot is, the more likely there are power structures that exist to avoid them having to do so. The media, captured by other Business Idiots, has become poisoned by power, deferring to its whims and ideals and treating CEOs with more respect, dignity and intelligence than anyone that works for them. When a big company decides they want to “do AI,” the natural reaction is to ask “how?” and write down the answer rather than think about whether it’s possible or whether the company might profit (say, by increasing their shareholder price) by having whatever they say printed ad verbatim.&nbsp;</p><p>These people aren’t challenged by the media, or their employees, because their employees are vulnerable all the time, and often encouraged to buy into whatever bullshit is du jour like hostages being held by a terrorist group that eventually fall victim to Stockholm syndrome. They’re only challenged by shareholders, who are agnostic about idiocy because it’s not core to value in any meaningful sense, as we’ve seen with crypto, the metaverse and AI, and shareholders will tolerate infinite levels of idiocy if it boosts the value of their holdings.&nbsp;</p><p>It goes further too. 2021 saw the largest amount of venture capital invested in the last decade, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/business/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a record-breaking $643 billion</u></a>, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/na-vc-startup-funding-2021-recap/?ref=wheresyoured.at#North%20America%20overall"><u>with a remarkable $329.5 billion of that invested in the US alone</u></a>.

In a just society, nobody would want to touch any of the C-suite that oversaw a company that handed out Nintendo Switches to literally anyone who booked a meeting (as with Lacework). Instead, the stank remains on the employees alone.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>One point about this: Meta’s most recent layoffs were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-low-performance-cuts-review-cycle-politics-2025-4?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>explicitly said to target low-performers</u></a>, needlessly harming the future job prospects of those handed a pink slip in an already fucked tech job market. It was cruel and pointless and — I’m certain — a big fat lie. <p>Meta is spending big on AI, has spent big on the metaverse (which went nowhere), and owns two dying platforms (Instagram and Facebook) and one that’s hard to monetize (WhatsApp). It needs to get costs down and improve margins. Layoffs are one way to do that. And things are getting bad enough that Meta is now, </p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-asked-amazon-microsoft-help-fund-llama?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>according to The Information</u></a>, walking around Silicon Valley begging other big tech companies for money to train their open source “Llama” LLM.<p>The “low-performer” jibe is an unnecessary twist of the knife, demonstrating that Meta would happily throw its workers under the bus if it serves their interests — because the optics of firing low-performers is different to, say, firing a bunch of people because you keep spunking money on dead-end vanity projects and me-too products that nobody wants or uses.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, I add, owns an island on Hawaii. The idea that he even thinks this much about Meta is disgraceful. Go outside, you fucking freak.</p></blockquote><p>It’s so easy, and perhaps inevitable, to feel a sense of nihilism about it all. Nothing matters. It’s all symbolic. Our world is filled with companies run by people who don’t interact with the business, and that raise money from venture capitalists that neither run businesses nor really have any experience doing so. And despite the fact that these people exist several abstractions from reality, the things that they do and the decisions they make impact us all. And it’s hard to imagine how to fix it.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>We live in a system of iniquity, dominated by people that do not interact with the real world who have created an entire system run by their fellow Business Idiots. <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/"><u>The Rot Economy’s</u></a> growth-at-all-costs mania is a symptom of the grander problem of <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/tss/"><u>shareholder supremacy</u></a>, and the single-minded economic focus on shareholder value inevitably ends at an economy run by <em>and for</em> Business Idiots. There is a line, and it ends here — with layoffs, the destruction of our planet and our economy and our society, and a rising tide of human misery that nobody really knows where it comes from, and so, we don’t know who to blame, and for what.</p><p>If our economy actually worked as a true meritocracy — where we didn’t have companies run by people who don’t use their products or understand how they’re made, and who hire similarly-specious people — these people would collapse under the pressure of having to know their ass from their earhole.</p><p>Yet none of this would be possible without the enabling layers, and those layers are teeming with both Business Idiots and those unfortunate enough to have learned from them. The tech media has enabled every single bubble, without exception, accepting every single narrative fed to them by VCs and startups, with even critical reporters still accepting <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/"><u>the lunacy of a company like </u></a>OpenAI just because everybody else does too.</p><p>Let’s be honest, when you remove all the money, our current tech industry is a disgrace.</p><p>Our economy is held up by NVIDIA, a company that makes most of its money selling GPUs to other companies primarily so that they can start losing the money selling software that might eventually make them money, just not today. NVIDIA is defined by massive peaks and valleys, as it jumps on trends and bandwagons at the right time, despite knowing that these bandwagons always come to an abrupt halt.</p><p>The other companies feature Tesla, a meme stock car company with a deteriorating brand and a chief executive famous for his divorces from both reality and multiple women along with a flagrant racism that may cost the company its life.

Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn’t matter, because <em>their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success.&nbsp;</em></p><p>These people don’t want to automate <em>work</em>, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing — living! — is beneath them, or at least <em>your </em>lives and <em>your</em> wants and <em>your </em>joy are. They don’t want to plan their kids’ birthday parties. They don’t want to research things. They don’t value culture or art or beauty. They want to skip to the end, hit fast-forward on anything, because human struggle is for the poor or unworthy.&nbsp;</p><p>When you are steeped in privilege and/or have earned everything through a mixture of stolen labor and office pantomime, the idea of “effort” is always negative. The process of creation — or affection, of love, of kindness, of using time not just for an action or output — is disgusting to the Business Idiot, because those are times they could be focused on themselves, or some nebulous self-serving “vision” that is, when stripped back to its fundamental truth, is either moronic or malevolent. They don’t realise that you hire a worker for the worker’s work rather than just the work themselves, which is why they don’t see why it’s so insulting to outsource their interactions with human beings.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll notice these people never bring up examples of automating actual work — the mind-numbing grunt work that we all face in the workplace — because they neither know nor care what that is. Their “problems” are the things that frustrate them, like dealing with other people, or existing outside of the gilded circles of socialite fucks or plutocrats, or just things that are an inevitable facet of working life, like reading an email. Your son’s birthday party or <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/using-chatgpt-for-interpersonal-relationship-advice/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a conflict with a friend can</u></a>, indeed, be stressful, but these are not problems to be automated out. They are the struggles that make us human, the things that make us grow, the things that make us who we are, which isn’t a problem for anybody other than <em>somebody who doesn’t believe they need to change in any way. </em>It's both powerful and powerless at the same time — a nihilistic way of seeing our lives as a collection of events we accept or dismiss like a system prompt, the desperate pursuit of such efficient living that you barely feel a thing until you die.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve spent years writing about these people without giving them a name, because categorizing anything is difficult. I can’t tell you how long it took for me to synthesize the Rot Economy from the broader trends I saw in tech and elsewhere, how long it took for me to thread that particular needle, to identify the various threads that unified events that are otherwise separate and distinct.</p><p>I am but one person. Everything you’ve read in my newsletter to this point has been something I’ve had to learn. Building an argument and turning it into words — often at the same time — that other people will read doesn’t come naturally to <em>anyone</em>. It’s something you have to deliberately work at.&nbsp; It’s imperfect. There are typos. These newsletters increase in length and breadth and have so many links, and I will never, ever change my process, because part of said process is learning, relearning, processing, getting pissed off, writing, rewriting, and so on and so forth.&nbsp;</p><p>This process makes what I do possible, and the idea of having someone automate it disgusts me, not because I’m special or important, but because my work is not the result of me reading a bunch of links or writing a bunch of words. This piece is not just 13,000 words long — it’s the result of the 800,000 or more words I wrote before it, the hundreds of stories I’ve read in the past, the hours of conversations with friends and editors, years of accumulating knowledge and, yes, growing with the work itself.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not something that you create through a summation of content vomited by an AI, but the chaotic histories of a human being mashed against the challenge of trying to process it. Anyone who believes otherwise is a fucking moron — or, better put, just another Business Idiot.</p>

<p>Project Manager for Zettawatt-Equivalent Ultrashort Pulse Laser System (ZEUS)</p>
</div></div>
</div>



<p>The ZEUS laser facility at the University of Michigan has roughly doubled the peak power of any other laser in the U.S. with its first official experiment at 2 petawatts (2 quadrillion watts).&nbsp;</p>



<p>At more than 100 times the global electricity power output, this huge power lasts only for the brief duration of its laser pulse—just 25 quintillionths of a second long.</p>



<p>“This milestone marks the beginning of experiments that move into unexplored territory for American high field science,” said <a href="https://ners.engin.umich.edu/people/krushelnick-karl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Karl Krushelnick</a>, director of the Gérard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science, which houses ZEUS.</p>



<p>Research at ZEUS will have <a href="https://news.engin.umich.edu/2019/09/most-powerful-laser-in-the-us-to-be-built-at-michigan/">applications in medicine, national security, materials science and astrophysics, in addition to plasma science and quantum physics</a>. Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, ZEUS is a user facility—meaning that research teams from all over the country and internationally can submit experiment proposals that go through an independent selection process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the great things about ZEUS is it’s not just one big laser hammer, but you can split the light into multiple beams,” said <a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/fdollar/lab-members/franklin-dollar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Franklin Dollar</a>, professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, whose team is running the first user experiment at 2 petawatts. “Having a national resource like this, which awards time to users whose experimental concepts are most promising for advancing scientific priorities, is really bringing high-intensity laser science back to the U.S.”</p>



<div>




<p>Dollar’s team and the ZEUS team aim to produce electron beams with energies equivalent to those made in particle accelerators that are hundreds of meters in length.&nbsp; This would be 5-10 times higher energy than any electron beams previously produced at the ZEUS facility.</p>
</div>



<p>“We aim to reach higher electron energies using two separate laser beams—one to form a guiding channel and the other to accelerate electrons through it,” said <a href="https://cuos.engin.umich.edu/researchgroups/hfs/profiles/anatoly-maksimchuk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anatoly Maksimchuk</a>, U-M research scientist in electrical and computer engineering, who leads the development of the experimental areas.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="672" height="448" src="https://news.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ti-sapph-crystal-2PWLaser.jpg" alt="The circular glass optics and silvery metal mounts that create the laser path appear tinted pink through the round window of the crystal." srcset="https://news.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ti-sapph-crystal-2PWLaser.jpg 672w, https://news.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ti-sapph-crystal-2PWLaser-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ti-sapph-crystal-2PWLaser-120x80.jpg 120w, https://news.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ti-sapph-crystal-2PWLaser-500x333.jpg 500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px"><figcaption>A view through the titanium-sapphire crystal that helps to transfer power into ZEUS’s laser pulses.

<p>They hope to do this in part with a redesigned target. They lengthened the cell that holds the gas that the laser pulse rams into, helium in this experiment. This interaction produces plasma, ripping electrons off the atoms so that the gas becomes a soup of free electrons and positively charged ions. Those electrons get accelerated behind the laser pulse-like wakesurfers close behind a speedboat, a phenomenon called wakefield acceleration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Light moves slower through plasma, enabling the electrons to catch up to it. In a less dense, longer target, the electrons spend more time accelerating before they catch up to the laser pulse, enabling them to hit higher top speeds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This demonstration of ZEUS’s power paves the way for the signature experiment, expected later this year, when the accelerated electrons will collide with laser pulses coming the opposite way. In the moving frame of the electrons, the 3-petawatt laser pulse will seem to be a million times more powerful—a zettawatt-scale pulse. This gives ZEUS its full name of “Zettawatt Equivalent Ultrashort laser pulse System.”</p>



<p>“The fundamental research done at the NSF ZEUS facility has many possible applications, including better imaging methods for soft tissues and advancing the technology used to treat cancer and other diseases,” said Vyacheslav Lukin, program director in the NSF Division of Physics, which oversees the ZEUS project. “Scientists using the unique capabilities of ZEUS will expand the frontiers of human knowledge in new ways and provide new opportunities for American innovation and economic growth.”</p>



<p>The ZEUS facility fits in a space similar in size to a school gymnasium. At one corner of the room, a laser produces the initial infrared pulse. Optical devices called diffraction gratings stretch it out in time so that when the pump lasers dump power into the pulse, it doesn’t get so intense that it starts tearing the air apart. At its biggest, the pulse is 12 inches across and a few feet long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After four rounds of pump lasers adding energy, the pulse enters the vacuum chambers. Another set of gratings flattens it to a 12-inch disk that is just 8 microns thick—about 10 times thinner than a piece of printer paper. Even at 12 inches across, its intensity could turn the air into plasma, but then it is focused down to 0.8 microns wide to deliver maximum intensity to the experiments.</p>

<p>“As a midscale-sized facility, we can operate more nimbly than large-scale facilities like particle accelerators or the National Ignition Facility,” said <a href="https://cuos.engin.umich.edu/researchgroups/hfs/profiles/john-nees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Nees</a>, U-M research scientist in electrical and computer engineering, who leads the ZEUS laser construction. “This openness attracts new ideas from a broader community of scientists.”</p>



<p>The road to 2 petawatts has been slow and careful. Just getting the pieces they need to assemble the system has been harder than expected. The biggest challenge is a sapphire crystal, infused with titanium atoms. Almost 7 inches in diameter, it is the critical component of the final amplifier of the system, which brings the laser pulse to full power.</p>

<p>“The crystal that we’re going to get in the summer will get us to 3 petawatts, and it took four and a half years to manufacture,” said <a href="https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/people/bayer-franko/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Franko Bayer</a>, project manager for ZEUS. “The size of the titanium sapphire crystal we have, there are only a few in the world.”</p>



<p>In the meantime, jumping from the 300 terawatt power of the previous HERCULES laser to just 1 petawatt on ZEUS resulted in worrying darkening of the gratings. First, they had to determine the cause: Were they permanently damaged or just darkened by carbon deposits from the powerful beam tearing up molecules floating in the imperfect vacuum chamber?&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it turned out to be carbon deposits, Nees and the laser team had to figure out how many laser shots could run safely between cleanings. If the gratings became too dark, they could distort the laser pulses in a way that damages optics further along the path.</p>

This test reveals any potentially damaging hot spots in the expanded laser pulse as it enters the compressor that will shrink it into a tiny, intense and powerful laser pulse. The lines come from imperfections in the final amplifying crystal, which must be replaced before ZEUS can reach its full power of 3 petawatts. At two petawatts, ZEUS is now the most powerful laser in the U.S. Photo: Marcin Szczepanski/Michigan Engineering</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, the ZEUS team has already spent a total of 15 months running user experiments since the grand opening in October 2023 because there is still plenty of science that could be done with a 1 petawatt laser. So far, it has welcomed 11 separate experiments with a total of 58 experimenters from 22 institutions, including international researchers. Over the next year—between user experiments—the ZEUS team will continue upgrading the system toward its full power.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Discord has evolved from a gaming-focused communication tool into a versatile platform supporting diverse online communities. Despite its large user base and active public servers, academic research on Discord remains limited due to data accessibility challenges. This paper introduces Discord Unveiled: A Comprehensive Dataset of Public Communication (2015-2024), the most extensive Discord public server's data to date. The dataset comprises over 2.05 billion messages from 4.74 million users across 3,167 public servers, representing approximately 10% of servers listed in Discord's Discovery feature. Spanning from Discord's launch in 2015 to the end of 2024, it offers a robust temporal and thematic framework for analyzing decentralized moderation, community governance, information dissemination, and social dynamics. Data was collected through Discord's public API, adhering to ethical guidelines and privacy standards via anonymization techniques. Organized into structured JSON files, the dataset facilitates seamless integration with computational social science methodologies. Preliminary analyses reveal significant trends in user engagement, bot utilization, and linguistic diversity, with English predominating alongside substantial representations of Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Additionally, prevalent community themes such as social, art, music, and memes highlight Discord's expansion beyond its gaming origins.

            <pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 14:21:10 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/devstral">https://mistral.ai/news/devstral</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44051733">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Today we introduce Devstral, our agentic LLM for software engineering tasks. Devstral is built under a collaboration between Mistral AI and <a href="https://www.all-hands.dev/">All Hands AI</a> 🙌, and outperforms all open-source models on SWE-Bench Verified by a large margin. We release Devstral under the Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://cms.mistral.ai/assets/a8f418f6-f7ee-4f21-8ab8-08bd76c37186.png?width=1600&amp;height=882" alt="Devstral Swe"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Agentic LLMs for software development</h2>
<p dir="ltr">While typical LLMs are excellent at atomic coding tasks such as writing standalone functions or code completion, they currently struggle to solve real-world software engineering problems. Real-world development requires contextualising code within a large codebase, identifying relationships between disparate components, and identifying subtle bugs in intricate functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral is designed to tackle this problem. Devstral is trained to solve real GitHub issues; it runs over code agent scaffolds such as OpenHands or SWE-Agent, which define the interface between the model and the test cases. Here, we show Devstral’s performance on the popular SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, a dataset of 500 real-world GitHub issues which have been manually screened for correctness.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral achieves a score of 46.8% on SWE-Bench Verified, outperforming prior open-source SoTA models by more than 6% points. When evaluated under the same test scaffold (OpenHands, provided by <a href="https://www.all-hands.dev/">All Hands AI</a> 🙌), Devstral exceeds far larger models such as Deepseek-V3-0324 (671B) and Qwen3 232B-A22B.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the table below, we also compare Devstral to closed and open models evaluated under any scaffold (including ones custom for the model). Here, we find that Devstral achieves substantially better performance than a number of closed-source alternatives. For example, Devstral surpasses the recent GPT-4.1-mini by over 20%.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 dir="ltr">Versatile: local deployment ↔️ enterprise use ↔️ copilots</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral is light enough to run on a single RTX 4090 or a Mac with 32GB RAM, making it an ideal choice for local deployment and on-device use. Coding platforms such as <a href="https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands">OpenHands</a> can allow the model to interact with local codebases and provide fast resolution to issues. To try it yourself, view the <a href="https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/llms/local-llms">documentation</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV9tAkS2Xic">tutorial video</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The performance of the model also makes it a suitable choice for agentic coding on privacy-sensitive repositories in enterprises, especially ones subject to stringent security and compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, if you’re building or using an agentic coding IDE, plugin, or environment, Devstral is a great choice to add to your model selector.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Availability</h2>
<p dir="ltr">We release this model for free under an Apache 2.0 license for the community to build on, customize, and accelerate autonomous software development. To try it for yourself, head over to our <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505">model card</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The model is also available on our API under the name devstral-small-2505 at the same price as Mistral Small 3.1: $0.1/M input tokens and $0.3/M output tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Should you choose to self-deploy, you can download the model on <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2505">HuggingFace</a>, <a href="https://ollama.com/library/devstral">Ollama</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/models/mistral-ai/devstral-small-2505">Kaggle</a>, <a href="https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/devstral">Unsloth</a>, <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/model/devstral-small-2505-MLX">LM Studio</a>&nbsp;starting today.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For enterprise deployments that require fine-tuning on private codebases, or higher-fidelity customization such as continued pre-training or distilling Devstral’s capabilities into other models, please <a href="https://mistral.ai/contact">contact us</a> to connect with our applied AI team.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What’s next</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral is a research preview and we welcome feedback! We’re hard at work building a larger agentic coding model that will be available in the coming weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Interested in discussing how we can help your team put Devstral to use, and about our portfolio of models, products and solutions? <a href="https://mistral.ai/contact">Contact us</a> and we’ll be happy to help.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Here are 5 factors that make a bigger difference to software development outcomes than “A.I.” coding assistants, but teams don’t address because they’re “old news, granddad!”</p>



<ul>
<li>Smaller teams are better value/$ spent</li>



<li>More frequent releases accelerate learning what has real value</li>



<li>Limiting work in progress – solving one problem at a time – increases delivery throughput</li>



<li>Cross-functional teams experience fewer bottlenecks and blockers than specialised teams</li>



<li>Empowered, self-organising teams spend less time waiting for decisions and more time getting sh*t done</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, I appreciate that every one of these is a can of worms that many organisations simply do not wish to open. They all have deep implications, and require foundational changes not just to the way we work, but the way we <em>think</em>.</p>



<p>For example, smaller, more frequent releases implies software’s in a shippable state more often, which implies faster build &amp; test cycles… and down the rabbit hole we go: into testing pyramids and separation of concerns and micro-cycles with continuous testing, continuous integration, continuous code review and… Come to think of it, <a href="https://codemanship.co.uk/">the stuff I teach</a> 🙂</p>



<p>Another example, empowering teams requires a pretty high level of psychological safety. When people are afraid to fail, they’re afraid to <em>try </em>– to make calls, to take initiative, to just f-ing do it! The culture of an organisation, which may have evolved over many years, is a hard thing to reshape. There’s often a lot of unspoken rules – sure, you <em>say </em>your door is always open, but… It takes much work and many iterations to shift those underlying patterns in the way we interact.</p>



<p>But waiting on the other side of that long journey is a high capability to rapidly and sustainably create and adapt working software that meets rapidly-changing business needs. Software agility Nirvana.</p>



<p>We already know from the data (e.g., DORA) that “A.I.” coding assistants don’t unlock that door.</p>

    <section>
        <p><em>By Terts Diepraam</em></p>
<p>We are working on an embedded scripting language for Rust. This language, called <a href="https://github.com/NLnetLabs/roto?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">Roto</a>, aims to be a simple yet fast and reliable scripting language for Rust applications.</p>
<p>The need for Roto comes from <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/routing/rotonda/?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">Rotonda</a>, our BGP engine written in Rust. Mature BGP applications usually feature some way to filter incoming route announcements. The complexity of these filters often exceed the capabilities of configuration languages. With Rotonda, we want to allow our users to write more complex filters with ease. So we decided to give them the power of a full scripting language.</p>
<p>We have some hard requirements for this language. First, we need these filters to be fast. Second, Rotonda is critical infrastructure and so runtime crashes are unacceptable. This rules out dynamically typed languages, of which there are plenty in the Rust community.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> We want a statically typed language which can give us more type safety and speed. Finally, we want a language that is easy to pick up; it should feel like a statically typed version of scripting languages you're used to.</p>
<p>Roto fills this niche for us. In short, it's a statically typed, JIT compiled, hot-reloadable, embedded scripting language. To get good performance, Roto scripts are compiled to machine code at runtime with the <a href="https://cranelift.dev/?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">cranelift</a> compiler backend.</p>
<p>Below is a small sample of a Roto script. In this script, we define a <code>filtermap</code>, which results in either <code>accept</code> or <code>reject</code>. In this case, we <code>accept</code> when the IP address is within the given range.</p>
<pre><code>filtermap within_range(range: AddrRange, ip: IpAddr) {
    if range.contains(ip) {
        accept ip
    } else {
        reject
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of a <code>filtermap</code>, we could instead write a more conventional <code>function</code>, which can simply <code>return</code> a value. The <code>filtermap</code> is a construct that Roto supports to make writing filters easier.</p>
<p>The Roto code there might look quite simple, but there's a twist: <code>AddrRange</code> is not a built-in type. Instead, it is added to Roto by the host application (e.g. Rotonda), making it available for use in the script.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Similarly, the <code>contains</code> method on <code>AddrRange</code> is provided by the host application as well. The full code necessary to run the script above is listed below. This example is also available <a href="https://github.com/NLnetLabs/roto/blob/a4edc7fcea79a2498798f69da4cdb9beb6ecd4d1/examples/addr_range.rs?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">on our GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<pre><code>use std::net::IpAddr;
use std::path::Path;
use roto::{roto_method, FileTree, Runtime, Val, Verdict};

#[derive(Clone)]
struct AddrRange {
    min: IpAddr,
    max: IpAddr,
}

fn run_script(path: &amp;Path) {
    // Create a runtime
    let mut runtime = Runtime::new();
    
    // Register the AddrRange type into the runtime with a docstring
    runtime
        .register_clone_type::&lt;AddrRange&gt;("A range of IP addresses")
        .unwrap();
    
    // Register the contains method on AddrRange
    #[roto_method(runtime, AddrRange)]
    fn contains(range: &amp;AddrRange, addr: &amp;IpAddr) -&gt; bool {
        range.min &lt;= addr &amp;&amp; addr &lt;= range.max
    }
    
    // Compile the program
    let program =
        FileTree::read(path).compile(runtime).unwrap();

    // Extract the Roto filtermap, which is accessed as a function
    let function = program
        .get_function::&lt;(), (Val&lt;AddrRange&gt;, IpAddr), Verdict&lt;IpAddr, ()&gt;&gt;(
          "within_range"
        )
        .unwrap();
    
    // Run the filtermap
    let range = AddrRange {
        min: "10.10.10.10".parse().unwrap(),
        max: "10.10.10.12".parse().unwrap(),
    };

    let in_range = "10.10.10.11".parse().unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", function.call(&amp;mut (), range, in_range)));

    let out_of_range = "10.10.11.10".parse().unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", function.call(&amp;mut (), range, out_of_range));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that nothing in the script is run automatically when the script is loaded, as happens in many other scripting language. The host application decides which functions and filtermaps it extracts from the script and when to run them.</p>
<p>Roto is very tightly integrated with Rust. Many Rust types<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, methods and functions can be registered directly for use in Roto. These types can be passed to Roto at negligible cost; there is no serialization between Roto and Rust. For Rotonda, this means that Roto can operate on raw BGP messages without costly conversion procedures.</p>
<p>The registration mechanism also ensures that Roto is not limited to Rotonda and could easily be used outside that context. It is designed as a general scripting or plug-in language.</p>
<p>We have many planned features on the roadmap for Roto and will continue to improve this language. This also means that the language should not be considered stable, though we'd love to hear feedback if you experiment with it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs">/r/ExperiencedDevs</a> subreddit! We hope you will find this as a valuable resource in your journeys down the fruitful CS/IT career paths. This community leans towards being a specialized subreddit facilitating discussion amongst individuals who have gained some ground in the IT world. </p>

<p>For an idea of what is encouraged in this subreddit and what is not (please report anything that does not follow the rules):</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/about/rules/">Rules</a></h2>

<p><strong>1. Do not participate unless experienced (3+ years)</strong></p>

<p>If you have less than 3 years of experience as a developer, do not make a post, nor participate in comments threads except for the weekly “Ask Experienced Devs” auto-thread. No exceptions.</p>

<p><strong>2. No Disrespectful Language or Conduct</strong></p>

<p>Don’t be a jerk. Act maturely. No racism, unnecessarily foul language, ad hominem charges, sexism - none of these are tolerated here. This includes posts that could be interpreted as trolling, such as complaining about DEI (Diversity) initiatives or people of a specific sex or background at your company.</p>

<p>Do not submit posts or comments that break, or promote breaking the Reddit Terms and Conditions or Content Policy or any other Reddit policy.</p>

<p>Violations = Warning, 7-Day Ban, Permanent Ban.</p>

<p><strong>3. No General Career Advice</strong></p>

<p>This sub is for discussing issues specific to experienced developers. </p>

<p>Any career advice thread must contain questions and/or discussions that notably benefit from the participation of experienced developers. Career advice threads may be removed at the moderators discretion based on response to the thread."</p>

<p>General rule of thumb: If the advice you are giving (or seeking) could apply to a “Senior Chemical Engineer”, it’s not appropriate for this sub.</p>

<p><strong>4. No "Which Offer Should I Take" Posts</strong></p>

<p>Asking if you should ask for a raise, switch companies (“should I work for company A or company B”), “should I take offer A or offer B”, or related questions, is not appropriate for this sub. </p>

<p>This includes almost any discussion about a “hot market”, comparing compensation between companies, etc.</p>

<p><strong>5. No “What Should I Learn” Questions</strong></p>

<p>No questions like “Should I learn C#” or “Should I switch jobs into a language I don’t know?”</p>

<p>Discussion about industry direction or upcoming technologies is fine, just frame your question as part of a larger discussion (“What have you had more success with, RDBMS or NoSQL?”) and you’ll be fine.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Don’t make it about you/yourself.</p>

<p><strong>6. No “I hate X types of interviews" Posts</strong></p>

<p>This has been re-hashed over and over again. There is no interesting/new content coming out.</p>

<p>It might be OK to talk about the merits of an interview process, or compare what has been successful at your company, but if it ends up just turning into complaints your post might still be removed.</p>
