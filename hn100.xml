   <p>Police in Kansas have returned cellphones, computers and other equipment to the Marion County Record, less than a week after a raid on the small-town newspaper was widely criticized as a likely violation of federal law.</p>   <p>In another development, news emerged that Magistrate Judge Laura Viar, who signed the search warrant allowing police to seize the equipment, was arrested at least twice for driving under the influence. Those 2012 arrests came months apart in two counties — and it's not clear how much information was shared between officials at the time, <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article278237263.html">The Wichita Eagle</a> reports. (See below for more on the allegations.)</p>

   <p>The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/14/1193676139/newspaper-marion-county-kansas-police-raid-first-amendment">extraordinary Aug. 11 raid</a> drew national and international headlines because it seemed to run counter to long-established press freedoms and guarantees. Such actions are nearly unheard of in the U.S.</p>   <p>"It's very rare because it's illegal," First Amendment attorney Lynn Oberlander told NPR. "It doesn't happen very often because most organizations understand that it's illegal." </p>   <p>Here's a quick recap of where things stand:</p>   <h3>DUI records have been pivotal to the case in Marion</h3>   <p>It was a confidential tip to the Record about the DUI history of Kari Newell, a local restaurant and catering company owner, that set incidents in motion. <a href="http://marionrecord.com/direct/updated_illegal_raids_contribute_to_death_of_newspaper_co_owner+5447raid+555044415445443a20496c6c6567616c20726169647320636f6e7472696275746520746f206465617468206f66206e657773706170657220636f2d6f776e65723c212d2d2d2d3e?">The paper says</a> it confirmed Newell had lost her driver's license, using a public website. </p>   <p>But the Record opted not to publish the information, choosing instead to inform Marion County Sheriff Jeff Soyez and city police Chief Gideon Cody about the source's allegation that officers were aware a local resident couldn't legally drive but were ignoring issues with their license. The paper says it didn't use Newell's name.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1194429207" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Days later, Newell publicly accused the Record of feeding the information to a councilwoman, Ruth Herbel. The paper says the same source who made the initial allegation also sent the information to Herbel.</p>   <p>Police then raided the Kansas newspaper after obtaining a search warrant from Viar citing a criminal investigation into "identity theft," regarding Newell's records found online. Officers also seized devices at Herbel's home.</p>   <p>Newspaper staffers scrambled to <a href="https://www.kcur.org/news/2023-08-16/marion-county-record-kansas-newspaper-police-raid-new-issue">cobble together enough equipment</a> to produce its regular Wednesday edition.</p>   <div data-crop-type="" id="res1194428802">

   <h3>Judge who signed warrant is under scrutiny</h3>   <p>The judge was arrested twice in 2012 — once on Jan. 25 in Coffey County and again on Aug. 6 in Morris County. At the time, Viar's last name was Allen and she was working as the top prosecutor in Morris County.</p>   <p>In the first arrest, Viar "was charged and entered a diversion agreement — which was extended six months because she refused to get an alcohol and drug evaluation and stopped communicating with her lawyer," <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article278237263.html">according to the Eagle</a>.</p>   
   <p>She was arrested again months later, this time in her home county. </p>   <p>"Officials say she was driving Morris County Magistrate Judge Thomas Ball's vehicle, when she ran off the road and hit a shed near the Council Grove football field," TV station WIBW <a href="http://membersof the Morris County Anti-Drug Task Force.">reported in 2012</a>, adding that at the time, the prosecutor was on the Morris County Anti-Drug Task Force.</p>   <p>"She was charged with DUI, reckless driving and refusal to take a preliminary breathalyzer,"  the <a href="http://www.emporiagazette.com/news/article_fdd3352e-b22f-59d6-82d4-34e86e5666a5.html">Emporia Gazette reported</a> at the time.</p>   <p>Despite those issues, Viar was reelected as county prosecutor several times. In late 2022, she was <a href="https://www.wibw.com/2022/11/21/morris-co-welcome-new-magistrate-judge-bench/">chosen to fill a slot</a> as a magistrate judge in the 8th Judicial District after the sitting judge retired.</p>   <p>Reporting on the 2012 charges this week, the Wichita Eagle said it was unclear how Viar's DUI cases were resolved or whether officials in either county were aware of her arrest in another jurisdiction.</p>   <h3>Newspaper looked into police chief's background</h3>   <p>Meyer said the Record <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/14/1193813087/kansas-newspaper-raid-police-chief-investigation">looked into allegations of misconduct</a> against Cody, who was sworn in on June 1 after retiring from the Kansas City Police Department,  based on anonymous tips from several of his former colleagues.</p>   <p>Meyer said a Record reporter approached Cody seeking comment about the allegations and in response Cody threatened to sue the paper.</p>   <p>Cody declined to confirm whether he threatened to sue the paper or whether the raid was linked to the paper looking into his background.</p>   <p>Meyer said Cody "has reason to not like us," but said he didn't know if there was a connection between his paper's reporting and the raid.</p>   <h3>The Kansas Bureau of Investigation took over the case </h3>   <p>The state agency began leading the investigation into alleged identity theft on Monday. Just two days later, the KBI said it would "coordinate the prompt return of all seized items." </p>   <p>The equipment and devices were returned "without review or examination," the bureau said.</p>   
   <p><a href="http://marionrecord.com/direct/newspaper_equipment_returned+5448breaking+4e65777370617065722065717569706d656e742072657475726e65643c212d2d2d2d3e?">The Record says</a> it reached a deal with investigators to turn the gear over to a forensic investigator to confirm whether the equipment had been reviewed or examined before it is put back into service.</p>   <p>Marion County Attorney Joel Ensley, who <a href="https://www.8thjd.com/DocumentCenter/View/610/Motion-and-Order-to-Release-Evidence-Seized">formally requested</a> for the judge to release the newspaper's items, <a href="https://www.kansas.gov/kbi/docs/media%20releases/2023/Media%20Release%20-%20UPDATE%20in%20Marion%20County%20Investigation.pdf">said in a written statement</a> issued by the KBI that he made the decision after he "reviewed in detail" the warrant application on Monday that had led to last Friday's raid.</p>   <p>Ensley said he concluded that "insufficient evidence exists" to establish a link between the alleged crimes and the places that were searched and the equipment that was seized.</p>   <p><em>NPR's Danielle Kaye and David Folkenflik contributed to this report.</em></p>

<p>Renewable energy production is almost entirely aimed at the generation of electricity. However, we use more energy in the form of heat, which solar panels and wind turbines can produce only indirectly and relatively inefficiently. A solar thermal collector skips the conversion to electricity and supplies renewable thermal energy in a direct and more efficient way.</p>
<p>Much less known is that a mechanical windmill can do the same in a windy climate – by oversizing its brake system, a windmill can generate lots of direct heat through friction. A mechanical windmill can also be coupled to a mechanical heat pump, which can be cheaper than using a gas boiler or an electric heat pump driven by a wind turbine.</p>
<h2 id="heat-versus-electricity">Heat versus Electricity</h2>
<p>On a global scale, thermal energy demand corresponds to one third of the primary energy supply, while electricity demand is only one-fifth. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> In temperate or cold climates, the share of thermal energy is even higher. For example in the UK, heat counts for almost half of total energy use. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> If we only look at households, thermal energy for space and water heating in temperate and cold climates can be 60-80% of total domestic energy demand. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In spite of this, renewable energy sources play a negligible role in heat production. The main exception is the traditional use of biomass for cooking and heating – but in the “developed” world even biomass is often used to produce electricity instead of heat. The use of direct solar heat and geothermal heat provide less than 1% and 0.2% of global heat demand, respectively <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. While renewable energy sources account for more than 20% of global electricity demand (mostly hydroelectric), they only account for 10% of global heat demand (mostly biomass). <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="direct-versus-indirect-heat-production">Direct versus Indirect Heat Production</h2>
<p>Electricity produced by renewable energy sources can be – and is being – converted to heat in an indirect way. For example, a wind turbine converts its rotational energy into electricity by the use of its electrical generator, and this electricity can then be converted into heat using an electric heater, an electric boiler, or an electric heat pump. The result is heat generated by wind energy.</p>
<p>In particular, the electric heat pump is promoted by many governments and organisations as a sustainable solution for renewable heat generation. However, solar and wind energy can also be used in a direct way, without converting them to electricity first – and of course the same applies to biomass. Direct heat production is cheaper, can be more energy efficient, and is more sustainable than indirect heat production.</p>

<p>The direct alternative for solar photovoltaic power is solar thermal power, a technology that appeared in the nineteenth century following cheaper production technologies for glass and mirrors. Solar thermal energy can be used for water heating, space heating or industrial processes, and <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/07/the-bright-future-of-solar-thermal-powered-factories/">this is 2-3 times as energy efficient</a> compared to following the indirect path involving electricity conversion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost nobody knows that a windmill can produce heat directly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The direct alternative for wind power that everybody knows is the old-fashioned windmill, which is at least 2.000 years old. It transferred the rotational energy from its wind rotor directly to the axis of a machine, for example for sawing wood or grinding grain. This old-fashioned approach remains relevant, also in combination with new technology, because it would be <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/10/wind-powered-factories-history-and-future-of-industrial-windmills/">more energy efficient compared to first converting the energy to electricity, and then back to rotational energy</a>.</p>
<p>However, an old-fashioned windmill can not only provide mechanical energy, but also thermal energy. The problem is that almost nobody knows this. Even the International Energy Agency doesn’t mention direct conversion of wind into heat when it presents all possible options for renewable heat production. <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-water-brake-windmill">The Water Brake Windmill</h2>
<p>The original type of heat generating windmill converts rotational energy directly into heat by generating friction in water, using a so-called “water brake” or “Joule Machine”. A heat generator based on this principle is basically a wind-powered mixer or impeller installed into an insulated tank filled with water. Due to friction among molecules of the water, mechanical energy is converted into heat energy. The heated water can be pumped into a building for heating or washing, and the same concept could be applied to industrial processes in a factory that require relatively low temperatures. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

<p>The Joule Machine was originally conceived as a measuring apparatus. James Joule built it in the 1840s for his famous measurement of the mechanical equivalent of heat: one calorie equals the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 cubic centimeter of water by 1 degree Celsius. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A heat generator based on this principle is basically a wind-powered mixer or impeller installed into an insulated tank filled with water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most fascinating thing about water brake windmills is that, hypothetically, they could have been built hundreds or even thousands of years ago. They require simple materials: wood and/or metal. But although we cannot exclude their use in pre-industrial times, the first reference to heat producing windmills dates from the 1970s, when the Danes started building them in the wake of the first oil crisis.</p>

<p>At the time, Denmark was almost entirely dependent on imported oil for heating, which left many households in the cold when the oil supply was disturbed. Because the Danes already had a strong DIY-culture for small wind turbines generating electricity on farms, they started building windmills to heat their houses. Some chose the indirect path, converting wind generated electricity into heat using electric heating appliances. Others, however, developed mechanical windmills that produced heat directly.</p>
<h2 id="cheaper-to-build">Cheaper to Build</h2>
<p>The direct approach to heat production is considerably cheaper and more sustainable than converting wind or solar generated electricity into heat by using electric heating devices. There’s two reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, and most importantly, mechanical windmills are less complex, which makes them more affordable and less resource-intensive to build, and which increases their lifetime. In a water brake windmill, electric generator, power converters, transformer and gearbox can be excluded, and because of the weight savings, the windmill needs to be less sturdy built. The Joule Machine has lower weight, smaller size, and lower costs than an electrical generator. <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Also important is that the cost of thermal storage is 60-70% lower compared to batteries or the use of backup thermal power plants. <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Second, converting wind or solar energy directly into heat (or mechanical energy) can be more energy efficient than when electric conversion is involved. This means that less solar and wind energy converters – and thus less space and resources – are needed to supply a certain amount of heat. In short, the heat generating windmill addresses the main disadvantages of wind power: its low power density, and its <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2017/09/how-not-to-run-a-modern-society-on-solar-and-wind-power-alone/">intermittency</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mechanical windmills are less complex, which makes them more affordable and less resource-intensive to build, and which increases their lifetime</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, direct heat generation greatly improves the economics and the sustainability of smaller types of windmills. Tests have shown that small wind turbines – which produce electricity – are <a href="http://theoildrum.com.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/node/6954" target="_blank">very inefficient and don’t always generate as much energy as was needed to produce them</a>. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> However, using similar models for heat production decreases embodied energy and costs, increases lifetime, and improves efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-heat-can-a-windmill-produce">How Much Heat Can a Windmill Produce?</h2>
<p>The Danish water brake windmill from the 1970s was a relatively small machine, with a rotor diameter of around 6 meters and a height of around 12 meters. Larger heat generating windmills were built in the 1980s. Most used simple wooden blades. In total, at least a dozen different models have been documented, both DIY and commercial models. <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Many were built with used car parts and other discarded materials. <sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>

<p>One of the smaller early Danish heat generating windmills was officially tested. The Calorius type 37 – which had a rotor diameter of 5 meters and a height of 9 meters – produced 3.5 kilowatt of heat at a wind speed of 11 m/s (a strong breeze, Beaufort 6). This is comparable to the heat output of the smallest electric boilers for space heating. From 1993 to 2000, the Danish firm Westrup built a total of 34 water brake windmills based on this design, and by 2012 there were still 17 in operation. <sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>A much larger water brake windmill (7.5m rotor diameter, 17m tower) was built in 1982 by the Svaneborg brothers, and heated the house of one of them (the other brother opted for a wind turbine and an electric heating system). The windmill, which had three fiberglass blades, produced up to 8 kilowatt of heat according to non-official measurements – comparable to the heat output of an electric boiler for a modest home. <sup id="fnref3:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Further into the 1980s, Knud Berthou built the most sophisticated heat generating windmill to date: the LO-FA. In other models, heat generation happened at the bottom of the tower – from the top of the windmill there was a shaft down to the bottom where the water brake was installed. However, in the LO-FA windmill all mechanical parts for energy conversion were moved to the top of the tower. The lower 10 meters of the 20 meter high tower were filled up with 15 tonnes of water in an insulated reservoir. Consequently, hot water could literally be tapped out of the windmill. <sup id="fnref4:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tower of the LO-FA windmill was filled up with 15 tonnes of water in an insulated tank: hot water could literally be tapped out of the windmill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LO-FA was also the largest of the heat generating windmills, with a 12 meter diameter rotor. Its heat output was estimated to be 90 kilowatt at a wind speed of 14 m/s (Beaufort 7). This results seems to be excessive compared to the other heat generating windmills, but the energy output of a windmill increases more than proportionally with the rotor diameter and the wind speed. Furthermore, the friction liquid in the water brake was not water but hydraulic oil, which can be heated up to much higher temperatures. The oil then transferred its heat to the water storage in the tower. <sup id="fnref5:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="renewed-interest">Renewed Interest</h2>
<p>Interest in heat generating windmills resurfaced a few years ago, although for now it concerns only a handful of scientific studies. In a 2011 paper, German and UK scientists write that “small and remote households in northern regions demand thermal energy rather than electricity, and therefore wind turbines in such places should be build for thermal energy generation”. <sup id="fnref3:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The researchers explain and illustrate the workings of the water brake windmill, and calculate the optimal performance of the technology. It was found that the torque-speed characteristics of wind rotor and impeller must be carefully matched to achieve maximum efficiency. For example, for the very small Savonius windmill that the scientists used as a model (0.5m rotor diameter, 2m tower), it was calculated that the impeller diameter should be 0.388m.</p>

<p>The researchers then ran simulations over a period of fifty hours to calculate the windmill’s heat output. Although the Savonius is a low speed windmill which is ill-suited for electricity generation, it turns out to be an excellent producer of heat: the small windmill produced up to 1 kW of thermal power (at wind speeds of 15 m/s). <sup id="fnref4:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> A 2013 study using a prototype obtained similar results, and calculated the efficiency of the system to be 91%. <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> This is comparable to the efficiency of a wind turbine heating water through electricity.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, it’s not always stormy weather, which means that the average wind speed is at least as important. A 2015 study investigates the possibilities of heat generating windmills in Lithuania, a Baltic country with a cold climate that’s dependent on expensive fuel imports. <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> The researchers calculated that at the average wind speed in the country (4 m/s of Beaufort 3), generating one kilowatt of heat requires a windmill with a rotor diameter of 8.2 meters.</p>

<p>The average wind speed is not guaranteed either, which means that a heat generating windmill requires heat storage – otherwise it would only provide heating when the wind blows. One cubic meter of heated water (1 ton, 1,000 liters) can hold up to 90 kWh of heat, which is roughly one to two days of supply for a household of four persons.</p>

<p>Providing enough storage to bridge a week without wind thus requires up to 7 tonnes of water, which corresponds to a volume of 7 cubic meters plus insulation. However, energy losses (self-discharge) should also be taken into account, and this explains why the Danish heat generating windmills usually had a storage tank holding ten to twenty thousand liters of water. <sup id="fnref4:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A heat generating windmill can also be combined with a solar boiler, so that both sun and wind can supply direct thermal energy using a smaller water tank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A heat generating windmill can also be combined with a solar boiler, so that both sun and wind can supply direct thermal energy using the same heat storage reservoir. In this case, it becomes possible to build a pretty reliable heating system with a smaller heat storage tank, because the combination of two – often complementary – energy sources increases the chances of direct heat supply. Especially in less sunny climates, heat generating windmills are a great addition to a solar thermal system, because the latter produces relatively less heat during winter, when heat demand is at its maximum.</p>
<h2 id="retarders-and-mechanical-heat-pumps">Retarders and Mechanical Heat Pumps</h2>
<p>The most recent and extensive studies to date are from 2016 and 2018, and compare different types of heat generating windmills with different types of indirect heat generation. <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> In this second type of heat generating windmill, heat is produced with mechanical heat pumps or hydrodynamic retarders, not with a water brake.</p>
<p>A mechanical heat pump is simply a heat pump without the electric motor – instead, the wind rotor is directly connected to the compressor(s) of the heat pump. This involves one less energy conversion, which makes the combination at least 10% more energy efficient than an electric heat pump driven by a wind turbine.</p>
<p>The hydrodynamic retarder is well known as a brake system in heavy vehicles. Like a joule machine, it converts rotational energy into heat without the involvement of electricity. Retarders and mechanical heat pumps have the same advantages as Joule Machines, in the sense that they are much smaller, lighter, and cheaper than electrical generators. However, in this case a gearbox is required to achieve optimal efficiency.</p>

<p>The study compares heat generating windmills based on retarders and mechanical heat pumps with indirect heat production using electric boilers and electric heat pumps. It compares these four technologies for three system sizes: a small windmill aimed at heating an off-the-grid household, a large windmill aimed at supplying heat to a village, and a wind farm producing heat for 20,000 inhabitants. The four heating concepts are ranked based on their yearly capital and operational expenditures, assuming a lifespan of 20 years. <sup id="fnref3:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Directly coupling a mechanical windmill to a mechanical heat pump is cheaper than using a gas boiler or the combination of a wind turbine and an electric heat pump.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the off-grid system, directly coupling a mechanical windmill to a mechanical heat pump is the cheapest option, while the combination of a wind turbine and an electric boiler is two to three times more expensive. All other technologies are in between. Taking into account both investment and operational costs, small-scale heat generating windmills with mechanical heat pumps are equally expensive or cheaper than conventional gas boilers when assuming the typical performance of a small windmill (which produces – over a period of one year – 12% to 22% of its maximum energy output).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the combination of a small wind turbine and an electric heat pump requires a windmill with a “capacity factor” of at least 30% to become cost-competitive with gas heating – but such high performance is very unusual. Larger systems present the same rankings – the combination of mechanical windmills and mechanical heat pumps is the cheapest option – but they have up to three times lower capital costs due to economies of scale. Larger windmills have higher capacity factors (16-40%), which result in even larger cost savings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the large energy losses for heat transportation, the heat generating windmill is at its best as a decentralised energy source, providing heat to an off-the-grid household or – in the optimal case – a small city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, larger systems also reveal a problem when scaling up the technology: storing heat may be cheaper and more efficient than storing electricity, but the opposite holds true for transportation: the energy losses for heat transportation are much larger than the energy losses for electricity transmission. The scientists calculate that the maximum distance that is cost-achievable under optimal wind conditions is 50 km. <sup id="fnref3:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Consequently, the heat generating windmill is at its best as a decentralised energy source, providing heat to an off-the-grid household or – in the optimal case – a relatively small town or city, or an industrial area. For even larger systems, energy needs to be transported in the form of electricity, and in that case direct generation of heat – with all its benefits – becomes unattractive.</p>
<h2 id="blinded-by-electricity">Blinded by Electricity</h2>
<p>Heat generating windmills are also investigated for renewable electricity production, mainly because they offer a better solution for energy storage <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/05/how-sustainable-is-stored-sunlight/">compared to batteries</a> or other common technologies. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> In these systems, the generated heat is converted to electricity by the use of a steam turbine. The storage system is similar to that of a concentrated solar power plant (CSP), and the solar concentrators are replaced by heat generating windmills.</p>

<p>Because high temperatures are needed to produce electricity efficiently with a steam turbine, these systems can’t make use of joule machines or hydrodynamic retarders, but instead rely on a type of retarder called an “eddy current heater” (or “induction heater”). These are comprised of a magnet mounted on a rotating shaft, and can reach temperatures of up to 600 degrees Celsius. Using eddy current heaters, windmills could provide direct heat at higher temperatures, making their potential use in industry even larger.</p>
<p>However, using the stored heat for electricity production is considerably more costly and less sustainable compared ro using heat generating windmills for direct heat production. Converting the stored heat into electricity is at most 30% efficient, meaning that two thirds of the wind energy is lost due to needless energy conversions – and the same is true <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/07/the-bright-future-of-solar-thermal-powered-factories/">when solar thermal is used for power production</a>. <sup id="fnref4:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Direct heat production thus offers the possibility to save three times more greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels using the same number of windmills, which are also cheaper and more sustainable to build. Hopefully, direct heat production will be given the priority it deserves. Despite a warming climate, the demand for thermal energy is as high as ever.</p>

  <h2>So You Want to Learn Physics…</h2><h4><em>SECOND EDITION </em></h4>

</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1618959539611_7944">
  <h3><strong>Introduction to the Second Edition</strong></h3><p><em>April 20th, 2021</em></p><p>Nearly six years ago, I sat down at my desk and typed up a detailed guide for anyone who wanted to learn physics on their own. At the time, I had no idea how many people would read it and use it — my only goal was to put the information out there in a clear and straightforward way so that anyone who wanted to learn physics would have the self-study curriculum they needed. Since then, over six hundred thousand people have turned to this guide to study physics. </p><p>According to the emails I’ve received from readers, many of you have gone on to get undergraduate degrees in physics after following the curriculum in this guide (some of you are even now in graduate programs!), but the majority of those who have bookmarked and followed this guide — even all the way to the end! — have done so out of pure curiosity and for the sheer joy of understanding the incredible universe we inhabit. </p><p>The success of this guide is, I believe, a testament to two things. </p><p>First, that one of the most impactful things you can do is to share what you know with others, even if it doesn’t seem like a lot. I wasn’t able to become a professional physicist, but I <em>was</em> able to use my knowledge of undergraduate and graduate-level physics to type up a comprehensive and accessible curriculum that has helped hundreds of thousands of people learn physics. That’s pretty remarkable. If you are wondering what you have to offer the world, I hope you will think of this guide and consider what you might know that you can share with others. </p><p>Second, that there are so many people in the world who want to understand physics but are unable to study it formally in a university setting for any number of reasons. These same people are very serious about learning physics, and not for any career purposes but simply because they want to understand the universe, and they are and have been dreadfully underserved and underestimated by the academic physics community (who do not take them seriously because they aren’t studying at colleges and universities) and by the authors of contemporary and popular physics books and the publishers of those same books (who mostly just sell them books that assume most readers can never and will never really understand physics). When I wrote the first edition of this guide, I was pretty sure there were a lot more people out there who really wanted to learn physics — <em>real </em>physics — than academic physicists and publishers believed, and those were the people I wanted to help. As it turns out, there were even more of you than I could ever have imagined!</p><p>Well, after almost six years and lots of reader feedback, I decided that it was finally time to make a (lightly) updated version of this guide. I went back through the emails and comments I’ve received over the years, and then made a list of the most popular requests. I skimmed through all the books in the curriculum and a few new ones as well. I updated textbook editions, added more undergraduate-level electives, added a section of graduate-level electives, and made a few other small changes — all in the hope that this new version will be even more useful than the first. </p><p>As I wrote in the first edition: “Remember that anyone can learn physics…Whether you turn it into a hobby or a career, the pure joy of understanding the universe around us is one of the most beautiful experiences you can ever have in life.”</p><p>Godspeed!</p><p><em>You can still find the first edition here, on my old website: </em><a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics">https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics.</a><em> </em></p>

  <h3><strong>Introduction to the First Edition</strong></h3><p><em>August 13th, 2015</em></p><p>Over the past few years, ever since writing a blog post called “<a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/26/from-the-fledgling-physicist-archives-if-susan-can-learn-physics-so-can-you" target="_blank">If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You</a>,” I've been contacted by people from all backgrounds who are inspired and want to learn physics, but don't know where to start, what to learn, what to read, and how to structure their studies. I've spoken with single mothers who want to go back to school and study physics, tenured philosophy professors who want to learn physics so that they can make significant and informed contributions to philosophy of physics, high school students who want to know what they should read to prepare for an undergraduate education in physics, and people in dozens of various careers who want to <em>really, really </em>learn and understand physics simply for the joy of it.&nbsp;</p><p>This post is a condensed version of what I've sent to people who have contacted me over the years, outlining what everyone needs to learn in order to really understand physics.&nbsp;</p><p>The general physics education given in U.S. universities is divided into what is learned at the undergraduate level and what is covered in graduate courses, and I've divided my list in a similar way. Because each subject is built upon the previous subjects and the mathematics becomes more complex and difficult, it's important to learn each topic in the order presented below.&nbsp;</p><p>If you work through the all of the textbooks in the <em>Undergraduate Physics </em>list of this post, and master each of the topics, you'll have gained the knowledge equivalent of a Bachelor's Degree in Physics (and will be able to score well on the Physics GRE). &nbsp;If you work through the graduate core of the <em>Graduate Physics</em>&nbsp;textbooks, you'll have the equivalent knowledge of obtaining a Master's Degree in Physics. A PhD in Physics requires the graduate coursework as well as several years of research and a thesis, and the experience involved in a PhD isn't something that can be gained independently of a PhD program.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that anyone can learn physics. It's no different from learning programming, from learning a musical instrument, from reading great literature. Whether you turn it into a hobby or a career, the pure joy of understanding the universe around us is one of the most beautiful experiences you can ever have in life.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3><strong>Before You Begin</strong></h3><h4><strong>Popular Books on Physics</strong></h4><p>When you're solving problems, working through textbooks, and getting into the nitty-gritty details of each topic, it's so easy to lose the forest for the trees and forget why you even became inspired to study physics in the first place. This is where really, really good (and non-speculative) popular books on physics come in handy: they inspire, they encourage, and they help you keep the big picture in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>One big problem is that many popular physics books (especially those written by famous physicists) are incredibly speculative and tend to present an unrealistic view of what the study of physics is all about. When you're learning physics, it's best to avoid these types of speculative books and stick to the ones that talk about the real physics that we know exists (in general, anything by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Close/e/B0032LWBQU?language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;linkId=3c7c04c8d21e464a287401f980430fd4&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank">Frank Close</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Richard-P.-Feynman/e/B000AQ47U8?language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;linkId=ed2f3d4424a1dedaff83313cfbcd4668&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a> is a safe bet!).</p><p>Here are a handful of my favorite popular physics books, ranked in order of difficulty: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465024378/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0465024378&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;linkId=d72aaa7813d719344a4c88258a5488d0" target="_blank">The First Three Minutes by Steven Weinberg</a> <strong>(Level: Easy)</strong>.<strong> </strong>An account of the Big Bang by one of the most brilliant physicists of all time.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Character-Physical-Law-MIT-Press/dp/0262533413?dchild=1&amp;keywords=character%20of%20physical%20law&amp;language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;linkId=85b0a8234adfc1bb7a7c4b643f59bf6b&amp;qid=1618957764&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank">The Character of Physical Law by Richard Feynman</a> <strong>(Level: Easy)</strong>.

This book is a great read while you are starting level 7 in the undergraduate curriculum. </p></li></ul><h4><strong>Mathematical and Scientific Preliminaries</strong></h4><p>Before you begin studying physics and working through the topics in the sections below, you need to be familiar with some basic mathematics. A high school education — which should include pre-algebra, algebra 1, geometry, algebra 2, trigonometry, and pre-calculus — is sufficient. If you need a refresher, I recommend either working through the Khan Academy math courses (<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">https://www.khanacademy.org/)</a> or the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Math-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387944273?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp%3Bqid=&amp;amp%3Bsr=&amp;language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;linkId=0fc3187aa8b5febcc75391ba905635b5&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank">Why Math? by R.D. Driver</a>. There's no need to be familiar with calculus before starting, because you’ll learn it as you work through the undergraduate-level courses.</p><p>There are no scientific prerequisites for this curriculum. You don’t need to be familiar with biology or chemistry at either the high school or college level in order to understand, although doing some studying on the side can’t hurt. Khan Academy has some great high school science refresher courses that are perfect for this (<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science" target="_blank">https://www.khanacademy.org/science)</a>. </p><h4><strong>How to Study</strong></h4><p>Everyone learns very differently, and knowing your learning style is important: do you learn by reading, by taking notes,&nbsp;by talking, by watching,&nbsp;by doing, or by a combination of some or all of these? For example, I learn by reading and by note-taking, so I read through textbooks very carefully, take copious notes, and summarize each concept in my own words before moving on to something new. Think about this before you begin so that you'll know how to structure your studies.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of your learning style, you'll still need to solve the physics problems in each textbook. <strong>Solving problems is the only way to understand physics.</strong> There's no way around it.&nbsp;Even though it can feel tedious at times, there's nothing more rewarding than figuring out a really difficult physics problem and realizing that you figured it all out all by yourself!</p><p>One tough thing about learning on your own is that you may not know whether you are solving the problems correctly. Some of the textbooks listed below have answers to selected exercises in the back of the book, but these aren’t always adequate for two reasons: (1) they often only show the solutions to the problems, and not the steps taken to get there; and (2) it’s much better to do <em>all</em> of the exercises rather than just a select few. The good news is that many of the solutions (and step-by-step ways to solve them) can be found online with a simple Google search. If you are going to Google the answers, however, <em>please first try to solve the problems on your own, and try multiple times</em> (you’re not in school trying to get a perfect grade — you’re trying to learn and understand).</p><p>And, finally, a note on learning in a laboratory vs. learning from textbooks. Physics is both an experimental and theoretical science, and while research happens in laboratories and on blackboards and computers, the majority of any physics <em>education</em> does not take place in a laboratory but in lecture classes that teach from textbooks and assign homework problems that are found in textbooks. Yes, there are some laboratory classes (usually at the very introductory levels, and their only purpose is to show that oh, look, Newton’s laws work in the real world after all) and some — <em>some</em> — undergraduates are allowed to participate in research on the side, but physics is taught through textbooks, lectures, and homework problems. Don’t believe me? Take a look at the undergraduate physics curriculum at any university that offers a physics major. Graduate programs in physics are largely the same — both M.A. and PhD programs in physics require two years of core classes — with one key difference: to get a PhD, students need to complete several years of research, a thesis, and — at many programs — take an exam to prove they have mastered the graduate core curriculum. The graduate core curriculum is all textbooks and lectures and homework problems. The textbooks listed in the curriculum I’ve written below are the same textbooks that are used in the top undergraduate and graduate physics programs in the world. Studying them will give you the same education that you would receive at one of these programs — no painfully-annoying-introductory-mechanics-laboratory-class-with-inane-group-projects required.  </p>

  <h4><strong>6. Quantum Field Theory</strong></h4><p><strong>What It's All About</strong></p><p>Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the heart of all modern high-energy physics: the Standard Model of particle physics is a QFT. The whole idea behind QFT is that we are doing quantum mechanics on classical fields, and it works remarkably well. Along with GR, QFT will be the most challenging part of your physics education, but perhaps the most rewarding (I know it was extraordinarily rewarding for me!). It may take many, many years to master.&nbsp;You'll learn about how to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_quantization" target="_blank">quantize fields</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram" target="_blank">Feynman diagrams</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics" target="_blank">quantum electrodynamics (QED)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization" target="_blank">renormalization</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory" target="_blank">non-Abelian gauge theories</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics" target="_blank">quantum chromodynamics (QCD)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism" target="_blank">the Higgs mechanism</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction" target="_blank">the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory</a>&nbsp;of electroweak interactions, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank">symmetries of particle physics</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking" target="_blank">spontaneous symmetry breaking</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Best Textbooks To Use</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691140340/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0691140340&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;linkId=1f7f650184687b5ba35fc46366c61763" target="_blank">Zee's Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell</a> (essential).

<a href="https://nivenly.org/">Nivenly</a>, and whose mission we continue to carry forward.
In her working life beyond Nivenly, she has left behind a legacy of
professionalism and strength of vision, and we all miss her terribly.</p><p>This is very fresh and raw for us in the Nivenly community right now, so we ask
for patience while we figure out how we move forward. But move forward we will,
as we know that is what Nóva would want.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Yes.  And they are!  This is called the "Angular diameter distance turnaround" (or turnover). In the usual model for expansion <span>$\Lambda CDM$</span>, it is at a redshift of about 1.5 or about 15 billion light-years (corresponding to a light travel time of about 10 billion years, or about 4 billion years after the big bang, the distance is greater due to the expansion of space) I'm using rounded values here, because the actual distance is quite sensitive to the exact parameters of expansion.</p>
<p>A galaxy from 400 million years after the big bang (a distance of 32 billion light-years) would look as big as a galaxy that is 2.7 billion light-years away. (These figures from Ned Wright's calculator)</p>
<p>It's illustrated in this <a href="https://xkcd.com/2622/" rel="noreferrer">xkcd comic</a>.  You can see nearby "galaxies" are large and bright, more distant galaxies are smaller, very distant galaxies are large, dim, and red. More details about this phenomena are answered by <a href="https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/21006/understanding-the-turnover-point-of-angular-diameter-distance">Understanding The Turnover Point of Angular Diameter Distance</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>X, which was formerly known as Twitter until its recent rebranding, is having a problem displaying old posts that came with images attached or any hyperlinks converted through Twitter’s built-in URL shortener. It’s unclear when the problem started, but it was <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcoates/status/1692922211416334597">highlighted on Saturday afternoon in a post by Tom Coates</a>, and a Brazilian vtuber, <a href="https://twitter.com/DaniloTakagi/status/1692256500700299436">@DaniloTakagi,</a> had pointed it out a couple of days earlier. </p><p>As it is, it appears to affect tweets published prior to December 2014, judging by posts visible on my own account. No videos are affected (Twitter only added native image support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/11/3756054/twitter-in-house-image-hosting-blobstore">in 2011</a> and built-in videos in 2016), but links to YouTube, for example, are now just text with a t.co URL that doesn’t work.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Screenshot of a famous

most famous tweets ever (back when they were still called tweets), <a href="https://twitter.com/EllenDeGeneres/status/440322224407314432">this selfie</a> posted by 2014 Oscars host Ellen DeGeneres flanked by celebs like Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and others, taken during the show’s broadcast. </p><p>I haven’t seen any public comments from owner Elon Musk or X CEO Linda Yaccarino about the problem, but at some point on Saturday night / early Sunday morning, the picture in that post was restored. </p><p>Despite speculation that it could be an intentional cost-cutting move by Musk, the fact that the actual media posted hasn’t been deleted suggests an error or bug of some kind, one of many that have arisen since last year’s takeover and mass layoffs. </p><p>There’s also at least one other old tweeted image that still worked — the one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/7/3612138/obama-victory-tweet-most-retweeted-ever">posted to President Barack Obama’s account</a> after winning his 2012 campaign for reelection, showing a hug between him and the First Lady. It’s unclear if that one had been manually restored, but <a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/266031293945503744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E266031293945503744%7Ctwgr%5Ee833f65c02315093f04c8d2ab4aaa6d6fd4d6ee2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2012%2F11%2F7%2F3612138%2Fobama-victory-tweet-most-retweeted-ever">it was still visible</a> on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>The timing for the cutoff in pictures and links that are broken seems related to changes Twitter made in 2016, adding “enhanced URL enrichment” to show previews for linked websites and <a href="https://twitter.com/X/status/777915304261193728/">native attachments</a> that didn’t count against Twitter’s 140-character limit. <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/data-dictionary/tweet-timeline#:~:text=With%20the%20Search%20APIs%2C%20these%20metadata%20begin%20emerging%20in%20December%202014">According to developer documentation</a>, the metadata for these additions “began emerging” in December 2014. </p><p>From the X Developer Platform Data Dictionary:</p><div><blockquote><p>In March 2012, the expanded URL enrichment was introduced. Before this time, the Tweet payloads included only the URL as provided by the user. So, if the user included a shortened URL it can be challenging to match on (expanded) URLs of interest. With both Historical PowerTrack and the Search APIs, these metadata are available starting in March 2012.</p><p>In July 2016, the enhanced URL enrichment was introduced. This enhanced version provides a web site’s HTML title and description in the Tweet payload, along with Operators for matching on those. With Historical PowerTrack, these metadata become available in July 2016. With the Search APIs, these metadata begin emerging in December 2014.</p><p>In September 2016 Twitter introduced ‘native attachments’ where a trailing shared link is not counted against the 140 Tweet character limit. Both URL enrichments still apply to these shared links.</p></blockquote></div><p>Twitter, X, or whatever it’s currently called, did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>]]></description>

My theory is that these books are being written by A.I. and passed off as a real author.</p><p>The larger issue here is the complete lack of checks and balances on Amazon’s website. Amazon employs a hands-off approach when it comes to what goes on in its bookstore. As reported by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/16/books/amazon-books-justice-department.html"><em>New York Times,</em></a> there doesn’t seem to be any checks for accuracy,&nbsp; quality, or authenticity with what Amazon sells in its Bookstore. It doesn’t seem that they have put any energy to overseeing the sellers who flock to their site.</p><p>That lack of accountability has resulted in a kind of open lawlessness on Amazon. Publishers, writers and groups such as the Authors Guild have all said that counterfeit books on Amazon have surged- and with very little checks in place, it’s no wonder why.</p><h3>Who’s Legally Responsible?</h3><p>In a New York Times article aptly called,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/technology/amazon-domination-bookstore-books.html"><em> What Happens After Amazon’s Domination Is Complete?

Scott Kelly, vice president of Antimicrobial Therapy, publishers of the manual, told&nbsp;<em>The Times</em>, “Lives depend on it.

Towns are too distracting.”</span></p><p><span>Ten years later, Hoffer’s masterpiece </span><em>The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements</em><span> was published when he was in his late forties. Its unexpected success led him to later be appointed as an adjunct professor at University of California, Berkeley.</span></p><p><span>A slim volume, </span><em>The True Believer</em><span> was a favorite of President Dwight Eisenhower, who regularly gifted copies to friends. The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was also an enthusiast of Hoffer’s book. The author and conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/28/archives/the-true-questioner-hoffer.html" rel="">described</a><span> </span><em>The True Believer</em><span> as “deeply provocative.”</span></p><p>It’s one of my favorite nonfiction books. </p><p>Hoffer’s unusual background as a manual laborer and member of the working class helped to fuel his unique psychological and sociological insights which people continue to mine to this day.</p><p><span>Today, political polarization is at its peak. Out-party hate is </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe1715" rel="">now</a><span> more powerful than in-party love as a predictor of voting behavior in the United States. </span></p><p>Eric Hoffer's ideas are more relevant than ever.</p><p><span>Eric Hoffer made the case that if you peel back the layers of any mass movement, you will find that </span><em>frustration</em><span> is their driving force.</span></p><p>Frustration, though, doesn’t arise solely from bleak material conditions. The dockyard philosopher argued that “Our frustration is greater when we have much and want more than when we have nothing and want some. We are less dissatisfied when we lack many things than when we seem to lack but one thing.”</p><p><span>He points out in the years leading up to both the French and Russian Revolutions, life had in fact been gradually </span><em>improving</em><span> for the masses. He concludes, “It is not actual suffering but the taste of better things which excites people to revolt” and that “The intensity of discontent seems to be in inverse proportion to the distance from the object fervently desired.”</span></p><p><span>Personally, I saw this when I first arrived at Yale. I recall being stunned at how status anxiety pervaded elite college campuses. Internally, I thought, “You’ve already made it, what are you so stressed out about?” Hoffer, though, would say these students believed they had </span><em>almost</em><span> made it. That is why they were so aggravated. The closer they got to realizing their ambitions, the more frustrated they became about not already achieving them.</span></p><p>Hoffer’s conceptions of frustration highlight how if your conditions improve, but not as much or as quickly as you’d like, you will be vulnerable to recruitment by mass movements that promise to make your dreams come true. &nbsp;</p><p><span>In </span><em>Democracy in America</em><span>, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, “When inequality is the general law of society, the most blatant inequalities escape notice. When everything is virtually on a level, the slightest variations cause distress. That is why the desire for equality becomes more insatiable as equality extends to all.” For Hoffer, this insatiability cultivates frustration—a nebulous, simmering emotional state that can be harnessed by any ideology.</span></p><p>He describes what has now become known as the “Tocqueville effect”: A revolution is most likely to occur after an improvement in social conditions. As circumstances improve, people raise their expectations. Societal reforms raise reference points to a level that is usually not matched, eliciting rage and frustration.</p><p>In addition to the fact that reality seldom matches expectations, frustration also originates in a deep sense of dissatisfaction within oneself. We see this in the rise of social movements across the U.S., where individuals across the political spectrum feel disillusioned by their current situation, leading to a strong desire for dramatic change.</p><p>Hoffer argued that mass movements consciously attempt to cultivate and exploit frustration among their members. This helps to fuel their existence. The promotion of frustration is not incidental but is in fact the result of competition: movements that effectively nurture frustration outperform others by attracting and retaining the most fervent members.</p><p><span>In a passage that is reminiscent of today’s idea of the “horseshoe theory” (political extremes have more in common with one another than with moderates), Hoffer wrote that, “When people are ripe for a mass movement, they are usually ripe for any movement...In pre-Hitlerian Germany, it was often a toss up whether a restless youth would join the Communists or the Nazis.” Indeed, the official figure from the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party was that fifty-five percent of their members were former communists. According to Rudolf Diels, head of the Gestapo in 1933-1934, the actual </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/central-european-history/article/abs/sa-in-the-radical-imagination-of-the-long-weimar-republic/38DA93D7F66C9FDAE0BF0CDD604F786B" rel="">figure</a><span> was seventy percent.</span></p><p><span>According to </span><em>The True Believer</em><span>, the shared factor among extreme mass movements is not ideology or practice but a shared hatred for the present and a yearning for a (subjectively defined) utopian future.</span></p><p>In the marketplace of ideologies, the dogma that is most effective at harvesting emotional discontent often prevails. The danger of mass movements lies in their ability to manipulate these frustrations. Hoffer argues that these movements purposely foster frustration and dissatisfaction, pushing their members further into their cause. This, in turn, deepens their commitment, keeping them in a state of perpetual discontent and thus, devotion to the movement that promises to liberate them.</p><p><span>The formula goes something like this. Mass movements that are good at what they do make previously content individuals frustrated and further frustrate their adherents while pretending to advance the movement. This means that the strongest mass movements are inevitably going to be the ones that are the best at </span><em>not</em><span> delivering the goods. Any movement that actually advances the interests of its frustrated supporters will make them less frustrated. Hence, they’ll stop being members.</span></p><p>A core aspect of Hoffer's argument is that the root of frustration lies not just in external circumstances or “the system,” but fundamentally in the burdens of being an individual. Outsourcing decisions about your life to the movement comes as a relief. While practical organizations (e.g., an employer) cater to self-interest and offer opportunities for self-advancement, a mass movement appeals to those who wish to escape or camouflage an unsatisfactory self. Mass movements hold the implicit promise of fulfilling the desire for self-renunciation.</p><p>When people feel their lives are meaningless, they seek meaning by telling others what to do with their lives, a key feature of many mass movements. One sentence in the book summarizes the idea: “Faith in a holy cause is to a considerable extent a substitute for the lost faith in ourselves.”</p><p>The book goes on, “A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other people’s business.”</p><p>Hoffer's concept of “substitution” elaborates on this theme. He suggests that individuals dissatisfied with their own self-image often substitute their identity for that of a larger group. Those who join mass movements often feel that their lives lack meaning because they cannot derive satisfaction from their current actions or circumstances. They seek fulfillment in something that extends beyond practical acts in the present, leading them to mass movements.</p><p>In one of the book’s most famous passages, Hoffer wrote “Hatred is the most accessible and comprehensive of all unifying agents...Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a God, but never without a belief in a devil.”</p><p>For mass movements, hatred serves a useful purpose. It’s the glue that binds the disgruntled members together, turning them into a focused, potent force. The collective enemy helps maintain an atmosphere of constant alertness. It does not only keeps the followers united but it also attracts new members who share similar fears. Hatred fosters an atmosphere of persistent threat that can never be entirely overcome.</p><p>Hoffer writes that “in a mass movement, the air is heavy-laden with suspicion…the faithful strive to escape suspicion by adhering zealously to prescribed behavior and opinion…strict orthodoxy is much the result of mutual suspicion as of ardent faith.”</p><p><span>This is consistent with modern notions of the enforcement of popular social norms. A widely-cited paper from 2009 </span><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/599250" rel="">proposed</a><span> that people coerce one another into adhering to disliked norms to show that they themselves have complied out of genuine conviction and not because of social pressure. Indeed, some individuals might be especially prone to enforcing unpopular norms because they are worried that others will regard them as insufficiently sincere.</span></p><p><span>In a notable historical illustration of a mass movement using a “belief in a devil” as a limitless source of ideological fuel, consider the </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/1521538514Z.00000000047?journalCode=ytcc20" rel="">case</a><span> of the “Recalling Bitterness” campaign in Maoist China. In the 1960s, the communist dictator Mao Zedong grew worried that ordinary Chinese citizens were developing lukewarm attitudes about the socialist revolution. In response, the regime forced people into rituals in which they publicly announced how bad life was before they had been liberated. Mao ordered writers and artists to rewrite history through the lens of class struggle to suit the needs of his political agenda. Regime officials held meetings encouraging peasants to describe how much better life was now compared to pre-liberation, hoping to convince them that the revolution’s successes outnumbered its failures. The “devils” here were reactionaries, landlords, rich farmers, and counterrevolutionaries. Documenting the rituals of the Recalling Bitterness campaign, the historian Guo Wu </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/1521538514Z.00000000047?journalCode=ytcc20" rel="">has written</a><span>, “Only poor peasants were allowed to speak; former landlords and rich peasants were silenced.”</span></p><p>Rewriting history to demonize selected groups is an effective way to promote unity within a mass movement.</p><p>For Hoffer, the deliberate cultivation of fear and hatred served to justify increasingly terrifying levels of cruelty and violence. The individual, convinced of his or her guiltlessness, relinquishes agency to the movement. This is yet another example of escaping the burden of the self.</p><p>These activities, Hoffer proposes, often manifest as futile tasks that seem to address problems but in fact accomplish little of substance. Rather than confronting the system they oppose, mass movements often end up targeting irrelevant figures or groups, engaging in meaningless protests, or turning on each other. Ironically, because the movement accomplishes so little, they ultimately give rise to increased fanaticism. This leads to further persecution in the quest to find a scapegoat to hold accountable for the failures of the movement.</p><p>A strong community can counter the attraction of mass movements. When people feel a sense of belonging, this can guide them away from falling into the trap of large collectives that dissolve individual identities. In our modern world, where traditional forms of community are fraying, and many feel unfulfilled by their work, the appeal of mass movements is amplified. Such movements thrive on shared frustrations.</p><p><span>Mass movements are not exclusive to the modern age. </span><em>The True Believer</em><span>, written in the mid-twentieth century, suggests that modernizing forces provide a fertile ground for their proliferation due to the lack of meaningful work, a sense of community, and an overarching sense of meaning in life.</span></p><p>Community is a safeguard against frustration. Hoffer suggests that those who see themselves as part of a close-knit group are less likely to be attracted to mass movements. The sense of accountability that comes from being part of a community and the reciprocal actions required to sustain membership counters the urge to lose oneself in a larger collective identity. The book points out that although mass movements can be seen as a kind of community, they differ in that they require only belief and identity, rather than reciprocal obligations and accountability.</p><p>In addition to membership in a cohesive community, engaging in meaningful work provides a buffer against radicalization. This is one reason why mass movements attempt to undermine the value of work, or claim that anyone who earnestly and unironically participates in the system is a victim of false consciousness or propaganda or has somehow been duped. The aim is to position the members of the mass movement as those who are truly “in the know,” and to undermine their targets’ confidence and turn them into potential recruits.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The True Believer</em><span> advises against supporting organizations without clear, attainable objectives. The dockyard philosopher reminds us that we should be skeptical of mass movements without clearly defined goals. Often, the ostensible aim of large movements is some nebulous idea of improvement. But the practical, concrete outcome is frequently more frustration, more anger, and more agitation, which benefits the organization rather than those they purport to help.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>This summary of modern physics in one table is written 
to make you wonder, check, and enjoy the beauty of nature.<br> 
The summary has been thoroughly tested by a huge number of scientists and engineers. <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/onresearch.html#social">(See here on how this is done.)</a><br>
The summary might save you a year of study.<br>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>This 9-line summary of textbook physics agrees with 400 
years of experiments. Exactly.</h3> 

<p>The 9 lines state that general relativity, 
the standard model of particle physics – extended with mixing massive Dirac 
neutrinos –<br> as well as thermodynamics describe all of nature. Yes, all of it.
The 9 lines also highlight what we do not know.

</p><p><b>The 9 lines are complete, correct and simple</b>

</p><p> The 9 lines contain <em>all present knowledge</em>
about nature, including all textbook physics and <em>all observations ever
made.</em>

</p><p>
The simplicity of the 9 lines and their vast domain of validity are
intensely fascinating.
	

</p><p> 
No known  observation  and no known  measurement  contradicts these 
9 lines, not even in the last significant digit.

</p><p> 
Discover a single contradicting observation and you will become famous.


</p><p> The 9 lines determine <em>all equations</em> of 
physics, as the references in the pdf show:
 
</p><p>
Lines 1, 2 and 3, together, uniquely determine special and general
relativity, cosmology, the Hilbert Lagrangian and Einstein's field
equations. <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/maximumforce.html">(This is shown here.)</a>

</p><p>  
Line 5, with line 1 and 4, uniquely implies thermodynamics.  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09914">(Shown in
https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09914)</a>

</p><p>  
Lines 1, 2, 4, and 6 to 9, together, uniquely determine quantum field
theory and the Lagrangian of the standard model of particle physics,
extended with massive Dirac neutrinos and PMNS mixing.  Written out, <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/Standard_Model.pdf">the Lagrangian is somewhat involved, as Jim
Shifflett showed.</a>

</p><p> The 9 lines show how little math is required to
describe nature with high precision.
	
</p><p>	 
The 9 lines describe everything that moves - and thus everything that
happens in nature.

</p><p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2034/">
The 9 lines given above improve the humorous 9 lines found here.</a>


</p><p> The 9 lines resulted from the work of countless 
scientists and engineers over 400 years.

</p><p>
Galileo started around the year 1600; line 1 resulted after over 150 years.
Line 5 arose from 1824 to 1929, line 6 arose<br> around 1860, lines 2 and
4 around 1900, line 3 from 1915 to 2002, and lines 7, 8 and 9 from 1936 to
1973.

</p><p> The 9 lines imply the lack of <em>trans-Planckian 
effects,</em> <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/physicscube.html">as detailed here.</a>

</p><p>
No such effect has been observed and no such effect will ever be observed.


</p><p> The 9 lines contain <em>all natural sciences.</em>


</p><p>
They contain physics, chemistry, material science, biology, medicine,
geology, astronomy and all engineering disciplines. 
<!-- and computer engineering.  --> 

</p><p>
Again: any single observation contradicting the 9 lines will create a
sensation.

<p> <b>From the 9 lines to Lagrangians</b>


</p><p>For general relativity, the Hilbert Lagrangian with a cosmological 
constant is found in every textbook. It follows from lines 1, 2 and 3. 
<a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/maximumforce.html">Publications prove it.</a>

</p><p> The Lagrangian of the standard model, extended with massive 
Dirac neutrinos and PMNS mixing, follows from lines 1, 2, 4, and 6 to 9. 
The best version on the internet is <a href="https://einstein-schrodinger.com/Standard_Model.pdf">Jim Shifflett's http://einstein-schrodinger.com/Standard_Model.pdf;</a>
a local <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/Standard_Model.pdf">copy is here.</a><br>

</p><p> This other, <a href="https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/the-deconstructed-standard-model-equation">
often cited Lagrangian of the standard model</a> by T.D. Gutierrez contains
also ghost terms; however, it has half a dozen mistakes and disregards neutrino masses and
mixings.  See the corrections at <a href="https://twitter.com/mmanuF/status/895390592854880260">https://twitter.com/mmanuF/status/895390592854880260.</a>


</p><p> An independent video summary of the standard model and
of general relativity, by David Tong, is found at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unl1jXFnzgo&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unl1jXFnzgo&amp;t=1s.</a>
The mathematical expression in the video is a 
combination of many, but not all of the 9 lines – though one can also 
argue that it implicitly contains them all.
<!-- In contrast, the 9 lines are complete and precise.
Line 1, the principle of least action, is part of David Tong's mentioned video. -->

</p><p>Sabine Hossenfelder's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0da8TEeaeE">video on 
unification</a> concentrates on line 1.

</p><p>&nbsp;<br>*</p>


<p><b>The 9 lines are not a "theory of everything" - but
help finding the unified theory of motion</b>

</p><p>
<!-- Are the 9 lines a "theory of everything"? -->
The 9 lines fulfil all requirements for a "theory of everything" found 
in tabloids and in popular books. 
They do so since the 1970s.<br> 
<a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/toe.html">However, the 9 lines are <i>not unified:</i></a> 
for example, the origin of lines 6 to 9 has to be clarified first. 

</p><p> In fact, the 9 lines allow measuring <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/onresearch.html#hitparade">progress towards unification, as told in
the blog.</a>

</p><p>Combining the 9 lines implies that twice the Planck
length (4G ℏ/c<sup>3</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> is the <em>smallest length
in nature</em>.

<a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/minimumlength.html">Its wide-ranging implications, also for unification, 
are explored on a separate page.</a>

<p><strong>In Finland, the number of homeless people has fallen sharply. The reason: The country applies the “Housing First” concept. Those affected by homelessness receive a small apartment and counselling – without any preconditions. 4 out of 5 people affected thus make their way back into a stable life. And: All this is cheaper than accepting homelessness.</strong></p>
<p>Updated on November, 10th 2020</p>
<p><em>Read this article in German <a href="https://kontrast.at/housing-first-finnland-obdachlose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em></p>

<h2><span id="Finland_is_the_only_country_in_Europe_where_homelessness_is_in_decline">Finland is the only country in Europe where homelessness is in decline</span></h2>
<p>In 2008 you could see tent villages and huts standing between trees in the parks of Helsinki. Homeless people had built makeshift homes in the middle of Finland’s capital city. They were exposed to harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, Finnish governments had been trying to reduce homelessness. Short-term shelters were built. However, long-term homeless people were still left out. There were too few emergency shelters and many affected people did not manage to get out of homelessness: They couldn’t find jobs – without a housing address. And without any job, they couldn’t find a flat. It was a vicious circle. Furthermore, they had problems applying for social benefits. All in all, homeless people found themselves trapped.</p>
<p>But in 2008 the Finnish government introduced a new policy for the homeless: It started implementing the “Housing First” concept. Since then the number of people affected has fallen sharply.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finland has set itself a target: Nobody should have to live on the streets – every citizen should have a residence.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the country is successful: It is the only EU-country where the number of homeless people is declining.</p>
<h2><span id="Housing_first_How_everyone_is_given_residence_in_Finland">Housing first: How everyone is given residence in Finland</span></h2>
<p>It is NGOs such as the “Y-Foundation” that provide housing for people in need. They take care of the construction themselves, buy flats on the private housing market and renovate existing flats. The apartments have one to two rooms. In addition to that, former emergency shelters have been converted into apartments in order to offer long-term housing.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was clear to everyone that the old system wasn’t working; we needed radical change,” says Juha Kaakinen, Director of the Y-Foundation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Homeless people turn into tenants with a tenancy agreement. They also have to pay rent and operating costs. Social workers, who have offices in the residential buildings, help with financial issues such as applications for social benefits.</p>
<p><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://www.ara.fi/download/noname/%7B2EBDCA25-C0B8-43AD-8438-2089037FAE9D%7D/156631" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Juha Kaakinen is head of the Y-Foundation. The NGO receives discounted loans from the state to buy housing. Additionally, social workers caring for the homeless and future tenants are paid by the state. The Finnish lottery, on the other hand, supports the NGO when it buys apartments on the private housing market. The Y-Foundation also receives regular loans from banks. The NGO later uses the rental income to repay the loans.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We had to get rid of the night shelters and short-term hostels we still had back then. They had a very long history in Finland, and everyone could see they were not getting people out of homelessness. We decided to reverse the assumptions.” (Juha Kaakinen, Director of the Y-Foundation)</p></blockquote>
<h2><span id="Thats_how_the_Housing_First_concept_works">That’s how the “Housing First” concept works</span></h2>
<p>The policy applied in Finland is called “HousingFirst”. It reverses conventional homeless aid. More commonly, those affected are expected to look for a job and free themselves from their psychological problems or addictions. Only then they get help in finding accommodation.</p>
<p>“Housing First”, on the other hand, reverses the path: Homeless people get a flat – without any preconditions. Social workers help them with applications for social benefits and are available for counselling in general. In such a new, secure situation, it is easier for those affected to find a job and take care of their physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The result is impressive: 4 out of 5 homeless people will be able to keep their flat for a long time with “Housing First” and lead a more stable life.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, the “Housing First” program provided 4,600 homes in Finland. While in 2017 there were still about 1,900 people living on the streets, the program could reduce this number to<a href="https://www.ara.fi/en-US/Materials/Homelessness_reports/Homelessness_in_Finland_2019(55546)"> less than 1000</a> long-term homeless by 2019 – but there were enough places for them in emergency shelters so that they at least didn’t have to sleep outside anymore.</p>
<h2><span id="Providing_people_with_apartments_is_cheaper_than_leaving_them_on_the_street">Providing people with apartments is cheaper than leaving them on the street</span></h2>
<p>Creating housing for people costs money. In the past 10 years, 270 million euros were spent on the construction, purchase and renovation of housing as part of the “Housing First” programme. However, Juha Kaakinen points out, this is far less than the cost of homelessness itself. Because when people are in emergency situations, emergencies are more frequent: Assaults, injuries, breakdowns. The police, health care and justice systems are more often called upon to step in – and this also costs money.<br>
In comparison, “Housing First” is cheaper than accepting homelessness: Now, the state spends 15,000 euros less per year per homeless person than before.</p>

<p>With 4 out of 5 people keeping their flats, “Housing First” is effective in the long run. In 20 percent of the cases, people move out because they prefer to stay with friends or relatives – or because they don’t manage to pay the rent. But even in this case they are not dropped. They can apply again for an apartment and are supported again if they wish.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee for success. Especially homeless women are more difficult to reach: They conceal their emergency situation more often: They live on the streets less frequently and rather stay with friends or acquaintances.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1666798430992_7629"><p>The Unix shell is pure wizardry. With the right incantation of shell spells, you can organise files, process text, compute data, and feed the output of any program to the input of any other. We might even say, paraphrasing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">Clarke’s Third Law</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Any sufficiently clever shell one-liner is indistinguishable from magic.</em><br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this article we’ll explore a package called <a href="https://github.com/bitfield/script"><code>script</code></a> that aims to sprinkle some Unix shell fairy dust on your Go programs.</p>
<h2 id="systems-programs">Systems programs</h2>
<p>It’s not that the shell itself is so clever. As a <em>programming</em> language, at least for non-trivial tasks, it’s distinctly clumsy. But its elegant design makes it the perfect tool for <em>scripts</em>: short, focused programs that operate on files, processes, or text, in the service of managing computer systems. In other words, <em>systems programs</em>.</p>
<p>Traditionally, much of this kind of software has been written as scripts for various <em>shells</em>. A shell such as <code>bash</code> is a sort of hybrid between a job control language and a text-based interactive user interface.</p>
<p>There are lots of different and mutually incompatible shells, which is part of the problem, but let’s just refer to all of these as “the shell” in this discussion.</p>
<p>Why shouldn’t it be as easy to write systems programs in Go as it is in the shell?</p>
</div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1690376901819_5602"><p>Join my Go Club and get Go-related stuff in your inbox, twice a month</p></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1666798430992_11157"><h2 id="why-go">Why Go?</h2>
<p>If the shell is the traditional way of writing systems software, then what would be the point of using a language like Go instead? It has many advantages: Go programs are <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/slower">fast</a>, scalable, can be written quickly, and can also be maintained by large teams over a long time.</p>
<p>Go does much to support us in writing <em>correct</em> programs, being a compiled language with a strong type system. It also surfaces errors in a way that makes them hard to ignore, encouraging robust programs.</p>
<p>However, whereas shells are optimised for the specific tasks of scripting and job control, Go is a <em>general-purpose</em> language, used for all sorts of different applications.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that we can’t use it for systems programming, though. It just means that it doesn’t have a lot of built-in facilities for making such programs easy to write. At least, perhaps not as easy as the shell makes it.</p>
<p>For example, consider a typical devops task such as counting the lines in a log file that match a certain string (<code>error</code>, let’s say). Most experienced Unix users would write some kind of shell <em>one-liner</em> to do this. For example:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>grep</span> error log.txt <span>|</span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The overall effect of this pipeline is to print the number of lines in <code>log.txt</code> that match the string <code>error</code>. The shell makes it easy to compose individual commands like <code>grep</code> and <code>wc</code> to achieve the goal.</p>
<h2 id="a-typical-task">A typical task</h2>
<p>But shell wizards (and witches) can do much more. For example, suppose we have a web server access log to analyse. Here’s a typical line from such a log: it contains the client’s IP address, a timestamp, and various information about the request.</p>
<pre><code>203.0.113.17 - - [30/Jun/2019:17:06:15 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2028 "https://example.com/ "Mozilla/5.0..."</code></pre>
<p>And suppose we want to find the top ten most frequent visitors to our website, by IP address. How could we do that?</p>
<p>Each line represents one request, so we’ll need to count the lines for each IP address, sort them in descending order of frequency, and take the first ten.</p>
<p>A shell one-liner like this would do the job:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>cut</span> <span>-d</span><span>' '</span> <span>-f</span> 1 access.log <span>|</span><span>sort</span> <span>|</span><span>uniq</span> <span>-c</span> <span>|</span><span>sort</span> <span>-rn</span> <span>|</span><span>head</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This extracts the IP address from the first column of each line (<code>cut</code>), counts the number of unique values (<code>uniq -c</code>), sorts them in descending numerical order (<code>sort -rn</code>), and shows the first ten (<code>head</code>).</p>
<p>Since virtually all Unix commands can accept data on standard input, and write results to standard output, some very complex pipelines can be constructed this way, using only the shell’s simple pipe operator.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful and flexible programming paradigm, which goes a long way to explaining the dominance of the Unix model today. It also suggests it’s worth investing a little time in learning how to get the best out of your shell.</p>
<p>So can we do the same sort of magic in Go? Let’s try to write a similar program and see how easy it is (or not).</p>
<h2 id="the-wrong-answer">The wrong answer</h2>
<p>While the task is well-defined, this program is by no means easy to write in Go. It’s certainly hard to make it as concise as the shell version.</p>
<p>Something like this might do the job:</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/bitfield/tpg-tools2/blob/main/visitors/1/main.go">Listing visitors/1</a>)</p>
<p>There are several problems with this program, not least that it’s pretty complicated. You might like to test your code-reading skills by figuring out how it works, but I’m by no means recommending it as a model of Go style.</p>
<p>It’s just a quick, untested, hack, and that’s partly the point. In devops work we’re often required to solve problems quickly, rather than elegantly. The server could be on fire <em>now</em>, and we need to figure out which IP address is burning it down.</p>
<p>So this isn’t a very satisfactory result. If Go is so great, why isn’t it a good fit for this problem? What kind of code would we like to write instead?</p>
<h2 id="programs-as-pipelines">Programs as pipelines</h2>
<p>Given the nature of the problem, we’d prefer to express the solution as a <em>pipeline</em>, just like the shell program. How could we express that in Go? What about something like this?</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">File<span>(</span><span>"log.txt"</span><span>).</span>Column<span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span>Freq<span>().</span>First<span>(</span><span>10</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In other words, read the file <code>log.txt</code>, take its first column, sort by frequency, get the first ten results, and print them to standard output.</p>
<p>Not only is this extremely concise, it’s arguably even <em>clearer</em> than the shell pipeline. A beginner wouldn’t necessarily know what <code>cut -d' ' -f 1</code> does, for example. But if they saw <code>Column(1)</code>, I think they’d understand that.</p>
<p>And this program achieves the same task as the awkward 30+ line monster we just saw… in <em>one</em> line. Not bad. In fact, it’s getting to the point where even seasoned shell wizards might start to think it’s worth writing systems programs in Go.</p>
<h2 id="the-script-package">The <code>script</code> package</h2>
<p>But this example doesn’t even really look like Go code! How is it possible? The answer is a package called <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bitfield/script"><code>script</code></a>:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>import</span> <span>"github.com/bitfield/script"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>script</code> is a Go package for doing the kind of tasks that shell scripts are good at: reading files, executing subprocesses, counting lines, matching strings, and so on. The author liked the elegant and concise nature of well-crafted shell pipelines, but liked Go even more.</p>
<p>Now you can construct nifty one-liners in Go without all that tedious scanning, sorting, slicing, and looping. Let’s take a look at a few examples.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to read the contents of a file as a string. Here’s what that looks like in <code>script</code>:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">data<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>File<span>(</span><span>"test.txt"</span><span>).</span>String<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That looks straightforward enough, but suppose you now want to count the lines in that file.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">n<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>File<span>(</span><span>"test.txt"</span><span>).</span>CountLines<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For something a bit more challenging, let’s try counting the number of lines in the file that match the string “Error”:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1">n<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>File<span>(</span><span>"test.txt"</span><span>).</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"Error"</span><span>).</span>CountLines<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>But what if, instead of reading a specific file, we want to simply pipe input into this program, and have it output only matching lines (like <code>grep</code>)?</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">script<span>.</span>Stdin<span>().</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"Error"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That was almost too easy! So let’s pass in a list of files on the command line, and have our program read them all in sequence and output the matching lines:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>Concat<span>().</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"Error"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Maybe we’re only interested in the first 10 matches. No problem:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>Concat<span>().</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"Error"</span><span>).</span>First<span>(</span><span>10</span><span>).</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">    Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What’s that? You want to append that output to a file instead of printing it to the terminal? <em>You’ve got some attitude, mister</em>. But okay:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>Concat<span>().</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"Error"</span><span>).</span>First<span>(</span><span>10</span><span>).</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">    AppendFile<span>(</span><span>"/var/log/errors.txt"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We’re not limited to getting data only from files or standard input. We can get it from HTTP requests too:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1">script<span>.</span>Get<span>(</span><span>"https://wttr.in/London?format=3"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>// Output:</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><span>// London: 🌦   +13°C</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s great for simple GET requests, but suppose we want to <em>send</em> some data in the body of a POST request, for example. Here’s how that works:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1">script<span>.</span>Echo<span>(</span>data<span>).</span>Post<span>(</span>URL<span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we need to customise the HTTP behaviour in some way, such as using our own HTTP client, we can do that:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1">script<span>.</span>NewPipe<span>().</span>WithHTTPClient<span>(&amp;</span>http<span>.</span>Client<span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2">    Timeout<span>:</span> <span>10</span> <span>*</span> time<span>.</span>Second<span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>}).</span>Get<span>(</span><span>"https://example.com"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or maybe we need to set some custom header on the request. No problem. We can just create the request in the usual way, and set it up however we want. Then we pass it to <code>Do</code>, which will actually perform the request:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">req<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> http<span>.</span>NewRequest<span>(</span>http<span>.</span>MethodGet<span>,</span> <span>"http://example.com"</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb17-2">req<span>.</span>Header<span>.</span>Add<span>(</span><span>"Authorization"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Bearer "</span><span>+</span>token<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb17-3">script<span>.</span>Do<span>(</span>req<span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The HTTP server could return some non-okay response, though; for example, “404 Not Found”. So what happens then?</p>
<p>In general, when any pipe stage (such as <code>Do</code>) encounters an error, it produces no output to subsequent stages. And <code>script</code> treats HTTP response status codes outside the range 200-299 as errors. So the answer for the previous example is that we just won’t <em>see</em> any output from this program if the server returns an error response.</p>
<p>Instead, the pipe “remembers” any error that occurs, and we can retrieve it later by calling its <code>Error</code> method, or by using a <em>sink</em> method such as <code>String</code>, which returns an <code>error</code> value along with the result.</p>
<p><code>Stdout</code> also returns an error, plus the number of bytes successfully written (which we don’t care about for this particular case). So we can check that error, which is always a good idea in Go:</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">_<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>Do<span>(</span>req<span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3">    log<span>.</span>Fatal<span>(</span>err<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb18-4"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If, as is common, the data we get from an HTTP request is in JSON format, we can use <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">JQ</a> queries to interrogate it:</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1">data<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>Do<span>(</span>req<span>).</span>JQ<span>(</span><span>".[0] | {message: .commit.message, name: .commit.committer.name}"</span><span>).</span>String<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can also run external programs and get their output:</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1">script<span>.</span>Exec<span>(</span><span>"ping 127.0.0.1"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>Exec</code> runs the command concurrently: it doesn’t wait for the command to complete before returning any output. That’s good, because this <code>ping</code> command will run forever (or until we get bored).</p>
<p>Instead, when we read from the pipe using <code>Stdout</code>, we see each line of output as it’s produced:</p>
<pre><code>PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.056 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.054 ms
...</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>ping</code> example, we knew the exact arguments we wanted to send the command, and we just needed to run it once. But what if we don’t know the arguments yet? We might get them from the user, for example.</p>
<p>We might like to be able to run the external command repeatedly, each time passing it the next line of data from the pipe as an argument. No worries:</p>
<div id="cb22"><pre><code><span id="cb22-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>ExecForEach<span>(</span><span>"ping -c 1 {{.}}"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That <code>{{.}}</code> is standard Go template syntax; it’ll substitute each line of data from the pipe into the command line before it’s executed. You can write as fancy a Go template expression as you want here (but this simple example probably covers most use cases).</p>
<p>If there isn’t a built-in operation that does what we want, we can just write our own, using <code>Filter</code>:</p>
<div id="cb23"><pre><code><span id="cb23-1">script<span>.</span>Echo<span>(</span><span>"hello world"</span><span>).</span>Filter<span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span>r io<span>.</span>Reader<span>,</span> w io<span>.</span>Writer<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb23-2">    n<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> io<span>.</span>Copy<span>(</span>w<span>,</span> r<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb23-3">    fmt<span>.</span>Fprintf<span>(</span>w<span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>filtered %d bytes</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> n<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb23-4">    <span>return</span> err</span>
<span id="cb23-5"><span>}).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span>
<span id="cb23-6"><span>// Output:</span></span>
<span id="cb23-7"><span>// hello world</span></span>
<span id="cb23-8"><span>// filtered 11 bytes</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>func</code> we supply to <code>Filter</code> takes just two parameters: a reader to read from, and a writer to write to. The reader reads the previous stages of the pipe, as you might expect, and anything written to the writer goes to the <em>next</em> stage of the pipe.</p>
<p>If our <code>func</code> returns some error, then, just as with the <code>Do</code> example, the pipe’s error status is set, and subsequent stages become a no-op.</p>
<p>Filters run concurrently, so the pipeline can start producing output before the input has been fully read, as it did in the <code>ping</code> example. In fact, most built-in pipe methods, including <code>Exec</code>, are implemented <em>using</em> <code>Filter</code>.</p>

<p>One of the things that makes shell scripts powerful is not just the shell language itself, which is pretty basic. It’s the availability of a rich set of <em>userland</em> tools, like <code>grep</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>head</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>But we can replicate most of the functionality of those tools using script. Here’s a program that just echoes its input to its output, like <code>cat</code>:</p>

<p>And here’s one that concatenates all the files it’s given as arguments and writes them to the output, again like <code>cat</code>:</p>
<div id="cb25"><pre><code><span id="cb25-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>Concat<span>().</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What about <code>echo</code>? Can we do that? Yup:</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>Join<span>().</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s fairly easy to reproduce at least the simple behaviour of most of the familiar Unix tools in this way. And for anything that’s not already provided in <code>script</code>, well, we can just use the tool itself:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1">script<span>.</span>Exec<span>(</span><span>"open info.pdf"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since we can run any external program, we can use the shell’s facilities too. Now we really have the best of all worlds!</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1">script<span>.</span>Exec<span>(</span><span>"bash -c 'echo hello from bash'"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>One common operation in shell scripts is to use the <code>find</code> tool to generate a recursive directory listing. We can do that too:</p>
<div id="cb29"><pre><code><span id="cb29-1">script<span>.</span>FindFiles<span>(</span><span>"/backup"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>But supposing we then wanted to do some operation on each of the files discovered in this way. What would that look like?</p>
<div id="cb30"><pre><code><span id="cb30-1">script<span>.</span>FindFiles<span>(</span><span>"*.go"</span><span>).</span>ExecForEach<span>(</span><span>"gofmt -w {{ . }}"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You might recognise the argument to <code>ExecForEach</code> as a Go template; every filename produced by <code>FindFiles</code> will be substituted into this command in turn.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Those chained function calls look a bit weird. What’s going on there?</p>
<p>One of the neat things about the Unix shell, and its many imitators, is the way you can compose operations into a <em>pipeline</em>:</p>
<div id="cb31"><pre><code><span id="cb31-1"><span>cat</span> test.txt <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> Error <span>|</span> <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output from each stage of the pipeline feeds into the next, and you can think of each stage as a <em>filter</em> that passes on only certain parts of its input to its output.</p>
<p>By comparison, writing shell-like scripts in raw Go is much less convenient, because everything you do returns a different data type, and you must (or at least should) check errors following every operation.</p>
<p>In scripts for system administration we often want to compose different operations like this in a quick and convenient way. If an error occurs somewhere along the pipeline, we would like to check this just once at the end, rather than after every operation.</p>
<h2 id="everything-is-a-pipe">Everything is a pipe</h2>
<p>The <code>script</code> package allows us to do this because everything is a pipe (specifically, a <code>script.Pipe</code>). To create a pipe, start with a <em>source</em> like <code>File</code>:</p>
<div id="cb32"><pre><code><span id="cb32-1">p <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>File<span>(</span><span>"test.txt"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You might expect <code>File</code> to return an error if there is a problem opening the file, but it doesn’t. We will want to call a chain of methods on the result of <code>File</code>, and it’s inconvenient to do that if it also returns an error. So <code>File</code> returns a pipe instead.</p>
<p>Since <code>File</code> returns a pipe, you can call any method on it you like. For example, <code>Match</code>:</p>
<div id="cb33"><pre><code><span id="cb33-1">p<span>.</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"what I'm looking for"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result of <em>this</em> is another pipe (containing only the matching lines from <code>test.txt</code>), and so on. You don’t have to chain all your methods onto a single line, but it’s pretty neat that you can if you want to.</p>
<h2 id="handling-errors">Handling errors</h2>
<p>As we saw in the <code>Do</code> example, as soon as any pipeline stage hits an error, the error flag is set on the pipe, and all subsequent operations on the pipe become no-ops. That means you don’t need to check for an error <em>at each stage</em>: instead, you can check it at the end, or whenever you like.</p>
<p>You can always ask a pipe for its error status by calling its <code>Error</code> method:</p>
<div id="cb34"><pre><code><span id="cb34-1"><span>if</span> err <span>:=</span> p<span>.</span>Error<span>();</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb34-2">    <span>return</span> fmt<span>.</span>Errorf<span>(</span><span>"oh no: %w"</span><span>,</span> err<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb34-3"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Seasoned Gophers will recognise this as the <code>errWriter</code> pattern described by Rob Pike in the blog post <a href="https://blog.golang.org/errors-are-values">Errors are values</a>. It’s ideal when you’re carrying out a series of operations, any of which can error, but you only care if the <em>sequence</em> as a whole encounters an error.</p>
<p>This eliminates a lot of the <code>if err != nil</code> boilerplate which seems to infuriate people so much about Go. Those people aren’t crazy: that kind of thing <em>can</em> be annoying, if you don’t know this useful pattern.</p>
<h2 id="closing-pipes">Closing pipes</h2>
<p>If you’ve dealt with files in Go before, you’ll know that you need to <em>close</em> a file once you’ve finished with it. Otherwise, the program will retain what’s called a <em>file handle</em> (the kernel data structure that represents an open file).</p>
<p>There is a limit to the total number of open file handles for a given program, and for the system as a whole, so a program that leaks file handles will eventually crash, and will waste resources in the meantime.</p>
<p>Files aren’t the only things that need to be closed after reading: so do network connections, HTTP response bodies, and so on.</p>
<p>How does <code>script</code> handle this? Simple. The data source associated with a pipe will be automatically closed once it is read completely. Therefore, calling any sink method that reads the pipe to completion (such as <code>String</code>) will close its data source. The only case in which you need to explicitly call <code>Close</code> on a pipe is when you don’t read from it, or you don’t read it to completion for some reason.</p>
<p>If the pipe was created from something that doesn’t need to be closed, such as a string, then calling <code>Close</code> simply does nothing, as you’d expect.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-shell">Why not shell?</h2>
<p>This is cool and all, but is it <em>really</em> needed? After all, haven’t we been running the world on shell scripts for several decades? And aren’t we writing more of them every day? So what’s the problem with shell scripts, and why is Go the solution?</p>
<p>It’s a fair question. Shell scripts and one-liners are perfectly adequate for building one-off tasks, initialization scripts, and the kind of ‘glue code’ that holds the internet together. I speak as someone who’s spent at least thirty years doing this for a living. But in many ways they’re not ideal for important, non-trivial programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to build portable shell scripts is a nightmare. The exact syntax and options of Unix commands varies from one distribution to another. Although in theory POSIX is a workable common subset of functionality, in practice it’s usually precisely the non-POSIX behaviour that you need.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shell scripts are hard to test (though test frameworks have been written, and if you’re seriously putting mission-critical shell scripts into production, you should be using them, or reconsidering your technology choices).
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shell scripts don’t scale. Because there are very limited facilities for logic and abstraction, and because any successful program tends to grow remorselessly over time, shell scripts can become an unreadable mess of special cases and spaghetti code. We’ve all seen it, if not, indeed, done it.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shell syntax is awkward: quoting, whitespace, and brackets can require a lot of fiddling to get right, and so many characters are magic to the shell (<code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and so on) that this can lead to subtle bugs. Scripts can work fine for years until you suddenly encounter a file whose name contains whitespace, and then everything breaks horribly.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Deploying shell scripts obviously requires at least a (sizable) shell binary in addition to the source code, but it usually also requires an unknown and variable number of extra userland programs (<code>cut</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>head</code>, and friends). If you’re building container images, for example, you effectively need to include a whole Unix distribution with your program, which runs to hundreds of megabytes, and is not at all in the spirit of containers.
</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair to the shell, this kind of thing is not what it was ever intended for. Shell is an interactive job control tool for launching programs, connecting programs together, and to a limited extent, manipulating text. It’s not for building portable, scalable, reliable, and elegant programs. That’s what <em>Go</em> is for.</p>

<p>Go has a great testing framework built right into the standard library. It has a superb standard library, and thousands of high-quality third-party packages for just about any functionality you can imagine. It is compiled, so it’s fast, and statically typed, so it’s reliable. It’s efficient and memory-safe. Go programs can be distributed as a single binary. Go scales to enormous projects (Kubernetes, for example).</p>
<p>The <code>script</code> package is implemented entirely in Go, and does not require any external userland programs. Thus you can build your <code>script</code> program as a single (very small) binary that is quick to build, quick to upload, quick to deploy (in a container, for example), quick to run, and economical with resources.</p>
<p>I’m not saying shell scripting is obsolete. I still use a lot of shell scripts myself. There is a large problem domain where shell is absolutely the right answer. But small programs tend to grow into large ones, and when that happens, it’s nice to be able to use the facilities of a language that was designed for programming at scale.</p>
<p>But with a package like <code>script</code>, we don’t have to lose all the elegance and flexibility of the classic Unix environment we’ve come to love. Instead, we can keep just a little bit of that old shell magic.</p>
<p><small>You can read more about the implementation of the <code>script</code> package, and other interesting programs, in my book, <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books/tools">The Power of Go: Tools</a>.</small></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/xanadu-patterns">https://maggieappleton.com/xanadu-patterns</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37197686">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p type="button" role="button" id="react-collapsed-toggle-undefined" aria-controls="react-collapsed-panel-undefined" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0"><h4>Table of Contents</h4></p></div>
<p>It's infamous in the technology community as a sixty-year project that&nbsp;never quite launched. A cautionary tale of what happens when you overhype, underdeliver, and try to stuff an operating system's worth of features into a single piece of proprietary software. The kind of tale that makes our ferociously lean startup culture of Move Fast, Break Things, and Demo or Die seem almost sensible.</p>
<p>Xanadu was a hypothetical hypertext system. </p>
<p>It's hard to read the word <em>hypertext</em> in 2021 and not believe its synonymous with the system Tim Berners-Lee built in 1989 – the World Wide Web that became so much more than linked text on digital screens. The version of hypertext you are reading this on is the only hypertext most of us have ever known.</p>
<p>And yet the idea of hypertext predates Berners-Lee by two decades. The term was coined in 1963 by none other than Ted Nelson as part of a much larger vision; one small brick in the grand Xanadu dream mansion. </p>
<p>To talk about Xanadu, we need to put a pin in our current understanding of <em>hypertext</em>. Our preconceived notions of what a link is, how it works, and what digital text is capable of threatens to overwrite the alternate history we're about to explore.</p>
<p>Ted hoped Xanadu would be a medium for “<!-- -->" – a paradigm shift that would free us from the material constraints of paper. His vision was the first to meaningfully consider how storing information in digital bits could reconfigure the way we read, write, cite, and share words.</p>
<p>Xanadu's failure to mature into a widespread, useable commercial product is great fodder a <!-- -->. One fuelled by the noticeably combative language in Xanadu's <!-- -->:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The computer world is a continual war over software politics and paradigms" where “we fight on" for “vindication" and “the last laugh."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One feels like the dinner guest who has stumbled into a raging martial argument over unwashed tea towels. You don't dare ask for context.</p>
<p>Yet these historical skirmishes and financial flops are also the least interesting thing about Xanadu. The most interesting part is its&nbsp;<strong>Pattern Language</strong>.</p>
<a href="#architectural-pattern-languages"><h2 id="architectural-pattern-languages">Architectural Pattern Languages</h2></a>
 are sets of flexible, reusable solutions to common
design problems.
<p>They come from the land of architects: the software developers of the material world. Namely, the architect <!-- -->, whose philosophy of constructing vibrant and humane living space escaped the confines of urban planning and infused the world of software design in the late 1980's.</p>
<p>In their book <!-- -->, Alexander defined 253 architectural patterns for designing cities, towns, and homes. These became the example patterns for writing patterns. Each one is composed of a context, problem, example, and solution.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>For example, the design pattern <strong>A Place to Wait</strong> asks that we create comfortable accommodation and ambient activity whenever someone needs to wait; benches, cafes, reading rooms, miniature playgrounds, three-reel slot machines (if we happen to be in the Las Vegas airport). This solves the problem of huddles of people awkwardly hovering in liminal space; near doorways, taking up sidewalks, anxiously waiting for delayed flights or dental operations or immigration investigations without anything to distract them from uncertain fates.</p>
<p>Others like <strong>Light on Two Sides of Every Room</strong> and <strong>Staircase as Stage</strong> are fairly self-explanatory.</p>
<p>There's no single way to implement these design patterns. They are purposefully abstract enough to adapt to the situation at hand. Rules of thumb rather than sets of formulaic instructions.</p>
<a href="#xanadu-as-a-design-pattern"><h2 id="xanadu-as-a-design-pattern">Xanadu as a Design Pattern</h2></a>
<p>Taken as a collection of design patterns, Xanadu's documentation suggests solutions to some of the hypertextual problems we're wrestling with today;</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we structure information and build relationships between pieces of data that help us see them across contexts, and clarify understanding?</li>
<li>How do we build systems that allow people to collaborate on shared documents without losing authorship? How do we credit and compensate authors based on their contributions?</li>
<li>How do we bring ideas and data from a variety of sources into conversation with our own, while leaving a clear trail back to the origin?</li>
</ul>
<p>Xanadu became a sad parable, when it should have been a piece of speculative design. A set of seeds scattered into the wind for other people to pick up and plant, rather than the patent-happy industrial farming conglomerate it tried to grow into.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, there appear to be rogue seedlings sprouting around the web. A number of Xanadu's design patterns are showing up in modern manifestations. We're finding ways to backwards engineer the original spirit of Xanadu into the existing structures of the World Wide Web.</p>
<h2>The Patterns</h2>
<h3 id="1-visible-links">1. Visible Links</h3>
<p>Ted Nelson has many gripes, and <strong>jump links</strong> are one of his biggest. They're the kind of links we all use around the web today. Clicking a hyperlink is a bit of a gamble. It <em>jumps</em> you into somewhere unknown. You find out when you get there.</p>
<p>We've found ways to adapt to this; Venkatesh Rao has a compelling exploration of how we've developed a <!-- --> to hint at where people are headed. Most browsers will do this more explicitly by showing you a URL preview, but they tuck them into the far corner in tiny text:</p>
<!-- -->
<p>These can only tell you so much when modern URLs are often obscured by link shorteners and overstuffed with tracking queries. These solutions are only a band-aid on the underlying wound. They suggest where you're headed, rather than showing you.</p>
<p>Nelson's answer to jump links are <strong>visible links</strong> – links that show you the full context of where you're headed. These were an essential feature of Xanadu. In the original mockups for “<em>Xanadocs</em>" linked text would be connected to its source in a rather literal fashion: brightly colored highlights running between documents.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>This proposed solution relies on two other patterns – <em>parallel documents</em> and <em>transpointing windows</em> (covered below) – but the underlying principle was simply that links made their destinations clear.</p>
<p>In lieu of Xanadoc links, the modern web has landed on some fairly decent solutions to this issue: <strong>hover previews and unfurls</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Hover previews</strong> are when you can see a preview of the page you're headed to when you hover over a link. It's usually an excerpt that gives you the page title, the first few lines of text, and sometimes an image. Wikipedia was one of the first major sites to <!-- --> in 2018.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Hover previews have also become popular in the <span></span></p> community as a way to help visitors quickly navigate through collections of public notes and essays that are deeply interlinked. <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak</a> and <a href="https://www.gwern.net/index">Gwern Branwen</a> are two gardeners with good examples of how these work in action.
<!-- -->
<p>Similar to hover previews, <strong>unfurls</strong> are the preview cards that automagically appear when you paste a link into Twitter, Facebook, Notion, Miro, or any other richly-featured web app. If I paste a link to this great article on <!-- --> into a Tweet or Notion document, it automagically displays the feature image, title, and byline without any extra effort from me:</p>
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<p>This system is powered by the <!-- --> which Facebook introduced in 2010. This standardised format helps website authors define <em>metadata</em> like titles, descriptions, authors, and images for each of their pages. These are automatically retrieved and “unfurled" when the link is pasted elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Both hover previews and link unfurls give you a good sense of where you're headed if you click on a link. They get us to <em>semi-visible</em> links.</p>
<p>Previews aren't quite the same as physical links between parts of a page though. You lose the fine-grained associations between specific paragraphs and lines. If we wanted to dial up the Xanadu-esque visibility, we could work on showing previews of the whole page and directing people to specific pieces of text within it.</p>
<h3 id="2-parallel-documents">2. Parallel Documents</h3>
<p>Ted's proposal for visible links relied on another key Xanadu pattern: <strong>parallel documents arranged side-by-side</strong>. This pattern allow us to see quotations in their original context, and quickly jump to the source material of documents.</p>
<p>It's also tricky to misquote someone and cherry-pick misleading excerpts when the reader has immediate, effortless access to the original.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>This sounds great in theory. Being able to lay multiple sheets of paper down side-by-side in meatspace is one of its shining qualities. Humans are very good at visually skimming information spread out in front of us – it allows us to quickly pattern-match by comparing and contrasting.</p>
<p>Ideally our digital mediums would lean into our ability to survey a large visual field. But the limitations of LCD screen sizes lead to some unsatisfying compromises. Instead, we end up squishing columns of documents onto our tiny screens.</p>
<p>The existing prototypes of Xanadu don't gracefully solve this problem in any way. Some of them – like the 2007 <em>XanaduSpace</em> demo – suggest launching into the disorienting world of 3D paper where documents tower over you like skyscrapers.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Here's Ted to give you an interactive tour:</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Flying about in multiple dimensions feels slightly distracting when you're trying to write a detailed product spec or salvage your mediocre thesis.</p>
<p>We have developed some slightly less nauseasting solutions to this problem.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Tabs and slide-over windows help us quickly move between documents, although they still fail at letting us see more than two at once.</p>
<p>Many modern note-taking apps have popularised fat “sidebars" that are essentially second windows.</p>
<p>Roam Research, Obsidian, Logseq, and Innos are all designed for parallel documents</p>
<p>Arranging two windows side-by-side doesn't properly solve this problem. We can't select things from from one window and drag them into the next. The two windows don't know about each other and usually can't interact. They're connected to different data sources, possibly running in seperate applications. Copying and pasting text, images, or objects between the two is a cumbersome workaround.</p>
<p>The mobile-first responsive web also makes this tricky. There is simply no space on a 320px-wide screen to consider viewing multiple windows at once. Although patterns like horizontal scroll and slide-over windows might help solve this.</p>
<h3 id="3-transpointing-windows">3. Transpointing Windows</h3>
<p>Parts of documents visibly point to other parts</p>
<p>LiquidText</p>
<!-- -->
<p> managed to craft up this crazy demo inside of their Roam Research database.</p>
<p>Loading...</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="5-bi-directional-links">5. Bi-Directional Links</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<span></span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-version-control">6. Version Control</h3>
<p>In the age of Git, we tend to take version control for granted.</p>
<p>The first version control system dates back to <!-- -->. It's now difficult to imagine programming without it.</p>
<h3 id="7-modular-text-blocks">7. Modular Text Blocks</h3>
<p>The core building block of the web has always been documents. While the idea of a web<em>page</em> has evolved far beyond it's original idea, we still construct, connect, and navigate websites at the page level.</p>
<p>The early web was built for academic researchers to share their work, in a time before all the plebs invaded with our bleeding-heart livejournal entries, dancing baby GIFs, and TikTok moves. These researchers designed the system to mimic their primary medium of communication; paper-based academic articles and documents.</p>
<p>This paper document design metaphor determined many of the early architectural decisions. URL addresses were set at the <em>page</em> level, rather than the paragraph. Inline images were an afterthought, and even a contentious addition to the spec. </p>
<p>Blocks construct documents</p>
<p>Notion pioneered this in the note-taking space</p>
<p>Explosion of note-taking apps using a block-first approach: Roam, Innos, Clover, Craft, Kosmik</p>

<p>The original Xanadu vision was ambitious. Unreasonably ambitious. The above feature list is a small selection.</p>
<p>Perhaps you sense the problem.<br>
<!-- -->Solving all the things all at once gets tricky.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> <span>YAGNI</span>, unless you’re working in a big company with federated front-ends or GraphQL.</p>
<p>It’s popular in web dev nowadays to build a backend that serves <span>JSON</span>, and a frontend that renders the app. This is fine. I’m not the biggest fan, but it’s really okay.

<li>How to optimize requests to multiple endpoints</li>
<li>How to avoid using <span>API</span> data fields in unintended ways</li>
<li>How to weigh the benefit of new features against the cost of new <span>API</span> requests</li>
</ol>
<p>Do these really have to be your problems if you’re just making a backend for your frontend? Do you have to imagine every possible workflow, avoid N+1 request issues, test every request configuration, or deny yourself features when you know exactly what each page needs to look like? You can probably see where I’m going with this.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-you-suggest">So what do you suggest?</h2>
<p>I suggest you stop treating your frontend as some generic <span>API</span> client, and start treating it as a half of your app.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could just send it the whole<span></span> <span>“</span>page” worth of <span>JSON</span>. Make an endpoint for <code>/page/a</code> and render the whole <span>JSON</span> for <code>/page/a</code> there. Do this for every page. Don’t force your front-end developers to send a bunch of individual requests to render a complex page. Stop annoying them with contrived limitations. Align yourselves. <span>🧘‍♂️</span></p>
<p>And in that <span>JSON</span>, actually render the page. Don’t render abstract models and collections. Render concrete boxes, sections, paragraphs, lists. Render the visual page structure.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "section1": {
    "topBoxTitle": "Foo",
    "leftBoxTitle": "Bar",
    "linkToClose": "https://…"
  },
  "section2": {
    …
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is similar but not quite the same as Server Driven <span>UI</span><a href="#footnote-18YB" id="ref-18YB" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Perhaps we could call it Server Informed <span>UI</span>.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-that-better-exactly">How is that better exactly?</h2>
<p>Have you seen that list of annoying decisions up there? For one, they are gone now. <img draggable="false" alt="💨" src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_ae6687516f4a44fb8370df95cf526289/_image_cache/b755281c-b164-4cd6-a1a0-175e1c00a72b.png" width="36" height="36"></p>
<p>For two, you are now free to decide<span></span> <span>“</span>I want page a” and then implement<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” in the backend, and in the frontend. Super straightforward. <img draggable="false" alt="✅" src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_ae6687516f4a44fb8370df95cf526289/_image_cache/c237b804-0a39-42cb-b7cc-a0629e3e52b5.png" width="36" height="36"></p>
<p>No more<span></span> <span>“</span>what <span>API</span> workflows do we need to introduce to sort of make this page possible almost? <span>🤔</span><span></span><span>”</span>. You can keep<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” dumb to only do what it needs to do. You test the crap out of<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” for bugs, security, performance. You can even fetch everything for<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” in a single big <span>SQL</span> query. You can cache the entire <span>JSON</span> payload of<span></span> <span>“</span>page a”.</p>
<p>Frontend knows exactly what each field in<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” payload is for. There are no discrepancies in field meanings. They represent exactly what frontend needs.</p>
<p>When a stakeholder tells you to change<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” you will be able to literally go ahead and change<span></span> <span>“</span>page a”, instead of spending meetings figuring out how your backend <span>API</span> could accommodate the change in<span></span> <span>“</span>page a”. It’s not a choreographed conglomeration of <span>API</span> requests. It’s just<span></span> <span>“</span>page a”. You have freed yourself from self-imposed limitations of your <span>API</span>.</p>
<p>Your business logic has now moved from being haphazardly split between frontend and backend into just backend. Your frontend can finally focus on presentation and <span>UI</span>. Your backend can finally focus on implementing exactly what’s needed. Kinda the goal, no?</p>
<h2 id="have-you-actually-tried-this">Have you actually tried this?</h2>
<p>Yes, I have tried this on a couple of production projects so far. One of them was personal, the other was a consistent multi-year refactoring effort in an existing company. The whole team was bought in, and it worked out well. The only problem we’ve encountered was that the front-end team has gotten increasingly bored. Nearly all business logic was taken away from them. At the same time, no<span></span> <span>“</span>excitement” was added to the back-end team. It’s just gotten kinda boring all around. Somehow we all ended up talking more about the business than the code.</p>
<p>Feel free to stop reading here if you’re convinced. Next part is just responding to various rebuttals I keep hearing.</p>
<h3 id="but-i-want-my-front-end-team-to-have-freedom-or-i-want-my-front-end-to-be-decoupled">But I want my front-end team to have freedom! (Or, I want my front-end to be decoupled!)</h3>
<p>Let’s be honest, your frontend doesn’t really have freedom. When they send you 7 requests to render a single page, that’s not freedom. It’s jumping hoops to meet basic requirements. As soon as requirements change, you probably going to need to change the backend anyway to accommodate it. The freedom is all accidental and mostly in the wrong places.</p>
<p>If you really want to give your front end team freedom, install them a GraphQL wrapper directly on top of Postgres and quit. <img draggable="false" alt="😛" src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_ae6687516f4a44fb8370df95cf526289/_image_cache/fb91fc71-2c42-4a9a-96d7-2b7839fdf04f.png" width="36" height="36"></p>
<h3 id="but-we-actually-want-a-general-purpose-api-anyway-so-this-is-2-birds-with-1-stone-no">But we actually want a general purpose <span>API</span> anyway, so this is 2 birds with 1 stone, no?</h3>
<p>No, you would not actually want to make this <span>API</span> public. You think you would, but when time comes, you’d be like<span></span> <span>“</span>crap, maybe I shouldn’t”. These 2 APIs have very different reasons to change. Public <span>API</span> needs to enable the workflows of your clients. Private backend needs to enable the next whim of your product manager. Stop jamming sticks into your own bicycle wheels.</p>
<h3 id="but-how-will-i-reuse-the-logic-when-building-json-for-pages-i-reused-so-much-logic-in-my-crud-controllers">But how will I reuse the logic when building <span>JSON</span> for pages? I reused so much logic in my <span>CRUD</span> controllers!</h3>
<p>If your programming language lets you reuse logic (it does), then you can reuse logic. Use mixins, composition, inheritance, whatever you got to work with. If you make yourself some good abstractions, then you will have an amazing time putting together pages from your <span>LEGO</span> blocks.</p>
<h3 id="but-we-can-reuse-this-api-for-the-mobile-app-too">But we can reuse this <span>API</span> for the mobile app too!</h3>
<p>Your mobile app has a different set of pages with different info, structures, and reasons to change. You’ll save more time and sanity making another backend specifically for it. But hey, you can reuse a lot of your logic (see the previous paragraph).</p>
<h3 id="but-what-if-a-page-needs-a-partial-xhr-update-am-i-supposed-to-always-return-an-entire-page">But what if a page needs a partial <span>XHR</span> update? Am I supposed to always return an entire page?</h3>
<p>No, it’s okay to make an endpoint that returns just something specific. You have my permission. Make endpoints for snippets of data for specific page sections or whatever. It’s okay. Render your React components from initial payload, then update them from <span>XHR</span> calls to these endpoints. But only introduce these endpoints when you need them on certain pages. These are exceptions, not the default.</p>
<h3 id="but-my-frontend-is-a-spa-so-it-almost-always-needs-data-snippets-not-entire-pages">But my frontend is a <span>SPA</span>, so it almost always needs data snippets, not entire pages</h3>
<p>Those data snippets could still be provided as partial page structures, not generic resources. As long as your backend only serves the exact needs of your frontend, you’re good. <img draggable="false" alt="😇" src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_ae6687516f4a44fb8370df95cf526289/_image_cache/ba0c8f92-0363-47ee-998e-873b458ed98a.png" width="36" height="36"></p>
<h3 id="but-im-building-a-site-builder-so-my-frontend-is-dogfooding-the-site-builder-api">But I’m building a site builder, so my frontend is dogfooding the site builder <span>API</span></h3>
<p><span>🗡</span> I dub thee a legitimate use case haver, congratulations!</p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-data-to-support-your-claims">Do you have data to support your claims?</h3>
<p>I wish. It’s pretty hard to measure these kinds of things in our industry. Who’s gonna maintain 2 architectures for the same software for 3 years, and compare productivity between them? All I got is a mixed bag of personal experiences. Feels inductively justifiable. <span>🤷‍♂️</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Debian is an island of stability and sanity in the constant swirling chaos of Linux and open source. Long may it continue to be.</p>
<p>Ian Murdock <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHistory?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Debian-announcement-1993.txt" rel="nofollow">announced</a> the new distro on August 16, 1993. <a href="https://bits.debian.org/2023/08/debian-turns-30.html" rel="nofollow">Three decades later</a>, Debian is arguably more important and more pivotal to the modern Linux world than ever before. The project calls the event <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay" rel="nofollow">Debian Day</a>, and there are <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay/2023" rel="nofollow">celebrations</a> around the world this weekend. If you can get to one, you should – real-life FOSS parties are great fun.</p>
<p>It's not the oldest extant distro, although it's only a month behind Slackware, whose <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/20/slackware_turns_30/">30th birthday</a> we covered last month. Slackware is still maintained by original project founder Patrick Volkderding, while, sadly, the founder of Debian <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/12/30/ian_murdock_debian_founder/">is no longer with us</a>.</p>

    

<p>Debian, though, has more remixes and respins and derivatives, and via them more users, than any other Linux distro – with the possible exception of ChromeOS, although of course a lot of people <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/linux_desktop_debate/">don't consider ChromeOS to be a Linux distro</a>. (Android dwarfs both but it's not really in the same playing field.)</p>
<h3>Free as in 'free beer'</h3>
<p>It's important to remember that the word "free" in "free software" does have two meanings. No matter how many self-important thinkpieces say it, FOSS <strong>isn't</strong> just about freedom. The simple fact that <em>you don't have to&nbsp;pay for it</em> matters as much or more.</p>
<p>This is especially true in poorer parts of the world. FOSS OSes also <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/11/software_versus_hardware/">work better on older, slower computers</a>, which drives adoption among the billions who can't afford the latest laptops. The innovative <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/12/endless_os_5/">Endless OS distro</a> doesn't rely on always-on internet, but while it uses Red Hat-backed tools such as GNOME, OStree, and Flatpak, it's built on Debian.</p>

        


        

<p>Without FOSS operating systems, there would be no "cloud." It's nothing technical: it would all work fine on paid-for OS instances, and they form part of it. What made AWS big was the machine-controlled deployment and control of VMs, but nobody sane would allow an auto-scaler to deploy thousands of instances if they cost a thousand bucks each in licence fees.</p>
<p>It's free Linux distros that made Google possible, and Debian is the most important free distro. While Google puts out ChromeOS to the masses who don't care what their laptop runs on, internally it runs on its own in-house distro called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/how-google-got-to-rolling-linux-releases-for-desktops" rel="nofollow">gLinux Rodete</a> – based on Debian.</p>

        

<p>And, of course, there's Ubuntu. Before it launched in October 2004, its sole web presence was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040906084232/http://www.no-name-yet.com/" rel="nofollow">no-name-yet.com</a>, which said:</p>

<p>Response at the time was muted. For instance, the KDE blog <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2004/08/28/canonical-software-no-name-yet-warthogs-and-ubuntu" rel="nofollow">said</a> it was "supposed to be Debian made good (shorter release cycles being one of the main features)." As far as we can tell at Vulture Towers, the splash made by Ubuntu was small enough that <em>The Reg</em> didn't cover it <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2006/07/25/ubuntu_goes_mainstream/">until 2006</a>, when the first ever LTS release appeared – two months late.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/16/red_hat_redeploys_desktop_dev/">Red Hat redeploys one of its main desktop developers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/16/openzfs_zfsbootmenu_2_2/">OpenZFS 2.2 is nearly here, and ZFSBootMenu 2.2 already is</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/15/red_hat_bootloader_role/">Red Hat's Mexican standoff: Job cuts? Yes, but we still need someone to boot Linux</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/14/oracle_suse_ciq_openela/">Oracle, SUSE and others caught up in RHEL drama hit back with OpenELA</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ubuntu was and is a direct offshoot of Debian. It's Sid, the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable" rel="nofollow">DebianUnstable</a> release, integrated, tested, and repackaged.</p>
<p>Nobody really knows how many Linux users there are; there are only estimates. <a href="https://truelist.co/blog/linux-statistics/" rel="nofollow">TrueList reckons</a> that Ubuntu has 33.9 percent of the market, followed by Debian at 16 percent. That's half the Linux market for Debian and its higher-profile offspring.</p>
<p>We also suspect that those figures may not adequately represent Chinese usage too. We've looked at the two leading distro families from the People's Republic. Kylin is one, and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/07/openkylin_is_ubuntu/">it's an Ubuntu remix</a>. The other is the Uniontech UOS family, of which <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/25/deepin_206_23/">Linux Deepin</a> is the international, end-user-facing member. It's based on Debian.</p>
<p>The Chinese "3-5-2 programme" <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/12/09/china_orders_ban_on_us_computers_and_software/">aimed to replace Windows with Linux</a> by the end of last year. We don't know if it's succeeded, but what it's replacing it with is Debian and Debian derivatives.</p>

        

<p>Red Hat makes the big bucks so gets the big headlines, but according to Truelist survey, Red Hat-based distros only constitute about 10 percent of the market, and of that share, some 95 percent are the free ones. That's why everyone is so upset that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/09/centos_red_hat/">Big Purple killed CentOS Linux</a> then <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/23/red_hat_centos_move/">killed off the rebuilds too</a>.</p>
<p>Red Hat <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/10/28/ibm_redhat_acquisition/">sold for $34 billion</a>, but that money represents about 1 percent of Linux usage. Debian and its offspring have <em>50 times</em> as many users as RHEL. Even factoring in CentOS and Fedora, it's just a fifth as many users as Debian.</p>
<p>Although some big businesses <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/14/oracle_suse_ciq_openela/">make much of the noise</a>, what they're squabbling about is the relatively small paid-for slice. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/" rel="nofollow">Software in the Public Interest</a> quietly gets on with funding the gentle giant. It's the free stuff that really matters, and there Debian is the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/16/debian_11/">"rock in a swirling gyre of 'move fast and break things'."</a> ®</p>

<p>In a column for <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irish_Times" title="The Irish Times">The Irish Times</a></i>, writer John McManus questioned whether Ireland had developed shit life syndrome in the wake of a recent fall in life expectancy.<sup id="cite_ref-IrishTimes_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-IrishTimes-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>A 2018 article in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quietus" title="The Quietus">The Quietus</a></i> on the films of the British director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Leigh" title="Mike Leigh">Mike Leigh</a> identified shit life syndrome in Leigh's 2002 film <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_or_Nothing_(film)" title="All or Nothing (film)">All or Nothing</a></i>. Kinney wrote that "The film asks questions about poverty – what does poverty do to people? How do you react when the chips are down?&nbsp;... The rise of populism in this country has been analysed through the lens of the 'left behind' – in a less crude way, this is exactly what <i>All or Nothing</i> was observing sixteen years ago."<sup id="cite_ref-Quietus_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Quietus-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>Rosemary Rizq, in an essay in the 2016 collection <i>The Future of Psychological Therapy</i>, questioned the origin of the term <i>shit life syndrome</i>, writing that "The phrase seemed to denote a level of long-standing poverty, family breakdown, lack of stability, unemployment and potential risk factors common to many of the predominately young, working class patients referred to the [psychotherapeutic] service" for shit is "something that we continually reject, get rid of or hide. At the same time it is something we cannot completely repudiate, it is part of us, something we need" and that the individuals with SLS have problems so "terrible, so untouchable" that they "quite literally cannot be thought about, cannot be handled by the service", yet a therapeutic organisation is "obliged to do so".<sup id="cite_ref-Lees2016_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Lees2016-5">[5]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">




<article>
  
  
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/">Datasette Cloud</a> is the new SaaS hosting platform for the <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> open source project. It enables teams to create a private collaboration space, upload and share data securely with each other, and then selectively publish that data to the world.</strong></p>
  <div>
    <p>Datasette was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Aug/19/instantly-publish-datasette/">born out of data journalism</a>, and the initial intended audience for Datasette Cloud is newsrooms: we want to help journalists share data with each other and with the public without needing to configure and run Datasette on their own hosting provider.</p>
<p>We expect that tools which help journalists find stories in data will be of value to all kinds of other companies and organizations as well though, so everyone else is invited to try out the product too!</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Teams can create a private <strong>space</strong> to collaborate on data, hosted in a region close to them. Spaces each run in their own secure container (powered by <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>) and get their own <code>space-name.datasette.cloud</code> subdomain.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the screen where you create a space, picking a location in the world to host it" src="https://datasette-cloud-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2023/welcome/pick-region.jpg" width="500"></p>
<p>The space administrator can then invite further members to join their space.</p>
<p>Team members can import data into their space in multiple different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload CSV files to create tables</li>
<li>Load CSV files from a URL</li>
<li>Import data from government open data portals that are powered by <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/">Socrata</a></li>
<li>Create new databases by uploading a SQLite database file</li>
<li>Import data using the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/1.0a3/json_api.html#the-json-write-api">Datasette Write JSON API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once imported, data can be edited inline through the Datasette Cloud web interface. See <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/2023/introducing-datasette-write-ui/">Introducing datasette-write-ui: a Datasette plugin for editing, inserting, and deleting rows</a>.</p>
<p>Data in Datasette Cloud can then be accessed using all of the tools provided by Datasette:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Datasette web interface, with filtering, faceting and the ability to run SQL queries and bookmark the results. See <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/explore">Exploring a database with Datasette</a> for a tutorial and live demos, and <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/learn-sql">Learn SQL with Datasette</a> for information on using SQL to query your data.</li>
<li>A powerful JSON API, protected by finely-grained API tokens, for accessing tables and executing SQL queries.</li>
<li>A GraphQL API to all of your tabular data, powered by the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin.</li>
</ul>
<p>All data in Datasette Cloud is stored securely in Fly volumes, and also backed up to S3 using <a href="https://litestream.io/">Litestream</a>.</p>
<h2>What's coming next?</h2>
<p>We're working on a number of features that will be coming to Datasette Cloud soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI-assisted queries. We've been researching ways Large Language Models (the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude and Google's Bard) can be responsibly applied to help journalists find stories in data. Read more at <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">llm.datasette.io</a>.</li>
<li>The ability to publish selected tables and queries to the outside world.</li>
<li>Data annotations: your team will be able to add comments to columns and rows in your data, making it easier to collaborate on data analysis and find stories in your data.</li>
<li>Pricing! We want you to be able to pay for the product, so you can feel confident in its sustainable future and we can get paid to keep working on it.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
      <article>
        
        

        
        <div>
          <p>In 2021, I developed a tool to stream the content of my reMarkable.
(and I also blogged about it <a href="https://blog.owulveryck.info/2021/03/30/streaming-the-remarkable-2.html">here</a>).
Given that I was predominantly working from home, this tool was very useful, allowing me to sketch elements during conference calls.</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of this tool was its ability to stream content directly into a web browser tab.
This feature was particularly useful because it meant I could exclusively share this tab during video calls, ensuring focus on the content I intended to present.</p>
<p>At its core, the tool consisted of two main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A server running on the device, responsible for capturing the raw image and transmitting it to the laptop.</li>
<li>A service on the laptop, which fetched the raw image from the server and processed it into a format suitable for browser viewing (I produced an MJPEG stream for this).</li>
</ol>
<p>Being the product manager of my own tools offered a unique perspective.
One piece of feedback I provided from my experience as a user was the slightly cumbersome nature of the tool’s on-the-fly activation.
The challenge arose from the necessity of a local service. During video calls, this meant some preparatory steps to initiate the local service, adding an additional layer of complexity to the process.</p>
<p>Recognizing this pain point, my goal became clear: eliminate the need for the local service.
This article delves into the revamped implementation of the streaming tool, which now boasts a more user-friendly design and improved performances.</p>
<h2 id="make-it-work-the-evolution-from-old-to-new">Make it work: The Evolution from Old to New</h2>
<p>The code running on the device must have a low footprint.
One way to ensure it remains lightweight is by eliminating any heavy computation on the device.
The sole function of the code running on the server is to grab the raw picture from the memory and expose it over the network.
This led to a three-tier design: server/client/renderer.</p>
<p><em>Ubiquitous language:</em></p>
<p>In this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The server</strong> refers to the code running on the reMarkable (the device). Its main purpose is to expose the raw image of the current display on the reMarkable.</li>
<li><strong>The client</strong> is responsible for fetching the raw image from the server and performing additional processes to convert it into a usable format.</li>
<li><strong>The renderer</strong> accepts the output from the client and displays it on a PC screen.</li>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To minimize CPU usage, the server extracts the picture only when the client is connected.
This functionality was achieved through gRPC communication.</p>
<p>The server can thus operate as a daemon on the reMarkable, awaiting an RPC call from the client.
To initiate streaming, I simply needed to activate the client.
The client retrieves the image in a loop, and each image is encoded in JPEG before being added to an MJPEG stream.
This stream is then made available as an HTTP service by the client.</p>
<p>The renderer is any software capable of reading the MJPEG stream via HTTP, such as VLC or a web browser.</p>
<p>One challenge with this setup is that it necessitates a specific network topology and configuration.
The client must not only be aware of the reMarkable’s address but also possess the necessary privileges to establish a server.
Additionally, the renderer must be familiar with the client’s IP address.</p>
<p>While this wasn’t an issue in my personal setup, complications arose post-pandemic when I returned to in-person presentations.
I realized the need for a more straightforward solution.
My ultimate aim became the ability to simply input the reMarkable’s address into any browser and instantly access the stream.</p>
<h3 id="new-architecture">New Architecture</h3>
<p>To achieve the objective, the solution involves eliminating the client and instead establishing an HTTP server within the server component.
The client should be implemented in a format that’s interpretable by a browser, such as Javascript or WASM.</p>
<p>My initial approach was to compile the client into WASM.
This seemed promising as it would let me leverage my expertise in Go development.
However, I encountered several limitations that would have necessitated substantial modifications.</p>
<p>Consequently, I opted to develop a second version of the tool, with the client written in Javascript.</p>
<p><em>Side note:</em> At this juncture, I confronted another challenge.
While I possess a broad understanding of Javascript’s functionality and browser rendering processes (what we might term “architectural skills”),
I felt less confident in my hands-on JS development abilities.
I turned to my digital assistant, ChatGPT, for guidance.
With my direction on the desired solution, it provided the necessary code fragments and explanations to bring my vision to life.
I was the developer, he was the coder.</p>
<h3 id="validation-of-the-canvas-renderer">Validation of the “canvas” renderer</h3>
<p>Initially, it was imperative to move away from the MJPEG stream, especially since my operations were now closely aligned with the renderer,
and Javascript possesses the required primitives for image manipulation.</p>
<p>In the browser, the conventional method for handling images is via the <code>canvas</code> element.
My preliminary task was to validate that I could retrieve a raw image from the server and showcase it within a <code>canvas</code>.</p>
<p>I achieved this by accessing the backbone of the canvas that represents the pixel map data in RGBA format and adjusting the pixels based on their values in the raw image from the reMarkable:</p>

<h3 id="basic-drop-in-replacement">Basic Drop-In Replacement</h3>
<p>With the renderer in place, my next step was to implement a lightweight JS client as a substitute.
While gRPC offers robust functionality, it’s not typically considered the gold standard in web development.</p>
<p>Thus, for communication and encapsulation, I gravitated towards the WebSocket protocol.
It was straightforward enough to be incorporated server-side, serving as a seamless drop-in replacement for the RPC server.</p>
<p>Messages delivered via this protocol carry the raw image.
The client remains on standby for these messages, and with each incoming message, the canvas content is updated, effectively emulating a streaming process.</p>
<p>One notable advantage of this approach is the enhanced control over server-side load.
Extracting the raw image demands both memory and CPU resources on the device.
By regulating the message emission frequency, I can efficiently manage device load.</p>
<h2 id="make-it-right-changing-the-streaming-architecture">Make it Right: Changing the Streaming Architecture</h2>
<p>The Websockets-based solution was operational, but it introduced challenges, particularly on iOS.
Furthermore, the Websocket implementation server-side introduced a certain overhead, which I lacked control over.
As a result, I pursued a different strategy to eliminate the use of websockets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One might wonder: Why even need an encapsulation method? Can’t I just directly send the data stream?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, <em>simplicity is complex</em>.</p>
<p>Raising this question of simplicity made me switch to a bare-bones approach: transmitting raw images over the network without any additional encapsulation.</p>
<p>This was feasible because I was privy to the image size, which remains constant due to the resolution of the reMarkable.</p>
<p>I crafted a Go endpoint that continuously wrote images to the wire (specifically to the <code>http.ResponseWriter</code>), using a basic <code>Write</code> method.</p>

<p>With a robust architecture in place, it’s time to fine-tune the tool’s efficiency. One significant challenge arises from the size of the raw picture—approximately 2.5Mb (with a resolution of 1872x1404 for the reMarkable 2). This volume of data needs to be transferred with each frame.</p>
<h3 id="packing-the-values">Packing the Values</h3>
<p>The reMarkable showcases “16” distinct colors. Since the release of FW 3.3, this color palette can be represented as an array of uint4 instead of uint8, as discussed in <a href="https://github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream/issues/36">issue 36</a>. Adopting this representation can yield a 50% reduction in data volume.</p>
<p>However, both Go and JavaScript lack native support for the uint4 type.</p>
<p>A viable workaround involves storing data for two pixels within a single byte (uint8). This approach necessitates the creation of two dedicated functions—one for packing in Go and another for unpacking in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Having achieved a reduction of 1.2Mb per frame through our packing technique, the next step is to further minimize data transfer.
To accomplish this, we can turn to more sophisticated compression algorithms without straining the reMarkable’s CPU or complicating our implementation.</p>
<p>Upon consulting with peers, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">Run Length Encoding (RLE)</a> algorithm emerged as a recommended option due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
Without delving into a detailed explanation, the principle behind RLE is relatively straightforward: it involves tallying the consecutive occurrences of the same pixel value and subsequently transmitting this count alongside the pixel value itself.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s consider a sample sequence:</p>

<p>Implementing RLE is quite direct.
However, a challenge arises when considering the potential count values, which can soar up to 1872*1404.
Representing such large numbers would necessitate a datatype like uint64.
This poses a risk: in certain scenarios, the “compressed” sequence could end up surpassing the uncompressed picture in size.</p>
<p>To avert this, I opted to cap the count length at 15.
This choice paves the way to represent both the count and the pixel value within a single byte, striking a balance between simplicity and efficiency.</p>
<p>An added advantage of our RLE implementation in Go, which mimics an <code>io.Writer</code>, is its reusability.
If a situation calls for it, I can apply the RLE compression twice, though current circumstances haven’t demanded such a measure.</p>
<p>So far, the transfer is about 200Kb in average.</p>
<h3 id="sending-pictures-only-upon-modification">Sending Pictures Only Upon Modification</h3>
<p>The final optimization is to transmit new frames solely when there’s a change.
Determining whether a picture has been altered would typically require computing a checksum, which can be CPU-intensive.</p>
<p>However, the reMarkable device operates on a Linux system.
Thus, any screen interaction, whether by pen or touch, gets routed through <code>/dev/input/event*</code>.
I’ve introduced a goroutine that monitors these events and dispatches the pictures as necessary.</p>
<p>As a result, in the absence of any events, the CPU usage drops to zero, even if a client remains connected.
During writing operations, the CPU usage hovers around 10% — a level I consider efficient.</p>

<p>This application is based on a hack.
The core challenge is about effectively decoupling the interface, which fetches the image, from the client/renderer.</p>
<p>In the prior implementation, there was a complete decoupling facilitated by the protobuf definition between the client and the server.
Historically, when reMarkable introduced its 3.3 firmware, it disrupted the tool, as highlighted by <a href="https://github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream/issues/36">issue 36</a> on GitHub.
However, the necessary adjustments fixing this issue impacted only the client component.</p>
<p>It seems firmware version 3.6 might also usher in a breaking change, as indicated by <a href="https://github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream/issues/58">issue 58</a>.
I anticipate that addressing this will entail broader modifications.
On the bright side, the self-contained nature of the application (with the client integrated into the server) should streamline updates on the device.</p>
<p>The realm of IT is riddled with trade-offs; there’s no universal solution.
This dynamism and adaptability are what infuse excitement into the domain.</p>

    <p>Theresa MacPhail is a medical anthropologist, former journalist and associate professor of science and technology studies. She is the author of “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/636231/allergic-by-theresa-macphail/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Allergic: Our Irritated Bodies In a Changing World</a>” (Random House, 2023), from which this piece has been adapted.</p>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth, an engineer in her late-30s, has three children, all with some form of allergy. Her eldest daughter, Viola, 12, had eczema as a baby; has environmental allergies to pollen; and allergies to corn, tree nuts and peanuts.</p>



<p>Her youngest son, Brian, 3, also had eczema as a baby and subsequently developed allergies to peanuts and barley, though Elizabeth fears there could be more. Her middle daughter, five-year-old Amelia, had a dairy allergy as an infant, but is now just lactose intolerant. She’s the easiest of the three, at least in terms of allergy.</p>



<p>By the time I hear her story, Elizabeth is already a veteran at dealing with her children’s irritated immune systems. She began a support group for parents of children with corn allergies and is heavily involved in trying to educate other parents about food allergies.</p>



<p>The parents share their theories about why their children have allergies. Her own is that Viola and Brian both went to the emergency room with high fevers as babies and were given precautionary antibiotics. She blames the antibiotics for altering her children’s gut microbiome and herself for agreeing to the treatment in the first place.</p>



<p>Part of Elizabeth’s rationale is that no one else in her family has allergies. In fact, it’s so rare that her parents initially didn’t believe the diagnoses. They argued that “back in their day,” everyone ate everything and was fine; food allergy was made-up nonsense. But when both Viola and Brian landed in the ER repeatedly for food-related anaphylaxis, her parents realized these allergies were indeed “real.”</p>



<p>Elizabeth’s family’s routines have been upended. “My life revolves around cooking for them,” she explains. “We don’t eat out. We don’t trust people preparing their food.” Instead, Elizabeth gets up daily at 6:30 a.m. to cook a breakfast that avoids allergens for all three kids. Then she cooks and packs their lunches, preparing everything from scratch because most packaged foods contain at least one ingredient that one of her children will react to.</p>



<p>On a recent vacation with four other families, Brian ended up in the ER with anaphylaxis due to cross-contamination. Elizabeth says she will never share a house again if she’s not the “cleaning boss,” which basically means being not only continuously vigilant about the foods prepared in the kitchen but also thoroughly cleaning and wiping down anything that an allergy-inducing food touches. It’s a labor of love and worry in equal measure.</p>



<p>Brian’s allergies are the most severe. Though only a toddler, he knows some foods are dangerous. “I’ll ask him, ‘Do you know why you can’t have that?’” Elizabeth said. “And he’ll say, ‘Yes, Brian allergic. Makes me <em>owie</em>. Mommy give me shot and we go to hospital.’ He remembers the EpiPen. He remembers it because those things hurt. It’s an inch and a half needle jabbed into you.”</p>



<p>Brian runs away whenever he sees Elizabeth pack an EpiPen, a potentially life-saving device for allergy sufferers, into one of their bags. She says it makes her feel like she’s the biggest monster in the world. Not only because of her son’s reaction, but also because she ultimately feels responsible for his allergy.</p>



<p>Although allergy researchers may disagree on definitions, symptoms and methodology, all agree on one thing: Allergies have grown <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/30/1178433166/theresa-macphail-allergic-allergies" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">worse</a> over the last few decades, and the staggering numbers of allergy sufferers worldwide is likely to continue growing. An estimated 235 million people worldwide have asthma, and anywhere from 240 to 550 million people globally may suffer from food allergies. Drug allergy may affect up to 10% of the world’s population.</p>



<p>There’s a consensus, looking at the last century’s data, that U.S. hay fever rates increased in the mid-20th century. Data suggests that the incidence of asthma increased beginning in the 1960s, peaking sometime in the 1990s. Since then, asthma rates have remained fairly constant. Respiratory allergic diseases and atopic sensitization (or skin allergy) have likely increased over the last few decades. But the most dramatic and visible increase has been the rise in global incidence rates for food allergies, which began in earnest in the 1990s and has grown steadily ever since.</p>



<p>There are, unsurprisingly, multiple theories about the cause. The hygiene hypothesis is one front-runner, positing that people who are “too clean” develop allergies. Many others think it’s our diet, that changes in the way we grow and prepare food have altered our gut microbiome, fueling allergies. Still others argue that manmade chemicals and plastics we encounter daily are making our immune systems more irritable.</p>

<p>What everyone agrees on is that the environment’s influence on our genes, or epigenetics, has played a large role in the rise of allergies, as does the makeup of our nose, gut and skin microbiomes. In the end, it appears, we are at least partially doing this to ourselves. Modern living is likely at the root of the recent rise in allergies.</p>



<h2 id="h-our-changing-microbiomes"><strong>Our Changing Microbiomes</strong></h2>



<p>If you want to better understand how our modern lifestyles might be behind some of our biggest problems with allergy, you will end up talking to a diminutive, deeply intelligent, empathetic woman named Cathryn Nagler, who is one of the best immunologists in the world. Her decades of research primarily focuses on the role our gut microbiome plays in the development of children’s food allergy. She remembers when food allergy rates first began climbing in the late 1980s.</p>



<p>“I saw it myself,” Nagler said, loading graphs onto her computer in her University of Chicago office on a sunny spring afternoon. “I have kids that are 23 and 27, so I followed this in real-time because cupcakes were excluded from the classrooms as my kids went through school. Right around the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, when food allergy rates were starting to increase, the American Academy of Pediatrics said to withhold peanuts and allergenic foods from pregnant mothers, from nursing mothers and from children with risk of allergy until they’re four years old. That was exactly the wrong advice, and that fueled the fire and caused even more increase. Now all of the push is for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26456447/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">early introduction</a>.”</p>



<p>Nagler is referencing the now-famous Learning Early about Peanut Allergy (LEAP) study, conducted by researchers in the United Kingdom and the United States, led by Dr. Gideon Lack at King’s College in London and <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1414850" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">published</a> in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015. The study found that decades of erroneous advice to parents to avoid giving children younger than three years old anything containing peanuts had likely led to a massive increase in the incidence and severity of peanut allergy.</p>



<p>Infants enrolled in the study (four to 11 months old) were randomly assigned to two groups: parents in one group would continue to avoid peanuts; parents in the other would introduce peanuts to their children right away. Infants in both groups were given skin-prick tests for peanut sensitivities. Among those who tested negative, the prevalence of peanut allergy at 60 months of age was 13.7% in the peanut avoidance group and merely 1.9% in the peanut consumption group. Among those who had tested positive for sensitivity to peanuts, the prevalence of peanut allergy was 35.3% in the avoidance group and 10.6% in the consumption group.</p>



<p>A recent study in Melbourne, Australia, <a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(20)31772-3/fulltext" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that changes to dietary advice on peanuts in 2016, following the success of the initial LEAP study, had led to a 16% decrease in peanut allergy among infants. It’s perfectly clear that introducing peanuts to infants has a protective effect.</p>



<p>Nagler understands why parents might be hesitant, however, to introduce allergens into the diet early. After all, why would anyone trust the same people who gave them incorrect advice just a few years prior? Plus, she doesn’t think there’s definitive evidence that early introduction is good.</p>



<p>“You can be sensitized even before the first introduction of solid food,” Nagler explains. “Kids get allergic responses within the first month of life. That means they could have been sensitized by breast milk or by the skin. If you give early introduction to a kid like that, that kid is going to have an allergic response. So early introduction is risky, but now we know withholding is not good either.”</p>



<p>So how does the body learn to tolerate some foods and begin to react negatively to others? Nagler is convinced that food allergy as a phenomenon is part of a generational change.</p>



<p>“People will tell you that there is no history in their family of this,” she explains. “From parents with no family history of allergy to kids that have life-threatening responses to a crumb. You can be allergic to any food. Your allergy can develop at any point in your life. It used to appear between the ages of two and five. Now we’re getting a lot more adult-onset food allergy. It used to be that milk, eggs, wheat allergy were outgrown. Now they’re lasting into adulthood.”</p>



<p>In other words, food allergies signal a larger problem.</p>



<p>Nagler stops on a slide showing what is likely contributing to our immune system’s malaise: diet, C-sections, changes in food production, breastfeeding.</p>

  </div>




<p>“The idea is that modern industrialized lifestyle factors have triggered shifts in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4498960/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">commensal bacteria</a>,” Nagler says, referencing the so-called friendly bacteria that exist within and alongside us. “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2022.733992/full" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Inflammatory bowel disease</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6905201/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">allergies</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-022-00794-0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">obesity</a>, <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/gut-brain-connection-autism" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">autism</a> — all non-communicable chronic diseases. They’ve all been linked to the microbiome.”</p>



<p>And there it is: Nagler’s answer to the all-important question of why allergies are rising. Changes to the makeup of our gut microbiome — or all the bacteria, fungi and viruses that help<strong> </strong>process our food into useable fuel for our cells — are driving immune function changes.</p>



<p>Recent studies have highlighted the connection between our diet, use of antibiotics and our gut bacteria in the development of allergies. A 2019 study led by Nagler <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30643289/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">showed</a> that the gut of healthy infants harbored a specific class of allergy-protective bacteria not found in infants with cow’s milk allergy. This was followed by a study at Brigham and Women’s Hospital that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0461-z" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that five or six specific strains of gut bacteria in infants seem to be protective of developing food allergies. A lead researcher on that study, Dr. Lynn Bry, surmised that our lifestyles are, for better or for worse, capable of “resetting the immune system.”</p>



<p>Another study found that higher levels of cheese in our diet may accidentally worsen allergy symptoms because bacteria in some cheeses produce histamine — the naturally-occurring compound that helps trigger an effective immune response. University of California, San Francisco researchers led a study that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6830510/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">discovered</a> a link between three species of gut bacteria and the production of a fatty molecule called 12,13-diHOME. That molecule lowers the number of T-reg cells in our gut, cells crucial for keeping inflammation at bay. The researchers found that babies with higher levels of these three bacteria had an elevated risk for developing allergy and asthma.</p>



<p>Ultimately, most of us living in the 21st century have changed our microbiome makeup. Our diets are the real culprit, according to Nagler.<strong> </strong>When we go from eating foods with lots of fiber to highly processed foods loaded with sugar and fat, we end up starving beneficial bacteria in our gut.</p>



<p>“We’ve co-evolved with our microbes,” Nagler says. But “they can’t live without their food.”</p>



<p>There’s also the use of antibiotics that kill off not only the bacteria that cause strep throat and sinus infections, but our gut bacteria. And we eat meat from animals that have been given low-dose antibiotics to make them <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/do-antibiotics-make-us-fat" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">fat</a>. We’re experimenting on ourselves and our microbiomes, Nagler says, to deleterious effect.</p>



<p>Nagler has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27096316/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">developed</a> the “barrier regulation” hypothesis, which theorizes that our gut and skin microbiomes regulate what is and isn’t allowed into the body. Commensal bacteria on the skin and in the gut are integral to maintaining barrier function. Nagler explains that a single layer of epithelial cells is all that stands between us and our environment, making sure that what enters our bodies is either inhaled or ingested.</p>



<p>Indeed, in 2018 researchers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30249647/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">discovered</a> a link between a gene coding for an antiviral protein in the gut, changes in the gut microbiota, and greater intestinal permeability and severe allergic skin reactions in mice. Gut microbiomes are an intricately balanced mix of different species of bacteria, viruses and fungi. Mice lacking the gene for the antiviral protein had a changed microbiome — or the amounts and types of different bacteria and viruses.</p>



<p>This suggests that our immune systems have developed ways of coping with microbes in our gut and maintaining balance. When the composition of the microbiota changes, the immune components’ responses shift, making us more miserable in the process. This is evidence of how our genes and the environment (changes to the gut microbiota) interact to produce allergy; it also proves Nagler’s larger point that altered gut microbiota can have a direct effect on allergy.</p>



<p>Avery August, an immunologist at Cornell University, describes human immune cells as curators of the human body — constantly sensing everything we encounter and making millions of micro-decisions about what should become a part of the human body or coexist with us and what should not.</p>



<p>The barrier regulation theory dovetails nicely with the conception of our entire immune system — microbiome included — as curators of what can and cannot be part of us. Without the regulation that those barrier cells provide, entire proteins can pass through our skin or gut into the bloodstream, where they encounter our immune cells.</p>

<p>The allergic person’s immune system is wholly functional; it is doing what it was meant to do. For Nagler, the problem is that it’s performing a job different from the one it was initially trained to do. From this perspective, allergic disease is a barrier problem, not necessarily an immune system problem.</p>



<p>All creatures, even invertebrates, have an associated microbiota, Nagler explains, which performs vital physiological functions. Without microbiota, there would be no life at all. The human gut encounters antigens from a hundred trillion — or 100,000,000,000,000 — commensal microbes and more than 30 kilograms — or 66 pounds — of food proteins per year. Cells making up the gut barrier must discern between what is harmful — pathogens like harmful outside bacteria or viruses — and what are harmless antigens.</p>



<p>To Nagler, Elizabeth’s theory blaming antibiotics for her children’s food allergies isn’t so far-fetched. Changes in the gut microbiome in infants and children can lead to a greater risk of developing allergic responses as children age. And our children’s earliest environments are likely the most crucial.</p>



<p>The microbiome has been shown to be incredibly stable by age three. Alterations before this age seem to be critical to whether allergies ultimately develop. A study led by France’s Pasteur Institute <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761319300810?via%3Dihub" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> evidence in mouse models for the role of gut microbiota in the development of a healthy immune system in as young as three to six months of age, around when most human babies are first introduced to solid foods.</p>



<p>Bacteria in the gut increased 10- to 100-fold after solid foods were introduced. This stage of rapid microbiome growth and development, called “pathogenic imprinting,” seems to determine one’s susceptibility to inflammatory disorders like allergy and autoimmune disorders in adulthood. Antibiotics could theoretically disrupt this developmental stage, producing a greater risk of allergic diseases.</p>



<p>So far, scientific evidence appears to back this up. Research by Rutgers University and the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33208243/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that children under age two who are given antibiotics are at greater risk for asthma, respiratory allergies, eczema, celiac disease, obesity and ADHD. The study looked at 14,572 children born in Olmsted County, Minnesota, between 2003 and 2011. If antibiotics were given in their first six months, the risk increased dramatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers found that 70% of the children in the study had been prescribed at least one antibiotic in the first 48 months of their lives (typically for respiratory or ear infections). Another study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7796951/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that antibiotics can allow for the growth of non-pathogenic fungus in the human gut, which may make respiratory allergies more severe. Finally, related studies<strong> </strong>of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aad0917" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Finnish</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aad7121" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">New York</a> babies <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/06/15/antibiotics-c-sections-may-change-childs-health-for-the-long-term/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that C-sections and antibiotics correlated with altered gut microbiomes and a greater risk of allergies in childhood.</p>



<p>These findings don’t surprise Nagler. Vaginal births give infants what are known as “founder bacteria,” she tells me. As the baby moves through the vaginal canal, it is exposed to its mother’s friendly bacteria. Breastfeeding introduces more helpful bacteria into the infant’s gut.</p>



<p>“If you skip over both of those processes, which many people have done, you’ve disordered the microbiome,” Nagler explains. “The first 100 -1,000 days of life are absolutely critical for the development of the immune system.”</p>



<p>Research has shown that babies born by C-section not only haven’t been exposed to the correct, harmless vaginal founder bacteria, but they have also been exposed to potentially harmful hospital bacteria. One recent review <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10146705/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that lactobacillus containing probiotics — the same bacilli found in breast milk — lowered SCORAD (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis) scores for children under age three who had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, or more severe eczema.</p>



<p>Breastfeeding for the first three months of life has also been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32128903/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">linked</a> with a lower risk of respiratory allergies and asthma. In a study of 1,177 mother/child pairs, breastfed babies had a 23% lower relative risk of allergies by age six and a 34% lower relative risk of asthma if there was no family history of asthma.</p>



<p>But for children whose mothers supplemented breast milk with formula, the protective effect seemed to have mostly disappeared. (Important aside: If you’re a mother and you’re panicking a bit right now, please don’t. There are many valid reasons to have C-sections and to choose formula over breastmilk. A lot of this is complicated and there’s a lot that we still don’t know about these interactions.)</p>

<p>Nagler reminds me that the cattle industry has been giving cows low doses of antibiotics for years to make them fatter and more commercially viable. We also eat <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">highly processed food </a>that’s low in fiber, with added sugars and fats. That means that the food we’re introducing into our guts is different from what our ancestors ate for millennia. That, of course, affects the types of bacteria that can flourish inside us.</p>



<p>Even simply changing bedsheets can change our microbiomes. Researchers in Denmark and the U.K. looked at samples from 577 six-month-old infants’ beds and compared them to respiratory samples taken from 542 of those infants<strong> </strong>at age three months old). Researchers <a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00895-w" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> 930 different types of bacteria and 103 genera of fungi.</p>



<p>A correlation was found between bacteria in bed dust and those found in the associated children; while the two populations of bacteria were not exactly synonymous, they did seem to directly affect each other. An increase or decrease in respiratory bacteria mirrored an increase or decrease in the bacteria in the infants’ beds. The <a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00895-w" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">research</a> suggests that less frequent changing of bed linens may benefit the health of all our nasal and airway microbiomes.</p>



<p>Many of the researchers I spoke to longed to return to a simple, less technologically driven way of life mostly centered on the foods we consume and how we produce them. One top allergist dreamt of performing the ultimate control study to prove that our modern lifestyle and habits negatively affect our immune systems.</p>



<p>“Imagine,” he said, “if we could get a group of people to revert back to a much older way of life. Eat foods grown without pesticides. Eat whole foods and a wide variety. Don’t use dishwashers or detergents. Do you know what would happen? No more allergies. I just wish I could prove it.”</p>



<h2 id="h-the-canaries-in-our-coal-mines"><strong>The Canaries In Our Coal Mines</strong></h2>



<p>The most compelling evidence that our 21st-century lifestyles and manmade environmental changes have spurred our allergies is this: Our companion species of thousands of years — dogs, cats, birds and horses — all get allergies regularly. Other species — those that do not live in our homes or alongside us — do not.

<p>Our pets’ symptoms are very similar to ours: sneezing, snoring, asthma, vomiting and over-grooming in cats; skin eruptions, persistent scratching and grooming in dogs; coughing and wheezing in horses. And they likely have allergies for the same reasons we do. After all, their immune systems are exposed to the same panoply of natural and chemical substances. The top allergen in dogs? Dust mites. The top allergen in horses? Their human-packaged feed. Cats are often allergic to grass, trees, and weed pollen. Cats and dogs can also be allergic to human dander, since we shed skin, too. Sound familiar?</p>



<p>Many owners spend lots of time and money trying to eradicate allergy symptoms in their pets. The most common methods are the same as for humans: pets either take antihistamines and steroids or undergo immunotherapy shots. The problem is that we don’t know just how big the problem is because we don’t have good data on pet allergies or their incidence. We don’t know if rates are increasing, or if vets and pet owners are just getting better at recognizing the signs.</p>



<p>To better understand how and why allergies affect our pets, I traveled to Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine to speak with Elia Tait<strong> </strong>Wojno, who started her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgHXqiQLgmo" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">career</a> doing work on parasitic worms and immune responses.</p>



<p>She explains that the immune response to parasitic worms is like the immune response during allergic responses in both humans and in dogs. (Of course, in the case of worms, those responses are protective and, in the case of allergies, the responses are the ones causing the miserable symptoms.) By studying the immune response to helminths (a type of parasitic worm) in dogs, we can learn a lot about the basic immune functions involved in allergy.</p>



<p>Working with dogs allows us to observe how allergies function in something other than mouse models. For decades, mice have been the dominant research organism in the field of immunology. But mice aren’t humans, and mouse models aren’t always the best predictors of what will happen in a human body. That is why<strong> </strong>there’s growing interest among allergy researchers to move beyond mouse models. Since some larger animals have natural allergic diseases, like cats and dogs, they might be good models for learning about basic immunology across species as well as doing drug testing for allergic conditions.</p>

<p>Unlike mice, which are confined to the lab, usually inbred and live in very controlled environments, the dogs that Tait<strong> </strong>Wojno works with are born the old-fashioned way. She works with breeders to enroll dogs into her studies and the dogs are treated like pets because they are. These aren’t lab animals; they live at home with their owners. This is an important detail, since that allows researchers to ponder which components of our shared, lived environments, habits and medical practices might be affecting our companion species as well as us.</p>



<p>Allergies in our pets offer potential clues to solving the mystery of allergies. If we can understand early immune response in animals, then we might be able to better understand it in humans. And that’s one of the things we really don’t understand in any mammals — the immune system’s initial reaction to something it encounters and the subsequent set of events that follow. Ultimately, my visit to Cornell convinced me of one thing: Our pets are the literal canaries in our figurative allergy coal mines. The fact that our intimate companions have allergies is a sign that something humans are doing is irritating the immune systems of us all.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-dirt-on-cleanliness"><strong>The Dirt On Cleanliness</strong></h2>



<p>You’re likely already familiar with the most espoused theory of allergy causation, the idea that being “too clean,” or overly hygienic, is not good for childhood development of a properly functioning immune system. Maybe you’ve heard that it’s good to let children play in the dirt, get a little messy and slobber on each other. So goes the basic idea behind the hygiene hypothesis, first posited to try to explain the explosion of asthma, eczema and food allergies in the last half of the 20th century.</p>



<p>In 1989, epidemiologist David Strachan <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1838109/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">published</a> a short article in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), entitled “Hay fever, hygiene, and household size.” Using data from a national sample of over 17,000 British children born during the same week in March 1958, he looked at three things: How many of the study participants self-reported symptoms of hay fever at age 23; How many of their parents had reported hay fever in them at age 11; and when participants were seven, whether the parents remembered if their child had eczema in their first year of life.</p>



<p>Strachan found that younger siblings<strong> </strong>seemed most protected from developing hay fever or eczema, despite differences in socioeconomic class. Strachan posited that the lowered allergy rates might be explained, “if allergic diseases were prevented by infection in early childhood, transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings, or acquired prenatally from a mother infected by contact with her older children.”</p>



<p>Smaller family sizes, improvements in housing, and higher cleanliness standards might have combined to reduce the opportunity for children’s exposure to a wide variety of microbes. In other words, Strachan’s findings suggested that mild childhood infections might be beneficial to a developing immune system.</p>



<p>At first this idea was rejected. Many immunologists still believed that bad infections could trigger allergy, especially asthma. But Strachan’s ideas were eventually adopted and popularized after researchers discovered that IgE-mediated (or antibody-driven allergic) immune responses were driving many allergic conditions. It seemed plausible that a lack of early exposure to certain germs was the underlying problem, leaving the immune system “untrained” and hyper-responsive in later life.</p>



<p>Early work on the microbiome and friendly commensal bacteria, Nagler <a href="https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/e/1480/files/2019/07/Iweala-and-Nagler-Annual-Reviews-Immunology-2019-published-version.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">co-wrote</a> in a 2019 review, “led to a reformulation of the hygiene hypothesis as the ‘old friends’ or the ‘biodiversity’ hypotheses of allergy, which proposed that changes in the environment, diet and lifestyle associated with Westernized, industrialized countries have altered the diversity of the gut and skin microbiomes.”<sup>8</sup></p>



<p>The “old friends” <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24481186/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">hypothesis</a> posits that humans are more at risk of chronic inflammatory diseases, like allergies or autoimmune disorders, because we no longer regularly encounter some of the microorganisms that we evolved alongside for millennia. These “old friends,” the theory goes, helped regulate our immune function. Their risk to human health was minimal, and a healthy immune system could easily keep them in check. This trained the developing human immune system, making it more robust and adaptive to its normal environment.</p>



<p>In the absence of these old friends, our immune system lacks the early training it needs to better self-regulate and overreacts to otherwise harmless stimuli, like pollen or dust mites.</p>



<p>Nagler explained to me how the hygiene hypothesis and the idea of microbes as old friends combine to produce an almost idyllic conception of farm life and the “farmhouse effect.” Farmhouses, with their tilled soil, muddy barns and stables, and fertile fields, come with a lot of bacteria, viruses and parasites.</p>

      “The most compelling evidence that our 21st-century lifestyles and manmade environmental changes have spurred our allergies is this: Our companion species of thousands of years — dogs, cats, birds and horses — all get allergies regularly. Other species — those that do not live in our homes or alongside us — do not.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>But if you alter the environment, you alter the microbiota. If you have better sanitation, move away from farms and have fewer children, then you cut off your supply of a richly diverse microbiota. You become, in essence, less intimate with microbes in your day-to-day life. And intimacy with friendly germs, especially in the first few years of life, does seem to be protective of a wide variety of immune disorders — but not all of them.</p>



<p>Recent studies have suggested that there is a measurable “farmhouse effect,” but researchers are uncertain about <em>which exposures </em>are protective and what mechanisms they might be triggering to produce that protective effect. What seems certain is that exposure to livestock from early childhood dramatically lowers the risk of developing allergic conditions later in life.</p>



<p>In particular, exposure to stable dust seems to prevent most allergic responses. Something in “farm dust” is effective — bacteria, viruses, fungi or even more allergens themselves — but it’s not entirely clear which components of the dust are protective, and which aren’t. Another <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11597666/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">study</a> of rural areas in Austria, Germany and Switzerland showed that a farming environment was more protective against hay fever, atopic sensitization and asthma.</p>



<p>If infants spent a lot of time in stables and drank cow’s milk in the first year of their lives, then their rates of allergic diseases dramatically lowered <em>even if </em>their IgE results showed sensitization. In other words, they might have an underlying sensitivity to some allergens, but that sensitivity did not become full-blown allergic responses.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170308083717.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">different study</a> that looked at the immune function of lab-raised mice versus those in a farm’s barn, the “farmhouse effect” was strongly supported. The results of studies in mice are, in fact, one of the key supports for this theory. August explained to me that pathogen-free mice bred for laboratory studies have dramatically different immune systems <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5512602/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">compared</a> to their “unclean” peers; the lab mice have immune systems that resemble a human newborn’s immune system. When you place those “clean” mice in a “dirty” environment — like the mice study did to simulate farm life — their immune systems change to look more like that of an adult human.</p>



<p>This tracks with research in humans that suggests that germ-ridden environments can also protect against allergies. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28381231/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Children</a> and adults who live with dogs have lower rates of asthma and obesity, in part due to more indirect exposure to bacteria that dogs carry and track into the home. A 2017 NIH-sponsored <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28939248/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">study</a> showed that exposing children in the first three years of life to high indoor levels of pet and pest allergens, like cockroach, mouse and cat allergens, lowers their risk of developing asthma by age seven. But whether exposure is protective, depends on the bacteria.</p>



<p>Enter the fascinating case of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, or <em>H. pylori</em>, a common gut microbe that’s the culprit behind gastrointestinal ulcers, chronic gastritis and even some forms of cancer.</p>



<p>Although scientists <a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(05)01320-6" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">discovered</a> the species <em>H. pylori </em>in 1982, there is speculation that our colonization by the bacteria took place circa 60,000 years ago and that it depended on repeated contact in small, close-knit groups, i.e. the way humans typically lived until fairly recently. There are many different strains of <em>H. pylori</em>, and their prevalence in humans was estimated to hover around 80% until after World War II, when the introduction of antibiotics like penicillin to treat common infections led <em>H. pylori </em>to begin to disappear from the human gut. Today, it is estimated that around 50% of humans are infected with <em>H. pylori</em>, with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28456631/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">rates hovering</a> as high as 88% in one African nation and as low as 19% in a European one.</p>



<p>This is in line with the hygiene hypothesis, since transmission of microbes is far easier in large, crowded households with many siblings. <em>H. pylori </em>is usually acquired in early childhood, after the first year, and is transmitted via the ingestion of feces, saliva or vomit (and if you just physically recoiled, I apologize). In the absence of antibiotics, <em>H. pylori</em>, once acquired, can persist in the gut for decades, often for the entire life of its human host. Most people living with <em>H. pylori </em>have no symptoms or ill effects.</p>



<p>The stomachs of people with and without <em>H. pylori </em>are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2014.13#:~:text=TREG%20cells%20have%20an,likely%20to%20develop%20peptic%20ulceration." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">immunologically different</a> and there is speculation that people with <em>H. pylori </em>have a larger gut population of regulatory T cells (Tregs). That’s important because Tregs are crucial for tamping down inflammatory immune responses. Although infection with <em>H. pylori </em>is associated with having more immune cells in the gut, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3888205/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">some researchers</a> have proposed that it may be a normal, rather than a pathological, response to the bacteria.</p>

      “There’s growing interest among allergy researchers to move beyond mouse models.

<p>In other words, <em>H. pylori </em>may be beneficial in some situations. In fact, people who lack the bacteria are much more likely to suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or acid reflux, and there is evidence that <em>H. pylori </em>plays a protective role against childhood-onset asthma.</p>



<p>All this gives credence to the basic premise of the hygiene hypothesis: We need regular exposure to friendly bacteria to train our immune systems. But also, simply living with more diverse microbial populations likely does not automatically produce improved immune system functionality. Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, director of the University of Virginia School of Medicine’s Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, believes the hygiene hypothesis cannot possibly explain the rise of allergies, at least not by itself. His <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4617537/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">argument</a> relies upon our more recent history of “cleanliness.”</p>



<p>Throughout the 20th century, hygiene standards were adopted more widely. Improved sewage systems and potable drinking water meant human exposure to microbes through ingestion was far less frequent. Regular infection by helminths, or intestinal parasites, had decreased due to food and water quality controls and the increased use of shoes.</p>



<p>During this time people moved from rural farms into urban centers, so the general population also saw lower exposure levels to farm animals and decreased diversity of the bacterial populations they encountered. Family size also decreased, perhaps exposing children to fewer germs. Platts-Mills notes, however, that all these changes were completed by the 1920s, which leaves the dramatic rise of asthma and allergic rhinitis, from the 1940s into the 1950s, unexplained.</p>



<p>Platts-Mills argues that the best explanation for the rise of hay fever and asthma is more likely “an increase in sensitization to indoor allergens and the loss of a lung-specific protective effect of regular deep inspiration.” In other words, outdoor play and recreation were likely more protective against allergies than spending hours playing Minecraft or Fortnite.</p>



<p>If the hygiene hypothesis or farmhouse effect were correct, one would also expect to see a marked decrease in allergy rates in rural, farming communities. Yet Dr. Jill Poole, the University of Nebraska Medical Center division chief of allergy and immunology, found that around 30% of Midwestern farmers suffer from allergic disease directly linked to their agricultural lifestyle. Dust from grain elevators and animal barns, pesticide exposures and grain rot from flooding causes so-called Farmer’s Lung. So while some farm exposures seem beneficial, others are clearly not.</p>



<p>And if family size, rural life and socioeconomic status are linked in the original hypothesis theory, then one might expect that countries with larger family size, more rural populations and lower socioeconomic status would have fewer allergic diseases. Yet their allergies are also steadily increasing.</p>



<p>A 2019 <a href="https://www.independent.co.ug/half-of-ugandans-suffer-from-allergy-study/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">study</a> found that half of Ugandans living in the capital of Kampala have some form of allergy. It found that allergies are on the rise in rural areas, although more urban dwellers have access to hospitals where they can report symptoms of asthma, nasal congestion or skin rash. Many Ugandans self-treat with over-the-counter antihistamines, steroids, and antibiotics. Dr. Bruce Kirenga, a Ugandan allergy expert, said he thinks environmental pressures like air pollution are to blame.</p>



<p>These findings suggest that the farmhouse effect or hygiene hypothesis might not be the smoking gun we’re searching for. The theory makes intuitive sense, but we don’t have enough scientific evidence to definitively say that rural life, with its “dirty” or microbially rich environments, can fully protect us from allergic disease.</p>



<p>And yet, the basic idea that <em>something </em>about our interactions with the microbial world around us has shifted because of our lifestyles and daily habits is compelling. The hygiene hypothesis, then, is likely <em>partially </em>correct. There is growing evidence that some of our habits (particularly in relation to our diets and food production) might be behind the recent rise of allergies — especially food allergy.</p>



<h2 id="h-barrier-warfare"><strong>Barrier Warfare</strong></h2>



<p>In a 1950s pamphlet on allergy, Dr. Samuel Feinberg, a leading allergist and the first president of the now-named American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, wrote: “Man’s progress creates problems.” Feinberg pointed the finger at human ingenuity as a significant cause of the developed world’s increasing allergies. All our tinctures and dyes, our synthetic fabrics and new plastics, our lotions and eyeliner and lipsticks and shampoos were beginning to wreak havoc on our immune systems.</p>



<p>Dr. Donald Leung, an immunologist who is head of allergy and immunology at Denver’s National Jewish Health is also one of the world’s leading researchers on atopic dermatitis. Leung told me that we overuse soap, detergents and products containing alcohol.</p>

<p>We routinely use harsh antimicrobial products to clean our hands and homes, instead of soap and water; a fact exacerbated by the Covid pandemic. All of this can negatively affect our skin barrier, making it more likely we’ll develop an allergic condition.</p>



<p>Furthermore, exposure to food proteins through a weakened skin barrier along with early ingestion of higher doses of food proteins can lead to full-blown <a href="https://naglerlab.uchicago.edu/files/2019/07/Iweala-and-Nagler-Annual-Reviews-Immunology-2019-published-version.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">food allergy</a>. In layman’s terms, that means if you make a peanut butter sandwich and don’t wash your hands and then you pick up your baby, you may be depositing trace amounts of peanut protein onto their skin. If their skin is “leaky,” or more permeable than normal skin due to a possible genetic mutation or a disruption (or irritation) of the skin’s normal microbiome, then that protein could seep into the baby’s skin and when the baby eats peanuts, it can trigger a peanut allergy.</p>



<p>“All the things we’re putting on our skin, or the things we’re putting on our babies’ butts, are probably not good for our barriers,” Robert Schleimer, former chief of allergy and immunology at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine, told me.</p>



<p>Schleimer said his first job in the 1960s was collecting used cotton diapers for the Tidee Didee Diaper Service for $1.70 an hour. He would bring them back to the laundry facility to be cleaned and repackaged for delivery. As he reflected on the barrier hypothesis, he noted that cotton is a natural fabric. Now we use plastic diapers with antimicrobial properties and apply creams to babies’ skin to prevent rashes from those materials. And that’s just <em>one </em>of the changes that might be exposing our children to more irritants.</p>



<p>“You have these very tough detergents made of rough chemicals that break things down,” said Dr. Kari Nadeau, director of Stanford University’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy &amp; Asthma Research. “And initially that was seen as positive. Then they started to see that, wait a minute, all these people working in the plants that are making those detergents have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-detergent-exposure/detergent-exposure-hard-on-workers-lungs-studies-idUSTRE5AQ47S20091127" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">breathing</a> issues.”</p>



<p>In our discussion, Nadeau is adamant about the downsides of modern living, especially when it comes to daily chemical exposure. She points to the recent rise in severe eczema. In the 1940s and 1950s, the image of a “squeaky clean” home was heavily promoted by the same companies making these new detergents (like Dow Chemicals).</p>



<p>“It turns out that the way my grandmother lived on the farm was probably the right way to do things: not using a lot of detergents, not bathing every day, making sure you were exposed to a little bit of dirt, being exposed to the outdoors,” Nadeau said.</p>



<p>In one recent study, Canadian university researchers found that infants less than four months old living in a home where household cleaning products were used more frequently were more likely to develop wheezing and asthma by age three. Researchers noted that most of the infants spent between 80-90% of their time indoors — heavily increasing their exposure to these products.</p>



<p>Study co-author Dr. Anne Ellis noted that children take more frequent breaths than adults and, unlike adults, breathe mostly through their mouths —&nbsp;bypassing the nose’s natural filtration system and allowing anything in the air to more easily penetrate the lungs. The researchers hypothesized that fumes from cleaning products inflamed their respiratory tracts, activating the babies’ innate immune systems. The frequent use of household products such as air fresheners, deodorizers, antimicrobial hand sanitizers, oven cleaners and dusting sprays seemed particularly harmful.</p>



<p>Exposure to problematic chemicals in gestation can be equally harmful to developing immune systems. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28392331/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">One study</a> found that higher concentrations of plasticizers, or solvents used to make materials more flexible, equated to a greater risk of developing allergies. Researchers measured levels of Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), a common plasticizer used to make Polyvinyl chloride (PVC or vinyl), in the urine of pregnant women and new mothers. They found that exposure to these phthalates during pregnancy and breastfeeding caused epigenetic changes to specific repressors for <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.945063/full" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Th2 immune cells</a> responsible for generating inflammation.</p>



<h2 id="h-our-dark-sedentary-lives"><strong>Our Dark Sedentary Lives</strong></h2>



<p>Changes to our work and leisure habits may also be contributing to the rise in allergies. We live much of our lives in the shade, Dr. Pamela Guerrerio at the NIH told me. The lack of the sun’s UVB rays on our skin, means our cells produce less vitamin D. It’s unclear how protective vitamin D is against allergies, but the ongoing debate over the evidence shows how little we know about the ill effects of our move indoors.</p>

<p>Dr. Scott Sicherer, director of Mount Sinai’s Elliot and Roslyn Jaffe Food Allergy Institute in New York, told me that both autoimmune and allergy diseases tend to occur at higher rates when a person lives farther from the equator. That fact made immunologists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047889/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">consider</a> whether vitamin D was involved in immune disorders, since people are exposed to less sunlight at higher latitudes.</p>



<p>But Sicherer also noted, “there might be fewer people engaged in farming lifestyles at those latitudes. There might be different exposures to different things in different regions of the globe. It’s so complex that we just don’t know.”</p>



<p>Guerrerio agreed, remarking that people around the globe have different diets, which, along with less sunlight, might compound immune system impacts. Guerrerio said it’s likely several factors cause allergies — including our indoor-prone lifestyles — and that several interventions will be necessary to reverse the effects on our immune systems.</p>



<p>As for Elizabeth and her children, Elizabeth’s misplaced sense of guilt is intimately tied to her desire to provide them with the best care. But her decision to allow her very ill babies to receive antibiotics was almost certainly the correct one, given the likelihood of more dangerous outcomes without treatment. Still, her sense of regret lingers — and she is most certainly not alone.</p>



<p>We are regularly bombarded with advice about how to keep ourselves and our children healthy and happy. You can try to “game the immune system,” but I don’t recommend it. As we learn more from experts about how our immune systems react and respond to our ever-changing environments, it’s best to come to terms with the fact that it’s highly unlikely that we can directly cause our own or someone else’s allergies. Reality is almost always more complicated than that.</p>

<p>The phrase arrived in my head so completely formed and concrete that I couldn’t believe it wasn’t already established in the lexicon, but at least preliminary searches suggest it is not. Of the people I have said the phrase to thus far — mostly a very small group of local women and one Parisian-based knitter — 95% immediately understood without further definition. This one registers loudly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Executive Function Theft (EFT) is the deliberate abdication of decision-making, tasks, and responsibilities that are perceived as administrative or repetitive, of lesser importance, or aren’t pleasant or shiny, to another person, with the result that the receiving person’s executive function becomes so exhausted that they are unable to participate in, contribute to, or enjoy higher level efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I say deliberate, it’s easy to picture a caricature villain chuckling to themselves of “oh, I am going to STEAL that executive function from Isobel and keep that precious capacity for myself!” Such extreme villains are hopefully rare as individuals, though perhaps not when we consider my corporate example below. But it is still a deliberate even if not consciously malicious choice. The thief has chosen to prioritize their executive function over another person’s and, having found that this makes their lives easier, repeats this behavior unless it is disrupted. When later called upon to carry their portion of the group executive function needed, they may become resentful or default to stereotypes (often gendered/racial) such as “oh she’s pickier than me, does it better, is just a good planner, they aren’t being tracked for leadership” or the thief may actively call to how they are busy doing “bigger picture things” with the implication that they must be protected from little things. They may also engage in willful or weaponized incompetence in order to maintain their ability to continue EFT.</p>



<p><strong>Everyone Faces Corporate EFT</strong></p>



<p>At one point as I work on this essay, I’m sitting on hold with the company that manages my health flexible spending account (FSA). Healthcare in the United States and attempting to manage and pay for it is an exquisite example of EFT. For example, today’s process involved:</p>



<ul>
<li>Receiving a bill from a provider</li>



<li>Reviewing the bill for accuracy (this is a recurring appointment)</li>



<li>Going to the provider’s billing website and make a payment (make sure you go through the email link, otherwise, you have to loop around 6 times in search of where to pay and re-enter all the details)</li>



<li>Going to FSA website and starting the process for reimbursement, which has to be entered as three different claims (see recurring)</li>



<li>Finding out that I am back to getting paper checks despite giving them direct deposit information</li>



<li>Attempting to get help via chat –which results in an agent or chatbot who keeps not reading anything I submit “what claim number is this about?” (one I haven’t submitted yet) “just go to your settings and set up a direct deposit!” (already did that)</li>



<li>Calling and wait on hold for a customer service agent</li>



<li>Finding out that because the “initial default setting for my employer” is pay-by-check there is no way AT ALL to get them to change it to direct deposit unless I wait for the FSA company to approve the payment and cut the check and then call to have them reissue the payment as a direct deposit.</li>



<li><strong>Pending</strong>: Monitoring the mail to receive 3 checks</li>



<li><strong>Pending: </strong>Taking the checks over to my bank – no I haven’t moved to phone-based check deposit</li>



<li><strong>Pending: </strong>Contacting my HR department to find out why my employer has moved to check-only as our option for reimbursement.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Here are multiple examples of theft from me. I have to maintain and track all of the paperwork and information; I have to spend an indefinite quantity of time with each of these parts and pieces. Should anything end up not being reimbursable or cross date lines for annual healthcare years, oh no!! I have to get it all perfectly right or run into fees and demands for me to reimburse the FSA company.</p>



<p>The goal, in the name of the company bottom dollar, is to make it as inconvenient as possible for me to use an employer offered benefit. A truly mundane and recurrent example, unfortunately, as I try to navigate U.S. health insurance.</p>



<p>While corporate examples are wonderfully obvious and right to hand, Executive Function Theft also plays out on the individual level. This might be at the workplace or in the home and these are often more insidious thefts.</p>



<p><strong>Workplace EFT</strong></p>



<p>In the workplace, an example of EFT often plays out in the inequality of service labor, and I will specifically use academic service work here as it is my current workplace. Think of the people who end up with more than their share of administrative maintenance tasks — such as organizing get well cards, scheduling workshops, or taking notes. Consider the colleague who has a list of committee appointments a yard long and has just gotten a request to be on Another! Important! <em>(is it?)</em> Committee. These individuals may not be doing these tasks strictly because it is their job responsibility, but because they see a need to be filled or have been asked or tasked with taking on more service that they feel they cannot turn down. And notice how those tasks so often fall to the same group of people — especially when we get to any form of implementation or ongoing commitment rather than the “fun” ideation phase. One way to calculate these service loads would be to count the number of committees and task forces held by and expected of various individuals — who gets a pass and who gets penalized if they don’t say yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quite often there’s a gendered component as to who is tasked with these additional service responsibilities — the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/they-feel-guilty-why-women-should-say-no-to-office-housework">office housekeeping</a> as well as the care tasks of the workplace. In their book,<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-no-club-putting-a-stop-to-women-s-dead-end-work-linda-babcock/17554489?ean=9781982152338"> The No Club</a> by Babcock, Pester, Vesterlund and Weingart summarize this gendered and imbalance service load thus:</p>



<p>“In our own and others’ work, we found substantive and overwhelming evidence that women more than men are tasked with non-promotable work. Less saddled with these tasks, men have the freedom to concentrate on work that helps them advance while women’s careers are stalled or stymied” — The No Club, Page 11.</p>



<p>I will admit to never having been able to read Cal Newport’s Deep Work all the way through — I got too irritated — but I would point to his dismissive naming of the idea of “shallow work”, which he defines as logistical and often repetitive tasks, such as writing short emails. Newport recommends entirely stopping or poorly performing that work; I read this as encouraging readers to commit EFT against others around them. Too often the dump off of what are critical responsibilities is not to a specifically tasked and appreciated administrator but instead onto the junior, female, minoritized, non-tenure track, or precarious employees. It’s the maintenance work of keeping the workplace going and we do not appreciate the maintainers. Similarly thinking about EFT in the workplace, I was reminded of the guy who got famous with the Four Hour Workweek book and how we were all just supposed to outsource things to nameless underpaid gig workers. Notably, when looking for a summary of that book, I found an article by Cal Newport praising it.</p>



<p>“You need to read me in on that and send me updates” — this was a demand I got from a work peer a few years ago. She was demanding that I repeatedly spend time updating her personally on a professional topic where I was involved in campus initiatives. The message was that she was too busy and too important compared to me and so I needed to attend these meetings, do the labor, and then take time I didn’t have to synthesize information for her, in her preferred format, and at her convenience. I wasn’t the only one who got this kind of demand from that colleague and no, none of us did it. And yes, this would have obviously been a notably different statement had it come from a supervisor.</p>



<p>Executive Function Theft can lead to an inequality of time to dream, to rest, or to plan and grow professionally. If you are facing EFT in the workplace, how are you supposed to do five year goals or strategic planning? When are you supposed to be getting that significant work in that will lead you to promotion or a career change?</p>



<p><strong>EFT in the Home</strong></p>



<p>When I described the healthcare interactions above, did that sound familiar? Is that because you are the primary caregiver in your relationship? For brevity on an already long post, when I am talking about relationships below, I’m mostly referring to cishet romantic relationships from my own U.S. based lens but I have certainly been privy to EFT in friendships and other interpersonal relationships.</p>



<p>When thinking about Executive Function Theft in the home or personal relationships, the outcome that cropped up was that of decision fatigue. Does one person in the relationship have to decide what is for dinner every single night, and also to arrange all of the logistics of acquiring the food, preparing it, cleaning up after dinner, deciding what can be saved for leftovers and what needs to go into a lunch box the next day? Is their decision-making ability wholly captured in those tasks while the other person is getting to relax or to plan a project? Or think of the stereotypical holidays. “All <em>that</em> just doesn’t Matter and *I* have to think about [SINGLE TASK]!” a husband said in the face of a list of holiday traditions that he absolutely expected his wife to ensure happened to his expectations. Oh…and then he was annoyed that she didn’t have an opinion about how something occurred which was related to his Big Exciting Task. How often is one partner unable to actually enjoy a holiday because they had to make sure all the arrangements were made and schedules were held to, gifts were acquired and wrapped, friends and family were invited, etc?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two different pieces of literature came to mind when I was considering EFT in the home. One was a quote from the excellent book Equal Partners by Kate Mangino:</p>



<p>“While his female partner continues to do housework for twenty, twenty-six, thirty-one more hours — he can devote this time to hobbies, relaxation, exercise, hanging out with friends, sleep, work and/or continued education. Essentially, he has the opportunity to do so much more with his life than she does.” — Kate Mangino, Equal Partners, Chapter 1</p>



<p>I felt this dovetailed nicely with a 2008 article from the University of Michigan:</p>



<p>“Having a husband creates an extra seven hours a week of housework for women, according to a University of Michigan study of a nationally representative sample of U.S. families.” (<a href="https://news.umich.edu/exactly-how-much-housework-does-a-husband-create/">Press Release for the study</a>)</p>



<p>If a woman is doing at least 7 more hours a week of housework –think of all of the decisions that are included in that, and all of the executive function needed for her to complete that housework. What is it that she must remember which needs to be cleaned or ordered or prepared and what is the outcome of her spending that much additional time on the minutiae of the relationship or family? The thieved partner is likely focused on maintaining home functionality, so they may not even get the space or time to figure out a new system which might serve everyone better or reduce the task requirements. Beyond that, it can overall rob her of time to make bigger plans for herself or for the partnership, relationship, family. It may lead to satisfice efforts and the potential of the thieved partner feeling like a failure in situations where they see what the thief has been able to do in the time and function they didn’t have to spend making all of the decisions about dinner.</p>



<p>There’s a trend in short videos (Reels, Tiktoks, Shorts — chose your name) where a guy starts with “if you had me for 24 hours, what would we do” and it’s stitched with a woman running down a significant list of tasks, mostly house chores and repairs that need some planning and execution (example version <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@monicasopenhouse/video/7237131875079425326">here</a>) . While a joke, it speaks to a desire for a “someone else” to hand things off to that these women often don’t appear to have.</p>



<p><strong>EFT &amp; The Mental Load &amp; Invisible &amp; Emotional Labor</strong></p>



<p>I don’t think you can have a conversation about Executive Function Theft without also talking about the mental load and invisible labor and emotional labor. All of these concepts are connected. EFT creates a greater mental load for another individual. EFT demands ever increasing amounts of invisible labor without giving equitable time for “promotable tasks” or rest. EFT expects that Someone Else who they have assigned to be of lesser importance will take on the emotional parts of work or care tasks. I identify EFT not to ignore those terms but to build upon them. I want to try and help describe the rage of a friend recently describing the complete failure of a colleague to complete any part of year-long project he had signed up to lead, and how after she had pulled the project out and completed it after he abandoned it, he still got assigned to a position of more authority. Or I write this to clarify the exhaustion of a friend in the midst of a pandemic-exacerbated divorce describing the soon to be ex-husband passively waiting for her to deal with all of the legal paperwork and to ensure childcare arrangements didn’t infringe on the fun things that he felt took priority. I write this to name my own disgust at a company going out of their way to make my day more inconvenient in the name of their profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>EFT at the Intersection</strong></p>



<p>I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge other health and societal factors surrounding these concepts which can exacerbate the impact of EFT. My insurance example was, for me, a frustrating and inconvenient hour while I was also answering emails and working on this draft. I do not have an executive function disorder which might have kept me from working on other tasks while on hold or created further barriers for me to work through all of those steps. Nor do I have a physical disability which might require me to expend additional executive function in order to accomplish the activities of daily living, while also requiring that I navigate these systems more often than a healthy person. And I have a job where this was something I could attend to in the middle of a weekday with minimal disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also I’ve written mostly here also about the binary gender impact. There is obviously much to reflect upon as to the further impact as EFT intersects with race and class. Returning to my academic service example, it’s a recognized issue that faculty from historically marginalized communities face exponentially more demands for committee participation “so we have representation on the hiring committee!” Chasing a shallow definition of inclusion, we regularly commit EFT from these colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, our social hierarchies and messaging about whose executive function should be protected so they can do some vaguely defined “real work”&nbsp; warrant a more extensive conversation that I hope others will pursue.</p>



<p><strong>Reducing EFT</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately I don’t have an exact solution for reducing EFT, as it requires either someone in a leadership or managerial role disrupting the pattern (e.g., a rotating schedule of meeting note takers and consequences when the thief screws up in an attempt to get out of it) or for someone to recognize their harmful behavior and work towards changing it. And we all are guilty of selfishness and EFT — though it is with different levels of awareness that naming this will make it useful to spot when we are offloading onto others or not valuing the executive function needed on tasks. The Babcock, et al,&nbsp; and Mangino books I’ve cited above have recommendations and ideas, though sadly, I will point out that in<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03677-6"> a follow up to the No Club</a>, the authors found that when they turned something down, another woman — usually one with less power — was asked. Systems were not disrupted.</p>



<p>But there are ways to engage. One tactic I’ve incorporated recently with a couple of my friends is “Do you want to be engaged with this or would you like me to just make a decision/do X?” There are times I can see their executive function fading or where it is just one decision too many for today. In those instances, I can offer to remove that decision/activity or to at least pare it down. This has to be done explicitly and with consent but their relief is palpable that I can see the struggle, identify the issue, and move forward with something acceptable that meets the need. It allows them to save a squeeze of Executive Function for other things. The caveat is that I am choosing these, not getting assigned it unrelentingly in our relationships, and they do the inverse when they have more function than I do.</p>



<p>In the interim, however, I hope this phrase and idea gives you the words you need and that we are all able to disrupt it, especially against the corporations wasting our precious time and decision-making skills.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/capnproto/l2BI6JrNTvY">Recently</a> on the Cap’n Proto mailing list, someone asked for
feedback on an initial design for an Elm implementation. I chimed in
with some advice and some lessons learned from writing the Haskell
implementation and working with the Go implementation. One thing I
mentioned was this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suggest optimizing for “well-written” schema, and making peace
with the fact that certain constructs may generate unpleasant APIs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Renshaw asked for details on what bits were difficult to map. I
talked a bit about difficulties with nested namespaces, and mentioned
that I had a longer critique in mind. This blog post is that critique.</p>

<p>It’s mostly a critique of the schema language itself – not the wire
format, not the RPC protocol. There are things worth saying about those,
but to keep things at least <em>somewhat</em> focused, I’m just going to stick
to the schema language proper.</p>

<p>Even so, this is one of my longer posts; get comfortable.</p>

<h2 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h2>

<p>Some of the critiques below have some motivating design principles,
which I’ll call out up front:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Design for the call site. When you're looking at a definition, you
have the benefit of having the documentation right there. When you're
looking at a <em>use</em> of something that has been defined
elsewhere, if
the name, order of arguments, etc. doesn't make it clear what's going
on, you have to go look something up to understand it. Also, you only
have one place where a thing is defined, but many where it is used --
so it's more important to optimize for the latter.</p>
    <p>For a schema language like Cap'n Proto, the schema itself is by
definition not the call site -- so we should be suspicious of any
features that make the schema language more ergonomic at the expense
of code using the schema.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make things easy on the code generator. Some of my suggestions
might lead a reader to say "but you can just not use those features."
The trouble with that is that a code generator plugin still has to
worry about them. Having to deal with the general case can make it
harder to generate nice APIs for "good" schema. When writing the Haskell
implementation, I spent more time than I care to think about figuring
out how to handle what I consider to be misfeatures.</p>
    <p>Finding a good mapping from one set into another is easiest if the
input is much smaller than the output. The more restrictions you can
make to the schema language the easier it gets to map those to a
programming language. Thus, unnecessary features are especially
harmful in this context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Little things add up. While a lot of the things in this post may seem
nitpicky, the cumulative effect they have is actually a big deal.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="name-spaces">Name Spaces</h2>

<p>In the Cap’n Proto schema language, each struct or interface definition
introduces its own namespace. So you can define:</p>

<pre><code>struct Foo {
    struct Bar {
    }
}

struct Baz {
    struct Bar {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which in C++, will generate types <code>Foo</code>, <code>Foo::Bar</code>, <code>Baz</code>, and
<code>Baz::Bar</code>. Rust and OCaml both do something similar.</p>

<p>In languages without any kind of intra-module namespaces, code
generators usually come up with some kind of naming convention as a
substitute. Both the C and Go implementations use underscores to
separate name space segments, e.g. <code>Foo_Bar</code>. The Haskell implementation
uses the single quote, like <code>Foo'Bar</code>.</p>

<p>The length of identifiers like this gets out of hand quickly. Here’s a
particularly nasty example, from the output of the Go code generator on
Sandstorm’s <code>web-session.capnp</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>websession.WebSession_WebSocketStream_sendBytes_Results_Future
</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative idea is to generate multiple modules, but this can introduce
cyclic dependencies, and the implementation is much more complex at best.
In some cases it is actually impossible.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as Kenton pointed out, having things properly namespaced in
the target language doesn’t actually make this much nicer. He provided
this example line of code from Cloudflare Workers:</p>

<div><pre><code>case PipelineDef::Stage::Worker::Global::Value::JSON:
</code></pre></div>

<p>Nested namespaces violate the “optimize for the call site” principle;
they are sometimes convenient at the definition site, but lead to APIs
that are annoying to work with in actual code. I generally recommend just
not using nested namespaces in schema code, and consider them to be a
misfeature.</p>

<h2 id="implicitly-named-entities">Implicitly Named Entities</h2>

<p>Relatedly, there are a few constructs which the schema author doesn’t have
to give a name to, but which (for most backends) generate named entities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anonymous unions</li>
  <li>Groups</li>
  <li>Method parameter &amp; result lists</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these things feel quite natural to work with at the schema level,
but then the code generator is left having to come up with a name for
you, and normally it doesn’t have a heck of a lot to work with.</p>

<h2 id="anonymous-unions">Anonymous Unions</h2>

<p>Cap’n Proto includes support for tagged unions/variants. However, unlike
the variants in ML-family languages (e.g. Haskell, OCaml, Elm), Cap’n
Proto unions are not first class types. Instead, they are fields of
structs, which can also be “anonymous.”</p>

<p>To someone coming from an ML-like language, The fact that Cap’n Proto’s
unions aren’t first class types is a bit odd. The official docs make a
good justification for this, and I think it is a-priori a reasonable
design. Nonetheless, the fact that the feature maps poorly to existing
languages is a real downside.</p>

<p>I have a suggestion on how to make this better, which I think avoids
losing the good points of the current design. Split the use of unions
into two cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Structs which are entirely one big union.</li>
  <li>Structs which contain fields outside the union.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first case is very common, and would be worth making more ergonomic.
I would suggest that rather than writing:</p>

<pre><code>struct Foo {
    union {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You should just be able to write:</p>

<pre><code>union Foo {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the second case I would disallow <em>anonymous</em> unions – if there are
other fields, you have to give them a name.</p>

<p>You could still add common fields to a top-level union; just change it
to a struct, move all of the existing variants into a (named) union
field, and add your fields per usual.</p>

<p>In languages where it is most natural, this would allow unions to cleanly
map to variants, and structs to records. The code generator would also
not have to invent field names for anonymous unions, and you don’t lose
any of the advantages of the current approach.</p>

<p>The Haskell implementation currently looks for structs which are one big
anonymous union so that it can drop the outer wrapper. By itself this
isn’t too complicated, but it was yet another thing, and they add up.</p>

<h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>

<p>As the official documentation describes, groups are primarily useful in
conjunction with unions. They allow more than one field as part of the
same union variant, and they can be a little more self documenting,
since the members of that variant can be given names.</p>

<p>But stand-alone groups are far less compelling, and present challenges
for code generators. They’re another entity that (usually) needs to have
a name generated for it, and this is again going to end up being longer
than ideal.</p>

<p>I think coupling groups to unions would make this a better. There was
actually a surprising amount of complexity in avoiding name collisions
between the full generality of groups and anonymous unions.</p>

<h2 id="parameters-and-results">Parameters And Results</h2>

<p>The huge Go identifier mentioned earlier comes from this (comparatively
reasonable) schema definition:</p>

<pre><code>interface WebSession @0xa50711a14d35a8ce extends(Grain.UiSession) {
    # ...
    interface WebSocketStream {
        sendBytes @0 (message :Data);
        # ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the definition site, we just name the method and its arguments (and
results, if any). But at the protocol level, arguments and results are
their own structs, and the schema compiler generates a struct type for
each parameter list, and each result list. The name
<code>websession.WebSession_WebSocketStream_sendBytes_Results_Future</code> refers
to something that doesn’t even carry any data – sendBytes has no
results!</p>

<p>It’s possible to instead define the parameter &amp; result types explicitly,
e.g:</p>

<pre><code>interface WebSocketStream {
    sendBytes @0 SendBytesReq -&gt; SendBytesResp;
}

struct SendBytesReq {
    message :Data;
}

struct SendBytesResp {
}
</code></pre>

<p>It’s tempting to argue that in this case, you don’t gain much – the
name I’ve chosen for the struct is no more informative that the
auto-generated one, and the schema is much more verbose. It’s not like
I picked an especially lousy example, either; most of the grpc examples
I’ve seen (where this style <em>is</em> required) end up with similarly boring
names.</p>

<p>But forcing the schema author to do this also forces them to deal with
the namespacing problem themselves, so the code generator can drop not
one but <em>two</em> levels of nesting. In the  Haskell implementation this
makes the type names significantly shorter; in the original you have:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>WebSocketStream'sendBytes'params</span> <span>=</span> <span>WebSocketStream'sendBytes'params</span>
    <span>{</span> <span>message</span> <span>::</span> <span>Data</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>whereas with the separately declared struct you get:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>SendBytesReq</span> <span>=</span> <span>SendBytesReq</span>
    <span>{</span> <span>message</span> <span>::</span> <span>Data</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The resulting identifier is <em>less than half</em> the length of the original.</p>

<h2 id="identifier-conventions">Identifier Conventions</h2>

<p>Cap’n Proto currently uses case to distinguish between types and
constants/annotations, but some programming languages (including both
Haskell and Go) use case to distinguish other things. This can cause
trouble when the code generator has to modify a  name to conform with
the target language.</p>

<p>For example, in <code>persistent.capnp</code> there is both a type called
<code>Persistent</code> and an annotation called <code>persistent</code>. Go uses capitalization
to distinguish between public and private identifiers, so if left to its
own devices, the Go backend capitalizes <code>persistent</code>, which causes a name
collision. The Haskell implementation tries to be smarter about this, but
it results in significant implementation complexity that could have been
avoided by a little thought during design.</p>

<p>We could solve this problem by having all identifiers use the same case
conventions (standardizing on <code>smallCamelCase</code>), and have them live in
the same namespace, so that anything that might cause a name collision
in the target language will also cause a collision in the schema
language.</p>

<h2 id="default-field-values">Default Field Values</h2>

<p>Finally something other than names!</p>

<p>Cap’n Proto allows the schema author to define default values for
fields, if they are not otherwise set. So if you write:</p>

<pre><code>struct Foo {
    bar @0 :Int32;
    baz @1 :Text = "hello";
}
</code></pre>

<p>If a message does not have the <code>baz</code> field set, it will be treated as
being the string <code>"hello"</code>.</p>

<p>I strongly argue for disallowing these for pointer types (strings,
lists, structs…). They are already rarely used. Between the schema
that ship with Cap’n Proto and the ones in Sandstorm – over nine
thousand lines of schema source – the feature is used exactly twice,
both to set the default value of a parameter to the empty string.</p>

<p>For the Haskell implementation, this feature actually introduced a
significant amount of complexity – enough that, given how infrequently
the feature is actually used – I just decided not to support it. The
Haskell implementation just prints a warning to the console and
ignores custom defaults for pointer fields.</p>

<p>The usual way to implement this is to modify the message on first
access, which for immutable messages doesn’t work. I considered just
returning a constant in the immutable case, but its storage would be in
a different message than the pointer the user followed to it, which
could lead to surprises if the user tries to fish out the underlying
segment from the new value. There’s probably a decent design to be found
here, but after not coming up with a great answer quickly, I eventually
decided it was a waste of time.</p>

<p>Default values for non-pointer fields are much less of an issue – they
are implemented by storing fields xor’ed with their default values, so
the immutability issue doesn’t come up. For Haskell it’s totally fine.</p>

<p>But they do cause a problem for Go when using the <code>pogs</code> package, since by
default Go zeros the memory for structs, so if you have a custom default
value in a Cap’n Proto struct declaration, The default value of the Go
struct will disagree. It’s not an issue when you’re working with
messages in the wire format, since you’re not using Go structs
directly, but when performance permits Go structs are nicer to work
with.</p>

<p>Supposedly this was also the motivation for dropping custom default
values from Protobufs in version 3.</p>

<p>Kenton mentioned on the mailing list that he uses custom defaults for
non-pointer fields “all the time,” particularly booleans. My own sense
was that these were more common as well, but I decided to do some
measurements, again on the core &amp; Sandstorm schema. Here’s what I found:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are 261 fields (including in parameters and return values) of
non-pointer type declared in all of those schema.</li>
  <li>Of those, 20 have explicit defaults set.</li>
  <li>Of those with explicit defaults, 15 of them are just explicitly
setting the field to the default value for the type – perhaps
serving as documentation, but not actually having an effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>This leaves only 5 uses of the feature that actually do anything.
The five cases are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the core schema’s <code>rpc.capnp</code>, the <code>Return</code> type’s
<code>releaseParamCaps</code> field is set to true.</li>
  <li>Likewise, the <code>Finish</code> type’s <code>releaseResultCaps</code> is set to true.</li>
  <li>In the core schema’s <code>schema.capnp</code>, the <code>Field</code> type’s
<code>discriminantValue</code> field has its default set to a sentinel value
declared elsewhere as a constant called <code>noDiscriminant</code> (with a
value of <code>0xffff</code>).</li>
  <li>In sandstorm’s <code>web-session.capnp</code>, <code>WebSession.AcceptedType.qValue</code>
defaults to <code>1.0</code>.</li>
  <li>…as does <code>Websession.AcceptedEncoding.qValue</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two could be solved by changing <code>release</code> to <code>retain</code> and
flipping the semantics. Kenton had expressed concern about double-negatives
making things hard to read, and my original intent in doing these
measurements was to collect a list of such fields, pull out a thesaurus,
and try to get a sense of how hard it actually was to avoid that. I was
surprised to find that I didn’t get a sample size big enough to tell.</p>

<p>I had previously been on the fence as to whether this feature was worth
the awkwardness it introduced for Go, but given how little it seems to
be used in reality, I’m more solidly of the opinion that it should have
been left out. Given Kenton’s experience report I have to assume it’s
used more inside Cloudflare, but I no longer believe the feature carries
its weight.</p>

<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>

<p>I would make a few changes to the way inheritance of interfaces works in
the schema language:</p>

<p>First, signal an error if an interface declares method with the same name as
a method in one of its parents. Right now, handling this correctly
requires more name spacing logic in the code generator, and I know at
least the Go implementation just punts on this – which is probably the
right thing to do, given that I’ve never seen a schema that actually
does this.</p>

<p>I would also drop multiple inheritance. This would get rid of the diamond
problem, which is a source of API design challenges. One that came up in
the context of the Haskell implementation:</p>

<p>Haskell has good support for message-passing concurrency, and it would
be fairly natural to map the receive end of objects to a channel that you
pull calls out of, so for an interface like this:</p>

<pre><code>interface Foo {
    bar @0 BarReq -&gt; BarResp;
    baz @1 BazReq -&gt; BazResp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>you would get code like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo'call</span>
    <span>=</span> <span>Foo'Bar</span> <span>BarReq</span> <span>(</span><span>BarResp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Foo'Baz</span> <span>BazReq</span> <span>(</span><span>BazResp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then a server would handle these by doing something like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>handleFoo</span> <span>calls</span> <span>=</span> <span>forever</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>recv</span> <span>calls</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>call</span> <span>of</span>
        <span>Foo'Bar</span> <span>req</span> <span>reply</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span>
            <span>...</span>
            <span>reply</span> <span>returnValue</span>
        <span>Foo'Baz</span> <span>req</span> <span>reply</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>do</span>
            <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is nice for a lot of reasons; it means the library doesn’t have to
care as much abount managing the lifetimes of servers/threads, the API
is small and transparent, it’s easy to have multiple threads service the
same object, or fork off a thread to handle something and reply later,
etc. It affords a lot of flexibility and is fairly simple to do.</p>

<p>Adding single inheritance to this situation isn’t too hard; just add a
<code>super</code> variant to the call type. Say we have:</p>

<pre><code>interface Quux extends (Foo) {
    echo @0 EchoReq -&gt; EchoResp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then this becomes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Quux'call</span>
    <span>=</span> <span>Quux'Echo</span> <span>EchoReq</span> <span>(</span><span>EchoResp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Quux'super</span> <span>Foo'call</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Multiple inheritance gets awkward though; you could add variants
<code>Quux'super'Foo</code> and <code>Quux'super'Bar</code>, but you can now potentially have
more than one path to the same object. It’s probably possible to find a
reasonable solution here, but I don’t think multiple inheritance buys
you enough for it to be worth imposing the burden on implementers (and
users of the resulting API).</p>

<p>I ended up mapping interfaces to type classes instead, but if I were to
do it over again I’d do what I describe above; type classes solve the
diamond problem, but the implementation needs to care about a bunch of
things it otherwise wouldn’t, and the inversion of control makes writing
servers harder.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are a lot of good things to say about Cap’n Proto. The two big
ones for me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s fast. Not just the reference implementation, but even fairly
naive implementations of the design – I’ve never even bothered to
benchmark the Haskell implementation, much less gotten around to
optimizing it, but I’ve nonetheless heard from people who are using
it because protobufs was too slow.</li>
  <li>The RPC protocol is expressive in a way that nothing else I’ve played
with quite matches.</li>
</ul>

<p>…but all of the incidental difficulties add up to a lot of unnecessary
implementation work, and clumsy APIs. The experience of implementing
Cap’n Proto has really cemented my belief in being ruthless in leaving
things out.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA is absolutely dominating the AI conversation right and for good measure - their GPUs perform out-of-the-box and are a top choice for professionals and businesses that want to dabble in consumer AI. But just this week, both Intel and AMD optimized their software stacks to get massive speedups in generative AI which has seen AMD's RTX 7900 XTX get higher performance per dollar than an NVIDIA RTX 4080 in generative AI (specifically Stable Diffusion with A111/Xformers). Considering Stable Diffusion accounts for the vast majority of non-SaaS, localized generative AI right now - this is a major milestone and finally offers some competition to NVIDIA.</p>
<h2>AMD's 7900 XTX achieves higher iterations per second per dollar in Stable Diffusion (Automatic111 with DirectML) than NVIDIA RTX 4080 (xformers)</h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Tuning for GenAI, much like tuning for crypto mining performance, will have mileage vary significantly depending on the model/configuration being used. This article is about the most common A111 Xformers config (you can get a running tally of average performance by GPU here: https://vladmandic.github.io/sd-extension-system-info/pages/benchmark.html) but there *<strong>are*</strong> hyper tuned boutique optimizations where the NVIDIA RTX 4080 is faster still.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using Microsoft Olive and DirectML instead of the PyTorch pathway results in the AMD 7900 XTX going form a measly 1.87 iterations per second to 18.59 iterations per second! You can read the <strong><a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/how-to-running-optimized-automatic1111-stable-diffusion-webui-on/ba-p/625585">detailed guide by AMD over here</a></strong>. This level of performance in Automatic111 is pretty close to the <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/stable-diffusion-performance-nvidia-geforce-vs-amd-radeon/">SHARK-based approach to Stable Diffusion</a> and definitively puts the company on the map with regards to generative AI. As it turns out, it also makes the 7900 XTX offer slightly higher GenAI performance per dollar (in Stable Diffusion /A111) than the comparative RTX 4080 - at least at current prices.</p>

Before we crunch the numbers, I do want to mention the caveat that unlike NVIDIA, the AMD pathway does require the user to be a bit more tech savvy (AMD pathway uses Microsoft Olive instead of PyTorch and most automatic installers will likely not install the dependencies required for this automatically) - so if convenience is a factor for you - NVIDIA is still the way to go. But professionals and small businesses can usually get around an initial setup hassle if the cost basis is good enough and it does seem to be the case here.</p>

<table id="tablepress-1825"><thead><tr><th>GPU</th><th>Market Price</th><th>Configuration</th><th>SD Perf (it/s)</th><th>Dollars Spent Per it/s</th>

</tr><tr><td colspan="5">*= data taken from Puget Systems comparison published on Jul 31, 2023.</td>
</tr></tbody></table><!-- #tablepress-1825 from cache --><p>As we can see, the AMD silicon is finally starting to shine in GenAI to the point where it offers higher value compared to the 4080 in Stable Diffusion A111. The AMD 7900 XTX offers 18.59 iterations per second making users pay $52.1 per it/s while NVIDIA RTX 4080 gets 19.41 iterations per second making users pay $56.6 per it/s. If users opt for the less-common SHARK implementation, they can drive the value proposition all the way up to just $46.6 per it/s for the Radeon 7900 XTX. So its official - AMD is officially a contender for consumers interested in generative AI.</p>
<p>This also means that given just slightly more attention from AMD - they can be a formidable competitor to NVIDIA's AI ambitions. Most people aren't going to be running LLMs out of their basement but GenAI and SLMs/ULMs are going to be absolutely everywhere within the next 12 months and part of a lot of productivity workflows. How Intel and AMD position themselves in a market that NVIDIA has a massive head start on - will determine how they fare in a world that is going to be dominated by AI.</p>

				<p>Sixty-nine (<em>nice</em>, but in Elvish) years ago this week, the godfather of high fantasy,&nbsp;John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, published the first novel in a proposed three-volume epic “largely concerned with hobbits.”</p>
<p><em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> has, in the decades since publication, shifted over 150 million copies and spawned perhaps the most successful film trilogy (when box office numbers generated, Oscars won, and rave reviews received are all taken into account) of all time.</p>
<p>Long before it became&nbsp;the most iconic novel in the now-storied history of the genre, however, it was reviewed in the pages of the <em>New York Times</em> by no less a literary critic than W. H. Auden.</p>
<p>Here’s what the “Funeral Blues” author had to say about Frodo and Co.</p>

<p><em>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,</em><br>
<em>One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.</em></p>
<p>“Seventeen years ago there appeared, without any fanfare, a book called <em>The Hobbit</em> which, in my opinion, is one of the best children’s stories of this century. In <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, which is the first volume of a trilogy, J. R. R. Tolkien continues the imaginative history of the imaginary world to which he introduced us in his earlier book but in a manner suited to adults, to those, that is, between the ages of 12 and 70. For anyone who likes the genre to which it belongs, the Heroic Quest, I cannot imagine a more wonderful Christmas present. All Quests are concerned with some numinous Object, the Waters of Life, the Grail, buried treasure etc.; normally this is a good Object which it is the Hero’s task to find or to rescue from the Enemy, but the Ring of Mr. Tolkien’s story was made by the Enemy and is so dangerous that even the good cannot use it without being corrupted.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The hero, Frodo Baggins, belongs to a race of beings called hobbits, who may be only three feet high; have hairy feet and prefer to live in underground houses, but in their thinking and sensibility resemble very closely those arcadian rustics who inhabit so many British detective stories. I think some readers may find the opening chapter a little shy-making, but they must not let themselves be put off, for, once the story gets moving, this initial archness disappears.</p>
<p>For over a thousand years the hobbits have been living a peaceful existence in a fertile district called the Shire, incurious about the world outside. Actually, the latter is rather sinister; towns have fallen to ruins, roads into disrepair, fertile fields have returned to wilderness, wild beasts and evil beings on the prowl, and travel is difficult and dangerous. In addition to the Hobbits, there are Elves who are wise and good, Dwarves who are skillful and good on the whole, and Men, some warriors, some wizards, who are good or bad. The present incarnation of the Enemy is Sauron, Lord of Barad-Dur, the Dark Tower in the Land of Mordor. Assisting him are the Orcs, wolves and other horrid creatures and, of course, such men as his power attracts or overawes. Landscape, climate and atmosphere are northern, reminiscent of the Icelandic sagas.</p>
<p>The first thing that one asks is that the adventure should be various and exciting; in this respect Mr. Tolkien’s invention is unflagging, and, on the primitive level of wanting to know what happens next, <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> is at least as good as <em>The Thirty-Nine Steps</em>. Of any imaginary world the reader demands that it seem real, and the standard of realism demanded today is much stricter than in the time, say, of Malory. Mr. Tolkien is fortunate in possessing an amazing gift for naming and a wonderfully exact eye for description; by the time one has finished his book one knows the histories of Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves and the landscape they inhabit as well as one knows one’s own childhood.</p>
<p>Lastly, if one is to take a tale of this kind seriously, one must feel that, however superficially unlike the world we live in its characters and events may be, it nevertheless holds up the mirror to the only nature we know, our own; in this, too, Mr. Tolkien has succeeded superbly, and what happened in the year of the Shire 1418 in the Third Age of Middle Earth is not only fascinating in A. D. 1954 but also a warning and an inspiration. No fiction I have read in the last five years has given me more joy than <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-fellowship.html" target="_blank">–W. H. Auden, <em>The New York Times</em>, October 31, 1954</a></p>

In the studies presented here, we employed simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected antiretroviral (ART)-treated Indian rhesus macaques to evaluate biodistribution, safety, and the ability of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing treatment (EBT-001) to target integrated SIV given in a single intravenous (IV) bolus infusion [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Mancuso P, Chen C, Kaminski R, Gordon J, Liao S, Robinson JA, et al.

EBT-001 (encoding SIV targeting guide RNAs) is the simian homolog of EBT-101 (encoding HIV targeting guide RNAs) and is comprised of an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) encapsulated all-in-one CRISPR construct simultaneously expressing the SaCas9 endonuclease and dual guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) and the Gag gene. EBT-101 is designed for the removal of large intervening integrated proviral SIV DNA sequences positioned between the intended CRISPR target sites, thereby generating 3 possible deletions: 5′LTR to Gag, Gag to 3′LTR, and 5′LTR to 3′LTR. The use of AAV9 delivery is supported by our initial studies in small and large animal models, in addition to a large body of evidence from previous gene therapy clinical trials where AAV9 has exhibited safety, efficacy and broad biodistribution properties [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Mancuso P, Chen C, Kaminski R, Gordon J, Liao S, Robinson JA, et al.

Here, we present more comprehensive data on safety, including extensive off-target analyses, and biodistribution of multiple doses (10<sup>12</sup>, 10<sup>13</sup>, 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg) of EBT-001 and extended study (3 and 6 months) in an Indian rhesus macaque SIV model. This preclinical safety, biodistribution, and efficacy study demonstrated that a single IV administration of EBT-001 for SIV editing was well-tolerated and can broadly reach and excise viral reservoirs in NHPs without any observed off-target effects. These results support that a single IV inoculation of EBT-101 for HIV gene editing can be utilized to reach viral reservoirs in infected tissues throughout the body for the safe and specific in vivo editing of latent HIV proviral DNA.</p></div><div id="Sec2-section" data-title="Materials and methods"><h2 id="Sec2">Materials and methods</h2><div id="Sec2-content"><h3 id="Sec3">Study design</h3><p>This study was approved by BIOQUAL’s IACUC, protocol number 18-036. Twelve male Indian rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were obtained from the Caribbean Primate Research Center in Puerto Rico. Two studies were performed. The first was an <i>n</i> = 10 with animals randomized by a statistician into four treatment groups with 3 untreated, 3 treated with 1.4 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/kg EBT-001, and 4 treated with 1.4 × 10<sup>13</sup> GC/kg EBT-001 (2 necropsied at 3 months and 2 at 6 months post EBT-001). Randomization was done using a permuted block randomization method with the restriction that social partner paired animals were in the same group. The second study was with an <i>n</i> = 2 using 1 log higher EBT-001 dose of 1.4 × 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg and no randomization was performed here. All animals were screened and were triple negative for Mamu-A*01, Mamu-B*08 and Mamu-B*17. All rhesus macaques were received at BIOQUAL’s Piccard Drive Facility, in Rockville, MD where all the in vivo studies described here were performed. The rhesus macaques were serology pre-screened for retroviruses (STLV and SIV), SA8 virus, SHF virus, and measles virus prior to the study. Animals were infected with SIVmac239 (a gift from Dr. Preston Marx, Tulane Primate Center). Animals were started on a daily ART regimen of tenofovir (TDF; #T018500; 15 mg/kg/animal), emtricitabine (FTC; #E525000; 50 mg/kg/animal), and dolutegravir (DTG; #D528800; 2.5 mg/kg/animal) (Toronto Research Chemicals) beginning on day 28 post infection and continued to necropsy. Animals were observed for morbidity, mortality, injury, and availability of food and water. Any animals in poor health were identified for further monitoring, clinical treatment, and possible euthanasia. Observations included, but were not limited to, evaluation of the skin, fur, eyes, ears, nose, oral cavity, thorax, abdomen, external genitalia, limbs and feet, respiratory and circulatory effects, autonomic effects such as salivation, nervous system effects including tremors, convulsions, reactivity to handling, neurological/behavioral effects, and unusual behavior. SIV viral load (limit of detection of 50 copies/mL) was measured in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma over the course of infection (Supplementary material and methods). Whole blood was collected on multiple days during the study period and submitted to IDEXX BioAnalytics, Inc. for complete blood count (CBC) analysis and for blood chemistries. Animals were dosed with EBT-001 at 6 months post SIV infection with a slow IV infusion at a rate of 1 mL/min. The amount of EBT-001 vector to be dosed was added to total of 100 mL of 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for each animal based on current body weight and dose (Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S2</a>).

Research staff was blinded to animal groupings during excision assays and analyses.</p><h3 id="Sec7">Cytokine analyses</h3><p>EDTA plasma samples were analyzed using the Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) assay. Each well of the plate is a working electrode surface that absorbs the capture reagent. The Cytokine Panel 1 (NHP, MSD v-plex K15057D) and Proinflammatory Panel 1 (NHP, MSD kit #K15056D) were utilized in the study and specifically validated for NHPs. First, plates were washed 3 times and incubated with calibrators/samples for 2 h with shaking. Plates were then washed and incubated with the detection antibody cocktail for 2 h. After the last washing step, plates were read and data analyzed using the MSD software.</p><h3 id="Sec8">Statistical analyses</h3><p>Continuous measures were presented by scatter plots and summarized as mean ± standard effort of the mean. For monkey weights, Group 1 (untreated) was compared to Groups 2, 3, and 4 combined (treated). A linear mixed-effects model was used to compare percent change in weight from pre-EBT-001 over time between treated vs untreated groups. Statistical significance was based on a two-sided alpha level of less than 0.05. The variance was similar between groups and the data are normally distributed.</p><h3 id="Sec9">Code availability for off-target assessment</h3><p>Nomination of off-target editing sites was performed using proprietary COTANA pipeline that is based on an open source tool Cas-OFFinder v2.4.1 (<a href="https://github.com/snugel/cas-offinder/">https://github.com/snugel/cas-offinder/</a>), which provides similar search results [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Bae S, Park J, Kim JS.

For this work in rhesus macaques, gRNAs targeting SIV were chosen to represent the same regions as the HIV guides for these biodistribution and safety studies.</p><p>The bioinformatics tool COTANA (<u>C</u>RISPR <u>O</u>ff-<u>Ta</u>rget <u>N</u>omination &amp; <u>A</u>nalysis) exhaustively searched the rhesus macaque reference genome (NCBI genome assembly Mmul_10) for the most similar chromosomal sequences to the target site. COTANA output each nominated site with the specified number of differences between the gRNA and DNA sequence (Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Tab1">1</a>). The output for the exhaustive search, including mismatches and possible bulges, contains few nominated sites in the rhesus macaque genome and very few with less than 4 differences (Supplementary materials and methods). The list of output sites also has few with low penalty match scores, which generally indicate a more possible chance of locating sequence-verified off-target sites. Penalty match scores were calculated based on the increasing number, type, and locations of the mismatches and bulges between the gRNA and chromosomal sequence (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig1">1</a>). When using gene editing to correct disease-causing mutations, one is generally limited to the closest few target sites. When targeting viral sequences for inactivation, there is much greater flexibility as multiple targeting strategies and series of target sites can be bioinformatically scanned to choose conserved viral target sites that have a much lower number and similarity of chromosomal locations [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Fu Y, Foden JA, Khayter C, Maeder ML, Reyon D, Joung JK, et al.

In study one, a total of 10 male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were divided into 3 groups: Group 1 had no EBT-001 treatment, Group 2 with 1.4 × 10<sup>12</sup> genome copies (GC)/kg of EBT-001, and Group 3 with 1.4 × 10<sup>13</sup> GC/kg of EBT-001 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig2">2A</a>). In study two, a higher dose (1.4 × 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg) of EBT-001 was given to 2 animals in Group 4 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig2">2B</a><b>)</b>. Both studies examined NHPs infected with SIVmac239 (200 TCID<sub>50</sub>) via the i.v. route and treated with a triple ART regimen (tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), and DTG) via the s.q. route (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig2">2C</a>). This regimen was selected for its similarity to how HIV-infected humans are treated to control HIV infection. ART began 28 days post-infection and all 12 animals remained on ART for the entire course of the study. Once viral levels were reduced to minimum levels in the blood, animals were maintained on only ART (Group 1) or treated with one of 3 doses of EBT-001 delivered by a single IV infusion (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig3">3C</a>, Supplementary material and methods, Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S2</a>). All monkeys received full doses of EBT-001. One monkey (CK49) in Group 3 experienced shortness of breath and hypoxia after administration of anesthesia that worsened after infusion of EBT-001. The infusion of EBT-001 was paused while the monkey was treated for acute pulmonary edema and recovered. The remaining dose of EBT-001 was delivered several days later without any complications. This was an adverse reaction due to the anesthetic agent, Dexdomitor because the re-challenge of EBT-001 was well-tolerated and the symptoms were consistent with adverse reactions to Dexdomitor. One animal in Group 2 developed a skin rash after EBT-001 infusion. Plasma viral RNA was measured throughout the course of infection and after EBT-001 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig2">2D, E</a>).</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-2" data-title="Non-human primate study design and viral loads."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig2" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 2: Non-human primate study design and viral loads.</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4/figures/2" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41434-023-00410-4/MediaObjects/41434_2023_410_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig2" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41434-023-00410-4/MediaObjects/41434_2023_410_Fig2_HTML.png" alt="figure 2" loading="lazy" width="685" height="407"></picture></a></div><p>Initial study design <i>n</i> = 10 (<b>A</b>), follow-up study design <i>n</i> = 2 (<b>B</b>), study chart with groups 1-4 identified (<b>C</b>), Individual plasma viral loads (log10 copies/mL of plasma) (<b>D</b>) and mean and SEM of plasma viral loads of 4 Groups (<b>E</b>).

EBT-001 treatment was associated with increases in AAV9 neutralizing antibodies 3 or 6 months after treatment relative to pre-dose values. The pre-dose titers (serum reciprocal dilution values) were low (&lt;5 and 80), except CF63, which had a pre-dose titer of 320. The values at necropsy ranged from 80-5120 in EBT-001 treated animals and were highest in the monkeys sacrificed at 6 months post-EBT-001. Of note, CF63’s titer did not change after EBT-001 treatment even though it was the highest at baseline.</p><p>All monkeys survived until the scheduled euthanasia (3 or 6 months post EBT-001) when a full necropsy was performed on all animals (Supplementary material and methods). Overall, the gross necropsy observations were within normal range, except for a single animal (1T6, Group 1) from the ART-only treated group, who was dehydrated and had a thin body condition (2/5 body composition score). All findings were consistent with SIV infection (Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S5</a>). No EBT-001-related gross or microscopic pathology findings were noted in a comprehensive histopathological evaluation of major organs performed by Charles River Laboratories, LLC. General microscopic findings attributed to chronic SIV infection were observed within all treatment groups and included minimal to mild lymphoid hyperplasia of the germinal centers and mantle zone of the mesenteric lymph node, lymphoid hyperplasia of the secondary lymphoid follicles in the white pulp of the spleen, and mononuclear cell infiltration of the heart, kidney, and lung. Additionally, there was lymphoid hyperplasia of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths of the spleen in animal BM79 (Group 4). There were no apparent differences in the frequency or severity of these findings in monkeys treated with ART only or in monkeys treated with ART in combination with EBT-001. In a separate neuropathological evaluation performed by Experimental Pathology Laboratories, Inc., findings in all SIV-infected rhesus macaques were few and consisted primarily of focal minimal findings of microgliosis and less commonly astrocytosis and/or sparse perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates. Overall, the microscopic findings were consistent with chronic SIV infection and were observed with similar frequency in control SIV-infected animals examined at the same timepoints from another EBT-001 study. The findings were therefore not attributed to treatment with EBT-001.</p><h3 id="Sec13">Detection of vector DNA in tissues</h3><p>To assess the biodistribution of the vector in tissues at necropsy, a TaqMan-based qPCR assay was used to quantitate EBT-001 (vector) DNA (Charles River) (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig3">3A, B</a>). All DNA biodistribution and vector shedding samples collected from the untreated animals (Group 1) were negative, demonstrating the contamination was well controlled from animal dosing, necropsy, DNA extraction, and qPCR analysis in this study. Tissues that are considered major HIV/SIV reservoirs, including spleen, lymph nodes, colon, bone marrow&nbsp;compartment, and blood were examined for vector biodistribution (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig3">3A</a>). Levels of vector DNA in spleen ranged from 4.82–6.44 (log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA/ug of monkey DNA). For the mesenteric lymph nodes, the value ranged from 4.01–6.42 and for colon 2.52–4.24 (log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA/ug of monkey DNA). In bone marrow, vector DNA was undetectable in Group 2, 1.75–3.55 (log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA/ug of monkey DNA) in Group 3, and 2 logs higher in Group 4 with average 5.5 (log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA/ug of monkey DNA). In blood, where cells turnover rapidly, vector DNA was only found in the 2 animals from Group 3 that were necropsied at 3 months post-EBT-001 and was absent in animals in the same group that were necropsied at 6 months and in the higher dosed animal also sacrificed at 6 months (Group 4) (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig3">3A</a>). However, when biodistribution was examined serially in blood starting at 2 weeks post-EBT-001, vector DNA was detected in Groups 2 and 3 and decreased over time (Figure&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S5</a>). The highest concentration of EBT-001 DNA was detected in the liver samples from Groups 3 and 4 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig3">3B</a>). For the brain and other tissues, Group 2 was low or undetectable and distribution was increased in Group 3 but interestingly, levels in Group 4 were in the range of 4 (log10 copies of EBT-001 DNA/ug of monkey DNA). No evidence of vector shedding in stool or urine was observed (not shown). The qPCR results confirm that EBT-001 was distributed widely to blood and all major organs and tissues tested in animals dosed with the vector. Biodistribution of EBT-001 (DNA levels) was dose dependent, and the vector levels in each tissue and blood decreased over time, although persisting 6 months after injection in many tissues.</p><h3 id="Sec14">Editing of proviral DNA fragments from blood cells and various solid organs</h3><p>SIV excision activity was assayed across treatment groups and tissues. The 2 gRNAs in EBT-001 target 3 locations in SIV and therefore excise 3 large intervening integrated proviral SIV segments. The LTR gRNA cuts both the 5′ and 3′LTR. As this guide is co-delivered along with the Gag gRNA, there is the possible removal of the intervening integrated proviral SIV DNA sequence between the 5′LTR to Gag, Gag to the 3′LTR and between the 5′LTR and 3′LTR. Two assays were used to demonstrate 5′LTR to Gag (5G) and Gag to 3′LTR (G3) excision in tissues and blood (see Supplementary material and methods and Supplementary Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">3</a>). Evidence of excision was detected by the observation of nested PCR products of distinct DNA fragments of 268 or 171 bp resulting from the removal of intervening DNA sequences between 5′LTR to Gag (5G) or Gag to 3′LTR (G3), respectively (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig4">4A, C</a>). The 5 G assay also amplified the full-length SIV at an amplicon size of 1282 bp. Due to extensive homology between the 5′ and 3′LTR sequences and the lack of standardized flanking sequences due to the random chromosomal integration of SIV proviral DNA, it was not possible to measure the third excision product which removes the entire 5′LTR to 3′LTR portion. Both PCR-based excision assays (5G and G3) were completed (in duplicate by 2 operators) for blood and small sections of tissues and organs, including: bone marrow, brain (brain stem, cerebellum, frontal, occipital, parietal, prefrontal, temporal cortices), colon, duodenum, heart (left ventricle, left atrium, right ventricle, right atrium), kidneys, liver, lungs, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and testes (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig4">4</a>, Tables&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S6</a>, and S<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">7</a>).

No excision, defined by no detection of either of the nested PCR products of 268 bp (5G) or 171 bp (G3), is represented by a gray box. If no full-length (top band of 1282 bp in the 5G only) or excised product could be amplified (in both 5G and G3), then this is represented by a white box. This analysis demonstrated SIV DNA cleavage in a broad range of tissues, 3 and 6 months after vector treatment. SIV viral excision, 5′LTR to Gag or Gag to 3′LTR, was observed in some tissue for all EBT-001 treated animals. There was individual animal variability observed, as well as differences in excision in tissues. Excision was detected at 3 months and in some tissues at 6 months. No virus was detected in some tissue samples at the highest dose of EBT-001 (Group 4) at 6 months post-EBT-001, which may indicate the elimination of viral DNA from those sections of tissues. The results of the excision activity analysis showed SIV DNA cleavage in a broad range of tissues 3 and 6 months after vector treatment, and in blood 2–10 weeks after vector treatment, including the presence of SIV excision in the blood of one animal (BM79) at necropsy (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Fig4">4D</a>). Since the 5G EXA assay amplifies both the full-length virus (1282 bp) and the amplicon (268 bp) of the excision product after the removal of intervening DNA sequences between 5′LTR to Gag, we calculated the percent efficiency of the 5G excision (Tables&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S8</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S9</a>, Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S6</a>, Supplementary material and methods). We understand the limitations of this PCR-based assay, as it is semi-quantitative, and it is possible that the smaller excision products may be amplified more efficiently than the intact virus. In addition, this assay reflects only one of 3 possible excision products that can occur through EBT-001 cutting. Despite the limitations of assay detection, the results show varying excision abilities with several animals reported to have detectable excision in tissue sections examined, even at the lower doses.</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-4" data-title="Proviral excision of SIV DNA in tissues and blood."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig4" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 4: Proviral excision of SIV DNA in tissues and blood.</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4/figures/4" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41434-023-00410-4/MediaObjects/41434_2023_410_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig4" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41434-023-00410-4/MediaObjects/41434_2023_410_Fig4_HTML.png" alt="figure 4" loading="lazy" width="685" height="595"></picture></a></div><p>Example of 5G and G3 PCR of necropsy tissues from monkey MA285 (<b>A</b>).

WGS was conducted on genomic DNA samples from lymph node biopsies collected from 2 NHPs, CK49 and CH97, before receiving EBT-001 and from the same animals after 3 months or 6 months of treatment with EBT-001, respectively. WGS was performed using 2 × 150 bp paired end sequencing and averaged ~30× coverage depth. To effectively align and process the sequencing reads, a pipeline was designed in the High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), a cloud-based environment optimized for storage and analysis of extra-large data, such as NGS (9; Supplementary text). When assessing for unintended off-target editing, we focused on the nominated sites with relatively higher homology to the guide sequences. The indel rates were calculated for genomic loci within 10 bp of hypothetical cut sites of each nominated locus. When we&nbsp;compared the treated with untreated samples from lymph node, the&nbsp;initial screen identified 5 sites to have significantly different numbers of SNPs (Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Tab2">2</a>) using two-tailed chi-squared test with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control false discovery rate (FDR). We observed that all these SNPs occur at a distant location from the hypothetical cut site (7–10 bases away) with SNPs showing in both treated and untreated samples. Further examination of these sites has shown a lack of evidence to attribute these changes to gene editing due to alignments being too noisy, having long stretches of Ts around the potential site that may result in ambiguous alignment, or coverage being low (Supplementary text). Additionally, it was noted that the relative change of the SNPs frequency was not consistent between the two select animals across all 5 sites. Hence, we conclude that there is lack of evidence for off-target editing activity. We also screened for structural variants among these nominated sites, we detected no read supporting partial alignments within 40 bp windows surrounding the nominated cut sites. Additionally, we looked at potential AAV integration events by searching for chimeric reads with partial alignment. Compared to samples before treatment, the analysis found only 2 potential reads in CH97 post-treatment and 1 read in CK49 post-treatment. The 2 reads from CH97 post treatment were identical to each other, possibly PCR duplicates, and showed partial alignment to Chr7:128862755–128862834 with partial alignment to Cas9 coding region (EBT001: 2636–2565). The 1 read in CK49 post treatment also showed partial alignment to Cas9 coding region (EBT001: 2944–3037), and partially aligned to Chr12:28738543–28738586 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#MOESM1">S8</a>). However, it was noted that among these three reads, none of their respective paired end read supported the partial alignment results. Taken together with the extremely little amount of supporting reads, we concluded that none of the 3 split-read jumps can be attributed as evidence for AAV integration in the lymph nodes after EBT-001 treatment.</p><div data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-2"><figure><figcaption><b id="Tab2" data-test="table-caption">Table 2 Sites identified with significantly different indels located within 10 bp of a nominated cut site in the WGS.</b></figcaption><p><a data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4/tables/2" aria-label="Full size table 2"><span>Full size table</span></a></p></figure></div></div></div><div id="Sec17-section" data-title="Discussion"><h2 id="Sec17">Discussion</h2><div id="Sec17-content"><p>Treatment of SIV-infected rhesus monkeys with AAV9 CRISPR-Cas9 and dual gRNAs targeting SIV LTR and Gag (EBT-001) exhibited broad tissue biodistribution and evidence of SIV proviral DNA editing in all major viral reservoirs. EBT-001 was well-tolerated at doses of 1.4 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/kg, 1.4 × 10<sup>13</sup> GC/kg, and 1.4 × 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg. There were no clinical signs of toxicity and no abnormal gross pathology or organ histopathology attributed to EBT-001. One animal experienced an infusion related reaction thought to be due to anesthesia as the symptoms started after administration of anesthesia and before infusion of EBT-001, and another animal developed a rash at the infusion site. Transient increases in liver enzymes and total serum bilirubin were observed with the highest dose. Elevations in liver function tests following treatment with EBT-001 may represent an acute hepatic inflammation resulting from the treatment. Importantly, the elevated liver function tests returned to baseline range values in both NHP within 1–8 weeks. The transient nature of the elevations, combined with an absence of histopathological evidence of liver injury 6 months following treatment, indicate that the effects on liver function were reversible.</p><p>One interesting observation was the absence of weight loss among our SIV-infected cohort who received EBT-001, in contrast to the observation of weight loss seen in NHPs in the ART-only group. Interestingly, among our NHPs that were receiving the highest dose (1.4 × 10<sup>14</sup> GC/kg) of EBT-001 and exhibiting no signs of weight loss, we also noticed improvements in their absolute lymphocyte counts within 6 months. Although we do not have data from untreated animals at 6 months, EBT-001 did not cause an elevation in IFN-gamma. Other cytokines, including IL-10, were examined but were either undetectable or no changes were seen. One animal in the highest dose group, BM79, had elevated IL-7 and IL-15 at 6 months, but without an SIV only control at this time point it is difficult to delineate if this is in response to AAV or SIV. In addition, the data suggests that EBT-001 may potentially benefit the immune system via lymphocyte recovery, T cell development, and NK cell maintenance.</p><p>One of the main concerns with the use of gene therapies in humans is their potential to induce immunological responses that may have adverse clinical effects [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Ronzitti G, Gross DA, Mingozzi F.

The 5G assay detects the amplicon bridging the excised region between 5′LTR and Gag; while the G3 assay detects the amplicon bridging the excised region between Gag and 3′LTR. Of note, there are 3 possible excision products that can result when using gRNAs targeting LTR and Gag. Due to the homology between the 5′ and 3′ LTRs, only 2 of the 3 excision are currently measurable. Thus, we are possibly underestimating the excision as we cannot detect evidence of the full 5′ to 3′LTR excision. However, the success of any one of the 3 possible excisions will render the viral unable to replicate.</p><p>With any gene editing platform, possible off-target effects are a concern that should be monitored. We mitigated this concern in this study using bioinformatics searches of the rhesus macaque genome that revealed no genomic sites output with 1, 2, or 3 mismatches to the guide and protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). One site was identified for the LTR guide that had 2 mismatches plus a bulge. Few sites were output with 4 or 5 differences between the guides and the rhesus macaque genome (Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#Tab1">1</a>). Assays for possible off-target events for EBT-101 in HIV-1 infected humanized mice revealed no detectible activity after treatment with the guides targeting HIV [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Dash PK, Kaminski R, Bella R, Su H, Mathews S, Ahooyi TM, et al.

To assay for possible unintended edits in this study, assays searched for indels and the possibility of larger changes, including insertions, deletions, inversions, translocations, or other chromosomal rearrangements. Past studies mapping the effects of CRISPR editing using a range of different gRNAs predominantly found single nucleotide deletions or insertions, a lower frequency of different small indels and a much lower frequencies of larger deletions and insertions [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 22" title="Cradick TJ, Fine EJ, Antico CJ, Bao G.

              " href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00410-4#ref-CR23" id="ref-link-section-d191707301e2343">23</a>]. When larger deletions occurred, smaller indels were found at a higher frequency. Our analysis, therefore, included searching both for indels and possible larger changes. A marked advantage of the combination studies is the opportunity to use multiple pipelines simultaneously to assay for possible off-target editing and for the data from one pipeline to improve the accuracy of the data in other pipelines. For example, if structural changes or AAV insertion were detected at sites of off-target editing, these hypothetical events would be supported by evidence from indel analysis that were observed to occur at the same chromosomal sites with a higher number of sequence-confirmed indels. The simultaneous use of pipelines for indels, structural variation and AAV insertions can therefore help to assay for any possible, low-frequency editing sites. Here, WGS was performed without detecting unintended editing events and with no conclusive evidence of AAV or SaCas9 insertions, structural variations, or disruption of a gene, due to EBT-001 CRISPR editing. These NHP studies observed the intended SIV excision activity across multiple tissues studied with no detectible unintended editing.</p><p>This study was designed as a preclinical study for the safety and tolerability of EBT-001 in a large animal model of HIV. To most accurately model EBT-101, SIV guides were not optimized for cutting efficiency, but were instead selected to target the same LTR and Gag regions. Other than the guide sequences, EBT-001 and EBT-101 are comprised of an identical all-in-one delivery vector. The limitations of our study are the small animal numbers per group, the limited time on ART prior to EBT-001, and the lack of an analytical treatment interruption. The study was not designed to test the effect on the intact viral reservoir as EBT-001 was given when the viral reservoir was not stable and there was still active viral replication. Additionally, as animals were maintained on ART, we did not test the ability of EBT-001 to extend time to viral rebound or eliminate viral reactivation after an analytical treatment interruption. Together, the biodistribution and safety data support the continued development of AAV9 delivered CRISPR-Cas9 dual gRNA for HIV eradicative cure strategies.</p></div></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>For years, cops</span> and other government authorities all over the world have been using phone hacking technology provided by Cellebrite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/cellebrite-may-have-found-a-way-to-unlock-iphones-running-ios-11/">to unlock phones</a> and obtain the data within. And the company has been keen on keeping the use of its technology “hush hush.”</p>
<p>As part of the deal with government agencies, Cellebrite asks users to keep its tech — and the fact that they used it — secret, TechCrunch has learned. This request concerns legal experts who argue that powerful technology like the one Cellebrite builds and sells, and how it gets used by law enforcement agencies, ought to be public and scrutinized.</p>
<p>In a leaked training video for law enforcement customers that was obtained by TechCrunch, a senior Cellebrite employee tells customers that “ultimately, you’ve extracted the data, it’s the data that solves the crime, how you got in, let’s try to keep that as hush hush as possible.”</p>
<p>“We don’t really want any techniques to leak in court through disclosure practices, or you know, ultimately in testimony, when you are sitting in the stand, producing all this evidence and discussing how you got into the phone,” the employee, who we are not naming, says in the video.</p>
<p>For legal experts, this kind of request is troubling because authorities need to be transparent in order for a judge to authorize searches, or to authorize the use of certain data and evidence in court. Secrecy, the experts argue, hurts the rights of defendants, and ultimately the rights of the public.</p>
<p>“The results these super-secretive products spit out are used in court to try to prove whether someone is guilty of a crime,” Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Stanford University’s Internet Observatory, told TechCrunch. “The accused (whether through their lawyers or through an expert) must have the ability to fully understand how Cellebrite devices work, examine them, and determine whether they functioned properly or contained flaws that might have affected the results.”</p>
<p>“And anyone testifying about those products under oath must not hide important information that could help exonerate a criminal defendant solely to protect the business interests of some company,” said Pfefferkorn.</p>
<p>Hanni Fakhoury, a criminal defense attorney who has studied surveillance technology for years, told TechCrunch that “the reason why that stuff needs to be disclosed, is the defense needs to be able to figure out ‘was there a legal problem in how this evidence was obtained? Do I have the ability to challenge that?’”</p>
<p>The Cellebrite employee claims in the video that disclosing the use of its technology could help criminals and make the lives of law enforcement agencies harder.</p>
<p>“It’s super important to keep all these capabilities as protected as possible, because ultimately leakage can be harmful to the entire law enforcement community globally,” the Cellebrite employee says in the video. “We want to ensure that widespread knowledge of these capabilities does not spread. And if the bad guys find out how we’re getting into a device, or that we’re able to decrypt a particular encrypted messaging app, while they might move on to something much, much more difficult or impossible to overcome, we definitely don’t want that.”</p>
<p>Cellebrite spokesperson Victor Cooper said in an email to TechCrunch that the company “is committed to support ethical law enforcement. Our tools are designed for lawful use, with the utmost respect for the chain of custody and judicial process.”</p>
<p>“We do not advise our customers to act in contravention with any law, legal requirements or other forensics standards,” the spokesperson said. “While we continue protecting and expect users of our tools to respect our trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information, we also permanently continue developing our training and other published materials for the purpose of identifying statements which could be improperly interpreted by listeners, and in this respect, we thank you for bringing this to our attention.”</p>
<p>When asked whether Cellebrite would change the content of its training, the spokesperson did not respond.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s senior staff attorney Saira Hussain and senior staff technologist Cooper Quintin told TechCrunch in an email that “Cellebrite is helping create a world where authoritarian countries, criminal groups, and cyber-mercenaries also are able to exploit these vulnerable devices and commit crimes, silence opposition, and invade people’s privacy.”</p>
<p>Cellebrite is not the first company that asks its customers to keep its technology secret.</p>
<p>For years, government contractor Harris Corporation made law enforcement agencies who wanted to use its cellphone surveillance tool, known as stingrays, sign <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/harris-stingray-nda/">a non-disclosure agreement</a> that in some cases suggested dropping cases rather than disclosing what tools the authorities used. These requests <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/cellebrite-asks-cops-to-keep-its-phone-hacking-tech-hush-hush/nytimes.com/2015/03/16/business/a-police-gadget-tracks-phones-shhh-its-secret.html">go as far back as the mid 2010s</a>, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-cell-site-simulator-stingray-secrecy/">are still in force today</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the full transcript of the training video:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m happy you can join us. And I’m happy to kick off this initial module covering the system overview and orientation for Cellebrite Premium. Thank you and enjoy.</p>
<p>Did you know that Cellebrite Advanced Services has 10 labs in nine different countries around the world? Well, in order to leverage all of that capacity, we are working together to deliver this training to you, so you will be hearing from colleagues from around the world. The following list are those that comprise this current module set, I hope you enjoy meeting them each.</p>
<p>Before we begin, it’s quite important to go over the confidentiality and operational security concerns that we must abide by by using Cellebrite Premium, not only ourselves in our own Cellebrite Advanced Services labs, but most particularly you in your own labs around the world.</p>
<p>Well, we must recognize that this capability is actually saving lives. And in situations when it’s too late, we’re helping to deliver closure for the victims’ families, and ultimately solve crimes and put people behind bars. So, it’s super important to keep all these capabilities as protected as possible, because ultimately leakage can be harmful to the entire law enforcement community globally.</p>
<p>In a bit more detail, these capabilities that are put into Cellebrite Premium, they are actually trade secrets of Cellebrite, and we want to continue to ensure the viability of them so that we can continue to invest heavily into research and development, so we can give these abilities to law enforcement globally. Your part is to ensure that these techniques are protected as best as you can, and to either consider them as “law enforcement sensitive” or classify them to a higher level of protection in your individual country or agency.</p>
<p>And the reason why is because we want to ensure that widespread knowledge of these capabilities does not spread. And, if the bad guys find out how we’re getting into a device, or that we’re able to decrypt a particular encrypted messaging app, while they might move on to something much, much more difficult or impossible to overcome.We definitely don’t want that.</p>
<p>We’re also aware that the phone manufacturers are continuously looking to strengthen the security of their products. And the challenge is already so difficult as it is, but we still continue to have really good breakthroughs. Please don’t make this any more difficult for us than it already is.</p>
<p>And ultimately, we don’t really want any techniques to leak in court through disclosure practices, or you know, ultimately in testimony, when you are sitting in the stand, producing all this evidence and discussing how you got into the phone. Ultimately, you’ve extracted the data, it’s the data that solves the crime. How you got in, let’s try to keep that as hush hush as possible.</p>
<p>And now moving on to operational security or “opsec.” It starts with the physical protection of the premium system and all of its components that you’ve received in the kit.</p>
<p>These little bits and pieces that make all this capability… magic. They’re highly sensitive assets, and we want to ensure that no tampering or any other curiosities are employed on these devices. And in some cases, there is the chance of tampering and disabling the component, and that’s something that you really don’t want to do, because it could knock out your agency from having the capability whilst you await a replacement.</p>
<p>Additionally, exposure of any of these premium capabilities could be quite harmful to the global law enforcement environment. So, be careful with information sharing, whether it’s in face to face conversations, over the phone, on online discussion groups, via email — other things like that — just try to keep it sensitive and don’t go into any details.</p>
<p>When it comes to written documentation, obviously, you don’t want to disclose too much in your court reports. But definitely put the bare minimum to ensure that a layperson can understand the basic concepts of what was done.</p>
<p>Certainly mention that you used Premium, you can mention the version, but do not go into detail of what you’ve done with the phone: either manipulating it or whatever shows up on the graphical user interface of premium itself.</p>
<p>And when it comes to technical operations and quality management within your organization, please be wary that any document that you put together as a standard operating procedure could be visible by an outside auditor for ISO 17025 or other people that could do a Freedom of Information Act request in your agency in whichever laws of your country.</p>
<p>So just be careful with all that. You need to protect this as best as possible. And the other additional factor that you may not be aware of is that failed exploitations on devices — if they’re able to connect to the network — they could phone home and inform the manufacturer that the device is under attack. And with enough knowledge and intelligence, it is possible that the phone manufacturers might find out what we’re doing to achieve this magic. So please do your best to follow all the instructions and make this the best possible procedures [sic] going forward.”</p></blockquote>
