<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="first">Regular physical activity may ease symptoms of depression about as effectively as psychological therapy, according to an updated Cochrane review. When researchers compared exercise with antidepressant medication, they found similar benefits, although the certainty of that evidence was lower.</p><div id="text">
<p>Depression remains a major global health challenge, affecting more than 280 million people worldwide and contributing significantly to disability. Exercise stands out as a low cost and widely accessible option that also improves physical health, making it appealing to both patients and healthcare professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Cochrane Review</strong></p>
<p>The analysis was led by researchers at the University of Lancashire and drew on data from 73 randomized controlled trials involving nearly 5,000 adults diagnosed with depression. These studies examined how exercise compared with no treatment or control conditions, as well as with psychological therapies and antidepressant drugs.</p>
<p>Overall, the findings showed that exercise led to moderate reductions in depressive symptoms compared with no treatment. When measured against psychological therapy, exercise produced similar improvements, based on moderate certainty evidence from ten trials. Comparisons with antidepressant medication also suggested comparable effects, but the supporting evidence was limited and considered low certainty. Few studies tracked participants after treatment ended, leaving the long-term impact unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Safety and Side Effects</strong></p>
<p>Reported side effects were uncommon. People in exercise programs occasionally experienced muscle or joint injuries, while those taking antidepressants reported typical medication-related issues such as fatigue and gastrointestinal problems.</p>


<p>"Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression," said Professor Andrew Clegg, lead author of the review. "This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important."</p>
<p><strong>What Kind of Exercise Works Best</strong></p>
<p>The review found that light to moderate intensity activity may be more helpful than vigorous workouts. Greater improvements in depressive symptoms were linked to completing between 13 and 36 exercise sessions.</p>
<p>No single form of exercise clearly outperformed others. However, programs that combined different types of activity and resistance training appeared more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Some activities, including yoga, qigong and stretching, were not evaluated in this analysis and remain areas for future study. As with other findings, long-term benefits are still uncertain due to limited follow-up.</p>
<p><strong>Why Conclusions Remain Cautious</strong></p>
<p>This update added 35 new trials to earlier versions of the review published in 2008 and 2013. Even with the expanded evidence base, the main conclusions changed little. Many of the included studies were small, often involving fewer than 100 participants, which makes it harder to draw firm conclusions.</p>
<p>"Although we've added more trials in this update, the findings are similar," said Professor Clegg. "Exercise can help people with depression, but if we want to find which types work best, for who and whether the benefits last over time, we still need larger, high-quality studies. One large, well-conducted trial is much better than numerous poor quality small trials with limited numbers of participants in each."</p></div></div>]]></description>

			Thanks for the suggestion, wish I'd seen it earlier. Clearing Play Store and Services cache/data didn't help, it wouldn't allow the store to even check for updates. Install location I was able to set to 1, though it was auto. After reboots, disabling GMS and Play Store spoofing in PI, I was able to at least check for updates again. Even if I disable all settings in PI, still says not enough room, there must be a setting there I'm forgetting? FWIW, I can't even get play store to update from within the About tab in Store. I don't know what I did here haha.

Again (see previous response above) which <i>PI spoofing</i> you use?<p>

PI Fork or PI Fix Inject or something else?</p></div>

Ok, still you can check PI Attesting directly in PlayStore. Go to Settings, General, About and keep tapping to the Playstore version until you become a developer<p>

Then go a step back, into that new Developer Options and run Check Integrity there</p><p>

You should pass PI Attest but for the Brand, Device, Model, PlayStore must properly show your actual values, not the spoofed values</p><p>

Also, check in your custom.pif.prop, your spoof settings should be<br>
<code>spoofBuild=1
spoofProps=1
spoofProvider=0
spoofVendingSdk=0
spoofVendingFinger=0</code></p><p>

and in target txt you must have (among others - depending which apps you use):<br>
<code>com.android.vending
com.google.android.gms</code></p></div>

Ok, within the play store integrity, this checks out. It passes and shows my actual values. <p>

My custom.pif.prop had so of those but also spoofSignature=1</p><p>

			Thanks for the suggestion, wish I'd seen it earlier. Clearing Play Store and Services cache/data didn't help, it wouldn't allow the store to even check for updates. Install location I was able to set to 1, though it was auto. After reboots, disabling GMS and Play Store spoofing in PI, I was able to at least check for updates again. Even if I disable all settings in PI, still says not enough room, there must be a setting there I'm forgetting? FWIW, I can't even get play store to update from within the About tab in Store. I don't know what I did here haha.

Fix the Pending Update Loop with ADB<br>

You also might need to address the PI and Device Spoofing issue. Make sure that you haven't enabled Force Basic Attestation with a fingerprint from a device with very little storage because you’ve been messing with PI modules and now the Store thinks it’s living on a 2012 toaster with 8GB of storage.<p>

Check <code>/data/adb/modules/</code> for any folder related to PI or spoofing.</p><div dir="ltr">
		<pre dir="ltr" data-xf-init="code-block" data-lang=""><code>adb shell getprop | grep -E "model|product|fingerprint"</code></pre>
	</div>If these values don't jive with your actual phone, your spoofing module is still active even if disabled in the app.<p>

Since your About tab won't update, the bin might be corrupted. Sideloading a fresh version sometimes fixes the installation directory permissions and remember to reboot in between any changes that you make. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p></div>

I had the nohello module active for reasons. Once I disabled it, the store works again.

I mean if they could find a reason to do it then they would. People may have wild conspiracy theories but that's very reasonable, given that I said a while ago that the head of our political system was the minister of public security aka the police.</div>

I’d see some weird API error notification, login to my SendGrid account, check everything is working properly, and then delete the email. I didn’t pay too close attention to them until I saw a couple very strange ones. </p><p>Today, I received this one implying SendGrid was going to be adding a “Support ICE” button to all emails sent through their platform:</p></div><figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="939" height="1024" src="https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM-939x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM-939x1024.png 939w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM-275x300.png 275w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM-768x837.png 768w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM-1409x1536.png 1409w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM.png 1730w" sizes="(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px"></figure><p><br>If you’ve been paying any attention at all to US politics, you’ll know how insidiuously provocative this would be if it were a real email.</p><p>But it isn’t. It’s a phishing email. If you use SendGrid, or have ever used it, you might be getting these too.</p><p>This phishing campaign is a fascinating example of how sophisticated  social engineering has become. Instead of Nigerian 419 scams, hackers have evolved to carefully craft messages sent to professionals that are designed to exploit the American political consciousness.</p><p>The opt-out buttons are the trap.</p><h2>The Attack</h2><p>Here’s how it works: hackers compromise SendGrid customer accounts (through credential stuffing, password reuse, the usual methods). Once they have access, they can send emails <em>through SendGrid’s infrastructure</em>, which means the emails pass all the standard authentication checks (SPF, DKIM) that your spam filter uses to determine legitimacy. The emails look real because, technically, they are real SendGrid emails sent via SendGrid’s platform and via a customer’s reputation –&nbsp;they’re just sent by the wrong people and wrong domains.</p><p>They’re likely using a list of SendGrid customers so they can target this to only people who have used the service before.</p><p>Security researchers at Netcraft dubbed this “<a href="https://www.netcraft.com/blog/popular-email-platform-used-to-impersonate-itself">Phishception</a>” back in 2024: attackers using SendGrid to phish SendGrid users, creating a self-perpetuating cycle where each compromised account can be used to compromise more accounts.</p><p>This has been going on for <em>years</em>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/sendgrid-under-siege-from-hacked-accounts/">Brian Krebs wrote about it in 2020</a>. And yet here we are.</p><h2>The Lures</h2><p>What’s changed, or at least what I’ve noticed recently, is the political sophistication of the bait.

They’re all legitimate businesses whose SendGrid accounts have been compromised. When these emails hit your inbox, they pass authentication because they really were sent through SendGrid, just not <strong><em>by</em></strong> SendGrid.</p><h2>Who’s Behind This?</h2><p>The political sophistication on display here (BLM, LGBTQ+ rights, ICE, even the Spanish language switch playing on immigration anxieties) suggests someone with a deep understanding of American cultural fault lines.</p><p>We know that state actors have invested heavily in understanding and exploiting these divisions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_measures">Russian active measures</a> campaigns have been documented doing exactly this kind of work: identifying wedge issues and creating content designed to inflame both sides. North Korea has demonstrated similar sophistication in their social engineering operations by <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jun/01/2003234055/-1/-1/0/JOINT_CSA_DPRK_SOCIAL_ENGINEERING.PDF">targeting academics and foreign policy experts</a>.</p><p>I’m not saying this is a state actor necessarily – the economic value of exploiting SendGrid’s formidable email infrastructure is most likely the appeal here. Similarly, this could just as easily be a domestic operation run by someone who’s extremely online and knows which culture war buttons to push. But I think the skill set required (technical ability to compromise accounts at scale <em>plus</em> cultural fluency in American politics) is notable.</p><h2>Can This Be Fixed?</h2><p>Honestly? I don’t know.</p><p>SendGrid has known about this problem for years. Twilio (SendGrid’s parent company) has talked about requiring two-factor authentication for all customers, but implementation has been slow. The fundamental issue is that SendGrid’s business model depends on making it easy for legitimate businesses to send email at scale. Anything that adds friction for good actors also adds friction for bad actors, but the bad actors are more motivated to work around it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the attackers only need one thing: access to SendGrid customer accounts. As long as people reuse passwords and don’t enable 2FA, there will be a steady supply of compromised accounts. It’s a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_effect">a hydra problem</a>: cut off one head, another grows behind it.</p><h2>Protecting Yourself</h2><p>If you’re a SendGrid customer: enable two-factor authentication immediately. Use a unique password. Check your account for unauthorized API keys or sender identities.</p><p>If you’re just receiving these emails: don’t click anything. The links go to fake SendGrid login pages that will steal your credentials in real-time as they actually validate your password against SendGrid’s API and even capture your 2FA codes.<br></p><h2>A Filter Hack</h2><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="978" height="1024" src="https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-978x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-978x1024.png 978w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-287x300.png 287w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-768x804.png 768w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-1468x1536.png 1468w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image.png 1806w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px"></figure><p><strong>For Gmail users</strong>, you can create a filter to automatically delete SendGrid impersonation emails that don’t come from legitimate SendGrid domains:</p><ol><li>Go to Settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses → Create new filter</li><li>In the “From” field, enter: <code>-from:sendgrid.com -from:twilio.com</code></li><li>In the “Has the words” field, enter: <code>sendgrid</code></li><li>Click “Create filter” and select “Delete it”</li></ol><p>This will catch emails that mention SendGrid but aren’t actually from SendGrid. It’s not perfect, but it helps.</p><h2>Have You Gotten These?</h2><p>I’m curious what other variations are out there. If you’ve received SendGrid phishing emails (especially weird or politically-charged ones) leave a comment or reach out. The more examples we document, the easier it is for people to recognize these when they land in their inbox.</p><p>And if you work at Twilio/SendGrid and want to explain what’s being done about this: I’m all ears.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tombedor.dev/mcp-is-a-fad/">https://tombedor.dev/mcp-is-a-fad/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46552254">Hacker News</a></p>

<p>MCP has taken off as the standardized platform for AI integrations, and it's difficult to justify <em>not</em> supporting it. However, this popularity will be short-lived.</p>
<p>Some of this popularity stems from misconceptions about what MCP uniquely accomplishes, but the majority is due to the fact that it's <em>very easy</em> to add an MCP server. For a brief period, it seemed like adding an MCP server was a nice avenue for getting attention to your project, which is why so many projects have added support.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-mcp">What is MCP?<a href="#what-is-mcp" aria-label="Direct link to What is MCP?" title="Direct link to What is MCP?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>MCP claims to solve the "NxM problem": with N agents and M toolsets, users would otherwise need many bespoke connectors.</p>
<h3 id="the-nxm-problem">The NxM problem<a href="#the-nxm-problem" aria-label="Direct link to The NxM problem" title="Direct link to The NxM problem" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>A common misconception is that MCP is <em>required</em> for function calling. It's not. With tool-calling models, a list of available tools is provided to the LLM with each request. If the LLM wants to call a tool, it returns JSON-formatted parameters:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="function_calling_no_mcp" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/function_calling_no_mcp-3f3ed851f1398f52c8cb7d71d853261f.png" width="3499" height="749"></p>
<p>The application is responsible for providing tool schemas, parsing parameters, and executing calls. The problem arises when users want to reuse toolsets across different agents, since each has slightly different APIs.</p>
<p>For example, tools are exposed to <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling?example=meeting#rest_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini's API</a> via <code>functionDeclarations</code> nested inside a <code>tools</code> array:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \</span><br></span><span><span>  -d '{</span><br></span><span><span>    "contents": [...],</span><br></span><span><span>    "tools": [</span><br></span><span><span>      {</span><br></span><span><span>        "functionDeclarations": [</span><br></span><span><span>          {</span><br></span><span><span>            "name": "set_meeting",</span><br></span><span><span>            "description": "...",</span><br></span><span><span>...</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?lang=curl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI's API</a>, tool schemas use a flat <code>tools</code> array with <code>type: "function"</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>curl -X POST https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \</span><br></span><span><span>  -d '{</span><br></span><span><span>    "model": "gpt-4o",</span><br></span><span><span>    "input": [...],</span><br></span><span><span>    "tools": [</span><br></span><span><span>      {</span><br></span><span><span>        "type": "function",</span><br></span><span><span>        "name": "get_weather",</span><br></span><span><span>...</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is the "NxM" problem. In theory, users must build N × M connectors. In practice, the differences are minor (same semantics, slightly different JSON shape), and frameworks like <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/function_calling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LangChain</a>, <a href="https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/completion/function_call" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiteLLM</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmolAgents</a> already abstract them away. Crucially, these options <em>execute tool calls in the same runtime as the agent</em>.</p>
<h3 id="how-mcp-addresses-it">How MCP addresses it<a href="#how-mcp-addresses-it" aria-label="Direct link to How MCP addresses it" title="Direct link to How MCP addresses it" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>MCP handles exposing and invoking tools via separate processes:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="function_calling_mcp" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/function_calling_mcp-7ddac7e9d3439168d21fdd812a16c8b6.png" width="3633" height="1163"></p>
<p>A JSON configuration controls which MCP servers to start. Each server runs in its own long-lived process, handling tool invocations independently. The application still orchestrates the agent loop and presents results to users.</p>
<p>This abstracts away schema generation and invocation, but at a cost. Tool logic runs in a separate process, making resource management opaque. The application loses control over tool instructions, logging, and error handling. And every tool call crosses a process boundary.</p>
<h3 id="scope-tools-dominate">Scope: tools dominate<a href="#scope-tools-dominate" aria-label="Direct link to Scope: tools dominate" title="Direct link to Scope: tools dominate" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>MCP also defines primitives for prompts and resources, but adoption of these is much smaller than tools<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-e0bb36" id="user-content-fnref-1-e0bb36" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="code_references" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/code_references-4bea4400fa382dec1d99d50df013aa6b.png" width="919" height="908"></p>
<p>Given this, the rest of this post focuses on tool calling, which is MCP's primary use case in practice.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems<a href="#problems" aria-label="Direct link to Problems" title="Direct link to Problems" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The convenience of MCP comes with a price, stemming from two architectural attributes of an MCP-driven application:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="issues" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/issues-aacc03230cf0cf8fc4fc94f2ba3c5876.png" width="1851" height="971"></p>
<p>Since tools are drawn from arbitrary sources, they are not aware of what other tools are available to the agent. Their instructions can't account for the rest of the toolbox.</p>
<p>The second issue stems from different toolsets having their own runtimes. This introduces a variety of problems I'll discuss below.</p>
<h3 id="incoherent-toolbox">Incoherent toolbox<a href="#incoherent-toolbox" aria-label="Direct link to Incoherent toolbox" title="Direct link to Incoherent toolbox" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/tool-space-interference-an-emerging-problem-for-llm-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agents tend to be less effective at tool use as the number of tools grows</a>. With a well-organized, coherent toolset, agents do well. With a larger, disorganized toolset, they struggle. <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI recommends keeping tools well below 20</a>, yet many MCP servers exceed this threshold.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Consider a workflow in which an agent should send a notification after doing work:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="confusion" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/confusion-00fa7e3d04a2eae3855e414829b16e58.png" width="2005" height="1001"></p>
<p>A tool's fit for a task depends not just on the job at hand, but also on what else is in the toolbox. Pliers can pull a nail, but if a hammer is available it's probably the better choice. When tools ship in isolation, their instructions can't say "use me only when you don't have a hammer," so agents don't get cohesive guidance.</p>
<p>If the toolset is controlled by the same authors as the application, they can add prompting to the toolsets to disambiguate when to use which tool. If not, the problem must be solved by system prompts or user guidance.</p>
<p>Looking through #mcp channels of open source coding agents, you'll invariably find users who struggle to get the agent to use the tools in the way they want<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-e0bb36" id="user-content-fnref-2-e0bb36" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>:</p>

<p>Or, users complaining of how many tokens are burned by tool instructions:</p>

<p>Each MCP server <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/lifecycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starts a separate process</a> that survives for the length of the agent session.</p>
<p>Even in the healthy state, this introduces a collection of processes that remain mostly idle, aside from serving occasional requests from an agent. In an error state, we get all the usual headaches: dangling subprocesses, memory leaks, resource contention.</p>
<p>Users have these issues, if they are able to get the servers running at all: in support channels, the most common complaint is difficulty getting the servers to run:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="connection_problems" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/connection_problem-7c5e6ede95ca4d7790b0caa5dd27d976.png" width="3196" height="668"></p>
<p>MCP offers no way for servers to declare their runtime/dependency needs. Some authors work around it by baking installation into the launch command (e.g., <code>uv run some_tool mcp</code>), which only succeeds if the user already has the right tooling installed.</p>
<p>Even if the relevant package is there, the MCP server might not start it successfully. MCP servers only inherit <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/legacy/tools/debugging#environment-variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a subset of parent ENV variables</a> (<code>USER</code>, <code>HOME</code>, and <code>PATH</code>). This is particularly problematic for <code>nvm</code> or users leveraging virtual environments.</p>
<p>Python or Node developers might be comfortable debugging environment issues, (although MCP's subprocess orchestration makes this more difficult), but are likely less comfortable debugging Node issues <em>and</em> Python <em>and</em> other runtimes. MCP seems to assert that I as the user should not really care which of these are used, or how many.</p>
<p>Even if toolsets are in one given runtime, MCP potentially spins up many instances of it, obviating efficiencies from caching, connection pooling, and shared in-memory state. MCP's HTTP transport mode doesn't help; it's just another HTTP API, but with MCP's protocol overhead instead of battle-tested REST/OpenAPI patterns.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security<a href="#security" aria-label="Direct link to Security" title="Direct link to Security" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>MCP pushes users to install servers from npm, pip, or GitHub. This inherits the usual supply-chain risk, but without even the minimal guardrails those ecosystems provide. There's no central publisher or signing; anyone can ship a daemon that runs on your machine and MCP offers no provenance check.</p>
<p>MCP's specification <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/mcp-security-network-exposed-servers-are-backdoors-to-your-private-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doesn't mandate authentication</a>, leaving security decisions to individual server authors. The result: <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/2000-mcp-servers-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one scan found 492 MCP servers</a> running without any client authentication or traffic encryption. Even Anthropic's own Filesystem MCP Server had a sandbox escape via directory traversal (<a href="https://strobes.co/blog/mcp-model-context-protocol-and-its-critical-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2025-53110</a>).</p>

<p>Unlike a human carefully clicking through an API, agents can be manipulated via prompt injection to call tools in unintended ways. The <a href="https://www.generalanalysis.com/blog/supabase-mcp-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supabase MCP leak</a> demonstrated this "lethal trifecta": prompt injection → tool call → data exfiltration, extracting entire SQL databases including OAuth tokens. Again, this risk isn't unique to MCP. But the best mitigations are existing security infrastructure: scoped OAuth tokens, service identities with minimal permissions, and audit logging. MCP sidesteps this infrastructure rather than building on it.</p>
<p>A common defense is that MCP isolates credentials—the agent talks to a socket, never seeing your API tokens. But this threat model is narrow: an agent that can invoke <code>mcp.github.delete_repo()</code> doesn't need your token to cause damage. You're not eliminating trust; you're redirecting it to third-party code that, as the CVEs demonstrate, is often unaudited and vulnerable.</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-benefit-doesnt-add-up">The cost-benefit doesn't add up<a href="#the-cost-benefit-doesnt-add-up" aria-label="Direct link to The cost-benefit doesn't add up" title="Direct link to The cost-benefit doesn't add up" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>These problems could be worth the cost, if we were to gain significantly. But comparing tool calling with MCP to tool calling without it, MCP handles remarkably little. MCP is, more or less, handling serializing function call schemas and responses.</p>
<p>The tools developers are saving themselves from having to write are, overwhelmingly, <a href="https://mcp.alphavantage.co/?utm_source=mcp.so&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=202508&amp;utm_id=000001&amp;utm_term=web_project&amp;utm_content=v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relatively thin wrappers around API clients</a>, or <a href="https://mcp.so/server/time/modelcontextprotocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">utility scripts</a>. In the former case, users must still obtain API keys, billing accounts, and so on.</p>
<p>This code <em>was</em> a hassle to write, prior to the advent of coding agents. But these small utility scripts are the precise thing that coding agents excel most at! A technical user of MCP tools will be hard-pressed to find a tool an agent could not one-shot in the programming language they are most comfortable in.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-took-off">Why it took off<a href="#why-it-took-off" aria-label="Direct link to Why it took off" title="Direct link to Why it took off" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>With these issues, it's fair to wonder why MCP has gained the popularity it has. It has had lots of support from Anthropic, and no trouble gaining traction with toolset publishers, agent providers, and enterprises. Why? It helps narratives:</p>

<p>It's quite easy to publish an MCP server. The lack of startup requirements means you don't even need to publish to <code>npm</code> or <code>pip</code>: you can drop an <code>@mcp.server</code> annotation in your repo and host a small manifest JSON that points to your entry command (e.g., <code>node server.js</code>) and lists the tools.</p>
<p>This provides a nice narrative to gain attention to AI projects: A user can, in theory, easily add some MCP tools from a project, gain value, and follow interest in learning more about the project. Support overhead will, in the main, fall to agent maintainers.</p>
<p>Once publishers started appearing, it became difficult to justify <em>not</em> supporting MCP. Your project could be perceived as being against open standards.</p>
<h3 id="enterprise-ai-credibility">Enterprise: AI credibility<a href="#enterprise-ai-credibility" aria-label="Direct link to Enterprise: AI credibility" title="Direct link to Enterprise: AI credibility" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Over the last few years, anyone watching San Francisco billboards has witnessed enterprise tools rebranding toward AI. MCP support provided an easy way to make your e.g. project management tool be AI. The branding of MCP as an "open standard" increased pressure to adopt - lack of MCP support could signal a lack of willingness to adopt open standards.</p>
<h3 id="anthropic-open-source-credibility">Anthropic: Open source credibility<a href="#anthropic-open-source-credibility" aria-label="Direct link to Anthropic: Open source credibility" title="Direct link to Anthropic: Open source credibility" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>MCP's status as <em>the</em> open standard for AI and the enterprise adoption greatly benefited Anthropic. The big fear of investors is that enterprise adoption doesn't persist - adoption of Anthropic's open standard helped this.</p>

<p>There are a few different possible users who interact with MCP:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="users" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/users-e233d38824dd614cca76cbe6a8e983f0.png" width="1077" height="722"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Technical end users</em> want to create tools and share them between different agents they might want to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Non-technical end users</em> want to use different tools while using agents. Note that this user group for MCP is, at present, largely theoretical. Exposing toolsets to MCP involves editing JSON, making it out of reach for non-technical users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Internal app devs</em> run production AI applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Agent devs</em> create agents for external users. They wish to enable their end users to swap in whatever toolsets they like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tool authors</em> create toolsets they wish to expose to users. MCP provides a way to easily share their work to users of different agents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the supposed beneficiaries are overwhelmingly technical. The "app store for AI" vision that would serve non-technical users remains unfulfilled.</p>
<p>For each user type, there's a simpler approach that avoids MCP's overhead:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>User Type</th><th>MCP Promise</th><th>Better Alternative</th><th>Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Technical end users</strong></td><td>Share tools between agents</td><td>Local scripts + command runner</td><td>AI can one-shot these scripts; works with any agent via shell; exposes tools to humans too</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Non-technical end users</strong></td><td>Easy tool installation</td><td><em>(MCP doesn't deliver)</em></td><td>MCP requires JSON editing—this group remains underserved regardless</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Internal app devs</strong></td><td>Standard tool interface</td><td>1st party tools</td><td>Same codebase, existing auth/logging/tracing, no process overhead, coherent toolbox</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Agent devs</strong></td><td>Let users swap toolsets</td><td>SDK abstraction (LangChain, LiteLLM)</td><td>Handles model API differences without separate processes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tool authors</strong></td><td>Distribute to all agents</td><td>OpenAPI specs or libraries</td><td>Existing distribution (npm, pip), decades of tooling, no new protocol</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3 id="local-scripts-with-command-runner">Local scripts with command runner<a href="#local-scripts-with-command-runner" aria-label="Direct link to Local scripts with command runner" title="Direct link to Local scripts with command runner" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>For a technical user, letting an agent invoke scripts directly is very difficult to beat. Useful 50-100 line scripts are <em>extremely</em> easy to write with AI coding agents. Care needs to be taken to filter output - raw build scripts can stream verbose logs into agent context, eating up tokens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="just" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/just-c9e8594a50331d5b095b35a059dae448.png" width="1352" height="1171"></p>
<p>Robust security against agent actions going haywire can be achieved via command runners like <a href="https://github.com/casey/just" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make</a>. These tools provide everything that MCP does - command specifications, descriptions, arguments. Agents allow you to specify what command prefixes can be invoked without approval - put your agent commands in a <code>justfile</code>, and only auto-allow shell commands prefixed with <code>just</code>.</p>
<p>This approach also exposes tools to humans, and is a nice approach for improving dev environments for humans and AI agents at the same time. (See <a href="https://tombedor.dev/make-it-easy-for-humans/">Make It Easy for Humans First, Then AI</a> for more on this).</p>
<h3 id="1st-party-tools">1st party tools<a href="#1st-party-tools" aria-label="Direct link to 1st party tools" title="Direct link to 1st party tools" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>For a self contained application, there is little reason to separate tool codebases from the codebase for the rest of the application. Tools can be dynamically exposed to the agent based on application context.</p>
<p>In a first party context, any code that devs wish to reuse can be exposed as libraries, just like any other code they wish to share. An AI tool is really nothing more than a function, and the fact that it's invoked by AI does not warrant special handling.</p>
<p>An enterprise context should have robust infrastructure for authenticating, authorizing, provisioning service identities, and tracing call chains for service to service calls. That some of these calls are now <em>AI</em> service to service calls does not warrant a rebuilt security posture.</p>
<h3 id="openapi--rest">OpenAPI / REST<a href="#openapi--rest" aria-label="Direct link to OpenAPI / REST" title="Direct link to OpenAPI / REST" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>OpenAPI specs are already self-describing enough for agents—they include operation descriptions, parameter schemas, examples, and enums. LLMs understand them well; GPT Actions are literally OpenAPI specs. The glue needed between an OpenAPI endpoint and an agent (output filtering, context, auth) is the same glue MCP requires. MCP doesn't provide meaningfully better tool descriptions; it just reinvents a schema format that already exists, without the decades of tooling, validation, and battle-testing.</p>
<h2 id="a-prediction">A prediction<a href="#a-prediction" aria-label="Direct link to A prediction" title="Direct link to A prediction" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>MCP's popularity will be relatively short-lived. The cost benefit does not add up, and there are readily available alternatives. The introduction of <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Skills</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/openai-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI's quick adoption</a> signal that even model providers agree.</p>
<p>Claude Skills is an incremental improvement over MCP, but is similarly overengineered. Longstanding tools and techniques for collaboration amongst human devs remain compelling, and these options will chip away at more AI-centric techniques which reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>It seems to have been advertised as a world-changing advancement. Was it just oversold? Was it another JVM applet scenario, doomed to fail?</p>
<p>I’d like to tackle this in a weirdly roundabout way because I think these sorts of questions make a few misplaced assumptions that are critical to clarify.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-real-world">In The Real World</h2>
<p>Of course, WebAssembly <strong>does</strong> see real-world usage. Let’s list some examples!</p>
<ul>
<li>Godot uses WebAssembly to <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_web.html">build games for the web</a>.</li>
<li>Squoosh.app uses WebAssembly to <a href="https://web.dev/blog/squoosh-v2#new_codecs_support">make use of image libraries</a>.</li>
<li>Zellij uses WebAssembly for its <a href="https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins#plugins">plugin ecosystem</a>.</li>
<li>Figma uses WebAssembly to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/">convert their C++ code</a> to something usable in a browser</li>
<li>Stackblitz uses WebAssembly for <a href="https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/introducing-webcontainers/">their web containers</a>.</li>
<li>Ruffle uses WebAssembly to run <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">a flash emulator</a> in your browser</li>
</ul>
<p>For many of these, WebAssembly is critical to either their entire product or a major feature.</p>
<p>But I think this alone is not very convincing. We don’t yet see major websites entirely built with <a href="https://github.com/yewstack/yew">webassembly-based frameworks</a>. We’re not building our applications directly to WebAssembly for maximum portability. But why not?</p>
<p>To answer this, we need a good mental model for what WebAssembly is. This will help us qualify where it is most impactful and the limitations we’re up against.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-webassembly">What Is WebAssembly</h2>
<p>In a word, WebAssembly is a language.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-speed">A Note On Speed</h2>
<p>This makes questions like “how fast is WebAssembly” a bit hard to answer. You don’t ask how fast algebraic notation is—it’s not a very sensible question.</p>
<p>Taken in the context of something like JavaScript, the language is only as fast as the engine running it. JavaScript the language has no speed, but you can benchmark JS engines like V8, SpiderMonkey, and JavaScriptCore. You can benchmark the IO libraries of JS runtimes like Bun, Deno, and Node.</p>
<p>What people actually mean is “how useful are the constructs of this language to efficient mappings of modern hardware” and “what is the current landscape of systems taking advantage of these constructs”.</p>
<p>Through clever-enough engineering, you can make any system sufficiently fast with some trade-offs. If compiling your code directly to C doesn’t bother you, getting “near native” speeds is possible in both <a href="https://hermesengine.dev/">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/blob/main/Wasm2c/README.md">WebAssembly</a>.</p>
<p>That’s right, you can compile WebAssembly! You can also choose to interpret it directly—that’ll be up to your runtime, just like every other system.</p>
<p>So let’s ask the actual question of WebAssembly: how useful are the constructs of this language to efficient mappings of modern hardware? Turns out, pretty useful!</p>
<h2 id="an-efficient-mapping">An Efficient Mapping</h2>
<p>WebAssembly is a pretty close approximation of an assembly language. Not too close, mind you. It’s higher level than that. But it’s close enough to cleanly compile to most assembly languages without a significant speed trade-off.</p>
<p>And yes, you can write WebAssembly by hand! I made a rustlings-esque course called <a href="https://github.com/EmNudge/watlings/">watlings</a> where you can hand-write WAT to solve some basic exercises.</p>
<p>WAT is a very close approximation to Wasm. It is <strong>almost</strong> 1:1 in that you can compile WAT to Wasm and then back to WAT with barely any loss in information (you may lose variable names and some metadata). It looks like this:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="clojure"><code><div><p><span>(</span><span>module</span></p></div><div><p><span>  </span><span>;; import external i32, name it $global_num_import</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>(</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>"env"</span><span> </span><span>"global_num"</span><span> (</span><span>global</span><span> $global_num_import i32))</span></p></div><div><p><span>  </span><span>;; A function that adds param $a to $global_num_import, returns i32</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span> $add_to_global_num (</span><span>param</span><span> $a i32) (</span><span>result</span><span> i32)</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>;; The last stack value is the return value</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>(</span><span>i32.add</span><span> (</span><span>local.get</span><span> $a) (</span><span>global.get</span><span> $global_num_import))</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>)</span></p></div><div><p><span>  </span><span>;; export local function, name it add_to_global</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>(</span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>"add_to_global"</span><span> (</span><span>func</span><span> $add_to_global_num))</span></p></div><div><p><span>)</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Try reading the code. It will feel both familiar and foreign.</p>
<p>We have functions and S-expressions. We have imports and exports. But we also have instructions like <code>i32.add</code> and implicit stack returns.</p>
<p>Wasm is a bytecode perhaps best compared to <em>JVMIS</em> (i.e. JVM bytecode). They have similar goals and constraints, but different landscapes and guarantees.</p>
<p>Compared to JVM bytecode, Wasm has a significantly smaller API and stronger safety guarantees. It has fewer opinions on your memory management strategy and more limitations on what your program can do without permission from its host environment.</p>
<p>It can crunch numbers, but must be explicitly provided its memory and all imports. In this way, it is much different from an actual assembly language (or, a more widely used one).</p>
<p>We’ll wrap back around to this later.</p>
<h2 id="a-compilation-target">A compilation target</h2>
<p>You can compile many languages to Wasm.</p>
<p>Notable among them are Rust, C, Zig, Go, Kotlin, Java, and C#. Commonly interpreted languages have even had their runtimes compiled to WebAssembly, such as Python, PHP, and Ruby. There are also many languages that solely compile to WebAssembly, such as <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a>, <a href="https://grain-lang.org/">Grain</a>, and <a href="https://www.moonbitlang.com/">MoonBit</a>.</p>
<p>For many of these, it is important not to require a garbage-collector. For others, it would be helpful to include one. Wasm allows for both (with the GC option being much more recent).</p>
<p>Your browser includes a Wasm “engine”, making this doubly an attractive compilation target. This means without much setup, your phone and laptop can run Wasm programs already.</p>
<p>Like how JVM can have many implementations of its runner, there are many implementations that run independently of your browser such as <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/Wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge">WasmEdge</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Wasmerio/Wasmer">Wasmer</a>.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="bash"><code><div><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>Wasmer</span><span> </span><span>run</span><span> </span><span>cowsay</span><span> </span><span>"I am cow"</span></p></div><div><p><span> </span><span>__________</span></p></div><div><p><span>&lt;</span><span> I am cow </span><span>&gt;</span></p></div><div><p><span> </span><span>----------</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>\</span><span>   </span><span>^__^</span></p></div><div><p><span>         </span><span>\</span><span>  (oo)</span><span>\_</span><span>______</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>            </span></span><span>(</span><span>__</span><span>)</span><span>\</span><span>       )</span><span>\/\</span></p></div><div><p><span>               </span><span>||</span><span>----w</span><span> </span><span>|</span></p></div><div><p><span>                </span><span>||</span><span>     </span><span>||</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>These languages can output a single artifact without being too specific to your computer’s hardware. You only need a Wasm runner to execute it (note more JVM analogies).</p>
<h2 id="security-and-what-it-enables">Security and what it enables</h2>
<p>Right now, Wasm is looking really similar to JVM. The main differences seem to be around memory management strategies and how many platforms support it.</p>
<p>The security story is what really starts to drive in the wedge.</p>
<p>WebAssembly maintains a minimal attack surface by treating all external interactions as explicit, host-defined imports. We went over this earlier. Its “deny-by-default” architecture, small instruction set, hidden control-flow stack (i.e. no raw pointers), and linear memory combine to create a <strong>very strong</strong> security story.</p>
<p>It is such that you can ensure process-like isolation within a single process. Cloudflare takes advantage of this aspect within V8 to run untrusted code very efficiently <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/mitigating-spectre-and-other-security-threats-the-cloudflare-workers-security-model/">using V8 isolates</a>. This means significant efficiency gains without significant security trade-offs.</p>
<p>Wasm programs can start 100x faster if you can avoid spinning up a separate process. Fermyon, a company in the Wasm hosting space, advertises <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/serverless-guide/speed-and-execution-time">sub-millisecond spinup times</a>.</p>
<p>In these cases, the performance is a direct result of what the security guarantees enable.</p>
<p>In other cases, security can unlock feature support.</p>
<p>Flash is a multimedia platform that was primarily used for animations and games up until it was dropped from all major browsers in January of 2021 (primarily) due to security concerns. <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">Ruffle</a> has revived Flash experiences on sites like <a href="https://www.notion.so/What-Happened-To-WebAssembly-aa6295c947a24fc48de2a31378ced53b?pvs=21">Newgrounds</a> by acting as an interpreter and VM for ActionScript.</p>
<p>Cloudflare allows running Python code with similar security guarantees to its JS code by using <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a>, which is a Wasm build of CPython.</p>
<p>Figma runs untrusted user plugins in your browser by running them in <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/">a QuickJS engine that is compiled to Wasm</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the security allows for extreme embeddability.</p>
<h2 id="portability-and-embeddability">Portability and Embeddability</h2>
<p>We’ve gone over the number of ways you can run Wasm programs. A Wasm runner can be pretty light. Instead of forcing library authors into a specific language (usually Lua or JavaScript), supporting Wasm itself opens the door to a much wider set of choices.</p>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij">Zellij</a>, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/lapce/lapce">Lapce</a> support Wasm for their plugin ecosystem.</p>
<p>In environments where a JavaScript engine is already being used, this means access to programs you would not have been able to run otherwise.</p>
<p>This includes <a href="https://github.com/kleisauke/Wasm-vips">image processing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js">ocr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js">physics engines</a>, <a href="https://skia.org/docs/user/modules/canvaskit/">rendering engines</a>, <a href="https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/">media toolkits</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">databases</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/lib/binding_web/README.md">parsers</a>, among many others.</p>
<p>In a majority of these cases, the use of Wasm will be transparent to you. A library you installed will just be using it somewhere in its dependency tree.</p>
<p>Godot and Figma have codebases written in C++, but are often browser-ready by compiling to (or in combination with) WebAssembly.</p>
<p>It seems the most common use of Wasm is bridging the language gap. Certain ecosystems seem to have suites of tools more common to them. <a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a> would be a much more limited application if it could only choose image compression libraries from NPM.</p>
<h2 id="speed-and-size-revisited">Speed and size revisited</h2>
<p>Browsers run WebAssembly with roughly the same pipeline that runs JavaScript. This seemingly puts a hard limit on the performance of Wasm applications, but they will often be more or less performant due to their architecture or domain.</p>
<p>Using languages with richer type systems and more sophisticated optimizing compilers can produce more efficient programs. The JIT model of engines like V8 might prevent optimizations if the cost of optimizing exceeds the gains from running the optimized code. You might avoid <a href="https://mrale.ph/blog/2015/01/11/whats-up-with-monomorphism.html">megamorphic functions</a> more easily by avoiding JavaScript.</p>
<p>However, there is a cost to crossing the host-program boundary, especially if cloning memory. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31214521">Zaplib’s post-mortem</a> is an interesting read here. Incrementally moving a codebase to Wasm can incur significant costs in boundary crossing, eliminating any benefit in the short term.</p>
<p>A small API surface also means binary bloat as system APIs are more often re-created than imported. There are standards like <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a> which aim to help here. Still, there is no native string type (<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/stringref">yet</a>).</p>
<p>Zig seems to produce the smallest Wasm binaries among mainstream languages.</p>
<p>Practical performance of Wasm in native contexts (i.e. outside of a JS engine) seems to suffer for a variety of reasons. Threading and IO of any sort incurs some cost. Memory usage is larger. Cold start is slower.</p>
<p>Still, the performance trade-offs might not be significant enough to matter. For most uses, I’d wager it’s “fast enough”. If you’re in a performance-sensitive context, the benefits of Wasm are likely not as relevant.</p>
<h2 id="language-development-and-you">Language development and you</h2>
<p>Clearly things are happening.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Wasmio">Wasm IO YouTube channel</a> has lots of talks worth watching.</p>
<p>In fact, standards and language development in Wasm has stirred significant controversy internally. There is a lot of desire for advancement, but standardization means decisions are hard to reverse. For many, things are moving too quickly and in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>There is the “more official” <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/Wasm/">W3C working group</a> and then the “less official” <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance">Bytecode Alliance</a> which works much more quickly and is centered around tooling and language development outside of Wasm directly (e.g. on <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html">WIT</a> and the <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">WebAssembly Component Model</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/features/">Wasm feature proposals</a> are being quickly advanced and adopted by a wide suite of tools. This is remarkable progress for standardization, but is also scary to watch if you fear large missteps.</p>
<p>So why do people think nothing has happened?</p>
<p>I figure most are under the impression that the advancement of this technology would have had a more visible impact on their work. That they would intentionally reach for and use Wasm tools.</p>
<p>Many seem to think there is a path to Wasm replacing JavaScript within the browser—that they might not need to include a <code>.js</code> file at all. This is very unlikely.</p>
<p>However, you can use frameworks like <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos">Leptos</a> without being aware or involved in the produced JS artifacts.</p>
<p>Mostly, Wasm tools have been adopted and used by library authors, not application developers. The internals are opaque. This is fine, probably.</p>
<p>Separately, I think the community is not helped by the philosophy of purposely obfuscating teaching material around Wasm. This is a fight I lost a few times.</p>
<p>For now, maybe check out <a href="https://github.com/EmNudge/watlings">watlings</a>. I’ll expand it at some point, surely.</p>  </article></div>]]></description>

<p>The European Commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/16213-European-Open-Digital-Ecosystems_en">opened</a>
a "<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=intcom%3AAres%282026%2969111">call
for evidence</a>" to help shape its European Open Digital Ecosystem
Strategy. The commission is looking to reduce its dependence on
software from non-EU countries:</p>

<blockquote>
The EU faces a significant problem of dependence on non-EU countries
in the digital sphere. This reduces users' choice, hampers EU
companies' competitiveness and can raise supply chain security issues
as it makes it difficult to control our digital infrastructure (both
physical and software components), potentially creating
vulnerabilities including in critical sectors. In the last few years,
it has been widely acknowledged that open source – which is a public
good to be freely used, modified, and redistributed – has the strong
potential to underpin a diverse portfolio of high-quality and secure
digital solutions that are valid alternatives to proprietary ones. By
doing so, it increases user agency, helps regain control and boost the
resilience of our digital infrastructure.
</blockquote>

<p>The feedback period runs until midnight (Brussels time)
February&nbsp;3, 2026. The commission seeks input from all interested
stakeholders, "<q>in particular the European open-source community
(including individual contributors, open-source companies and
foundations), public administrations, specialised business sectors,
the ICT industry, academia and research institutions</q>".</p><br clear="all"><hr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hey everyone,
​I’ve been reading the text of the "NO FAKES Act" currently in Congress, and it’s worse than I thought.
​The Tldr: It creates a "digital replica right" for voices/likenesses. That sounds fine for stopping deepfake porn, but the liability language is a trap. It targets anyone who "makes available" a tool that is primarily used for replicas.<br>
​The Problem: If you release a TTS model or a voice-conversion RVC model on HuggingFace, and someone else uses it to fake a celebrity, you (the dev) can be liable for statutory damages ($5k-$25k per violation).
​There is no Section 230 protection here. This effectively makes hosting open weights for audio models a legal s*icide mission unless you are OpenAI or Google.</p>

<p>What I did:
I contacted my reps email to flag this as an "innovation killer." If you run a repo or care about open weights, you might want to do the same. We need them to add a "Safe Harbor" for tool devs.</p>

<p>S.1367 - 119th Congress (2025-2026): NO FAKES Act of 2025 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress <a href="https://share.google/u6dpy7ZQDvZWUrlfc">https://share.google/u6dpy7ZQDvZWUrlfc</a></p>

<p>UPDATE: ACTION ITEMS (How to actually stop this)
​If you don't want to go to jail for hosting a repo, you need to make noise now.
​1. The "Lazy" Email (Takes 30 seconds):
Go to Democracy.io or your Senator’s contact page.
​Subject: Opposition to NO FAKES Act (H.R. 2794 / S. 1367) - Open Source Liability
​Message: "I am a constituent and software engineer. I oppose the NO FAKES Act unless it includes a specific Safe Harbor for Open Source Code Repositories. The current 'Digital Fingerprinting' requirement (Section 3) is technically impossible for raw model weights to comply with. This bill effectively bans open-source AI hosting in the US and hands a monopoly to Big Tech. Please amend it to protect tool developers."
​2. The "Nuclear" Option (Call them):
​Call the Capitol Switchboard: (202) 224-3121
​Ask for Senators Wyden (D) or Massie (R) if you want to thank them for being tech-literate, or call your own Senator to complain.
​Script: "The NO FAKES Act kills open-source innovation. We need a Safe Harbor for developers who write code, separate from the bad actors who use it."</p>

<div><p>Yes, you can use this with any text file and file extension to send file content to Claude Code with unix-like pipe support.

<div><p>Thank you, and yes! That is what I already frequently do for quick automation tasks.</p><p>As you say, Claude is actually very good at writing shell scripts and using tools on-the-fly.

<div><p>I agree that script execution safety is a real concern, as it is with AI coding tools generally. By default the runnable markdown files do not have permission to execute code, unless you specifically add those permissions.</p><p>I can see there might be valid arguments for enforcing file type associations for execution at the OS level. These are just text files, and Unix-like environments support making text files executable with a shebang as a universal convention.</p><p>I am a fan of that unix-like philosophy generally: tools that try to do a single thing well, can be chained together, and allow users to flexibly create automations using plain text. So I tried to stick with that approach for these scripts.</p><p>I'm a bear of little brain, and prompt engineering makes my head hurt. So part of the motivation was to be able to save prompts and collections of prompts once I've got them working, and then execute on demand. I think the high readability of markdown as scripts is helpful for creating assets that can be saved, shared and re-used, as they are self-documenting.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46556345"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46556345" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46556345&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46549444"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>The ability to execute code is not granted as part of the directory permissions. By default the scripts will not be able to execute code, only run analysis and text gen tasks.

<div><p>At the moment, it looks like Claude Code does not support using ‘temperature’ or ‘seed’ flags.

<div><p>I think I get the idea... but why not officially create a new file type altogether?</p><p>Not only it would avoid any confusion (Markdown wasn't meant to be executable?) but it would allow future extensions in a domain that is moving fast.</p><p>The recent incident (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532075">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532075</a>) regarding Claude Code's changelog shows that pure Markdown can break things if it is consumed raw.</p><p>Also, regarding:
"Detect my OS and architecture, download the right binary from GitHub releases, extract to ~/.local/bin, update my shell config."</p><p>I have a hard time seeing how this is "more auditable" than a shell script with hardcoded URLs/paths.</p><p>"the right binary" is something that would make me reject an issue from a PM, asking for clarifications because it's way too vague.</p><p>But maybe that's why I'll soon get the sack?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46550962"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46550962" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46550962&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46549444"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Another format is an interesting idea. This tool will work with any text file content and file extension. So you could create another text-based format yourself and use it in theory.</p><p>I think the reasons Markdown is appealing include:</p><p>- It's just a text file.</p><p>- LLMs like Claude have high comprehension of the format, so Claude Code does very well with it.</p><p>- You can mix structured and unstructured text, and code with plain language: YAML frontmatter, outline/headings, code blocks, tables, links and images etc.</p><p>I used a heavily condensed version of the example prompt that Pete Koomen posted about as a simplified example, so that's really just me cutting it back to the most simple form of the concept.</p><p>In real-use it would be detailed, verbose and specific, and include the actual code blocks and external shell script references to retrieve and execute. So this really is just a proof of concept to give an idea of the sort of thing that people could create in future.</p><p>I know lots of us developers joke about getting the sack and losing out to AI. But for what it's worth, the sorts of points you raise are exactly why I think skilled developers become even more valuable than ever with AI.</p><p>Programming will change massively this next decade. But it has many times even in my life. So I'm definitely in the camp that thinks this is a new programming abstraction level, and Claude Code and Codex and others are useful tools that improve the productivity of skilled coders. Especially when they are used carefully and thoughtfully.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46554663"><td></td></tr><tr id="46555656"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46555656" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46555656&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46549444"></a></center></td><td><br>

And to Claude Code, Codex themselves.</p><p>claude-run is just a bunch of little convenience scripts, but for it to work effectively with code execution, the handling needs to do a little more than just `cat` the file output, for example stripping shebang lines, supporting flags and permissions and a few other things.

<div><p>My view is that readability and ease of understanding have a real impact on auditability. Nondeterministic output also clearly has a significant impact on auditability.</p><p>The balance between readability and determinism for auditability partly relates to developer philosophy. Tech is famous for religious arguments. I have friends who hate AI coding, and want to avoid nondeterminstic tools at all costs. And other friends whose productivity has increased significantly, and who see the future of programming as natural language.</p><p>The quality of AI models and tools like Claude Code is improving fast, and there are many developers who find value in them, myself included. I built this to make life easier for developers who want to use AI tools for automation.</p><p>I find it much faster to parse and understand plain language than many code scripts I've seen. It was one of Python's great insights that people spend more time reading code than writing it. And there is a tradeoff in auditability between determinism and the ability to quickly read and understand what systems do.</p><p>There are clearly many people who find AI useful, and who are becoming skilled in its use as a tool. This is just a little tool that I put together for myself and other people who fall in that basket.</p><p>Learning where to use AI tools appropriately - how to constrain the dangers while maximizing the value - is part of the challenge. From using this particular tool for real work, it fits some use cases well, and can make things easier both to understand and share, as well as to write.</p><p>I hope it's useful for some other people wanting to use AI for scripting and automation.</p><p>I think that quickly understandable instructions are part of auditability. Not the whole thing, and their use needs to be balanced with safety and security. But an important part of it.</p><p>I accept there are plenty of folks who don't see AI tools that way. We're sharing this for people who see the value in this new approach, even though it is a fast-moving field and there are a lot of imperfections.</p><p>Any reasonably competent Claude Code user who is careful about setting permissions boundaries is no more going to delete their hard drive than a competent command line user would. There will be things that go wrong with AI, as before it.</p><p>In years of tech support, I've personally had to help people who neutered their Windows install or deleted files they needed. Those things happen and I'd argue they come down to skill issues, with AI or without. New tools have a learning curve.</p><p>I get that you think that's bizarre to see readability with AI-based tools as more auditable, and I really do understand that perspective.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46549769"><td></td></tr><tr id="46549894"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46549894" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46549894&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46549444"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>In practice after using this for real-world test suites and evaluations, the results with Claude Code if you do this sensibly are remarkably consistent. That's because you can still write the deterministic parts as the `./run_tests.sh` bash script (or `run_tests.py` etc).</p><p>So you're using the appropriate tools for the task at hand embedded within both traditional scripts and markdown scripts.</p><p>Examples:
- A bash script summarizes text files from a path in a loop
- A markdown script runs `./test/run_tests.py` and summarizes the results.</p><p>Tools like Claude code combined with executable scripts and pipes open up a genuinely new way of doing tasks that are traditionally hard with scripting languages alone.

    <p>After almost 18 years, I left iNaturalist, the product and organization I helped create. I left because I don’t believe the current Leadership team is pointing the product in the right direction, and I don’t think they are managing their talented staff in an empathetic or effective way. If you’d like me to continue working on natural history software, <a href="https://patreon.com/kueda?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=why-i-left-inat&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&amp;utm_content=support-me-on-patreon"><strong>support me on Patreon</strong></a>.</p>

<p>This post is an announcement for those who were unaware, an explanation for those who are confused, and a record so I don’t forget.</p>

<h2 id="some-history">Some History</h2>
<p>I wanted to build something like iNat shortly after I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003. In 2007 I attended the UC Berkeley School of Information and built it along with my fellow students and co-founders <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/5">Nate Agrin</a> and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/2">Jess Kline</a>. Nate and I worked on it a bit in our spare time after graduating, and I started collaborating with <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/477">Scott</a> in 2009, still in our spare time. Scott was instrumental in recruitment, funding, and collaboration, and we formed an <abbr title="Limited Liabilty Corporation">LLC</abbr> together as a way to have a bank account to accept funds to build out functionality like the first iPhone and Android apps. In 2014 we joined the California Academy of Sciences (<abbr title="California Academy of Sciences">CAS</abbr>) in the hope of gaining access to more resources to hire more staff, which we did and thus survived almost a decade of growth in usage. In 2023 we left <abbr title="California Academy of Sciences">CAS</abbr> after arduous negotiations and formed an independent non-profit.</p>

<p>Up to this point, iNat functioned as an unstructured anarchy. Scott and I were titular “co-directors” but we did not provide a lot of direction and most of the big moves and features were driven largely by individual initiative. We never found a great way to collaborate. We struggled to set collective goals that might override individual ones, we struggled to keep longer-term goals in mind amid day-to-day firefighting, and we remained merely the sum of our parts, if that. Toward the end of our time at <abbr title="California Academy of Sciences">CAS</abbr> we experimented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy">sociocracy</a> as a way to organize without hierarchy and coercion, but despite my enthusiasm for the form, we didn’t start with universal buy-in or understanding from the whole team, we didn’t fully adopt its structures, and, like many democracies before us, we ultimately voted to abolish our own democracy when we formed the “leadership circle” and created a hierarchy.</p>

<p>The leadership circle was me, Scott, and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/7580">Carrie</a>. We didn’t have clearly-defined roles, but our mandate was navigating the separation from <abbr title="California Academy of Sciences">CAS</abbr> while forming a new organization, which meant lots of talking with lawyers, understanding the requirements of tax-exempt status, forming a new board and writing its bylaws. I had very little interest in any of it and to my discredit, I let Carrie and Scott do most of the work. When we did need to make decisions, I was generally the minority, e.g. in how much to disclose in our negotiations with <abbr title="California Academy of Sciences">CAS</abbr> (<abbr title="in my opinion">IMO</abbr> everything) or whether board members should be required to donate money (<abbr title="in my opinion">IMO</abbr> no, plutocracy is bad at all times and at all levels). In addition to constantly feeling like the losing vote, the “leadership circle” was sliding into becoming a Leadership team of department heads, and being a dis-empowered leader of people doing the actual work wasn’t what I wanted, so I stepped down and was officially just an engineer, work I’d been doing all along anyway.</p>

<p>The new mobile app (which we were calling “iNat Next” and is now simply “iNaturalist,” the older app becoming “iNaturalist Classic”… still following? I’m going to refer to them as “iNat Next” and “iNat Classic” for clarity) was proving to be more work than the team dedicated to it could handle, so I put all of my time into that. We hired two new staff to work on it, and did our best to reconcile what little guidance we got from Leadership with an internal process focused on discussion and consent. By late 2024, the app wasn’t what anyone wanted it to be, but we had soft-launched on iPhone and were iteratively improving. At this point Leadership started establishing arbitrary goals like a hard launch with promotion in time for City Nature Challenge 2025 with the hopes of getting featured in the Apple App Store. They insisted the app needed to be simpler, to cater first to incidental users who wanted a quick answer, to be a friction-less path to a feeling of contribution. I don’t believe that’s possible while also serving existing users who value (don’t laugh) the power and nuance of iNat, including, among many other things, the way it <em>doesn’t</em> give you a quick answer, forcing you to consider options when making an identification. At this point it was clear to me Leadership wanted the app to be something I had no interest in using and that I didn’t believe would serve people like me, and that they were totally uninterested in hearing feedback from the team developing it, so I left and joined the web team.</p>

<p>Over that spring, Leadership changed direction on iNat Next again and again, shifting the baseline for what constituted a viable feature set for release and driving the team toward a deadline for getting featured in the App Store that ultimately proved fruitless when the app wasn’t featured after all. The team felt dis-empowered and Leadership seemed unwilling to listen to their complaints. Some of the team asked if I could do anything, so I tried to do what seemed like the only thing I could do in a hierarchy and communicate the problems up to the Head of Engineering and Head of Engagement (early March 2025), but there was likewise no change in behavior from Leadership in the way they managed the mobile team. I ultimately proposed restructuring product Leadership under a new Head of Product role with the explicit responsibility of consulting with workers and with users about their needs and capabilities, working closely with design and engineering staff to ensure that no one was blindsided by sudden changes in direction but also ensuring no team was left without product direction (17 April 2025). I proposed that this role have independent control over product decisions to resist impulses from the rest of Leadership to override existing priorities before work could be tested by use. I also proposed that I could do the job.</p>

<p>A day later, Leadership informed me they had no intention of adopting my proposal (“We’re not planning to change the Head of Product structure at this time,” 18 April 2025, referring the three-member sub-group of the Leadership team that was making product decisions at the time). A few days after that Scott announced that he was taking on an additional role to his Executive Director responsibilities: Head of Product (circa 21 April 2025). On 5 May 2025, the Leadership team summoned everyone who worked on iNat Next into an agenda-less meeting titled “post launch Strategic alignment” and announced that they would offer us half a year’s pay to quit. Offended and incensed that they would rather so many staff leave than listening to and addressing their concerns, I decided iNaturalist was no longer an organization I wanted to work for and I told them to write up the offer. I consulted with friends and advisors, who all suggested that I take longer to decide, perhaps on a sabbatical. Leadership agreed to that, so I tried to spend the last few months thinking about whether I could remain in an organization led by people in whom I have lost so much faith. In the interim, most of the recipients of that buyout offer left the organization, as well as another engineer, and the Head of Engineering, resulting in a 30% attrition in staff. The org is trying to fill that gap with the three new engineers that have been hired for the mobile team, former board member <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/181">Dan Rademacher</a> joining staff as Head of Product (though not, apparently, with the independence I proposed, so responsibility without the necessary power), and hiring two more engineers for the web/ops team (in progress, to my knowledge).</p>

<p>As I was leaving, the Google gen AI debacle happened, a fiasco big enough to merit description in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/google-ai-grant-to-inaturalist-prompts-community-outcry/">Scientific American</a>. This was an own goal. iNat’s Engagement team predicted the backlash but the Leadership team chose not to listen to their warning. I was not involved in this grant, its announcement, or its fulfillment, but while it didn’t directly lead to my own choice to leave, it is symptomatic of the problems that led to that choice, and I think it played a role convincing more staff to quit. In my discussions with staff since, almost everyone recalled being blindsided by the announcement of the grant and confused about what the money was going to be used for.</p>

<h2 id="product">Product</h2>
<p>My fundamental difference from Leadership in terms of the organization’s products is that I think different products should meet different needs, while the Leadership team believes a single product can meet all the needs of the organization’s potential users (I have many others differences, but this might be the least reconcilable). At the beginning of iNat, I thought one product could meet all those needs too. In grad school, we described personas of potential users and quickly identified the divide in needs between enthusiast naturalists and people with a more occasional interest in nature, and we tried to design to meet the needs of both groups of people. Again and again over the years, I saw that we just couldn’t do it. Enthusiasts need power and complexity that is immediately confusing and intimidating to more casual users, and that extends from the use of scientific names through the kinds of filters you can use to explore the data. Casual users need structure and guidance to invite them into the amazing but complex and often unfamiliar world of biodiversity, but that structure can be a hindrance or even infantilizing to people who just want to get things done. iNaturalist the product is fundamentally complicated, and I have watched many, many people bounce off that wall of complexity over the years, even as I’ve seen so many people enrich their lives after they climb over it.</p>

<p>The last nail in the coffin on this subject for me was Seek, an idea from <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/44845">Alex</a> and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/79343">Joelle</a> (later rebuilt by <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/1132118">Amanda</a> and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/247291">Abhas</a>) to build a version of iNat <em>specifically</em> for that casual crowd, focused on quick answers with a gamified structure. Seek was wildly successful, eventually equaling and occasionally exceeding the usage of the iNaturalist apps. Two critical anecdotes: I remember looking for rare plants in a burn zone and overhearing two young botanists one hill over trying to figure out a plant and eventually saying, “well let’s just see what Seek says.” I was alarmed that these professionals were using such an unprofessional tool, but also reminded that in that moment, they didn’t need iNat-level complexity. They just needed a Seek-sized nudge in their identification process. One summer a year or two later I went home for my annual family vacation and my dad told me he’d just discovered the marvels of Seek and was puttering around everywhere seeing what Seek thought of the plants in the yard. Dad has been a meticulous recorder of information his entire life, and has been a loyal iNat contributor for years, but he has never had much interest in computers and absolutely couldn’t give a toss about connecting with other people on the Internet, so Seek really worked for him in a way iNat never did.</p>

<p>iNat’s history and Seek’s success prove to me that my initial belief in a single app to meet all needs was wrong: iNat the product should serve the enthusiast users, and Seek should serve the casual users. Arguments about Seek eating into iNat’s potential usage are absurd: the mission of the organization is to connect people to nature through technology, and if two products are doing that better than one product, that’s success. If Seek users aren’t contributing to a global data set, that’s also fine. Data generation has always been a byproduct of building connection. Seek could be better about encouraging data contribution, but it doesn’t need to.</p>

<p>iNat’s current Leadership does not share this belief. To them, Seek is an off-brand liability that they don’t intend to improve. They think iNaturalist the product can serve those Seek users while also serving existing core iNat contributors to the detriment of neither.</p>

<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<p>Leadership made many mistakes over the last year, including</p>

<ol>
  <li>Failing to listen to the concerns of the mobile team in the development of iNat Next and overriding their decisions</li>
  <li>Abandoning product direction on the web team and for Seek</li>
  <li>Trying to address discord by jettisoning staff instead of addressing their concerns</li>
  <li>Accepting a grant without any consultation with staff about how its obligations might be met</li>
  <li>Ignoring staff warnings about how the announcement of that grant would not go over well with users</li>
</ol>

<p>I lay the departure of 30% of staff at their feet, primarily because of the buyout offer. I think that showed the entire organization that their bosses are the kind of people who deal with criticism with a firm shove out the door. Yes, the people who left may have had other opportunities, but they primarily left because they were not being consulted when they had feedback, not getting help when they needed it, and not granted the level of independence they needed to get things done. The reputational damage from the Google AI grant was similarly due to Leadership’s inability to hear and digest criticism. If they had listened to the warnings of the Engagement team, it might have gone down very differently.</p>

<p>Since the exodus, Leadership has improved on some fronts. Within the Engagement and Engineering teams they are consulting with staff more than they have in the past. Within Engagement that consultation seems to be translated into action more than it has in the past. They hired three new engineers for the mobile team that seem both experienced and enthusiastic. Bringing Dan into a Head of Product role will hopefully provide more empathy and clarity to the engineering teams.</p>

<p>But fundamentally for me, even if Leadership has learned something from their mistakes, they have not learned to admit them, which proves to me they haven’t really learned to accept criticism. There has been no all-staff discussion about stumbling through the release of iNat Next, of the Google gen AI debacle, or, most importantly, why 30% of staff left the organization in three months. The mistakes of the Leadership team are partially or totally to blame for these events, and if they do not own their responsibility before staff and before the community, I don’t think they deserve their power. They certainly don’t deserve my trust.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>

<p>First of all, I quit. I can’t work with a Leadership team that has such a different vision for where iNat the product needs to go and how iNat the organization should be managed. Or if I can, I can’t find satisfaction while doing so.</p>

<p>I’d like to keep working on natural history software, and if you’d like me to as well, <a href="https://patreon.com/kueda?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=why-i-left-inat&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&amp;utm_content=support-me-on-patreon"><strong>support me on Patreon</strong></a>. In a perfect world, I’d be employed by the people who use the software I make, so I figured I’d try it. Right now I’m working on <a href="https://github.com/kueda/chuck">a way to back up your iNat observations</a> and an <a href="https://underfoot.rocks/">app for viewing geologic maps</a>. Both could use a lot of work. In the future I’d like to experiment with a decentralized version of iNat. In all likelihood I’ll need to get a “real” job so <a href="mailto:work@kueda.net">let me know</a> if you’d think you’d like to hire me.</p>

<p>I am, of course, heartbroken. I genuinely like almost everyone on staff and I will miss working with them. It would be hard to find a more talented, bright, and perceptive group of people, and they genuinely care about iNat and are trying to do right by it, which makes it all the more tragic that the organization can’t seem to do right by them.</p>

<p>To those who are mystified by a co-founder’s choice to leave the thing they co-founded, I don’t really care about the fact that I helped create iNat (it was not a unique idea), but I very much care about it existing in something like its present form because I use it every day, interact with people like me on it every day, and it hurts to step away from an active role in improving and maintaining it.</p>

<p>Obviously, I think the Leadership team should change, and maybe they will. Hiring Dan is a good step, but I think they will need more fundamental changes to their approach to right the ship, starting with learning how to admit when they’re wrong.</p>

<p>I also think the board should change, because they are either complicit in Leadership’s mistakes or failing in their oversight function. I think the board should develop lines of communication with staff and users outside of the Leadership team. We set up iNat’s board to be largely non-interventionist, but I think that was a mistake. Now they only get information from a Leadership team that cannot admit fault. If the board is really to perform its oversight function, it should be hearing from staff and users more directly.</p>

<p>I also think the board should follow Wikimedia’s lead and commit to a <a href="https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal:Wikimedia_Foundation_Bylaws#(F)_Overall_Board_composition.">majority of community-selected members</a>, instead of selecting their own membership from people like them. Users should have more power in the organization. Right now they’re barely even informed about what staff are doing.</p>

<p>In case anyone is alarmed about the state of iNat after reading this, I do not advise stopping your use of iNat, and I definitely don’t advise deleting your account. I’m certainly not doing either. I was appalled at the number of people who went nuclear and deleted their accounts during the gen AI debacle. Temporarily withdrawing your data would be a reasonable form of protest if it was possible, but destroying existing data that can’t be retrieved hurts everyone. If you think iNat has problems, either the ones I’ve described or others, I think you should keep contributing observations, identifications, and if you can, donations, <em>but</em> also organize. Users don’t currently have any effective control over staff or the board, but you do control the life blood of iNat: participation. A large enough cessation of data or money would exert pressure, but it would take organization.</p>

<p>If you’re concerned, I’d also advise exploring or creating alternatives. While I don’t think iNat has reached Doctorow-level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>, it does suffer from centralization. If you don’t like the way your data is used to train <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> models, you can’t currently move your data to a non-<abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> service while still contributing to and using iNat data, even if such a service existed. But you should be able to do that. It also suffers from stagnation. If you want features like client-side geofencing, video support, sonograms, sound <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>, etc, you might need to build them. iNat still maintains the web 2.0 virtue of <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">adversarial interoperability</a> in the form of its <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, so some of these alternatives can be built in non-competitive ways (and if the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> goes away, we’ll know things have gotten really bad), but some may require competition. Those of us who benefit from tools like iNat should be looking seriously to the decentralized models being developed by the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">Mastodon</a>, because we can’t rely on any single organization to provide that benefit forever.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Box">



<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000010631041/minneapolis-ice-shooting-video.html">The New York Times has frame-by-frame analysis</a>, from three angles, of the murder of 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis yesterday. She was shot to death by <s>a still-unnamed</s> mask-wearing ICE agent <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ice-agent-who-fatally-shot-woman-in-minneapolis-is-identified/601560214">Jonathan Ross</a>, with what was obviously no justification. The shooting is, justifiably, national news. I’m sure you’ve read about it. But this Times analysis coolly and calmly shows just how outrageous it was, and how preposterous the claims from President Trump and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3mbwjgwh5xc2u">Secretary of Hats Kristi Noem</a> are ostensibly attempting to defend it — both as an act of self-defense by the cowardly ICE agent and, even more absurdly, as an act of “domestic terrorism” by Good, who was attempting to do nothing more than drive away from the scene.</p>

<p>George Orwell, in <em>1984</em>: “The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.” Let’s stop pussyfooting around what happened here. This ICE agent murdered Renee Good, in broad daylight, in front of many witnesses and multiple cameras. Trust the evidence of your eyes and ears.</p>

<hr>

<p>But I want to add another note. The main footage here comes from bystander Caitlin Callenson. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9CJY5p0xz4">Here’s her full 4m:25s footage</a>, uncensored, hosted — with credit, and I hope, permission — on the YouTube account of Minnesota Reformer. Be warned that it shows Good being shot to death (albeit sans gore), and contains many loud profanities. This is <em>very</em> good and clear footage. It is difficult viewing but you should watch it. Callenson was very close to Good’s vehicle. I’d say about 30 feet or so. You can see why she thought to start filming  <em>before</em> the murderous agent drew his gun and fired. The scene was already chaotic. But then, <em>after</em> the murderous agent fired three shots — just 30 or 40 feet in front of Callenson — Callenson had the courage and conviction to stay with the scene and keep filming. Not to run away, but instead to follow the scene. To keep filming. To continue documenting with as best clarity as she could, what was unfolding.</p>

<p>I’d like to think I’d have done the same. I’m not sure at all that I would have. I definitely might have been using my iPhone to shoot video of the incident up until the shots were fired. But when that happened, my mind would immediately have turned to “<em>These agents are scared and angry and out of control, and</em> that <em>one just went psycho and fired his gun unprovoked. That guy is just as likely to shoot more people as he was the woman he just shot. His angry, scared, obviously undertrained colleagues might join in. And the most likely people they’ll shoot next are people pointing cameras at them.</em>” I do not know what I would have done in that moment. I hope I never find out. But I know with certainty what I would immediately think, which is that if I choose to continue shooting video of the incident, there is a very good chance one of them will shoot or brutalize me next. It would make <em>more</em> sense to shoot someone filming the scene than it did to shoot Renee Good in the first place. Good’s killing was utterly senseless. Shooting a witness with a running camera and then destroying their phone to eliminate the evidence (and a witness) would make some sense. Sick sense, but sense.</p>

<p>But in that moment of pandemonium and obvious danger to herself, Callenson didn’t merely continue filming. She didn’t merely stand her ground. She proceeded <em>into</em> the scene to get closer to Good’s vehicle after it crashed into a parked car, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixNkVvtC5FY">Mr. Brown-style</a>. She pointed her camera directly at the only-partially-masked face of the murderous agent as he walked away from Good’s crashed vehicle, then got into an unmarked Chevy Tahoe and just fled from the scene like the obvious coward he is. I presume the murderous agent will soon be identified, and Callenson’s clear steady-handed footage may be the reason why. [<strong>Update:</strong> While I was finishing this post, the Minnesota Star Tribune identified and named him — <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ice-agent-who-fatally-shot-woman-in-minneapolis-is-identified/601560214">Jonathan Ross</a> — and indeed, it was Callenson’s footage that made his identification possible.] And, to top it off, all the while — starting <em>before</em> the shooting — Callenson was screaming “Shame!” in the faces of these agents, and calling them out on their abhorrent indefensible actions. To each of their directives to her, she responds, with the definition of righteous anger, “You shot someone in the fucking face!” (Emily Heller, Renee Good’s neighbor, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/us/video/ebof-minneapolis-ice-shooting-witness-emily-heller">showed similar courage</a>, telling an ICE agent who refused to allow a citizen physician to check on Good (who laid dying or dead inside her car), as she filmed the scene, “How can I relax, you just killed my fucking neighbor! You shot her in the fucking face! You killed my fucking neighbor! How do you show up to work every day?”)</p>

<p>Callenson’s courage in the face of obvious danger is just remarkable. My god. She rose to the moment in a crucible of chaos, insanity, and murderous violence. We all need to think about what she did, to really imagine ourselves in the same moment — the danger she stood up to, and the principles she stood up for — if we hope to do the same if a similar moment comes to us.</p>

<p>And, to top it off, she had the presence of mind to shoot her historic footage in widescreen. </p>
