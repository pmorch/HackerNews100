<p>Just months after Neil Armstrong’s historic moonwalk, <a href="https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/">Jim Storer</a>, a Lexington High School student in Massachusetts, wrote the first <a href="https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander.html">Lunar Landing</a> game. By 1973, it <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/_Books/101_BASIC_Computer_Games_Mar75.pdf">had become</a> “by far and away the single most popular computer game.” A simple text game, you pilot a moon lander, aiming for a gentle touch down on the moon. All motion is vertical and you decide every 10 simulated seconds how much fuel to burn.</p>



<p>I recently explored the optimal fuel burn schedule to land as gently as possible and with maximum remaining fuel. Surprisingly, the theoretical best strategy didn’t work. The game falsely thinks the lander doesn’t touch down on the surface when in fact it does. Digging in, I was amazed by the sophisticated physics and numerical computing in the game. Eventually I found a bug: a missing “divide by two” that had seemingly gone unnoticed for nearly 55 years.</p>



<h2>Landing with Maximum Fuel</h2>



<p>To use the least fuel while landing, you need to land in the shortest time possible. Initially you maximize your speed by keeping your engine off, then at the last possible second you burn full throttle, reducing your speed to zero just as you touch the surface. The Kerbal Space Program community calls this a “suicide burn”, since getting the timing right is hard and it leaves no room for error.</p>



<p>With some trial and error and a bit of (manual) binary search, you can find the schedule that just barely has you landing.  You burn nothing for 70 seconds, then 164.31426784 lbs/sec for the next 10 seconds, then the max 200 lbs/sec after that:</p>

<p>The game considers a perfect landing to be less than 1 MPH, but here we land at over 3.5 MPH and are told we “could be better.”  Yet burn even 0.00000001 more lbs/sec, and you miss the surface entirely, ascending at 114 MPH:</p>

<p>How did we go from a hard landing to not landing at all, without a soft landing in between?</p>



<h2>Physics Simulation: One Smart Kid</h2>



<p>I expected to see the simple Euler integration that’s common in video games even today.  That’s where you compute the forces at the start of each time step, then use <em>F=ma</em> to compute the acceleration, then assume the acceleration is constant over a time step of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\Delta t"> seconds:</p>


<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+v+%3D+a+%5CDelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+v+%3D+a+%5CDelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+v+%3D+a+%5CDelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\Delta v = a \Delta t"><br><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+x+%3D+v+%5CDelta+t+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+a+%28%5CDelta+t%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+x+%3D+v+%5CDelta+t+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+a+%28%5CDelta+t%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+x+%3D+v+%5CDelta+t+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+a+%28%5CDelta+t%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\Delta x = v \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} a (\Delta t)^2"></p>



<p>Because the mass is changing over the timestep, the acceleration will change too, so assuming it’s constant is only approximate.  But surprisingly, Jim used the exact solution, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a>, with a Taylor series expansion for the logarithm. He also used some algebra to simplify it and reduce the amount of round off error.  Very impressive for a high school senior in 1969.  When I asked him about it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I was skilled at calculus at the time and familiar with concepts like a Taylor series, but also my recollection is that my father, who was a physicist, helped me in the derivation of the equations.” – Jim Storer, personal communication</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rocket equation is what gives rise to the suicide burn being optimal, and the five terms he uses of the Taylor series, where the argument is at most 0.1212, makes it accurate to over six decimal places. So that’s not the problem we’re looking for.</p>



<h2>Assumptions Go Out The Window When We Hit The Ground</h2>



<p>The rocket equation works well until you hit the ground. In general, collisions between solid objects is a really hard part of dynamics engines, and what separates the great ones from the good ones, as I discovered when contributing to <a href="https://www.ode.org/">Open Dynamics Engine</a> as a postdoc at MIT.</p>



<p>And this is where the Lunar Landing Game faces its biggest challenge. Imagine the lander descending at the start of a 10-second turn but ascending by the end. Simply verifying that it’s above the surface at both points isn’t enough. It might have dipped below the surface somewhere in between. When this happens, the program has to rewind and examine an earlier moment.</p>



<p>An obvious place is to look at the lowest point of the trajectory, where the velocity is zero. For the rocket equation, it turns out, there’s no closed form expression for that lowest point that involves only basic mathematical functions.<sup data-fn="636f2ae6-d817-49bc-a1ca-6c07b4cee9c6"><a href="#636f2ae6-d817-49bc-a1ca-6c07b4cee9c6" id="636f2ae6-d817-49bc-a1ca-6c07b4cee9c6-link">1</a></sup> So instead, we can use the physicists favourite technique, and take only the first few terms of the Taylor series. If you use only the first two terms of the logarithm, the problem simplifies to a quadratic equation and you can use the good old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula">quadratic formula</a> from high school. And the approximation should be pretty good over the space of a 10 second turn, accurate to within 0.1% or so.</p>



<p>But that’s not what Jim did. His formula has a square root in the denominator, not the numerator. It also had an error 30 times bigger.</p>



<h2>How To Know When You’ve Hit Rock Bottom</h2>

<p>What could he possibly be doing? I stared at this for a long time, wracking my brain for any other approach to approximate the bottom of the trajectory that would still only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root. Taking only the first term of the logarithm would give an approximation worse than the quadratic, but wouldn’t involve a square root. Taking a third term and we need to solve a cubic, which in general would need a lot more code and in our case it doesn’t seem to be of any special form that has a simple solution<sup data-fn="809751a5-4c07-42d1-9eb3-892e999bd451"><a href="#809751a5-4c07-42d1-9eb3-892e999bd451" id="809751a5-4c07-42d1-9eb3-892e999bd451-link">2</a></sup>. There are many approximations to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\log(x)">, but the non-Taylor ones involve advanced functions like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Ex&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Ex&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Ex&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="x^x"> that are hard to invert.</p>



<p>Until I looked a little more closely at his square root. It’s of the form:</p>


<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B+%5Cleft%28+%5Cdfrac%7Bb%7D%7B2%7D+%5Cright%29+%5E2+-+a+c%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B+%5Cleft%28+%5Cdfrac%7Bb%7D%7B2%7D+%5Cright%29+%5E2+-+a+c%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B+%5Cleft%28+%5Cdfrac%7Bb%7D%7B2%7D+%5Cright%29+%5E2+-+a+c%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\sqrt{ \left( \dfrac{b}{2} \right) ^2 - a c} "></p>



<p>Which looks a awful lot like the quadratic formula where we’ve divided by 4 inside the square root. It <em>has to</em> be related. But why is it in the denominator? Did he find a quadratic in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="1/t"> ? No, because <em>t</em> can be very close to zero, so his formula would need to be approximated over a wide range of very large values, and a quadratic isn’t good for that. Did he make a quadratic approximation to log, <em>then</em> substitute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3D1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3D1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3D1%2Ft&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="T=1/t">, solve for <em>T</em>, then substitute back? Playing around with that, I re-discovered an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula#Square_root_in_the_denominator">alternate form</a> of the quadratic formula with the square root on the bottom! And indeed, this matches the formula in Jim’s code.</p>



<p>I don’t know why 18 year old Jim was using the alternate form. Perhaps he re-derived the quadratic formula rather than looking it up, and ended up deriving that form. Perhaps he was worried about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_cancellation">catastrophic cancellation</a> and wanted a form where he’d add positive numbers, rather than subtract them.<sup data-fn="2e932716-93ea-4b84-b03e-a6fb66e4764b"><a href="#2e932716-93ea-4b84-b03e-a6fb66e4764b" id="2e932716-93ea-4b84-b03e-a6fb66e4764b-link">3</a></sup></p>



<h2>Let’s Double Check The Derivation</h2>



<p>But if his formula is equivalent, then why is the approximation error 30 times higher? Deriving the formula ourselves, we get:</p>


<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BLet+%7D+W+%5Cequiv+%5Cdfrac%7B1+-+%5Cfrac%7BMG%7D%7BZK%7D%7D%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BLet+%7D+W+%5Cequiv+%5Cdfrac%7B1+-+%5Cfrac%7BMG%7D%7BZK%7D%7D%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BLet+%7D+W+%5Cequiv+%5Cdfrac%7B1+-+%5Cfrac%7BMG%7D%7BZK%7D%7D%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\text{Let } W \equiv \dfrac{1 - \frac{MG}{ZK}}{2}"></p>

<p>Which is identical to Jim’s code, except … he’s missing the 2 in the denominator inside the square root! It was probably a simple error, either when deriving the formula or typing it into the computer.  After all, the computer algebra system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma">MACSYMA</a> had only started a year before, and wouldn’t be available at a high school, so he would have had to do everything using pencil and paper.</p>



<p>With this bug, he consistently <em>under</em>estimates the time to the lowest point. He compensates for this two ways: adding 0.05 sec, and then re-estimating from his new, closer location. And this explains why it misses the time of landing: the first estimate is while the lander is above the surface and still descending, then the second one is after reaching the bottom and ascending again, which takes less than 0.05 sec.</p>



<p>If we add the missing factor of two and remove the 0.05, what happens? Now the best we can do with a suicide burn is:</p>

<p>Our velocity is down to 1.66 MPH, almost three quarters of the way to the perfect landing at 1 MPH.  It’s not perfect because w’re still only using the first two terms of the Taylor series.  Also, once you’ve decided your lowest point is under the surface, you then need to find the time where you first hit the surface, which involves a similar approximation.  Another iteration would help, although with the bug fixed we <em>over</em>estimate the time, so we’d need to go back in time, which might mean we have to pick the other solution to the quadratic. You could simplify that by using only a single term from the Taylor series, and is what’s done in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton’s method</a>. You could then stop when the magnitude of the velocity is below some threshold, and use the altitude there to decide whether or not you landed.  But this is all more work, and the game was fun to play as it is, so why complicate the code?</p>



<p>It’s also possible to land gently, you just need to end your 14th turn with a low altitude and velocity, and then use low thrust in your 15th turn, landing somewhere after 150 seconds.  It’s just the theoretical full-thrust-on-landing suicide burn, that takes around 148 seconds, that eludes us.</p>

<p>Overall, this is very impressive work for an 18 year hold high school student in 1969 on a PDP-8.  This was long before Computer Science was taught in high school.  The numerical computing aspects, such as iteratively improving the estimate using Newton’s method or worrying about catastrophic cancellation, weren’t well known back then.  I didn’t learn them until I was studying for a Ph.D. in robotics.</p>



<p>It is also surprising that, as far as I can tell, this bug has been there for almost 55 years and nobody has noticed it before.  That’s probably because, even with the bug, it was a fun game, both difficult and possible to land gently.&nbsp; The quest to not just win, but find the optimal strategy, can certainly lead to trying to understand small discrepancies.  I suspect everybody else was just happy to play the game and have fun.</p>

Auch, weil Deutschland keine Kontrolle hatte? Der Umweltausschuss nimmt Stellung.</p><p><strong>Update vom 12. Juni, 16.21 Uhr:</strong> Schwere Vorwürfe gegen das Umweltministerium des Bundes: Viel zu fahrlässig habe man chinesische Projekte zum Klimaschutz unterstützt. Dabei seien Millionen an Geldern geflossen, die aus der sogenannten THG-Quote stammten.  </p><p>„Seit August 2023 gibt es erhebliche Betrugsvorwürfe gegen Klimaschutzprojekte in China, welche zur Anrechnung auf die Treibhausgasminderungsquote genutzt werden“, sagte Daniel Rinkert (SPD) in einem Plenum des Umweltausschusses am Mittwoch. „In der heutigen Sitzung wurde das Thema ausführlich diskutiert und Vorwürfe ausgeräumt.“</p><p>Die Betrugsanschuldigungen bei den Upstream-Emission-Reduction-Projekten – kurz UER-Projekte – seien laut Parlamentarier erheblich und verlangten eine konsequente Aufklärung. Laut Umweltbundesamt stehen aktuell 40 von 60 Projekten in China unter einem Betrugsverdacht. „Das ist Wirtschaftskriminalität im großen Umfang“, sagte Rinkert. „Es ist mehr als offensichtlich, dass bei diesen Projekten keine Kontrolle auf anspruchsvollem Niveau sichergestellt werden kann. Daher wird die Förderung dieser Projekte auch durch die Bundesregierung Ende 2024 eingestellt. Die entsprechende Verordnung wurde am 8. Juni im Kabinett verabschiedet.“</p><h2>Umweltministerium will mit Auswärtigem Amt deutsche Kontrollen in China durchdrücken</h2><p>Das Bundesumweltministerium und das Umweltbundesamt hätten damit „sehr deutlich gemacht“, dass die zuständigen Stellen in Deutschland frühzeitig eine „vollumfängliche Aufklärung“ eingeleitet haben. „In aufwendigen Prüfungsschritten wird seit den ersten aufkommenden Betrugsvorwürfen jedes einzelne Projekt untersucht und überprüft“, betonte Rinkert.&nbsp; Die in diesem Zusammenhang immer wieder vorgebrachten Vorwürfe der Tatenlosigkeit der zuständigen Stellen hätten sich damit als haltlos herausgestellt. „Die Union sollte die Vorwürfe daher nicht wiederholen und Nebelkerzen werfen. Sie sollte vielmehr die Bundesregierung bei der Aufklärung unterstützen“, sagte Rinkert.</p><p>Gemeinsam mit dem Auswärtigen Amt dränge das Umweltministerium nun die chinesische Regierung dazu, eine unabhängige deutsche Kontrollmission in China zuzulassen. Nur dadurch könne ein vollumfänglicher Einblick in die Situation vor Ort gewonnen werden. „Für dieses Vorgehen gibt es die volle Unterstützung der SPD-Bundestagsfraktion“, sagte Rinkert zum Schluss.</p><h2>Millionen-Betrug in China: Haben Konzerne die deutschen Klimaschutzmaßnahmen unterwandert?</h2><p><strong>Erstmeldung vom 11. Juni: </strong>Berlin – Der Image-Schaden für den deutschen Klimaschutz dürfte fast schwerer wiegen, als die verlorenen Milliarden an Euros. Nagelneue Ölförderungsanlagen in China sollen angeblich CO₂ einsparen. Gebaut von internationalen Großkonzernen zur „grüneren“ Gewinnung von Öl. Die Bauvorhaben ermöglicht jeder, der in Deutschland tankt. Denn als Nutzer:in von fossilen Brennstoffen zahlt man beim Tanken Klima-Abgaben über die „Treibhausgasminderungsquote“ – kurz THG-Quote. Das Problem: Wahrscheinlich gibt es diese neuen und sauberen Anlagen in <a href="https://www.merkur.de/politik/china/" title="China" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;China&quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:18,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}">China</a> gar nicht, wie Recherchen von <em>ZDF frontal</em> ergaben. Und anscheinend ist es auch nicht möglich für das Umweltministerium des Bundes, den Betrugsvorwürfen effektiv nachzugehen, wie die <em>Welt</em> berichtet.</p><p>Doch von Anfang an: Verstrickt in den Skandal sind anscheinend mehrere Ölmultis, die die Anlagen angeblich gebaut haben. Die meisten dieser Projekte sollen auf den Öl- und Gasfeldern der Provinz Xinjang entstanden sein. Für die Konzerne ein lukratives Geschäft mit dem Handel von Umwelt-Zertifikaten. Denn für jede eingesparte Tonne Kohlendioxid konnten die Unternehmen bis zu 400 Euro in Deutschland kassieren. Viele Projekte waren nach Recherchen von „ZDF Frontal“ aber nur vorgetäuscht. </p><figure><p><img src="https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBBG.jpg" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBb9.jpg 448w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OB73.jpg 768w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBBG.jpg 1100w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OB7d.jpg 1408w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBPH.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 769px) 768px, 100vw" height="733" width="1100" alt="Eigentlich sollten mit der Umlage Öl- und Gasbohrungen vor allem in China finanziert werden, die umweltfreundlicher als die gewöhnliche Förderung sind.

Zuletzt im April meldete sich ein chinesischer Öl- und Gaskonzern von selbst bei dem von Steffi Lemke (Grüne) geführten Umweltministerium und erklärte deutlich, dass von Betrugsfällen auszugehen ist. „Wir vermuten, dass es eine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit gibt, dass Dokumente gefälscht wurden und wir bitten dringend, dass Ihre Behörde dazu ermittelt“, teilte der chinesische Konzern dem Ministerium mit. Dieses wimmelte wohl ab, wie die <em>Welt</em> berichtet. Deutsche Prüfstellen haben anscheinend einige Daten der Anlagen des chinesischen Unternehmens geändert und ohne dessen Zustimmung verwendet. Das Ziel war, möglichst hohe CO₂-Einsparungen in Deutschland geltend zu machen. Allein in diesem offenbar gefälschten Projekt ging es laut <em>ZDF</em> um eine Million Tonnen Kohlendioxid, die angeblich eingespart wurden – der Marktwert: etwa 180 Millionen Euro.</p><p>Ein weiteres Beispiel: Deutsche Autofahrerinnen und Autofahrer zahlten mit ihrer Klima-Abgabe vermutlich rund 80 Millionen Euro für ein<a href="https://www.fr.de/thema/klima-sti162637/" title="Klima" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Klimaschutzprojekt&quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:25,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}"> Klimaschutzprojekt</a> in der chinesischen Provinz der unterdrückten Uiguren. Am Ende stand dort laut <em>Welt</em> lediglich ein Hühnerstall. Recherchen deutscher Bioenergie-Unternehmen bestätigten den Vorfall.</p><p>Es existieren wohl mindestens 60 weitere und ähnlich gelagerte Verdachtsfälle in China. Der Schaden könnte sich auf mehr als 4,5 Milliarden Euro belaufen, wie das <em>Hauptstadtbüro Bioenergie</em> schätzt. Beim Hauptstadtbüro Bioenergie handelt es sich um eine Vertretung der Branche in Berlin.</p><p>Der Kern des vermutlichen Betrugs liegt in den Klimaschutzauflagen für Öl-Konzerne. Sie sind gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet, die von etwa Benzin und Diesel verursachten Emissionen jährlich zu senken. Die Kennzahlen dafür legt die Bundesregierung fest. Dabei reicht es nicht mehr, biologische Anteile in die Kraftstoffe zu mischen. Da so die Quoten nicht mehr erfüllt werden können.</p><h2>Behörden können zur Kontrolle der Klimaschutz-Projekte nicht in China einreisen</h2><p>Ein anderer vom Gesetzgeber vorgesehener Weg zur Einhaltung der THG-Quote ist die Möglichkeit, als Alternative im Ausland CO₂-Sparmaßnahmen zu finanzieren. Bei der Öl- und Gasförderung gibt es verschiedene technische Möglichkeiten, die Emissionen zu drücken. Mit der Reduzierung dieser sogenannten „Upstream-Emissionen“ – kurz UER – dürfen Konzerne seit 2020 ein Fünftel ihrer THG-Quoten erfüllen. Um die UER zu bestimmen, wird eine mögliche Menge an Emissionen der „grünen Anlage“ mit dem Wert verglichen, der entstünde, wenn die Förderungsanlagen nicht mit einem Projekt zur Minderung der Abgase gebaut worden wäre. Der Wert wird dabei über genormte Grundsätze nach ISO 14065 ermittelt. </p><p>Ölkonzerne können aber auch Zertifikate kaufen, die für eine Klimaschutz-Investition in eine Raffinerie oder andere Förderanlage stehen. Die Ausgaben für alle Vorhaben werden auf den Kraftstoffpreis an der Tankstelle umgelegt.</p><p>Das <a href="https://www.fr.de/politik/tbl-china-klimapolitik-treibhausgas-emissionen-co2-klimawandel-cop-28-entwicklungsland-zr-92405505.html" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle genehmigten &quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:33,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}">Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle genehmigten </a>75 dieser UER-Projekte – fast ausschließlich in China. Und das, obwohl weitere Hinweise dafür sprachen, besser nicht dort zu investieren. Denn China lässt unabhängige Kontrollen im eigenen Land nicht zu. Peking verweigert entsprechenden Prüfer:innen die Einreise.</p><p>„Das Ausmaß des Betrugs am Klimaschutz ist verheerend. Mehr als 7,6 Millionen Tonnen angeblicher CO₂-Einsparung hat es real nie gegeben. Das können wir jetzt nicht einfach mit einem Achselzucken abtun“, sagte Sandra Rostek dazu in einem Statement. Sie ist Leiterin des Hauptstadtbüros Bioenergie. „Hinweisgeber aus der Branche wurden von den Behörden abgewimmelt – noch vor wenigen Wochen wurden offenkundig gefälschte Projekte durchgewunken. Wir hoffen, dass vor dem Hintergrund der Recherche-Ergebnisse des <em>ZDF</em> die verantwortlichen Behörden endlich aufwachen.“</p><p>Was Rostek mit dem „Durchwinken“ meint, ist die anscheinend unzureichende Prüfung der Bauvorhaben durch das Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle. Über Satellitenbilder wäre einfach zu erkennen gewesen, dass einige der eingereichten chinesischen Vorhaben schon vor dem eigentlichen Baustart existiert haben.

By executing this well, Apple can guarantee that AI is a force multiplier that keeps even people using their devices longer, rather than pushing them to other upstart companies or competitive products.</span></p><p><span>Apple’s presentation rang very different than most AI keynotes we’ve seen in the last few years. While OpenAI and Google are trying to </span><em>prove</em><span> that they are the best at AI, Apple leaned into a narrative of what else we can do with AI.

Two companies, who should really be compliments, consistently try to one-up and out-position each other. A few months ago with the launch of Llama 3, Meta launched </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/meta-ai/" rel="">Meta AI</a><span>, which is generally available and rolling out to Meta’s 3 billion users. Meta AI is much more general. It is trying to be a chatbot, entertainment, and an information store. Its competition includes ChatGPT and all the other places people can go for this information. Meta AI should really be integrated next to ChatGPT into operating system features, but this is very unlikely.</span></p><p>Apple’s new features will be rolled out on its newest devices (e.g. iPhone 15 Pro and later, M1 Macs and later), which eventually can reach all of their 2 billion users as well. It presents a very different view of what AI is to the general public. Apple is framing what they built as being fundamentally different from ChatGPT, Claude, Meta AI, Gemini results, etc., and it is probably right.</p><p><span>While the many features they announced are interesting, and I will be upgrading my phone this cycle to try them out, they have an extremely high variance on how well they’ll land in the final product (e.g. how </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/" rel="">Microsoft Recall needed substantial updates post announcement</a><span> due to security issues). Photo generation, decent on-device generation, better Siri, textual Siri, webpage summaries, etc. all will serve different audiences. Today, beyond the focus on how transformative it is for billions of people to have access to AI rather than hundreds of millions, I want to dig into the interesting technical details Apple has shared with us.</span></p><p><span>All the evidence in WWDC and related communications, such as a </span><a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/introducing-apple-foundation-models" rel="">foundation model blog post</a><span>, showcase that Apple is right where it needs to be with AI on the technical side. Given the amount of AI products that are announced and never delivered, passing the bar on technical capabilities via clear communications with the ML community is important for independent monitoring of the performance of top labs (i.e. what I, and many investors, ML nerds, etc. all try to do). I split this summary into three core categories: 1) </span><strong>Core model performance</strong><span>, 2) </span><strong>adapter and on-device strategy</strong><span>, and 3) </span><strong>alignment strategies</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>The general approach that Apple is taking is highlighted in this </span><a href="https://x.com/MaxWinebach/status/1800277157135909005" rel="">great 6-minute video from the WWDC keynote</a><span>. In summary, Apple foundation models focus on personalization (alignment strategies), performance (core models), and size (on-device strategies). Only the last one is orthogonal from other developers out there, but it surely added substantial constraints that inspired the other two. </span></p><p>There are a lot of details in the blog post about their models, covering everything from safety to summarization to email completion. At the end of the day, most of these evaluations are extremely opaque, so I’m leaning on a lot of trust in the company's reputation and general context to make predictions on the actual quality of their models.</p><p>The most central figure to my analysis is the Apple human evaluation versus other top language models. This evaluation likely favors Apple by at least a few percentage points. The things they’re training these models for are explicitly different than what ChatGPT is — otherwise, why would Apple have the option to send any prompts to other services? These models are about things that iPhone users already could use AI for. Regardless, the scores are still solid enough to make a strong case.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png" width="1456" height="629" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:629,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:212746,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65e4c4f7-1cc6-442e-bfac-af1d43d66c25_2434x1052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>We can see that the on-device model, which is about 3 billion parameters, performs very well versus other models out there. Models like </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/gemma-google-ships-it" rel="">Gemma</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/phi-3-and-arctic-llms" rel="">Phi 3</a><span> are more research or marketing artifacts than models central to future business strategy, so Apple really ought to be crushing models here.</span></p><p>Apple’s Server Model is where things get a little more interesting. The models they’re comparing to, except GPT-4, mostly are considered B-tier by the community. This looks like 2 years after the release of GPT-4, Apple has approximately trained an original GPT-4 level model. This is likely not their ceiling, but the sweet spot they found with respect to their costs — again, the hardest tasks will be offloaded. Beating models like DBRX and Mixtral 8x22B is not trivial, yet it is where Apple should be. To beat the current GPT-4-Turbo, Apple likely needed to invest way more money than would be worth it (e.g. Meta’s GenAI / Metaverse level spending). It was reported that Apple “used a host of licensed content to train and fine-tune their models” like many big tech peers.</p><p><span>There are lots of noteworthy privacy features in the handling of the server model — </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web" rel="">secure enclave</a><span>, secure boot, encryption, no persistent storage, etc. — the combination of which Apple is going to make public so security researchers can verify their claims of privacy. Apple is serving this model entirely on its own infrastructure, which is likely the only way this level of privacy could be achieved (so Google may be able to do something similar if they want to too).</span></p><p>I wasn’t expecting to write about this, but Apple buried a revealing paragraph about fine-tuning techniques. in their foundation model blog post (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p><span>We find that data quality is essential to model success, so we utilize a hybrid data strategy in our training pipeline, incorporating both human-annotated and synthetic data, and conduct thorough data curation and filtering procedures. We have developed two novel algorithms in post-training: (1) a </span><strong>rejection sampling fine-tuning algorithm with teacher committee</strong><span>, and (2) a reinforcement learning from human feedback </span><strong>(RLHF) algorithm with mirror descent policy optimization</strong><span> and a </span><strong>leave-one-out advantage estimator</strong><span>. We find that these two algorithms lead to significant improvement in the model’s instruction-following quality.</span></p></blockquote><p>The bookends of this paragraph are pretty standard — use all the quality data you can get (human and synthetic) and the right algorithm, and you’ll get great performance out of your model. The algorithmic details are interesting because they are so specific with respect to existing literature.</p><p><span>First, rejection sampling with the teacher committee looks like an extension of the rejection sampling approach that was used for Llama 2, Llama 3, Qwen 2, and more models. </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06657" rel="">Rejection sampling</a><span> is a simple idea to generate completions from your model, rank them by a reward model (trained separately), and then use the language modeling loss again to fine-tune your model on the top texts. The new thing introduced is a “teacher committee,” which is very likely to be building on the extensive work that has been appearing around using </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09244" rel="">reward model ensembles</a><span> (or </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12187" rel="">merging</a><span>) to </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16635" rel="">improve performance</a><span>. Ensembles, in principle, improve performance by giving a more robust and or calibrated reward signal.</span></p><p><span>The second algorithm is far more interesting (and technical, so bear with me). They put a direct reference to an older RL algorithm that never really got a ton of traction (e.g. it isn’t implemented in most popular RL libraries) and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09814" rel="">mirror descent policy optimization</a><span> (MDPO). This algorithm is similar to </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347" rel="">proximal policy optimization</a><span> (PPO), the algorithm you hear about a lot when people discuss RLHF, but solves the problem in a different way. PPO, and its predecessor </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477" rel="">TRPO</a><span>, optimize what they call a “surrogate objective” that looks like maximizing a value with respect to a constraint on a “trust region.” Instead of a constraint, MDPO looks like a penalty (and there are many other details). </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/putting_rl_back_in_rlhf_with_rloo" rel="">Leave-one-out error</a><span> is likely an implementation detail of that algorithm that is grounded broadly in ML theory.</span></p><p>The MDPO offers some great intuitions on how the algorithms relate to each other, and how parts of them may impact current RLHF approaches. Let’s start with a comparison of PPO and TRPO, from the paper (additions mine):</p><blockquote><p>PPO takes a more relaxed approach [than TRPO] and updates its policies by solving an unconstrained optimization problem in which the ratio of the new to old policies is clipped to remain bounded.</p></blockquote><p>This, though, can result in some numerical issues in practice.</p><blockquote><p><span>This phenomenon, which has been reported in (</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07940" rel="">Wang et al., 2019</a><span>) and (</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12729" rel="">Engstrom et al., 2020</a><span>), shows that clipping in PPO does not prevent the policy ratios to go out of bound, but it only reduces its probability. This means that despite using clipping, PPO does not guarantee that the trust-region constraint is always satisfied. In fact, recent results, including those in (Engstrom et al., 2020) and our experiments in Section 5.3, show that most of the improved performance exhibited by PPO is due to code-level optimization techniques, such as learning rate annealing, observation and reward normalization, and in particular, the use of generalized advantage estimation (GAE).</span></p></blockquote><p>This is essentially saying that PPO works due to implementation tricks and not exactly due to its designed objective, which MDPO tries to fix. The key differences between MDPO and PPO are that:</p><ul><li><p>MDPO updates are on the “entire dataset” rather than batches. With this, MDPO can be run in an on-policy and an off-policy manner.</p></li><li><p>MDPO uses a different scheduling of KL distance (which may not exist in the RLHF version relative to the original paper).</p></li><li><p><span>MDPO uses opposite direction of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence" rel="">KL</a><span>. The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence is a directional measure of distance between two distributions that is not symmetric. PPO does KL distance the old policy to the new policy and MDPO the opposite. Intuitively, this is a change between information gain and loss of the policy, where one direction penalizes the loss of high-probability tokens and the other penalizes the creation of new behaviors. MDPO, being the latter, could potentially explore better.</span></p></li></ul><p>The key takeaway is that seeing new algorithms for RLHF is exciting because it is very unlikely that the current PPO implementations are actually optimal for our final goals, so this will encourage more experimentation across the industry.</p><p><span>Realistically, all the details aside, Apple is most likely to innovate here due to their deep company culture of creating </span><em>personal</em><span> products. I’m excited to keep tabs on what they build, as true personalization is a large blindspot in the RLHF literature and discourse.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.interconnects.ai/p/apple-intelligence?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/apple-intelligence?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>Apple has done a ton of things to put all of this together on their devices. They figured out how to train great models that use just the right amount of memory with quantization, how to train many adapters that work with different apps or styles, how to get fast latency speeds, and much more they didn’t talk about. This is very serious ML system engineering of a different flavor than large models and large request count handling.</p><p><span>This on-device stage relies on a lot of groundwork that Apple has built in the past, such as </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents" rel="">App Intents</a><span>, which is a standard way for apps to expose their functionality to automation apps and Siri. Apple has successfully trained a small language model to speak the same functional language. In the WWDC keynote, Apple explained that they focused on fine-tuning specific models for specific tasks, which is likely the 12 categories of applications they will be supporting when this launches.</span></p><p>Apple fine-tuned a batch of adapters for the small model that are loaded into memory when the prompt is detected to need them. What I’m not sure about is how the multi-app sequences showcased in the keynote are handled. When Apple Intelligence is asked “Can I make it to my daughter’s play in time,” the example Craig used, are each of the adapters loaded sequentially, or are they applied and mixed together? This sort of technical magic I don’t expect to get an answer to, but represents a serious investment, especially with the high-quality bar that Apple has.</p><p><span>It’s extremely validating for the local model community that a model that takes only 1 GB of memory to load when quantized, and another 3.2GB to run inference for can do so much. As Apple expands the memory footprint of their devices to accommodate a larger AI narrative, they have easy performance to gain by just dropping the quantization levels a bit.

The price of building material and construction labor can fluctuate, sure, but not by enough to explain the massive surge in housing costs. The key driver of housing scarcity is actually </span><em>land</em><span> scarcity – you can always build more houses, but there’s a limited amount of land to build them on, especially in desirable locations close to jobs where people actually want to live.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, those that already own land often become “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY" rel="">NIMBYs</a><span>” who lobby for restrictive building and zoning policies that restrict </span><em>other </em><span>landowners from building, because more housing could help meet demand, in turn lowering the market value of the NIMBY’s existing properties.</span></p><p><span>A land crisis is therefore a root cause of a housing crisis, and ultimately affects not just housing, but </span><a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/" rel="">the entire economy at large</a><span>.

Any kind of durable upgrade or stationary investment counts as an “improvement.” Land Value Taxes tax </span><em>only</em><span> the land, and leaves the improvements untaxed.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Heavily tax squatting on land</strong><br><span>By placing a heavy tax on the land asset, you make it expensive to simply buy land and hold it for no reason, or for speculative reasons (waiting for the price to go up).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Incentivizes adding profitable improvements to land</strong><br><span>Players should only want to buy land if they plan to build something productive on top of it that at the very least pays the land tax. This is a strong incentive to build useful stuff instead of just squatting and sucking up rent, or holding the land out of use and waiting for its value to go up.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Note that Land Value Tax behaves differently from a conventional </span><em>Property Tax</em><span>. Property taxes tax both the land </span><em>and</em><span> its improvements, and can lead to perverse incentives (such as punishing you for building stuff, and rewarding you for keeping it vacant). The key is to tax the land and </span><em>only</em><span> the land.</span></p><p><span>But why just land? Because assets that are truly "land-like" are special - they gatekeep access to core features and/or economic privileges, and </span><em>you can't make any more of them</em><span>. That makes it easy for landowners to collectively corner the market on land and dictate terms to everybody else.</span></p><p><span>Without LVT – i.e., the typical status quo – It will be expensive to </span><em>buy</em><span> land, but cheap to </span><em>hold</em><span> land.

There are constructs that look and behave a lot like land. But this is an illusion and the details of how land is implemented matter immensely.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Rent</strong><span>: The mechanic of players renting to other players is rather rare in traditional games, but is becoming particularly popular in blockchain games. A common purpose of such a feature is to offer a way for players to engage with the economy when crucial assets have very high prices. Of course, those high prices are themselves often a symptom of a virtual world designed as a financial vehicle first and a game second. But suffice it to say, some games let you rent assets to other players, with the return of the asset upon expiry of the contract enforced by software rather than courts of law.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Taxes</strong><span>: Virtual worlds tend to use faucet-and-drain economies where digital assets can be created and destroyed on whim. Virtual taxes generally act as yet another arbitrary sink, often in service of a player incentive. Much of real-world concerns about levying taxes to pay for communal services barely apply.</span></p></li></ul><p>It is easy to just assume that everyone knows what “land” is. But in virtual worlds these need to be recreated from first principles. Certain assumptions become design choices. Is land finite? In the real world, that’s obviously true. In the virtual world, it is a choice. And how does “location” work? In the real world we take Euclidean geometry and conventional physics for granted – you can’t be in two places at once, you can’t instantly warp from one location to another, etc., but these need not be so in a virtual world.</p><p>With all that properly understood, let’s talk about how to actually implement a digital Land Value Tax in a virtual world.</p><p>There are four basic steps to implementing a digital Land Value Tax policy:</p><ol><li><p>Identify “land-like assets”</p></li><li><p>Separate “improvements” from “land”</p></li><li><p>Discover the full market value of land (ideally as both rental income and as selling value)</p></li><li><p>Levy a Land Value Tax that captures 85-100% of land rents</p></li></ol><p>There are a few other baseline requirements that your virtual world must first fulfill for this to work, of course:</p><ol><li><p>Land must be tradeable</p></li><li><p>There must be some kind of currency to levy the tax in</p></li></ol><p><span>Keep in mind that if </span><em>you</em><span> don’t make land tradeable, or provide some sort of currency for your economy, players may simply provide both features themselves. If land cannot be formally traded between accounts in-game, players will form a black market to buy, sell, and trade accounts out-of-game, or provide services that do whatever it takes to move an asset from one account and into another one. And if you don’t provide an official currency, players will find some other commodity in game to stand in for one and use that.</span></p><p>Your first step should be to evaluate your design and identify land-like assets. But what is a “land-like asset”? Generally speaking it’s any thing you can own that fulfills three requirements:</p><ol><li><p><span>Is </span><strong>strictly scarce</strong><span> and </span><strong>cannot be produced</strong></p></li><li><p><span>Is </span><strong>necessary for production or gameplay</strong></p></li><li><p><span>Is </span><strong>more or less valuable because of its location</strong></p></li></ol><p>(Also, it goes without saying that the asset must have a significant degree of persistence and be identifiable to the community – if it’s ephemeral or highly instanced it’s not a good candidate for a land-like asset)</p><p><span>The asset must be something that players cannot make. It needs to be essentially finite in supply, pre-provided by the developers themselves as part of “the world,” and come with the </span><em>expectation that only a certain amount of it will be provided</em><span>.</span></p><p>Occasional expansions in the land supply weaken this property but don’t necessarily break it.

Taking our network graph from before, let's say each node represents a piece of land, the size of the node represents the market value of its "inherent" developer-provided resources and affordances, and lines connecting nodes represent travel connections. Let's say owning a plot entitles you to everything it produces as well as to charge a fee for people and goods to move across it.</p><p>Which one of these nodes is most valuable?

This is a textbook example of a digital land-like asset, despite the thematic set dressing of a “factory.”</span></p></div><p>Much of the value generated in a virtual world is social capital. We often think of value in terms of ‘stuff’ but in a virtual economy assets are mostly illusionary. What isn’t an illusion is our relative relationships inside the virtual world with other human beings. They are real, we are real and we care deeply about our standing with others.</p><div><p><span>Land-like assets have adjacency to those other people. They help codify and mediate relationships, status and social support.</span></p><p><span>If you look carefully, you can track large portions of location value to social network adjacencies with either strong benefits or lowered costs. To consider Manhattan again, the land is primarily valuable because of the proximity to all the people here and the services they provide.

In </span><em>CQXII</em><span>, resources are gathered from land, and all structures must be built on land. This makes access to land “necessary for production” because without land you can’t participate in major parts of the game. Finally, the location of the land matters. As other players regularly gather in particular locations, land closer to those settlements will become more valuable. This is due to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration" rel="">agglomeration effect</a><span>. </span><em>CQXII</em><span> land is a fully land-like asset, and thus a prime asset for speculators that will yield the greatest returns.</span></p><p><span>These are tradeable deeds granted by in-game authorities and are similar to real-world </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_medallion" rel="">taxi medallions</a><span>. Players who wish to engage in certain economic activities such as building temples or brewing potions must first obtain the respective permit from the priest’s guild or the witch’s guild. Each guild issues only a fixed number of permits, but within its own category, one permit is as good as any other. In this sense permits are non-unique and thus “fungible.” Permits are necessary for production because the game will literally not allow you to do certain things without the right permit in your inventory. Permits have many properties in common with land in that they gate-keep access to the economy: an enterprising witch doesn’t have to brew her own potions, she can let an apprentice operate under her permit and charge the apprentice rent for the privilege. However, permits aren’t tied to a particular location and thus don’t obtain locational value the same way land does. They’re somewhat land-like, but not all the way there. There will be speculative interest in permits, but not as much as in land.</span></p><p><span>Unicorns are a special kind of mount in </span><em>CQXII</em><span>. They aren’t necessary for production, but they are very nice to have because they are swift, loyal, and impervious to all forms of harm. Only 10,000 unicorns exist on any given server, and the developers have sworn to never create any more. Since Unicorns aren’t tied to a particular location, they don’t obtain locational value. The only way unicorns are “land-like” is that they are scarce in supply. But because they aren’t truly necessary for production, it’s not a big deal if you don’t own a unicorn. There is some speculative interest in holding unicorns due to their scarcity. That said, in the long term most of the value of bids will be based on their inherent utility, given that unicorn ownership doesn’t gatekeep participation in the economy itself.</span></p><p>Horses are a common type of mount. They are very useful and nice to have, but they aren’t necessary for production, they aren’t scarce, and they don’t obtain locational value. If you want to buy a horse all you have to do is go to your local horse breeder and buy one. And if that particular breeder won’t sell you one, another one will. Worst case scenario, you can just go out into the wild and try to tame a wild stallion yourself. Horses have little speculative interest because owning one doesn’t grant you any real leverage over anybody else; their value is entirely derived from their utility.</p><p>The next step is to distinguish between land-like assets and “improvements” that have been made to or built upon them. In the real world the most typical example of an “improvement” is a building, but technically speaking anything that makes land more valuable that comes from applying labor or capital counts as an improvement. Plowing a field, irrigating it, or planting an orchard on it all count as improvements. In the context of a game both “upgrades” and “buildings” count as “improvements.”</p><p><span>If your game does </span><em>not </em><span>include any features whereby players may “improve” on land-like-assets, then there is nothing to be done here. In that case, all you need to do is ensure that there is a healthy sale and/or rental market so that you can derive land purchase prices and rental income directly from observation. If there are improvement mechanisms (such as building construction), then you must take special care in your implementation to make it as easy as possible to separate the market value of improvements from the market value of unimproved land.</span></p><p>In the real world, separating land from improvements is a complex but feasible task. You should therefore be able to implement a Land Value Tax in almost any kind of online multiplayer game with much less difficulty than in the real world. There are, however, certain choices that could make your job easier.</p><p>If you take good care to log all market transactions from the game’s first day of operation, you give yourself a huge advantage that would make real-world assessors green with envy. Having complete and comprehensive data makes any numerical estimation method much more powerful. This assumes of course that your economy is healthy and is not pushing a large volume of transactions off onto a black market that is invisible to you.</p><p>The greatest affordance we have in the digital world is that we can, in principle, move any player-created structure or improvement anywhere we want. We may still wish to constrain players’ ability to do this themselves, but the point is that the power is available to the game developers. It is perfectly feasible to let the player pluck the house off a plot of land, stuff it in their inventory, and sell the land bare.</p><p><span>In the real world, most houses can’t be trivially moved from one spot to another, and even then no two houses are </span><em>exactly </em><span>alike – especially considering varying amounts of wear and tear. In the digital world it is perfectly plausible for certain structures to be perfectly interchangeable commodities, and degradation of virtual goods doesn’t exist unless you explicitly implement it. This makes it much easier to assess the value of improvements as there is less variation to consider between assets.</span></p><p>In order to levy a Land Value Tax, we must first assess the value of land. And what do we mean by “land value?” There’s two different kinds:</p><ol><li><p><span>Land </span><em>selling</em><span> value</span></p></li><li><p><span>Recurring land </span><em>income</em></p></li></ol><div><p><span>Land income drives land selling value (aka land price), not the other way around. The amount someone is willing to pay for land is the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp" rel="">net present value </a><span>of the recurring income the land generates – the amount of money you expect the land to produce over some time horizon, adjusted for how patient you are. This income can be literal monetary income, benefits the land provides that someone is willing to pay money for, or a mix of both.</span></p><p><span>In any case, whether you’re assessing selling value or income, all assessments are based on a simple algebraic equation:</span></p></div><p><em><strong>T = I + L</strong></em><br><em><strong>T</strong><span>otal Market Value </span><strong>= </strong><span>(</span><strong>I</strong><span>mprovements Value) + (</span><strong>L</strong><span>and Value)</span></em></p><p>If you know any two of these values, you can derive the third, known as the “residual.”</p><div><p><span>But we must also take care to assess at </span><em>full market value. </em><span>Full market value specifically means the value an asset would obtain in the market under “fair and unconstrained” conditions. As a counter-example, if your dad sells you a valuable plot of land for $1, he’s intentionally selling it for less than full market value; he’s essentially giving you a gift. So we should exclude any such non-"arm’s length" transactions as a basis for assessments.</span></p><p><span>The goal is to discover the full market selling value of every land parcel in our virtual world. We have three main ways we can do this:</span></p></div><ol><li><p>Assessment</p></li><li><p>Short-term leases with auctions</p></li><li><p><span>Harberger taxes</span><br><span>a. Modified Harberger Taxes</span><br><span>b. Blood Taxes</span></p></li></ol><p><span>In the real world, property assessors use a variety of complex methods for estimating the value of land separately from that of buildings, typically something like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_regression" rel="">hedonic regression</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the digital world, we can just accept separate bids on the land and the improvements for any given property in the game, and thus generate cleanly separated valuations directly from the market. Any player may offer to buy </span><em>just the land</em><span> or </span><em>just the improvements</em><span>. If the land alone is sold, the improvements are stuffed into the owner’s inventory. If the improvements are sold, they go into the buyer’s inventory and the owner’s land becomes bare.</span></p><p>This allows you to collect true market data about how players value land and improvements separately.</p><p><span>To estimate the value of assets that have not had recent market transactions, you compare those to recently sold comparable properties in the area, making adjustments for differences. In practice you can automate this procedure with either a linear regression model or a machine learning model that uses a dataset built from your observed market transactions and the properties of your assets (with location being a highly salient property). You will want to ensure that your model not only has predictive value for the hold-out set of data you use to evaluate the model during training, but also that it </span><em>actually accurately predicts the value of future transactions</em><span>.</span></p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><p>Good price discovery</p></li><li><p>Can be retrofitted into an existing land economy</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Requires you to do math and book-keeping</p></li></ul><p>There are other ways to perform price discovery of land-like assets for the purposes of levying an LVT, or even replacing LVT with a different kind of policy that achieves many of the same goals. Let’s look at those next.</p><p>In this model the “government” (ie the developer) “owns” the actual title to all the land in the game, and simply leases it out. Every player becomes a de-facto tenant and must renew their lease at the end of the rental term.</p><p><span>At the end of the rental term, the land goes up for auction, and the player who wins the auction becomes the next holder of the land. There are many, many, kinds of auctions, but a popular one for this sort of purpose is the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction" rel="">Vickrey Auction</a><span> – all bids are secret, the winner is whoever gives the highest bid, and the price the winner pays is the amount of the </span><em>second highest</em><span> bid. The advantage of this kind of auction is that each bidder is incentivized to bid the maximum amount the asset is actually worth to them, without worrying about what others are likely to bid. This is because if the bidder wins the auction, they will not pay the amount of their own bid, but the lower amount bid by whoever came in second place. In the event that there is only one bidder, that person wins the auction regardless of what they bid, the "next highest bid" is zero, and the asset may be had for free.</span></p><p>Although it is essential that bids are kept secret from other bidders, the game developer can and should access that information for purposes of price discovery. Once the auction has been conducted we have three things: 1) a willing buyer, 2) a winning market price, and 3) a range of bids.</p><p>The downside to this approach is that it’s more aggressive than an LVT. Land Value Taxes are an ongoing signal to the player to make the best use of their land or sell it to someone who will, but the choice is still ultimately theirs. When a short-term lease expires, the owner could lose the land simply by losing the auction. Also, land income values cannot be reassessed by this method on any more frequent time interval than the term of the lease itself, whereas the traditional methods could (in theory) reassess values on any schedule.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><p>Simple to implement</p></li><li><p>Excellent price discovery</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Exposes the landowner to the risk of a forced sale at the end of the auction term</p></li><li><p>Harder to retrofit into an existing game, best implemented from the start</p></li></ul><div><p><span>This method was popularized by the book </span><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177502/radical-markets" rel="">Radical Markets</a><span>. In this system everyone self-assesses the value of their own property. They just come up with a number and write it down, that’s the value of their property. In our case, we would only need to have players do this for land-like assets.</span></p><p><span>Two crucial things happen next:</span></p></div><ol><li><p>Players pay taxes based on that valuation</p></li><li><p><em>Anyone </em><span>has the right to purchase the asset for that valuation in a forced sale</span></p></li></ol><p>This unusual method is supposed to balance incentives: you have an incentive to not value your item too high to avoid paying taxes, but you also have an incentive to not value your item too low lest it be bought off of you. Ideally a rational player will be forced to discover the true market value of their asset in this way. A price that is not so high you can’t bear to pay the taxes, but is not so low that you’d be unwilling to take that much money in exchange for it.</p><p>To put it another way:</p><p>Most people would accept an offer to buy their house for a billion dollars, but not for 1 dollar.</p><div><p><span>Most people would be glad to pay an annual X% tax on 1 dollar, but not on a billion dollars.</span></p><p><span>The entire idea of Harberger taxes is to find the sweet spot in the middle of that range, for every piece of property. This could be one way for getting players themselves to conduct price discovery for land-like assets.</span></p><p><span>There are downsides. For one, it assumes a certain level of sophistication on the user’s behalf. One can easily imagine novice players under- or over- pricing assets and running into trouble. There could also be innocent mistakes with huge consequences such as misplacing a decimal point or a zero. If you try to ameliorate this with some auto-populated default value, players will probably heavily gravitate towards it, defeating the point of the self-assessment.</span></p><p><span>This method can also force the current landowner off the property with little notice and no recourse, which is a huge issue and likely makes it a non-starter for many virtual worlds.</span></p><p><span>There </span><em>are</em><span> proposed ways to modify Harberger Tax schemes to get around the abrupt forced sale problem, but they make the implementation even more complex.</span></p></div><p><span>In classic Harberger taxes, if a buyer is willing to pay more than the valuation, they get it right away. In a modified version proposed by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FabricioNakata/status/1434081416778682374" rel="">Fabricio Nakata</a><span>, you instead make the prospective buyer put their offer money into an escrow account (this is an implementation detail that the game developer would manage). The owner may then decide to either accept the offer or reject it.</span></p><p>If they reject the offer, the property’s valuation immediately rises to match the value of the rejected offer, and the rejected buyer is rewarded with a bounty – an amount equal to the additional tax that will now be levied because of the increased valuation (for e.g. 1-2 months or whatever the appropriate duration of time is). If the owner of the property wants their assessment lowered, they may do so by changing their self-valuation, but must put money in a “bounty bond” account that is sufficient to pay out the bounty if someone comes along and offers a higher price for the property and the owner chooses to reject it.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><p>Excellent price discovery</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Exposes the landowner to forced sales (in classic Harberger)</p></li><li><p>Larger complexity burden (in modified Harberger)</p></li><li><p>Punishes simple mistakes and unsophisticated players</p></li></ul><p>There’s another way to modify the concept of Harberger Taxes, specifically in the context of video games, which we call “Blood Taxes.”</p><div><p><span>If you squint, Harberger Taxes look a little bit like balancing the costs of attacking and defending territory, only with money instead of weapons. The player wants to invest a certain amount in “defense” to protect their land, but not so much that they consume more resources than the land is worth, defeating the point of holding it in the first place. Since we’re talking about video games here, there’s no reason you couldn’t implement such a system with actual attacking and actual defending.</span></p><p><span>Redirecting a portion of land income to building fortifications and garrisoning defenders is akin to paying taxes, and funding an invading army to seize the land is akin to offering a buyout price. Since it is typically much cheaper to defend something than to attack it, the attacker must spend proportionately more to seize the land than it costs for the defender to protect it. The attacker is willing to do this because the ultimate prize is the recurring income of the land. If the attacker can push the defender to the point where all their income is gobbled up by defense spending, the defender may even choose to simply abandon the territory rather than keep up the fight.</span></p><p><span>The “price” here is ultimately paid in “blood” rather than in money, and the “taxes” aren’t collected by anyone, but this is a video game where taxes often just go straight into a sink, so there’s not much difference on that score.</span></p><p><span>Naively, “blood taxes” are more akin to a </span><em>property </em><span>tax rather than a land tax, because if invaders can capture improvements built by the defenders, that could serve to increase the price attackers are willing to pay and that defenders must respond to. To make sure blood taxes only fall on land, one would need to modify the gameplay such that improvements cannot be seized by an invading army, only the bare land. There are two ways to do this. One is to instantly raze all improvements on conquered land (a hefty transaction cost to the “seller” that imposes significant deadweight loss). Another way would be to pluck the vanquished defender’s castle off the land, stick it in the defender’s pocket as a consolation prize, and send them on their way. Giving defeated players some portion of the value of their destroyed base is a fairly common mechanic already, so this fits in.</span></p><p><span>Virtual world economies are driven by faucets and drains and must constantly sink value to stave off the ever-present specter of runaway inflation, so this particular implementation isn’t as outlandish as it first appears.</span></p><p><span>The biggest limitation to blood taxes is that the thematic set dressing and PVP framing is not appropriate for every type of game and should thus not be regarded as a universal solution.</span></p><p><span>Pros:</span></p></div><ul><li><p>No worrying about market transactions and taxes, just let people fight</p></li><li><p>Don't bore players to death with tax policy, just kill them to death</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Needs modification otherwise it’s just a property tax</p></li><li><p>Exposes the landowner to straight-up violent conquest</p></li><li><p>Inefficiency of war causes “assessment errors” for both attackers and defenders</p></li><li><p>Requires a battle and conquest mechanic</p></li><li><p>Changing the battle system could have unintended economic consequences</p></li></ul><p>Every game is different so we can't point to any specific price discovery solution as universally appropriate. But generally speaking we rank them in this order:</p><ol><li><p>Short-term leases</p></li><li><p>Assessment</p></li><li><p>Harberger Taxes</p></li></ol><p>Short-term leases with Vickrey auctions are simple and give you direct access to land income market values, but they can be harder to retrofit into existing games.</p><p>Assessment can work well and can be used to drop an LVT policy into an existing game, but you'll need to do some math and carefully track transaction records.</p><p>Harberger Taxes are interesting and theoretically brilliant, but are probably a hard sell to players and raise UX concerns.</p><p>That said, all of these are excellent candidates, and you should evaluate all of the choices and make the right decision for your particular game. Even better, get your game economist to run a controlled A/B experiment. If you do, write to us and tell us the results!</p><div><p><span>Okay, so we’ve identified the land-like assets, we’ve separated land from improvements, and we’ve accurately assessed the full market selling value of all the land. What’s next?</span></p><p><span>The next step is to actually levy the tax. Decide on a time interval (say, once a month), pick a tax rate to apply, and then charge landowners the tax. If someone doesn’t pay their tax, the land is confiscated and sold at auction to the public (throw in a grace period if you feel like, it's your virtual world).</span></p></div><p><span>Orthodox Georgism proposes a tax rate of 85-100% on the </span><em>recurring rental income </em><span>generated by land. The basic idea is that the </span><strong>selling price of land should approach zero</strong><span>. Let that be your north star: if land still has a large selling price, your LVT is too low. If land is being abandoned and players have to be paid to hold it (the selling price is negative), then your LVT is too high.</span></p><p>Wait! That’s weird!</p><p>If we levy a Land Value Tax, and we get it exactly right, and the price of the land goes to zero, and we base the tax on the land value, which is now zero… isn’t there a problem here?</p><p>This is a common point of confusion, but it's actually not that hard to disentangle it. First let's nail down some precise terms:</p><p><strong>Land Selling Value</strong><span>, refers to the actual selling price of land in the market, which “prices in” any taxes the holder of the land has to pay.</span></p><div><p><strong>Land Income</strong><span>, is the market value of the recurring benefit that the land itself produces. </span><em>It is land income that drives land selling value, not the other way around. </em><span>Land Income is </span><em>unchanged</em><span> by Land Value Tax. The land’s productivity doesn’t go down. But the Land Selling Value </span><em>does</em><span> change.</span></p><p><span>Bear with us while we step through some math and explain. Here's the formula for Land Selling Value:</span></p></div><p><em><strong>S = (I - T) / D</strong></em></p><div><p><em><span>Land </span><strong>S</strong><span>elling Value = (Land </span><strong>I</strong><span>ncome - Land </span><strong>T</strong><span>axes) / </span><strong>D</strong><span>iscount Rate</span></em></p><p><strong>Discount Rate</strong><span> represents how much one values a dollar today versus a dollar tomorrow. Even if some land could theoretically generate an infinite amount of benefits if I held on to it forever, I'm not going to live that long. I care about my investment's value tomorrow, and next year, and maybe even over the next few decades, but I don't care about it's value in 5,000 years. The less patient I am, the higher my discount rate, and the less I'm willing to pay for the same piece of income-generating land.</span></p></div><p>Here are some example calculations using a 5% annual discount rate, showing how a change in land taxes affects the selling value:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png" width="1028" height="331" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:331,&quot;width&quot;:1028,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27348,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><div><p><span>What this example hopefully makes clear is that </span><strong>LVT is a tax on the recurring land income</strong><em><strong>, </strong></em><strong>not the selling price</strong><span>. We are not proposing a recurring tax anywhere close to the actual full purchase price of a plot of land.</span></p><p><span>If your game has a rental mechanic then you should have lots of transaction records for the rental price of land. This should allow you to build a model that gives you an accurate assessed rental income value for every piece of land. Tax that at 85-100%, and adjust accordingly until you observe that the land’s selling price is approximately zero. You don’t need to get it perfect, in fact it’s preferable to undershoot the Land Value Tax by a little bit just to be safe (hence the 85% lower bound).</span></p></div><p><span>Evidence suggests you can see good results even without a perfectly calibrated 100% LVT. Economist Ramin Shokrizade, with no formal knowledge of Georgist theory, </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-i-used-eve-online-to-predict-the-great-recession" rel="">fixed </a><em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-i-used-eve-online-to-predict-the-great-recession" rel="">EVE Online</a></em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-i-used-eve-online-to-predict-the-great-recession" rel="">’s land recession</a><span> simply by directing CCP Games to assess a “high enough” holding fee to land-like spaceship factories, which had the effect of dissuading speculators.</span></p><p>But what if you don’t have a rental mechanic or only have selling values in your transaction logs? In that case you’ll need to work out the land income indirectly.</p><p>The capitalization rate is the ratio between the selling price of land and how much income it generates for the owner. If you have a rental mechanic, you can calculate this ratio easily. But if you don’t, you’ll need to measure income in another way, such as assessing the market value of all the resources and other benefits that a player generates over a unit of time by holding the land.</p><p>For context, in the real world annual capitalization rates tend to be somewhere between 3-10% of the selling value of land. If you have absolutely no idea what an appropriate capitalization rate for your virtual world is, start by guessing somewhere in the 3-10% range, observe what happens to the selling price of land, and adjust up or down accordingly. Remember – your goal is to get the selling price of land to approach zero without going negative.</p><p>If you are levying a full 100% LVT, then the tax rate and the capitalization rate will be the same. If you are levying an 85% LVT, then the tax rate will be 85% of the capitalization rate.</p><p>Here are some examples of how land selling price and land rental income relate to the capitalization rate:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png" width="1032" height="382" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:382,&quot;width&quot;:1032,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27535,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Note that in the real world capitalization rates tend to vary both by location and by property type (commercial vs. residential, urban vs. rural, etc) and we would expect to see similar results in the digital world.

Look at the price of land in the market. If it’s close to zero, you’re doing a good job. If it’s a lot more than zero, there’s still a lot of uncollected land income. And if it’s </span><em>less</em><span> than zero, meaning you have to </span><em>pay</em><span> people to get them to willingly hold land, you’re taxing it too much.

The land’s fundamental productivity doesn’t change if you tax it, but </span><em>who </em><span>is collecting that same amount of land income does. You have the privilege of observing both the amount that you, the “government,” are collecting, as well as what any tenants are being charged. From these two figures you can always know the total amount. It’s on this basis that you can calculate the full untaxed market value of the land.</span></p><p><span>That said, you can also just guess, and then iteratively adjust the land taxes until the market responds with land prices approaching zero, knowing this signals that your tax rates are appropriate. What’s the land income for a parcel of land whose price has been driven to exactly 0?

What are we gonna do we do with it? Well, first it depends what kind of money you raised.</span></p></div><p><span>Most traditional MMO’s that lack “real money” economies will simply delete the money raised by an LVT. This is for two reasons: 1) the in-game currency is useless for funding real world development costs, and 2) the primary economic challenge of traditional MMO’s is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflation" rel="">MUDflation</a><span>, where endgame players accumulate lots of money with nothing to sink it in, flooding the market with currency and driving down the market price of high-end items. Given that housing is a traditional end-game “money sink” mechanic, LVT is a natural solution to this problem.</span></p><p><span>By “real money” we mean a game in which you can cash </span><em>out </em><span>virtual currency for real world currency through any number of intermediaries (black markets, crypto, paypal, banks, etc). There are plenty of systems in which you can only cash </span><em>in</em><span> real money (Steam Wallets are a good example), and these don't count.</span></p><div><p><span>If your economy runs on “real money,” two things change.</span></p><p><span>The first is you are much more vulnerable to having criminals use your game for money laundering and your players become valuable targets for account theft, but that is beyond the scope of this particular paper.</span></p></div><p>The second thing that changes is that the same currency players use to trade in-game could also obtain real world value for you, the developer. What can you do with the money?</p><ol><li><p><strong>Keep it. </strong><span>Because why not?</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Employee bonuses. </strong><span>Give it to your employees, they deserve it.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Reinvest it.</strong><span> </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George_theorem" rel="">The Henry George Theorem</a><span>, derived by Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, predicts that spending on “pure public goods” causes land values to rise proportionately, and other research suggests that a partial effect holds for other kinds of public spending. A real-money LVT game could use the stimulating effects of LVT on user generated content, and the tendency of “public spending” by the developer on new features to soak into land values, and set up a self-funding flywheel.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Universal Basic Income.</strong><span> Henry George was an early proponent of what we now call UBI, called a “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen's_dividend" rel="">Citizen’s Dividend</a><span>” in his time. You take the taxes collected by LVT and share them out equally among your players. In this way your player base, which is one of the key things that makes your game grow in value, are at least partially compensated for the value they are creating. In the digital world this immediately throws up some red flags about who gets to count as a player. You will have to avoid the problem of people signing up under 10 different accounts to get multiple UBI payments.</span></p></li></ol><p>If you're building a virtual world that includes land-like assets, you need to be careful about perverse incentives that can attract land speculators who will suck all the fun out of your game and crash your in-game economy.</p><p>To fix this, you must identify land-like assets, separate the value of "improvements" from that of "land," measure the selling value and/or recurring income of the land, and then levy a Land Value Tax that captures 85-100% of the land income. This creates a "use it or lose it" holding fee that properly aligns incentives, ensuring that only people who want to use land-like assets for their actual intended purpose will hold onto them.</p><p>But a few questions still linger.</p><div><p><span>The good news is that, having exhaustively investigated Blockchain and NFT technology, we conclude that there is nothing in current practice (and very little in theory) that can be done in games with these technologies that cannot be accomplished just as easily (or more easily) with conventional solutions.</span></p><p><span>So if you’re making a Blockchain or NFT game, anything in this policy paper should be just as applicable, with the exception that you are in a worse position for adjudicating disputes as you lack the power to reverse fraudulent transactions and </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=axie%20infinity%20hack" rel="">hacks</a><span> that occur on an immutable blockchain. Also, the high valuations currently chasing blockchain games will also give you a much more aggressive set of financially motivated bad actors to contend with.</span></p><p><span>Good luck!</span></p></div><p><span>Yes, you certainly can. If land supply can increase as necessary, that makes it less scarce, which makes the asset less "land-like" economically speaking. This is </span><em><a href="https://secondlife.com/" rel="">Second Life</a></em><span>'s approach to land, more or less.</span></p><p><span>But creating more land isn't always a solution. Maybe your server cost structure has limits, so you can't just spin up tons of new housing blocks (as is commonly alleged about </span><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em><span>).</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, it's hard to escape the agglomeration effect. Land has value for three reasons: location, location, location. This comes from proximity to centers of economic activity, valuable resources, and most importantly, people. So even on an infinite plane, some locations will always be more valuable than others. America has plenty of empty land, but a patch of desert is no replacement for New York City. Likewise, </span><em>Ultima Online</em><span> has plenty of servers, but there's no replacement for the Atlantic shard.</span></p><p><span>This is the case for a lot of blockchain games like </span><em><a href="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/p/0c8f89fe-cf3f-4809-9eba-4fe050405ca5/decentraland.org/" rel="">Decentraland</a></em><span>, </span><em><a href="https://axieinfinity.com/" rel="">Axie Infinity</a></em><span>, and </span><em><a href="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/p/0c8f89fe-cf3f-4809-9eba-4fe050405ca5/sandbox.game/en/" rel="">The Sandbox</a></em><span>, who have sold millions of dollars worth of land in advance of most (or any) of their land-based features coming online.</span></p><p>We're sorry to say this, but you might be hosed.</p><p>When you pre-sell land, you attract a certain class of investor who expects a return on that asset. And because you've used both the metaphor and the mechanics of land from the real world, they're expecting it will play out the same way: buy land when it's cheap, wait for people to move in and start building stuff, and see the investment rise in value.</p><p>When the predictable land crisis hits, you are faced with two terrible choices:</p><p><span>1. Protect land scarcity, angering the landless and cutting off user growth, OR</span><br><span>2. Make concessions to the landless, sparking a landowner revolt</span></p><p><span>There's signs of the second one starting to bubble in the Axie Infinity community as we speak, it wasn't hard to find responses like these in the wake of a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOZN61kdnBI" rel="">Q&amp;A about their upcoming land gameplay</a><span>:</span></p><p><span>We don't envy anyone who has painted themselves into this corner</span><em>. </em><span>Our best advice to everyone else is to not put yourself there in the first place.</span></p><p>Building a virtual world is no easy task, but by George, you can do this.</p><p>And Land Value Tax can help.</p><p><em><span>Originally published on </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/land-value-tax-in-online-games-and-virtual-worlds-a-how-to-guide" rel="">Game Developer</a><span> by Lars Doucet and Dan Cook</span></em></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>TLDR:</h4><ul role="list"><li>Lamini Memory Tuning is a new way to <strong>embed facts into LLMs that improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucinations</strong> to previously unachievable levels — for one Fortune 500 customer, Lamini Memory Tuning led to 95% accuracy compared to 50% with other approaches. Hallucinations were reduced from 50% to 5%.</li><li>Lamini Memory Tuning is <strong>a research breakthrough that overcomes a seeming paradox in the AI world</strong>: achieving precise factual accuracy (i.e. no hallucinations) while upholding the generalization capabilities that make LLMs valuable in the first place.</li><li>The method entails <strong>tuning millions of expert adapters (e.g. LoRAs) with precise facts on top of any open-source LLM</strong>, like Llama 3 or Mistral 3. If the goal is to get Roman Empire facts exactly right, Lamini Memory Tuning would create experts on Caesar, aqueducts, legions, and any other facts you provide. Inspired by information retrieval, the model retrieves only the most relevant experts from an index at inference time — not all the model weights — so latency and cost are dramatically lower. <strong>High accuracy, high speed, low cost</strong>: with Lamini Memory Tuning, you don’t have to choose.</li><li><a href="https://www.lamini.ai/contact">Contact us</a> to try Lamini Memory Tuning.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>‍<strong>Accuracy matters immensely</strong></h5><p>Yet, general-purpose LLMs are designed to hallucinate, because they are trained to reduce the average error across the examples they’ve seen. <em>They’re pretty good at everything, but perfect at nothing.</em> They can produce fluent English prose because they’ve seen so much of it across the internet, but specific facts—like a date, a revenue number, or a variable name—get muddled in probabilities. As a result, companies have not been able to count on LLMs for the most critical and most valuable use cases – until now.</p><h5><strong>Introducing Lamini Memory Tuning</strong></h5><blockquote>Lamini Memory Tuning is a completely new way to fine-tune any existing LLM by tuning millions of LoRA adapters and selecting across them in a wide Mixture of Experts at inference time. </blockquote><p>Instead of optimizing average error on everything, Lamini Memory Tuning optimizes for zero error on the specific facts you tell it to remember, so it recalls those facts nearly perfectly. That’s not special on its own. This approach is particularly groundbreaking because it preserves the LLM’s ability to generalize with average error on everything else, and thus continue to produce fluent prose around those facts. Lamini Memory Tuning is a systematic tool for eliminating hallucinations on the facts you care about.</p><blockquote>Fortune 500 customers are already using Lamini Memory Tuning to achieve 95% factual accuracy on critical use cases where previous state-of-the-art approaches peaked at 50%.</blockquote><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f9ebe58e6225ebad55efe2/666a5420a0f4c472fdf8ab6b_memory_tuning_4_new_small.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p><h2>Prompting and RAG: necessary but not sufficient</h2><p>Prompting and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) are important methods for surfacing relevant information to the model, shifting its probabilities to consider similar information. This is an important step to getting the model to condition on the right concepts and information, because the model has been trained on so many tasks. Good prompt-engineering and RAG pipelines are critical to improve the overall accuracy of the model.</p><p>At times, this is all you need. But other times, you provide the relevant information and the response is still wrong but so close to right — leading to hallucinations.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f9ebe58e6225ebad55efe2/666a561a2e040719151c2290_memory-5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Why do hallucinations happen with the right data? In the model’s internal representation, the right answer is likely clustered with similar, but wrong, options. The right context increases the probabilities of the right answer and nearby wrong options. The model doesn’t know that a nearly right answer is still wrong, because general models don’t distinguish between exactly right and nearly right — they never learned to take the loss on those answers to zero. Prompting and RAG don’t change that.</p><p>Lamini Memory Tuning addresses this directly, by combining methods from information retrieval and AI to <strong>teach the model that getting the answer nearly right is the same as getting it totally wrong</strong>.</p><h2>Instruction fine-tuning: the wrong tool for the job</h2><p>Many teams turn to instruction fine-tuning when other techniques hit a wall on factual accuracy, but instruction fine-tuning, with or without LoRAs, lead to the same issue that pre-training has: it gets to be pretty good at a more narrow dataset, but still perfect at nothing, while being finicky to work with (losing the ability to perform on some general tasks, if you do it wrong). </p><p>As a result, teams struggle with unclear choices, long feedback loops, high compute bills, and ultimately underwhelming performance improvements. While instruction fine-tuning can be really valuable (it’s what turned GPT-3 into ChatGPT), it doesn't make models perfect at the facts that matter. In other words, <strong>traditional fine-tuning does not ensure that the model's answers are faithful to facts in its training data</strong>.</p><p>This is why we developed Lamini Memory Tuning.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>OUR INNOVATION</strong></p><h2>Lamini Memory Tuning: near-perfect fact recall via 1 million-way MoE</h2><p><strong>Lamini Memory Tuning is a fundamentally different fine-tuning approach that effectively teaches any open-source LLM to be near-perfect on facts, while still maintaining its ability to be pretty good at everything else.</strong> When the model is supposed to recall a specific fact, Lamini Memory Tuning shifts the entire probability mass to that particular fact (i.e. specific tokens within a particular context), such as the exact SQL schema for your database. This results in output probabilities that are not just closer to the right result, but exactly there.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f9ebe58e6225ebad55efe2/666a69e776ea0e87c3adeda0_loss-example.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>To do this, Lamini Memory Tuning tunes a massive mixture of <em>memory</em> experts on any open-source LLM. Each memory expert acts like a LoRA adapter that functionally operates as memory for the model. Together, the memory experts specialize in a million different ways to ensure faithful and factual accuracy to the data that it was tuned on. Inspired by information retrieval, these million memory experts are equivalent to indices from which the model intelligently retrieves and routes. At inference time, the model retrieves the most relevant experts at each layer and merges back into the base model to respond to the user query.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f9ebe58e6225ebad55efe2/666a566d8349581f404b5372_memory-4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>The result is a sparsely activated model, called a Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME), that can scale to an enormous number of parameters at a fixed computational inference cost.</strong> This means MoMEs have extremely high capacity for the number of facts that can be learned, bounded only by the total size of the training data set. Llama 3 was trained on 15 trillion tokens. Realistically, you will run out of system memory before you run out of memory capacity in a MoME.</p><p>Ultimately, this approach makes what were impossible use cases that critically suffer from hallucinations within reach, and drastically improves LLM time-to-accuracy and thus time-to-market.</p><p>Read more details in our <a href="https://github.com/lamini-ai/Lamini-Memory-Tuning/blob/main/research-paper.pdf">research paper.</a></p><h2>Results</h2><p>Lamini Memory Tuning has been a game-changing capability with Lamini’s Fortune 500 clients, who are deploying it for the following use cases:</p><h5>High precision text-to-SQL</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Client need</strong>: Democratize data access by using LLMs to turn natural language questions into database queries.</li><li><strong>Challenge</strong>: The relevant databases had unique internal names and large, messy schemas.</li><li><strong>Result</strong>: We achieved 95% accuracy with Lamini Memory Tuning after 50% accuracy with RAG.</li></ul><h5>High precision classification</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Client need</strong>: Save thousands of hours by automatically labeling data accurately.</li><li><strong>Challenge</strong>: We had to adhere to an exact taxonomy of 900 categories.</li><li><strong>Result</strong>: We achieved 100% accuracy across thousands of documents.</li></ul><h5>High precision recommendations</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Client need</strong>: Increase cart size and revenue with AI-powered product suggestions.</li><li><strong>Challenge</strong>: Applications break when product IDs are hallucinated.</li><li><strong>Result</strong>: We achieved 88% accuracy across a 50,000 product database.</li></ul><h2>A new frontier</h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f9ebe58e6225ebad55efe2/666a6a0a621a75710e69e50e_memory-6.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Lamini Memory Tuning changes several of the fundamental dynamics and tradeoffs governing how we work with LLMs. We’re in the early days of this new paradigm, and we’re still learning alongside our customers what’s possible.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><a href="https://yobibyte.github.io/"><img src="https://yobibyte.github.io/pics/socrat.png"></a>

<h2>notebooks are McDonalds of code</h2>

<p>
  You can come to McDonalds and order a salad, but you won't. Same with notebooks, you can write NASA-production-grade software in a notebook, but most likely you won't.
  Notebooks make you lazy, and encourage bad practices.
</p>

<h2>common arguments</h2>

I first watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">this talk</a> by Joel Grus and laughed hard.
I later saw the extensive use of notebooks everywhere, even in production, and I don't laugh anymore.
I'm scared and sad.
This section will have arguments mostly from that talk, but I might add a couple more here in the future.

<h3>state</h3>

State is like Jesus from the Big Lebowski, you don't fuck with Jesus.
But state will for sure fuck you up.
You execute a cell, you change the variable value, save the colab and forget to execute the cell.
Twenty minutes later you find a bug, hello there!

<h3>versioning</h3>

We've seen it before. 
<tt>tfinal_final_final_of_final.xls</tt> is back.
You want to play with a notebook, you copy it, change a couple of cells.
Two weeks later, you have 25 different versions, which one do you need?
Good luck with that!

<h3>bad habits</h3>
This is exactly the McDonalds methaphor.
If people are given a chance to be lazy, they will be (I will be for sure).
Quickly hacking some stuff without properly testing? Sure!
Linting? Pfff, living on the edge, you'll throw the colab away in an hour anyways.
Writing everything in one file? Of course! Scrolling is so fun!

<h2>notebooks slow you down</h2>
Here I try making a point why using notebooks is bad for you personally.

<h3>distractions</h3>
I don't have a diagnosed ADHD, but I have 90% of the symptoms from the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/symptoms/">NHS website</a>.
I'm very easy to distract.
And when I use colabs, I'm just one tab away from everything else.
Wikipedia? Sure, let's open five more tabs.
Gmail? Let's check the inbox!
Youtube music? Let's change the playlist.
You got it, my tmux pane with neovim or any IDE of your choice is far less destructive.

<h3>execution environment</h3>
Notebooks are often used as a playground to easily have access to an accelerator.
In this case, the execution environment is often set up differently and with different dependencies.
In this case, you make your code work in a colab, smile widely and run your experiment after on a cluster or whatever.
You start crying in twenty minutes after your code crashes due to lack of dependency or versioning or anything else similar.

<h3>efficiency</h3>
Notebooks keep the state, you have all the data on your fingertips, you are not encouraged to optimise your code.
When you rerun scripts, you want them be damn fast, you think more about the efficiency of your code.

<h3>reading code</h3>
I find notebooks broken for moving around the codebase.
In neovim (or Pycharm, or VSCode), you can easily go to the place where the function is defined and change it, it's just one hotkey away.
You can easily look at all the places where the function is used.
How do you do that in a notebook?
Do you go to your IDE and search for it?
What do you do if you change a function? Reload the whole thing?
Autoreload can help, but now you have to remember to rerun the cells you need and potentially fuck up your state if you skip a cell.

<h2>notebooks slow your team down</h2>

Enough with personal reasons, let's think about the issues affecting the whole team.

<h3>breaking changes</h3>
You use some function in a colab.
Another developer changes the function signature and their IDE changes all other calls of this function in the code, but not in the notebooks!
If the notebook is not used often (e.g. for leaderboarding), you are in for a treat.
Apart from the frustration, this is also bad from the context switching and credit assignment perspective.
Who is to fix this? You, who uses the notebook? Developer who changed the function signature?
Both of the cases suck.

<h3>awareness</h3>
You don't usually check in notebooks in your version control system (if you do, I'm sorry).
They usually pile up either locally or on some cloud drive.
In this case, people are unaware of what's going on.
When you check in your data analysis scripts or any modules, people can glance over PRs and have an idea of what's going on.
Notebooks are like dark matter of development (yes, I have almost zero knowledge of physics, and still think I can use this metaphor here).

<h3>fucking around -&gt; production</h3>
Some people like notebooks as they allow them to easily check some ideas and move on.
However, when their ideas work out, they are having hard time moving this code to modules.
Let's think about what you need to do.
First, you need to move the code to modules, sometimes it's not just a single file, it can be multiple files across the codebase.
Now you need to test it somehow.
Personally for me, after I've moved the code, I'm already exhausted and sometimes bored.
I know my code runs in a colab, why do I need to test it again?
Often I end up not unit testing my code for this reason.
But even if you don't test your code, you have to make sure that it runs and produces similar results to what you've had in a notebook.
This also takes time and energy.

<h3>sharing is caring</h3>
You have hunderds of notebooks with useful utils that are accessible only to you.
If that was a library within your team codebase, everyone could use that and the whole team could avoid code duplication.
But as discussed earlier, you are not encouraged to move this to a module because you are lazy.


<h2>FAQ</h2>

I'll try to answer some common answers I get when I tell people I do not use notebooks. If your question is not here, let's chat on <a href="https://twitter.com/y0b1byte">twitter</a>.

<h3>how do you do plotting?</h3>
I have small utils that unify how my plots look. In case I want incrementally play with the plot, I pickle the data for it and run the plotting script for each iteration.

<h3>how do you work with a remote machine?</h3>
<tt>sshfs</tt> works greatly for these purposes in case you need interactivity.

<h3>I am using code autoreload and write code in modules</h3>
Nice! I've done this for a while as well. This is a good use-case.
However, this approach does not address some of the issues, e.g. data analysis scripts should be checked by another team member.

<h3>i considered you to be my friend, how could you do this to me?</h3>
Hi Lucas, I'm not judging you. We can still be friends. But we can be better friends if you stop using notebooks.

<h3>some of your points are valid, but why stop using notebooks completely?</h3>
I don't think I'm losing much.
I'm also constantly exploring other options and having fun.

<p>City building simulations are not real life. They can be <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=611fdd1531e1cc42e46c1e16fa70cf3d21e6bc58">helpful</a> teaching <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/teaching-with-simcity-using-sophisticated-gaming-simulations-to-teach-concepts-in-introductory-american-government/762C8068A6686704C32B51A563E19FA7">tools</a>, but they abstract away many of the real issues in changing communities.</p>
<p>And yet, sometimes a game like <em>Cities: Skylines 2 (C:S2) </em>will present an issue that's just <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Rent_is_2_Damn_High">too timely and relevant</a> to ignore. Such is the case with "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/4145079671516384052">Economy 2.0</a>," a big update to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/">beleaguered</a> yet continually in-development game, due to arrive within the next week or so. The first and most important thing it tackles is the persistent issue of "High Rent," something that's bothering the in-game citizens ("cims" among fans), <em>C:S2</em> players, and nearly every human <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/business/housing-rent-inflation.html">living in the United States</a> and many other places.</p>
<p><em>C:S2</em> has solutions to high rent, at least for their virtual citizens. They removed the "virtual landlord" that takes in rent, so now a building's upkeep is evenly split among renters. There's a new formula for calculating rent, one that evokes a kind of elegant mathematical certainty none of us will ever see:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rent = (LandValue + (ZoneType * Building Level)) * LotSize * SpaceMultiplier</p></blockquote>
<p>And then there are the complaints themselves, filling players' notification streams. While developer Colossal Order's other fixes feel almost elegant in their simplicity, this one is a bit more grubby, like real life. If a citizen has a high enough income, but not enough liquid cash, such that they <em>should</em> have been able to swing this month's boarding, "they won’t complain and will instead spend less money on resource consumption." Cutting back on coffee bars and avocado toast should work, then, unless their income drops too low. Then, they will complain and "look for cheaper housing or move out of the city."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Just like here, “There are no starter homes”</h2>
<p>Once the patch arrives, <em>C:S2 </em>players might see their citizens "start looking for different types of housing or move around the city," according to the update notes, which tracks with the large city model I happen to live in. Unlike that model, however, for the <em>C:S2</em> citizens, living without unnecessary landlords, with simple rent calculations and a bit of belt-tightening, it "should help them afford the type of housing they prefer," and most rent complaints should disappear after awhile. If they still can't afford the rent, well, "check your unemployment and provide citizens with jobs so that they can pay their rent." Simple!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/city-builder/cities-skylines-2-kills-off-its-virtual-landlords-to-save-players-from-soaring-rent-prices-the-existence-of-which-is-news-to-them/">noted by PC Gamer</a>, players have come up with their own recommendations for players facing high rent, some of them perfectly timely and relevant. "Zone more smaller sized homes," writes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/1cvxhon/comment/l4sb16c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one player/micro-economist</a>, because just like in meatspace, "there are no starter homes left in and around major cities."</p>
<p>There are, in fact, algorithms that try to determine an optimal price for rent in the real world, though they're more for the non-virtual corporate landlords that are unlikely to be patched out. YieldStar, a "collaborative" rent-setting algorithm that suggests prices for open units, has helped large landlords push rent prices "to places that you wouldn't have gone if you weren't using it," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/rent-going-up-one-companys-algorithm-could-be-why/">according to one satisfied customer</a>. That kind of success has led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/company-that-makes-rent-setting-software-for-landlords-sued-for-collusion/">lawsuits from renters</a>, Senate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/us-senator-seeks-antitrust-review-of-apartment-price-setting-software/">complaints to the Federal Trade Commission</a>, lawsuits from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/14-big-landlords-used-software-to-collude-on-rent-prices-dc-lawsuit-says/">the District of Columbia</a> and <a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-sues-realpage-and-residential-landlords-illegal-price-fixing">Arizona</a>, and a recent <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/fbi-raids-landlord-connection-realpage-price-19507654.php">FBI raid on a landlord</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Ikea’s workers were quitting in droves in the US. In the UK and Ireland, half of all new hires were leaving before their first anniversary. Globally, each departure cost Ikea $5,000 or more to replace.&nbsp;</p><div>



<p>To stem the bleeding, the Swedish furniture behemoth needed to figure out what was making its store workers so unhappy — and fix it fast. By 2022, more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ingka.com/static/ingka-group-annual-summary-and-sustainability-report-fy23.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.ingka.com/static/ingka-group-annual-summary-and-sustainability-report-fy23.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">62,000</a>&nbsp;employees were departing a year for various reasons, equating to about a third&nbsp;of its workforce, and the pandemic-era labor shortage made it difficult to replenish its ranks.</p>



<p>Workers “suddenly became very scarce,” said Jon Abrahamsson Ring, chief executive officer of Inter Ikea Group — the umbrella entity that oversees Ikea’s store franchising,&nbsp;product design and supply chain — in a recent interview in New York. Ikea focused on things that many businesses talk about doing but struggle to actually implement:&nbsp; Boosting pay, increasing flexibility for frontline employees and using emerging technologies to make things easier on workers and their customers.</p>



<p>The results were stark: Voluntary turnover in the US dropped to about a quarter of employees by the end of 2023, from a third a year earlier. Globally, across the parent company’s more than 600 stores and warehouses, the quit rate&nbsp;fell to 17.5% in April from 22.4% in August&nbsp;2022. While&nbsp;voluntary attrition has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-04/us-job-openings-fall-further-to-lowest-since-february-2021?sref=QnKyEnuc" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-04/us-job-openings-fall-further-to-lowest-since-february-2021?sref=QnKyEnuc" rel="noreferrer noopener">fallen</a>&nbsp;in many&nbsp;white-collar occupations as hiring&nbsp;has slowed, employment in the retail sector has continued to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">trend up</a>&nbsp;in recent months, making Ikea’s progress&nbsp;notable.</p>



<p>Retail jobs are often marked by low pay, erratic schedules and irate customers, which helps explain why the quit rate for retail workers is more than 70% higher than in other US industries, according to a 2022&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-attract-and-retain-frontline-talent-amid-the-great-attrition#/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-attract-and-retain-frontline-talent-amid-the-great-attrition#/" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>&nbsp;by McKinsey &amp; Co. Half of them are considering leaving their job, McKinsey found, and of those, half want to ditch retail entirely. The situation isn’t better in other parts of the world: UK retailers typically need to replace one out of every two workers each year.</p>



<p>“Attracting, developing, and retaining frontline talent must become a top agenda item for retail CEOs,” the McKinsey report said, noting the challenge has only grown amid inflation and an environment where labor unions are increasingly flexing their muscles.</p>



<p>Privately held Ikea, whose 473&nbsp;stores in 63&nbsp;markets employ nearly 200,000&nbsp;people, historically lost fewer workers than its industry peers, thanks in part to a Nordic corporate culture that’s known for being warmer and fuzzier than, say, US discount giants&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DG:US" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DG:US" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dollar General Corp.</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/WMT:US?sref=QnKyEnuc" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/WMT:US?sref=QnKyEnuc" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart Inc</a>.&nbsp;But managing a sprawling, global workforce in an era where work-life balance&nbsp;has&nbsp;become mandatory for many people&nbsp;isn’t easy, and signs emerged that it wasn’t all Swedish meatballs and bliss amid Ikea’s endless aisles of Billy bookcases and Stockholm rugs.</p>



<p>In 2018, a coalition of unions accused local Ikea managers of quashing organizing efforts at stores in the US, Ireland and Portugal. They&nbsp;filed a&nbsp;<a href="https://uniglobalunion.org/news/unions-file-oecd-complaint-against-ikeas-international-pattern-of-workers-rights-abuses/#:~:text=The%20unions%20filing%20this%20complaint,and%20international%20human%20rights%20standards." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://uniglobalunion.org/news/unions-file-oecd-complaint-against-ikeas-international-pattern-of-workers-rights-abuses/#:~:text=The%20unions%20filing%20this%20complaint,and%20international%20human%20rights%20standards." rel="noreferrer noopener">joint complaint</a>&nbsp;with a branch of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development alleging that senior leadership “ignored red flags” about claims that workers’ rights were being trampled. “I never thought that Ikea&nbsp;would allow supervisors to intimidate and interrogate us,”&nbsp;Nancy Goetz, a worker in Ikea’s Stoughton, Mass., store, said at the time.&nbsp;“I expected more from Ikea.”</p>



<p>A wave of worker protests ensued. In Poland, employees were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bwint.org/cms/poland-ikea-workers-protest-unjust-wages-prepares-for-strike-vote-2611#:~:text=BWI-,Poland%3A%20IKEA%20workers%20protest%20unjust%20wages%2C%20prepares%20for%20strike%20vote,the%20wages%20of%20its%20workers." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bwint.org/cms/poland-ikea-workers-protest-unjust-wages-prepares-for-strike-vote-2611#:~:text=BWI-,Poland%3A%20IKEA%20workers%20protest%20unjust%20wages%2C%20prepares%20for%20strike%20vote,the%20wages%20of%20its%20workers." rel="noreferrer noopener">peeved</a>&nbsp;that a wage hike was pegged below the rate of inflation. In South Korea, unionized workers said&nbsp;they received subpar treatment compared with their peers in other countries.&nbsp;In the US, the company had to&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/559800-southern-ikea-created-juneteenth-menu-with-watermelon-fried-chicken/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/559800-southern-ikea-created-juneteenth-menu-with-watermelon-fried-chicken/" rel="noreferrer noopener">apologize</a>&nbsp;for serving fried chicken, collard greens and watermelon at a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/what-is-juneteenth-the-newest-national-us-holiday-explained?sref=uYHHCFbx" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/what-is-juneteenth-the-newest-national-us-holiday-explained?sref=uYHHCFbx" rel="noreferrer noopener">Juneteenth</a>&nbsp;event for Atlanta employees. (One former Ikea worker&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7KBcsdPhxA" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7KBcsdPhxA" rel="noreferrer noopener">went viral</a>&nbsp;by posting videos&nbsp;as&nbsp;“Angry Retail Guy” that mocked clueless managers and shoppers alike.)</p>



<p>After several years of talks between the union coalition&nbsp;and Ikea, the company last year&nbsp;<a href="https://uniglobalunion.org/news/oecd-ikea-ncp-final/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://uniglobalunion.org/news/oecd-ikea-ncp-final/" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed</a>&nbsp;in principle to let workers organize and allow store access to union representatives. Notably, though, the parties couldn’t come to terms on allowing labor reps to enter US stores.</p>



<p>“IKEA respects the rights of co-workers to join, form or not to join a union of their choice without fear of reprisal, interference, intimidation or harassment,” a&nbsp;spokesperson said.&nbsp;“The company is committed to maintaining an environment of mutual respect and ensuring all co-workers’ rights are protected irrespective of their preference and choice concerning unionization.”</p>



<p>While the talks dragged out, unhappy Ikea workers started looking elsewhere. Then, the pandemic hit, and labor shortages made finding and holding onto people even more challenging. “There was a shortage of staff for entry-level jobs,” said Ring.</p>

Workers got&nbsp;disgruntled, and started leaving for other gigs.</p>



<h2>‘Unhappy Workers’</h2>



<p>It was a far cry from when 17-year-old Ingvar Kamprad founded Ikea, using his village’s milk van to deliver bargain-priced pens and picture frames. He began selling furniture made by local carpenters in 1948, and opened his first store in Sweden a decade later. Ikea created a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/22/business/ikea-venture-in-us-a-hit.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/22/business/ikea-venture-in-us-a-hit.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">frenzy</a>&nbsp;when it entered the US in 1985, and helped turn Kamprad into the world’s eighth-richest person.</p>



<p>For a service-driven company like Ikea, unhappy workers can quickly lead to unhappy customers. “You cannot be a great place to shop if it’s not a great place to work,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iese.edu/faculty-research/faculty/philip-moscoso/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.iese.edu/faculty-research/faculty/philip-moscoso/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philip Moscoso</a>, a professor at Europe’s IESE business school who has studied the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Ring took the CEO job at Ikea in September 2020, the retailer had an alarming retention problem. In the US, UK and Canada, employee turnover had crept well above 30% and swapping shifts was a cumbersome process. In India, staff quit when they became parents, due to meager child-related benefits.</p>



<p>Ingka Group, the Netherlands-based franchisee that operates and staffs&nbsp;Ikea stores in&nbsp;31 countries that employ more than 165,000 people, embarked on a campaign to lower turnover, targeting the biggest pain points in each market. The approach improved pay and benefits, scheduling, new-hire orientation and in some places included an AI-powered tool that alerts managers when a worker might be in danger of quitting. Even employees’ uniforms were refashioned.</p>



<p>“Many times people come into world of retail thinking that this is a role I will take on until I find something better,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neena-potenza/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/in/neena-potenza/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neena Potenza</a>, who oversees HR in the US for Ingka. “But at Ikea, we want people to grow and develop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s still a ways to go, particularly when it comes to supporting&nbsp;employee mental health and workers with disabilities. In Japan, turnover has actually gone up amid a stubbornly tight labor market.&nbsp;In France, a&nbsp;push to convert temp workers to full-time status has also led to outsized employee departures. And in Puerto Rico, more than 50 Ikea warehouse employees&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goiam.org/news/puerto-rico-ikea-workers-vote-to-join-iam-union/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.goiam.org/news/puerto-rico-ikea-workers-vote-to-join-iam-union/" rel="noreferrer noopener">just voted</a>&nbsp;to unionize over complaints about&nbsp;pay and worker treatment.</p>



<p>For one US worker, the changes haven’t been enough. The sales associate, who asked not to be identified, quit recently after a dust-up&nbsp;with a colleague quickly escalated into disciplinary action, she said, with managers aligned&nbsp;against her. Rigid scheduling rules also forced her to miss critical medical&nbsp;appointments. In employee surveys, other workers have complained about poor communication and micromanaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Wage Bumps</h2>



<p>Compensation is often the biggest reason why workers leave, so across many regions Ikea raised starting wages, sweetened bonuses, or closed gender pay gaps. In London, base pay rose from 11 pounds ($14) an hour to 13.15. The UK also added a new starting pay band for a handful of stores outside London where the cost of living was much higher than in more remote areas.</p>



<p>A bigger problem in UK stores, though, was the tendency of new hires to quit within months of joining. The so-called onboarding process was poorly organized, with infrequent feedback from managers and newbies unclear where to turn to for advice. Ikea UK/Ireland&nbsp;strives to hold onto 85% of hires after three months, but that figure had dropped as low as 60%, according to Darren Taylor, people and culture manager for that region, who oversees 9,500 retail workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Coming out of Covid, people re-evaluated what was important to them, and work-life balance became more important,” he said. “So it required a big change in terms of how we positioned ourselves to attract people into retail.”</p>



<p>Those people included&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natasha-williams-a63b4a253/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/in/natasha-williams-a63b4a253/?originalSubdomain=uk" rel="noreferrer noopener">Natasha Williams</a>, 22, who got a job at Ikea selling kitchen fixtures last year. Ikea worked to smooth her transition: Getting from her home in Basingstoke to the Ikea store in Reading was a two-hour slog involving two buses and a train. So instead of six-hour shifts across four days, Taylor gave her three eight-hour shifts, and allowed her to start at 10am rather than 9am. “That changed everything — I was much happier at work,” Williams said.</p>



<p>Part-time staff, who make up about two-thirds of Ikea’s UK workforce, often don’t get enough hours to make ends meet, so Ikea is now giving some of them additional hours working remotely, answering customer calls. To retain students, Taylor has introduced shifts on weekends only, or just during school breaks.</p>



<p>“Small things,” said&nbsp;Taylor, “make a big difference.”</p>



<p>In India, the things that matter to Ikea’s&nbsp;workers are&nbsp;benefits like subsidized&nbsp;daycare,&nbsp;26 weeks of parental leave&nbsp;for mothers and fathers&nbsp;and a five-day workweek (six days is the norm for many Indian retailers). Those perks are&nbsp;a game changer&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shweta-singh-16bb6919/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/in/shweta-singh-16bb6919/?originalSubdomain=in" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shweta&nbsp;Singh</a>, a 39-year-old mom&nbsp;who was hired two years ago and runs the children’s furniture department in the&nbsp;Hyderabad store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the US, where Ingka&nbsp;employs more than 17,000 people, one of the most impactful fixes was moving its shift scheduling tool online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, inflexible schedules&nbsp;didn’t allow for life’s daily hiccups— a sick kid, a flat tire. Unpredictable shifts can then have a ripple effect on workers’ well-being, leading to&nbsp;<a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WP-Choper-Schneider-and-Harknett-Uncertain-Time.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://equitablegrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WP-Choper-Schneider-and-Harknett-Uncertain-Time.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher workforce turnover</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unpredictable-work-hours-and-volatile-incomes-are-long-term-risks-for-american-workers/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unpredictable-work-hours-and-volatile-incomes-are-long-term-risks-for-american-workers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">economic hardship</a>&nbsp;due to income fluctuations, according to studies by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and the Brookings Institution.</p>



<p>“There is this notion that workers’ time is not valued,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/kristen.harknett" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://profiles.ucsf.edu/kristen.harknett" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristen Harknett</a>, a professor of sociology at the University of California, San Francisco, who has researched&nbsp;unstable work schedules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://shift.hks.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ikea-Baseline-Report.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://shift.hks.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ikea-Baseline-Report.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration</a>&nbsp;with a group called the Shift Project, Ikea US began testing the ability for workers in a few stores&nbsp;to swap shifts online, without a manager’s approval,&nbsp;replacing paper forms that had to be signed by both workers and&nbsp;their respective managers, which made swapping “particularly tedious,” Shift Project researchers found. Workers in the pilot program can also adjust their hours of availability more easily,&nbsp;and request to not be scheduled in certain blocks of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, a&nbsp;retention&nbsp;tool dubbed “Stay” analyzes historical data on departed workers and flags worrisome&nbsp;traits – such as constantly fluctuating hours – to managers. Store managers who have used the tool&nbsp;report turnover rates nearly three percentage points lower than those who don’t.</p>



<p>Now, more store workers like Natasha Williams are sticking around longer. She just got a raise after taking a two-week training class, and would eventually like to move from the kitchen department to interior design.</p>



<p>She’s not sure if she’ll work at Ikea her whole career, “but for the foreseeable future, definitely.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><em>The byline on this essay is a pseudonym.</em></p><p>My daughter is one of those kids the US surgeon general warned us about. Our nation’s children are “unknowing participants” in a “decades-long experiment”. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Social media</a> usage poses mental health risks to youth, who use it “almost constantly”, causing sleep deprivation, depression and anxiety.</p><p>Before sixth grade, my daughter saved her dog-walking money for a phone. She found a used <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">iPhone</a> 13 Mini on Craigslist. I set expectations to incentivize getting good grades, keeping her room clean and taking out the trash. Little did I know that the iPhone would systematically undermine her ability to complete these tasks – and so much more.</p><p>When my daughter walked into class through an inflatable arch on her first day of middle school, I took comfort in the fact that I could reach her. Like most parents, I associated the phone with safety, not danger. I didn’t know that social media developers were manipulating her next swipe, or that her “human future” was being sold to the highest bidder, enriching the wealthiest corporations in human history.</p><p>I learned the hard way – through my daughter’s lies, manipulation, slipping grades. Through the “zebra-stripe” scars sketched across her arms.</p><p>Her sixth-grade school picture captures my daughter’s “emo” phase: the feather earring, Pink Floyd T-shirt and crooked smile. The innocence in that image was quickly replaced by the selfie. Peace-signs-over-puckered-lips selfie. Head tilt, half-face, full-body selfie. The selfie in bed. Her camera roll documents my child’s downward spiral. Crying selfies, puffy-eyed selfies, unable-to-leave-the-bedroom selfies.</p><p>By spring semester, my daughter was performing poorly in school. I took her for a psychiatric evaluation, assuming she had ADHD. Afternoon sun filtered through faux wood blinds, casting light strips across her ever-present black hoodie. The doctor’s questions started predictably. Trouble focusing in class? Completing homework? Sleeping? Then the interview took a turn for the dreadful. Do you feel your life isn’t worth living? Have you ever harmed yourself? Do you wish you were dead?</p><p>I gaped at my child’s profile, each “yes”<em> </em>lacerating my guts.</p><p>The doctor diagnosed my daughter with depression and anxiety. Further testing showed that gaining her friends’ approval occupied 80% of her attention. No wonder she was failing math. It was a miracle she was passing any of her classes at all with only 20% of her brain available for school.</p><p>The doctor prescribed therapy and Lexapro. While these were helpful, the doctor failed to alert me to the sweeping phone trends among middle school students. I have since learned that my daughter is among the first generation of 10-to-14-year-olds active on social media. For these girls, suicide rates have risen 151%, self-harm 182%. Her treatment assumed her struggles were individual, as opposed to structural. In our country, we prescribe drugs to solve this social crisis.</p><p>Ignorant of these dynamics at the time, I allowed my daughter to continue her social media use. One day, I received a text from another mom. I stared at the screen, wondering why this mom had sent me a graphic selfie. Then I recognized the mole on the woman’s chest. My kid’s mole.</p><p>My daughter gasped when I showed her the photo. She handed over her phone. I discovered she’d circumvented the screen limits and had been using social media into the wee hours of the morning. She’d sent the image to someone named PJ on Snapchat. He claimed to be a 16-year-old boy, but his response was so graphic I suspected someone older. The phone was a two-way street, I realized with dread, with platforms adults could use to kidnap and traffic our children.</p><p>I called a family meeting with my daughter, her dad and her stepmom. My daughter would delete her social media accounts and give up her phone until the start of the school year. As the summer months passed with travels, in-person hangouts and family time, my daughter returned to herself. The dark circles under her eyes faded. The sighs, shrugs and eyerolls stopped. She got up in the morning. She laughed. She even let me hug her, sometimes.</p><p>It was hard to give her phone back before seventh grade, but we had a deal. I wanted to reinforce her good behavior. I made new rules: no social media, no devices in bedrooms, phones off at 8pm. We charged our phones on the kitchen counter. I bought alarm clocks and sound machines. We endured digital detox. My daughter started soccer. My insomnia resolved. We joined a gym and worked out together.</p><figure id="7734e1f6-4003-48e8-9a03-f0605c74be21" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:15,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘They give us liberty with less anxiety’: A teenager, a parent and a teacher on smartphones for under-14s | panel&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;7734e1f6-4003-48e8-9a03-f0605c74be21&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/08/smartphones-under-14s-st-albans-children&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:1,&quot;design&quot;:8}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&quot;:true,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>But within a few months, my daughter relapsed. Little lies. Big lies. Another text came from a friend’s mom with selfies of our daughters vaping and hanging out with boys I’d never met at the mall. We held another family meeting.</p><p>“This may sound crazy,” my daughter’s stepmom said. “But maybe she doesn’t need a phone.”</p><p>The words rippled across my mind. How had I never thought of it? The phone was destroying my daughter, but I couldn’t imagine life without it. I’d remained loyal to the idea of it, the ideal of it. I took custody of the phone again.</p><p>My daughter threw a tantrum when I told her she’d lost her phone until high school. She didn’t want to be <em>that </em>kid, the only one in class without her phone. But as the tantrum subsided, she began to return to herself. Then, within a few weeks, signs of her addictive behavior began to resurface.</p><p>I found iPhone chargers in the outlets by her bed – for charging her AirPods, she said. She threw her body on the ground to stop me from searching beneath her bed. One night, as I lay in bed ruminating, it hit me. I remembered my daughter had <em>two</em> phones. When I’d accidentally broken the Mini in a weight machine during our workout, I bought her a new iPhone 13. I’d seized the 13, but she could still have the Mini.</p><p>“I sold it to a friend at school,” my daughter said when I asked her the next morning. She couldn’t say to whom, or for how much.</p><p>“I’ll find it,” I said with an <em>I-see-you</em> gesture. I was frantic, but displayed calm confidence, even a little humor, as I searched her backpack and drawers, patted down her pockets, entered her room unannounced, trying to catch her in the act. My daughter remained calm throughout my searches. I began to think I’d gone completely mad. I bought a metal detector.</p><p>Then one evening, I came into her room. My daughter bolted upright and shuffled her comforter. I rushed to the bed, ran my hands under the covers. A charging cord! My fingers traced its length to the attached phone.</p><p>We stared at the Mini lying in my hands. The Snapchat app glowed beneath the shattered screen. She looked at me. Her eyes went wide, then filled with tears.</p><p>That night, my heartbeat tapped wildly against my pillow as I scrolled her social media. Her exchanges were desperate with need. She pleaded with people to reply, especially a boy named Damien. When he didn’t respond, she said she was depressed, sexted, sent a boob pic.</p><p>I found answers via my sister in Johann Hari’s book Stolen Focus, which explores how and why our attention is collapsing: “The phones we have, and the programs that run on them, were deliberately designed by the smartest people in the world to maximally grab and maximally hold our attention.” Of course. At such a young age, my daughter was defenseless against this manipulation. She assessed her worth within a system where she was simultaneously attention-addicted and attention-starved. She’d internalized an algorithm where provocative content wins: “If it’s more enraging, it’s more engaging,” Hari writes.</p><p>The social experiment in our house is being replicated in homes across the country. As parents, we want to keep our kids safe. We want them to call us if an active shooter comes to campus. But the greatest danger lies <em>within </em>the phone, not outside if it.</p><p>One reason our kids are so addicted to their phones is because we’re addicted to ours. My friends complain of insomnia, but can’t imagine leaving their phones outside the bedroom. Addressing my child’s phone use has meant addressing my own. I have to restrain myself from texting while driving. I’ve stopped rushing to the charge station every morning to see if I missed a message.</p><p>As seventh grade ends, my daughter is <em>that </em>kid. Without her phone, she’s the kid who dribbles her soccer ball across the living room, rides her skateboard down the street, makes the honor roll, joins the track team. She’s the kid whose hands gesture wildly as she chats with her friends, who plaits her hair and falls asleep reading a book.</p><p>These days, we use my phone together to coordinate hangouts, listen to audiobooks, sing along to her songs and mine – Shakira and Sade, Ice Cube and the Fugees. Last weekend, we drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to visit family. June gloom hugged the coastline as my daughter and I bodysurfed a glassy wave that rushed us to the shore. “Again!” she said, leaping to her feet. She’s addicted to the feeling of the water rolling beneath her belly.</p><p>My daughter’s not the only kid. I recently met a woman who seized her 11-year-old son’s phone when she discovered he was sexting. Students at the Illing middle school in Connecticut build community and pay attention in class now that the school makes them put their phones in rubber pouches – a trend that’s quickly spreading. British children are largely learning in “a mobile phone-free environment” since a department of education mandate.</p><p>We need both individual <em>and </em>systemic changes to check our phone use. I’m curious where these changes will take us by the time my daughter enters high school.</p><p>Until then, I’ll hold the phone.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>When Tomás Vega SM&nbsp;’19 was 5 years old, he began to stutter. The experience gave him an appreciation for the adversity that can come with a disability. It also showed him the power of technology.</p><p>“A keyboard and a mouse were outlets,” Vega says. “They allowed me to be fluent in the things I did. I was able to transcend my limitations in a way, so I became obsessed with human augmentation and with the concept of cyborgs. I also gained empathy. I think we all have empathy, but we apply it according to our own experiences.”</p><p>Vega has been using technology to augment human capabilities ever since. He began programming when he was 12. In high school, he helped people manage disabilities including hand impairments and multiple sclerosis. In college, first at the University of California at Berkeley and then at MIT, Vega built technologies that helped people with disabilities live more independently.</p><p>Today Vega is the co-founder and CEO of Augmental, a startup deploying technology that lets people with movement impairments seamlessly interact with their personal computational devices.</p><p>Augmental’s first product is the MouthPad, which allows users to control their computer, smartphone, or tablet through tongue and head movements. The MouthPad’s pressure-sensitive touch pad sits on the roof of the mouth, and, working with a pair of motion sensors, translates tongue and head gestures into cursor scrolling and clicks in real time via Bluetooth.</p><p>“We have a big chunk of the brain that is devoted to controlling the position of the tongue,” Vega explains. “The tongue comprises eight muscles, and most of the muscle fibers are slow-twitch, which means they don’t fatigue as quickly. So, I thought why don’t we leverage all of that?”</p><p>People with spinal cord injuries are already using the MouthPad every day to interact with their favorite devices independently. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9U8BaNx3ZM">One of Augmental’s users</a>, who is living with quadriplegia and studying math and computer science in college, says the device has helped her write math formulas and study in the library — use cases where other assistive speech-based devices weren’t appropriate.</p><p>“She can now take notes in class, she can play games with her friends,” Vega says. “She is more independent. Her mom told us that getting the MouthPad was the most significant moment since her injury.”</p><p>That’s the ultimate goal of Augmental: to improve the accessibility of technologies that have become an integral part of our lives.</p><p>“We hope that a person with a severe hand impairment can be as competent using a phone or tablet as somebody using their hands,” Vega says.</p>        

      </div><div>
          

            <p><strong>Making computers more accessible</strong></p><p>In 2012, as a first-year student at UC Berkeley, Vega met his eventual Augmental co-founder, Corten Singer. That year, he told Singer he was determined to join the Media Lab as a graduate student, something he achieved four years later when he joined the Media Lab’s Fluid Interfaces research group run by Pattie Maes, MIT’s Germeshausen Professor of Media Arts and Sciences.</p><p>“I only applied to one program for grad school, and that was the Media Lab,” Vega says. “I thought it was the only place where I could do what I wanted to do, which is augmenting human ability.”</p><p>At the Media Lab, Vega took classes in microfabrication, signal processing, and electronics. He also developed wearable devices to help people access information online, improve their sleep, and regulate their emotions.</p><p>“At the Media Lab, I was able to apply my engineering and neuroscience background to build stuff, which is what I love doing the most,” Vega says. “I describe the Media Lab as Disneyland for makers. I was able to just play, and to explore without fear.”</p><p>Vega had gravitated toward the idea of a brain-machine interface, but an internship at Neuralink made him seek out a different solution.</p><p>“A brain implant has the highest potential for helping people in the future, but I saw a number of limitations that pushed me from working on it right now,” Vega says. “One is the long timeline for development. I’ve made so many friends over the past years that needed a solution yesterday.”</p><p>At MIT, he decided to build a solution with all the potential of a brain implant but without the limitations.</p><p>In his last semester at MIT, Vega built what he describes as&nbsp;“a lollipop with a bunch of sensors” to test the mouth as a medium for computer interaction. It worked beautifully.</p><p>“At that point, I called Corten, my co-founder, and said, ‘I think this has the potential to change so many lives,’” Vega says.&nbsp;“It could also change the way humans interact with computers in the future.”</p><p>Vega used MIT resources including the&nbsp;<a href="https://vms.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Venture Mentoring Service</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://icorps.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT I-Corps program</a>, and received crucial early funding from MIT’s&nbsp;<a href="https://innovation.mit.edu/resource/e14-fund/" target="_blank">E14 Fund</a>. Augmental was officially born when Vega graduated from MIT at the end of 2019.</p><p>Augmental generates each MouthPad design using a 3D model based on a scan of the user’s mouth. The team then 3-D prints the retainer using dental-grade materials and adds the electronic components.</p><p>With the MouthPad, users can scroll up, down, left, and right by sliding their tongue. They can also right click by doing a sipping gesture and left click by pressing on their palate. For people with less control of their tongue, bites, clenches, and other gestures can be used, and people with more neck control can use head-tracking to move the cursor on their screen.</p><p>“Our hope is to create an interface that is multimodal, so you can choose what works for you,” Vega says. “We want to be accommodating to every condition.”</p><p><strong>Scaling the MouthPad</strong></p><p>Many of Augmental’s current users have spinal cord injuries, with some users unable to move their hands and others unable to move their heads. Gamers and programmers have also used the device. The company’s most frequent users interact with the MouthPad every day for up to nine hours.</p><p>“It’s amazing because it means that it has really seamlessly integrated into their lives, and they are finding lots of value in our solution,” Vega says.</p><p>Augmental is hoping to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance over the next year to help users do things like control wheelchairs and robotic arms. FDA clearance will also unlock insurance reimbursements for users, which will make the product more accessible.</p><p>Augmental is already working on the next version of its system, which will respond to whispers and even more subtle movements of internal speech organs.</p><p>“That’s crucial to our early customer segment because a lot of them have lost or have impaired lung function,” Vega says.</p><p>Vega is also encouraged by progress in AI agents and the hardware that goes with them. No matter how the digital world evolves, Vega believes Augmental can be a tool that can benefit everyone.</p><p>“What we hope to provide one day is an always-available, robust, and private interface to intelligence,” Vega says. “We think that this is the most expressive, wearable, hands-free input system that humans have created.”</p>

      <p>
        This torrent list is the “ultimate unified list” of releases by Anna’s Archive, Library Genesis, Sci-Hub, and others. By seeding these torrents, you help preserve humanity’s knowledge and culture. These torrents represent the vast majority of human knowledge that can be mirrored in bulk.
      </p>

      <p>
        These torrents are not meant for downloading individual books. They are meant for long-term preservation. With these torrents you can set up a full mirror of Anna’s Archive, using our <a href="https://annas-software.org/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive">source code</a> and metadata (which can be <a href="https://annas-software.org/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive/-/blob/main/data-imports/README.md">generated</a> or <a href="https://annas-archive.org/torrents#aa_derived_mirror_metadata">downloaded</a> as ElasticSearch and MariaDB databases). We also have full lists of torrents, as <a href="https://annas-archive.org/dyn/torrents.json">JSON</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently <strong>60%</strong> of the total <strong>521.1TB</strong> is copied in at least 4 locations, and only 3% in more than 10 locations. We need your help to get to 100%!
      </p>

      <div>
        <p><em>“The lost cannot be recovered; but let us save what remains: not by vaults and locks which fence them from the public eye and use, in consigning them to the waste of time, but by such a multiplication of copies, as shall place them beyond the reach of accident.”</em></p><p>— Thomas Jefferson, 1791</p>
      </div>

      <p><span id="guide">Guide</span> <a href="#guide">§</a></p>

      <p>
        The list of torrents is split in three parts:<br>
        1. The first part is managed and released by Anna’s Archive. These include books, papers, and magazines from websites such as Z-Library and Internet Archive. It also includes metadata records from websites such as WorldCat and ISBNdb.<br>
        2. The second part is managed and released by others, such as Library Genesis and Sci-Hub. We include these torrents in order to present a unified list of everything you need to mirror Anna’s Archive.<br>
        3. Miscellaneous other torrents; not critical to seed and not included in stats or the torrent list generator.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Torrents seeded by Anna’s Archive are indicated with a checkmark (✅). Some torrents get temporarily embargoed (🔒) upon release, for various reasons (e.g. protecting our scraping methods). An embargo means very slow initial seeding speeds. They get lifted within a year.
      </p>

      <p>
        For more information about the different collections, see the <a href="https://annas-archive.org/datasets">Datasets</a> page. Also see the <a href="https://annas-archive.org/faq#torrents">Torrents FAQ</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you seed large amounts of our collection (50TB or more), please <a href="https://annas-archive.org/contact">contact us</a> so we can let you know when we deprecate any large torrents.
      </p>

      <p><span id="stats">Stats</span> <a href="#stats">§</a></p>

      <p>
        You can help out enormously by seeding torrents that are low on seeders. If everyone who reads this chips in, we can preserve these collections forever. This is the current breakdown, excluding embargoed torrents, but including external torrents:

<p>Science fiction writer Ted Chiang has won <a href="https://www.penfaulkner.org/our-awards/the-pen-malamud-award/" target="_blank">the&nbsp;2024 PEN/Bernard and Ann Malamud Award for Excellence in the Short Story.</a> The award is given each year to a writer who has “demonstrated exceptional achievement in the short story form.”</p>
<p>Ted Chiang has published two collections of short fiction, <em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em>, and <em>Exhalation</em>, both of which have won many awards including four Hugos and four Nebulas. Award Committee Chair Jung Yun describes Chiang’s work as “an absolute wonder to behold,” and “invite readers to think, imagine, and explore unique worlds beyond their own.” She also noted that “Chiang exemplifies Bernard Malamud’s belief that a short story can produce ‘the surprise and effect of a profound knowledge in a short time.’”</p>
<p>Chiang joins past prize winners Edwidge Danticat, Yiyun Li, Charles Baxter, Lydia Davis, John Edgar Wideman, Amina Gautier, Joan Silber, Jhumpa Lahiri, Joy Williams, and Deborah Eisenberg.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In today’s E112 of “5mins of Postgres” we discuss streaming and vectored I/O in Postgres 17. This is an important step towards implementing asynchronous I/O in Postgres. In Postgres 17 we do not yet have asynchronous I/O, but we do see a performance benefit from what is essentially a refactoring work around the internal APIs.</p>
<p>In this episode, I give you a little bit of a behind the scenes view on my understanding of the changes made in 17 and how they impact future asynchronous I/O work.</p>

<p><strong>Transcript</strong></p>
<p>We'll start with this <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=210622c60e1a9db2e2730140b8106ab57d259d15">commit by Thomas Munro</a>, co-authored by Andres Freund is introducing a vectored variant of an important internal API called <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/storage/buffer/bufmgr.c#L1152">ReadBuffer()</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-better-api-for-read-io-inside-postgres"><a href="#a-better-api-for-read-io-inside-postgres" aria-label="a better api for read io inside postgres permalink"></a>A better API for read I/O inside Postgres</h2>
<h3 id="the-role-of-the-internal-readbuffer-api"><a href="#the-role-of-the-internal-readbuffer-api" aria-label="the role of the internal readbuffer api permalink"></a>The role of the internal ReadBuffer API</h3>
<p>Now, "buffer" or also sometimes called a page is essentially a fundamental unit in Postgres where Postgres is working with something, for example, its doing a sequential read, it will read many, many buffers to read from your table sequentially.</p>
<p>This important internal API now has a way to start a read and then wait for the result for one or more buffers, instead of reading each one at a time. future this will allow for actual asynchronous I/O to happen, but in the meantime, just the fact that the internal APIs are now refactored to work with multiple blocks at a time, will already allow some performance optimization in certain cases.</p>
<h3 id="how-this-fits-into-asynchronous-io-aio"><a href="#how-this-fits-into-asynchronous-io-aio" aria-label="how this fits into asynchronous io aio permalink"></a>How this fits into Asynchronous I/O (AIO)</h3>
<p>If you're interested in how this all fits together with asynchronous I/O, Andres Freund, who is one of the principal authors behind the asynchronous I/O work, did a talk at PGConf.EU (<a href="https://anarazel.de/talks/2023-12-14-pgconf-eu-path-to-aio/path-to-aio.pdf">slides</a>, see video recording below) where he talked about both the work that Thomas did in 17, to essentially introduce this important building block of the new read stream API, but also how this relates to all the other work that needs to happen to actually see asynchronous I/O in Postgres:</p>

<h3 id="new-internal-apis-for-streaming-reads"><a href="#new-internal-apis-for-streaming-reads" aria-label="new internal apis for streaming reads permalink"></a>New internal APIs for streaming reads</h3>
<p>Now there's two main things that the streaming and vectored I/O work in 17 is doing:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>systematically issue POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED for random access, replacing patchy ad hoc advice</li>
<li>build larger vectored I/Os; eg one preadv() call can replace 16 pread() calls</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CA+hUKGJkOiOCa+mag4BF+zHo7qo=o9CFheB8=g6uT5TUm2gkvA@mail.gmail.com">Thomas Munro in "Streaming I/O, vectored I/O (WIP)" mailinglist thread</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first change here is to more systematically issue <code>POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED</code> calls for random page access. This information is utilized by the Kernel to decide which pages to load ahead of time into the operating system page cache, making it a lot faster when that information is actually read by Postgres.</p>
<p>This is for example needed when you're doing <code>ANALYZE</code> calls and you're sampling a random portion of your table.</p>
<p>And then the other thing just building larger vectored I/O by making larger I/O requests, for example when doing a sequential scan on a table.</p>
<p>In 17, we have only a small subset of users of these new APIs. The work in Postgres 17 is mainly intended to start testing the waters, see some initial benefits. There is 3 commits worth mentioning:</p>

<p>First of all Thomas <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=3a352df05e65de740b4a375a0ecbcae97a1f6196">added a simple example</a> by changing how "pg_prewarm" does I/O. pg_prewarm is a contrib extension which is used to load a full relation (table, index) into shared buffers, and will likely see a small performance benefit from this change.</p>
<p>This uses the <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=b5a9b18cd0;hp=210622c60e1a9db2e2730140b8106ab57d259d15">new Streaming API</a> directly, sidestepping ReadBuffer, since it doesn't actually use the buffers loaded:</p>

<p>And now, the change where some people will see a noticable direct performance improvement on their production workloads with 17, is to <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=b7b0f3f27241e424b7103397489464d907cef2c4;hp=6ed83d5fa55cf6e6c9d1be34ec10730c48eba763">use streaming I/O for sequential reads</a>, authored by Melanie Plageman. This now means sequential scans in Postgres will use the new API and will do typically do larger reads, going from the old 8kB read syscalls, to 128kB reads by default when reading enough data.</p>
<p>That change is slightly too large to show fully here, but the principle remains the same. Where previously there was a direct call to a variant of ReadBuffer(), there is now a streaming read:</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-performance-benefits"><a href="#testing-the-performance-benefits" aria-label="testing the performance benefits permalink"></a>Testing the performance benefits</h2>
<h3 id="the-test-setup"><a href="#the-test-setup" aria-label="the test setup permalink"></a>The test setup</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at that in an example. I have 3 virtual machines running here, one with 16, one with 17, and one with 17 without that streaming sequential scan patch just mentioned. These are running on Amazon EC2, c5.xlarge instance type, with 100GB of <code>io1</code> storage attached as their root filesystem.</p>
<p>Besides comparing 16 and 17, I also want to isolate other performance improvements in 17, from just that individual addition of the streaming reads API.</p>
<p>On my first virtual machine, I'm just going to create a table with 10 million records:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres16=# CREATE TABLE test AS SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,10000000);
SELECT 10000000
Time: 48281.089 ms (00:48.281)</code></pre></div>
<p>I'm going to do the same on the second one. And the same on the third one, which is 17 without that patch.</p>
<p>This table is about 346 MB:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres16=# \dt+ test
                                  List of relations
 Schema | Name | Type  | Owner  | Persistence | Access method |  Size  | Description 
--------+------+-------+--------+-------------+---------------+--------+-------------
 public | test | table | ubuntu | permanent   | heap          | 346 MB | 
(1 row)</code></pre></div>
<p>Now this system here has a bunch of memory, so this definitely fits in the OS page cache, but it won't fit into shared buffers. "shared_buffers" here on this system is just the default of 128 megabytes:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres16=# SHOW shared_buffers;
 shared_buffers 
----------------
 128MB
(1 row)</code></pre></div>
<p>Also, if you're doing a sequential scan, it will use the ring buffer, and so will not use all of shared buffers when you just read in the whole table.</p>
<p>And I'm going to turn off parallel query here because I don't want this to interfere with the timing information:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SET</span> max_parallel_workers_per_gather <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To keep things simple, <strong>in this test we will focus on testing the impact of Postgres reading from the OS page cache</strong>, not the underlying disk. That means any performance improvements we'll see are most likely due to reduced syscall overhead, or other internal optimizations between Postgres and the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Let's look at the performance difference here of running a <code>SELECT COUNT(*)</code> on this table.</p>
<h3 id="baseline-comparison-between-16-and-17"><a href="#baseline-comparison-between-16-and-17" aria-label="baseline comparison between 16 and 17 permalink"></a>Baseline comparison between 16 and 17</h3>
<p>Here on 16, on the first run, we get 476 milliseconds:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres16=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;
  count   
----------
 10000000
(1 row)

Time: 476.639 ms</code></pre></div>
<p>I'm going to do the same on 17:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres17=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;
  count   
----------
 10000000
(1 row)

Time: 422.464 ms</code></pre></div>
<p>First run looks promising, but let's run this a few more times. Here we can see the best of 3 on 17 was 410 milliseconds:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres17=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;
  count   
----------
 10000000
(1 row)

Time: 410.469 ms</code></pre></div>
<p>Now let's run a few more on 16 as well. On 16, we can see clearly there is about a 60 - 70 millisecond difference between the two versions.</p>
<p>Clearly in this case, <strong>17 is faster for the sequential scan, noticeably.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-impact-of-the-streaming-io-for-sequential-scans"><a href="#the-impact-of-the-streaming-io-for-sequential-scans" aria-label="the impact of the streaming io for sequential scans permalink"></a>The impact of the streaming I/O for sequential scans</h3>
<p>Now let's isolate the change here and let's see if this was just because of this patch. So I used the latest development branch, reverted Melanie's patch, and then rebuilt my local Postgres, to look at what kind of difference that makes.</p>
<p>Here, the performance is about 20-30ms slower without the patch, compared to 410 ms earlier:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres17-without-streaming-seqscan=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;
  count   
----------
 10000000
(1 row)

Time: 425.217 ms</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, one other thing we can do is we can run an <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>. And the reason I like this is because it shows the performance difference actually, a bit more explicitly.</p>
<p><code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> always as a little bit of overhead, but you can see here that on this particular example on 17, we take about 520 ms with the patch (<code>actual time=0.030..521.069</code> part of the <code>Seq Scan</code>):</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres17=# EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;
                                                       QUERY PLAN                                                        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=169293.16..169293.17 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=934.996..934.998 rows=1 loops=1)
   Buffers: shared hit=2592 read=41696
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on test  (cost=0.00..144292.13 rows=10000413 width=0) (actual time=0.030..521.069 rows=10000000 loops=1)
         Buffers: shared hit=2592 read=41696
 Planning Time: 0.033 ms
 Execution Time: 935.016 ms
(6 rows)

Time: 935.336 ms
postgres17=# </code></pre></div>
<p>Versus on 17 without the patch, we take 575 ms (<code>actual time=0.041..575.851</code>):</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres17-without-streaming-seqscan=# EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;
                                                       QUERY PLAN                                                        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=169308.96..169308.97 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=1007.480..1007.481 rows=1 loops=1)
   Buffers: shared hit=2464 read=41824
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on test  (cost=0.00..144304.77 rows=10001677 width=0) (actual time=0.041..575.851 rows=10000000 loops=1)
         Buffers: shared hit=2464 read=41824
 Planning Time: 0.031 ms
 Execution Time: 1007.500 ms
(6 rows)</code></pre></div>
<p>As we can see, in an EXPLAIN ANALYZE measurement, there is about 50 millisecond difference between just that patch being applied. This stays consistent across multiple runs.</p>
<h3 id="small-reads-are-a-big-problem-for-some-filesystems"><a href="#small-reads-are-a-big-problem-for-some-filesystems" aria-label="small reads are a big problem for some filesystems permalink"></a>Small reads are a big problem for some filesystems</h3>
<p>Additionally, sometimes there is actual performance overhead to doing small reads.</p>
<p>For example, last year around the time Thomas proposed this new patch series, there was <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CA+hUKGLisdw=PLn-cjtnUh7QQ_6o85vSH8bk_FjKwyEgqd2mPw@mail.gmail.com#e2f637652acf4ca53324687f9d5adbd7">a report from somebody</a> on the Postgres performance mailing list, who was using a <strong>zstd-compressed btrfs filesystem, that does not do any I/O merging</strong>. Clearly this can cause issues with the 8 kB reads that Postgres does today in 16, where the filesystem will have to do a lot of effort for each individual I/O operation.</p>
<p>Now on 17, instead of the reads being 8 kB reads, by default in this case, you'll get 128 kB reads:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres=# select count(*) from t;

preadv(46, ..., 8, 256237568) = 131072
preadv(46, ..., 5, 256368640) = 131072
preadv(46, ..., 8, 256499712) = 131072
preadv(46, ..., 5, 256630784) = 131072</code></pre></div>
<p>But you can go a step further, and use the new "io_combine_limit" Postgres setting to change the size of the I/Os. And so if you want larger I/Os, for in your file system, that makes a difference, you can, for example, say:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SET</span> io_combine_limit <span>=</span> <span>'256k'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And this will cause the <code>read</code> calls that Postgres issues to the OS (for users of the new streaming I/O API), to actually be up to 256k reads:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres=# set io_combine_limit = '256k';
postgres=# select count(*) from t;

preadv(47, ..., 5, 613728256) = 262144
preadv(47, ..., 5, 613990400) = 262144
preadv(47, ..., 5, 614252544) = 262144
preadv(47, ..., 5, 614514688) = 262144</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="in-conclusion"><a href="#in-conclusion" aria-label="in conclusion permalink"></a>In conclusion</h2>
<p>As shown, this already provides a nice benefit in 17, and I'm really excited of course about Postgres 18 and all of the asynchronous I/O work that we'll hopefully see there.</p>
<p>Well done, Thomas, Melanie, Nazir and everybody else who worked on this, I'm excited to see an important building block of the AIO work land in 17.</p>

<p>A new <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security issue</a> was discovered that affects the JetBrains <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13115-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub plugin</a> on the IntelliJ Platform, which could lead to disclosure of access tokens to third-party sites. The issue affects all IntelliJ-based IDEs as of 2023.1 onwards that have the JetBrains GitHub plugin enabled and configured/in-use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The issue is now resolved and a fix has been provided for all IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform from version 2023.1 onwards.</p>

<p>The JetBrains GitHub plugin has also been updated with the fix, and previously affected versions have been removed from <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JetBrains Marketplace</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have not updated to the latest version, we strongly urge you to do so.</p>



<h2>The Details</h2>



<p>On the 29th of May 2024 we received an external security report with details of a possible vulnerability that would affect pull requests within the IDE. In particular, malicious content as part of a pull request to a GitHub project which would be handled by IntelliJ-based IDEs, would expose access tokens to a third-party host. The CVE ID assigned to this vulnerability is <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2024-37051</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to assessing the issue and starting work on a resolution, we also immediately contacted GitHub to assist us with mitigation. Please note that due to these mitigation measures, the JetBrains GitHub plugin in older versions of JetBrains IDEs may no longer work as expected.</p>



<h2>What is required of you</h2>



<p>First and foremost, we strongly recommend updating to the latest version available for your IDE.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you have actively used GitHub pull request functionality in the IDE, we strongly advise that you revoke any GitHub tokens being used by the plugin. Given that the plugin can use OAuth integration or Personal Access Token (PAT), please check both and revoke as necessary:</p>



<ol>
<li>OAuth Integration Settings: go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Applications</a> → Authorized OAuth Apps and revoke access for the <strong><em>JetBrains IDE Integration</em></strong> application.</li>



<li>Personal Access Token Settings: go to the <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokens</a> page and delete the token issued for the plugin. The default token name is <strong><em>IntelliJ IDEA GitHub integration plugin</em></strong>, but you may be using custom names as well.</li>
</ol>







<p>Please note that after the token has been revoked, you will need to set up the plugin again as all plugin features (including Git operations) will stop working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We sincerely want to apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.</p>



<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Just after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/computex" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/computex">Computex 2024</a>, AMD CEO Lisa Su sat down with Stratechery to conduct an extended interview about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-about-solving-hard-problems/" data-url="https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-about-solving-hard-problems/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">solving hard problems</a> throughout her career— including her time at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm">IBM</a> and contributing to the legacy of PlayStation from both there and AMD afterward. As she notes, "I've been working on PlayStation for a long time, if you think about it. PlayStation 3, 4, 5...[like the common thread] across multiple companies, yes."</p><p>Now, even if you're familiar with the PlayStation 3 and its nature as being difficult to program thanks to its IBM PowerPC-based Cell processor, you most likely didn't know Lisa Su had any involvement with it before this week. Details are few and far between, but we did manage to find the earliest statement where pre-AMD CEO Lisa Su commented on the matter.</p><p>According to Lisa Su, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eetimes.com/ibm-sony-toshiba-team-on-processor-architecture-for-broadband/" data-url="https://www.eetimes.com/ibm-sony-toshiba-team-on-processor-architecture-for-broadband/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">then-Director of Emerging Products at IBM</a> in 2001, "We [IBM] started with a clean sheet of paper and sat down and tried to imagine what sort of processor we'd need five years from now." The decision that IBM, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>, and Toshiba made was to create a CPU with an extreme focus on parallelization.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, that approach is fairly common through multicore CPUs, Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT, or Hyper-threading under Intel marketing), and even dedicated Efficiency cores, but SMT wouldn't emerge until 2002, and the first <em>consumer</em> multicore CPUs from AMD and Intel wouldn't be seen until 2005. And, of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2363-multi-core-cpu/" data-url="https://www.techspot.com/article/2363-multi-core-cpu/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">the first-ever multicore was released by IBM for workstation and server use in 2001</a>— the same year they were planning the PS3's Cell processor.</p><p>The interviewer points out that Sony's PlayStation 3 is viewed as one of its least successful consoles, which is true. The PlayStation 3 pretty much lost the generation handily to Nintendo's cheap, casual-friendly Wii and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s less powerful but easier Xbox 360. The complexity of the architecture meant that cross-platform games didn't always perform as well as they should on PS3, though as developers (particularly first-party devs) mastered the hardware, it did result in the most visually stunning console games of the latter half of the generation being Sony exclusives, like <em>Uncharted 3</em> and its ilk.</p><p>Lisa said, "The Cell processor was extremely ambitious at that time, thinking about the type of parallelism it was trying to get out there. Again, I would say, from a business standpoint, it was certainly successful. As you rank things, I think history will tell you that there may be different rankings."</p><p>"My perspective is, the console era has gone through phases [...] but once you went to HD, you had tremendous increase in cost of asset creation, you had developers heavily motivated to support multiple processors, you had game engines coming along. Suddenly, no one wanted to go to the burden of differentiating on the Cell; they just wanted to <em>run</em> on the Cell," Su explained.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6SfLwwcGyhc4B9pHSZ2DY4"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><p>Interestingly, the seventh generation of home consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii/Wii U) also marks a shift in AMD's allegiances to console manufacturers. AMD produced graphics chips for both Nintendo and Xbox, and all three console manufacturers used the PowerPC CPU architecture. But come to the eighth-gen (PS4, XB1, Switch), both Xbox and PlayStation had switched fully to AMD-powered x86 CPU and GPU architecture. The Switch also saw Nintendo pivot to an Nvidia-powered SoC design (with Arm CPU cores) for their new hybrid console focus.</p><p>With the added context of this interview, one can't help but wonder if Lisa Su's unifying thread throughout the last three generations of PlayStation hardware isn't a coincidence. It could just be corporate happenstance, but going from a humble Product Director and Engineer working on the PS3 at IBM to Senior vice president (in 2012, CEO in 2014) at AMD, setting the future course of both PlayStation and Xbox hardware, is truly impressive.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also a great win for AMD, in general, to provide the hardware behind the two biggest consoles on the market for two consecutive (and a third upcoming) console generations. No matter who wins between Sony and Microsoft and their console war, AMD wins, and that's the kind of thinking that earns you a CEO spot.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>At Meta, we support real-time communication (RTC) for billions of people through our apps, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We are working to make RTC accessible by providing a high-quality experience for everyone – even those who might not have the fastest connections or the latest phones.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>As more and more people have relied on our products to make calls over the years, we’ve been working on new ways to ensure all calls have a solid audio quality.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We’ve built the Meta Low Bitrate (MLow) codec: a new tool that improves audio quality especially for those on slow-speed connections.</span></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_21370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21370"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Complexity-Properties-Triangle-1.png?w=663" alt="" width="350" height="295" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Complexity-Properties-Triangle-1.png 663w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Complexity-Properties-Triangle-1.png?resize=96,81 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Complexity-Properties-Triangle-1.png?resize=192,162 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-21370">Figure 1: Increasing complexity or bitrate usually improves quality, but good codecs achieve higher quality while balancing the other two.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>RTC products use many building blocks to deliver the full experience, and one of the critical components is audio/video codecs. These codecs help compress the captured audio/video data so it can be sent across the internet efficiently to the recipient, keeping the experience real time. For example, the size of raw audio captured for a typical call is 768 kbps (mono, sampling at 48kHz, bit depth 16), which modern codecs are able to compress down to 25-30 kbps. Often this compression comes at the cost of some quality (loss of information), but good codecs can strike a balance among the trio of quality, bitrate, and complexity by exploiting deep knowledge about the nature of the audio signal as well as by using psychoacoustics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Building a good codec is quite challenging, and that is why we don’t see new codecs emerging very often. The last widely known, good open-source codec was Opus, released in 2012, which has become the codec of choice for the wide variety of applications on the internet. Meta has used Opus for all its RTC needs, and so far it has served us well – helping to deliver quality calls to billions of users across the globe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ypsZUNRjI4?si=Jo_8nGuviRGzo-4f" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2><span>Our motivation for building a new codec</span></h2>
<p><span>Given the massive scale of RTC usage in Meta products, we get to see how a codec performs in a range of network scenarios and how it impacts the end user’s experience. In particular, we’ve observed that a significant chunk of calls have poor network connections throughout or for part of a call. Typically a bandwidth estimation module (BWE) detects the quality of the network, and as the network quality degrades, we need to lower the codec operating bitrate to avoid congesting the network and keep the audio flowing – impacting the trio balance referenced above. Complicating matters, conducting a video call despite poor network quality leaves little room for audio and pushes the audio bitrate further down. The lowest operating point for Opus is 6 kbps, at which it runs in NarrowBand mode (0 – 4kHz) and does not adequately capture all the sound frequencies produced by human voices—and so doesn’t sound as clear or natural. Here is an example of how Opus sounds at 6kbps and the corresponding reference file for comparison.</span></p>
<p><span>Raw reference signal:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Opus @ 6 kbps NarrowBand (NB):&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Over the last two years, we have seen development of some new machine learning (ML)-based audio codecs that provide good quality audio at very low bitrates. In October of 2022, Meta released </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-powered-audio-compression-technique/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Encodec</span></a><span>, which achieves amazingly crisp audio quality at very low bitrates. While these AI/ML-based codecs are able to achieve great quality at low bitrates, it often comes at the expense of heavy computational cost. Consequently, only the very high-end (expensive) mobile handsets are able to run these codecs reliably, while users running on lower-end devices continue to experience audio quality issues in low-bitrate conditions. So the net impact of these newer computationally expensive codecs is actually limited to a small portion of users.</span></p>
<p><span>A significant number of our users still use low-end devices. For example, more than 20 percent of our calls are made on ARMv7 devices, and 10’s of millions of daily calls on WhatsApp are on 10-year-old-plus devices. Given the readily available codec choices and our commitment to ensure that all users – regardless of what device they’re on – have a quality calling experience, we clearly need a codec with very low-compute requirements that still delivers high-quality audio at these lowest bitrates.</span></p>

<p><span>We broke ground with our development of a new codec in late 2021. After nearly two years of active development and testing, we are proud to announce </span><b>M</b><span>eta </span><b>Low</b><span> Bitrate audio codec, aka MLow, which achieves two-times-better quality than Opus (POLQA MOS 1.89 vs 3.9 @ 6kbps WB). Even more importantly, we are able to achieve this great quality while keeping MLow’s computational complexity </span><b>10 percent lower</b><span> than that of Opus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Figure 2 below shows a MOS (Mean Opinion Score) plot on a 1-5 scale and compares the POLQA scores between Opus and MLow at various bitrates. As the chart makes evident, MLow has a huge advantage over Opus at the lowest bitrates, where it saturates quality faster than Opus.</span></p>

<p><span>Being able to encode high-quality audio at lower bitrates also unlocks more effective Forward Error Correction (FEC) strategies. Compared with Opus, with MLow we can afford to pack FEC at much lower bitrates, which significantly helps to improve the audio quality in packet loss scenarios.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are two audio samples at 14 kbps with heavy 30 percent receiver-side packet loss.</span></p>
<p>Opus:</p>

MLow:</p>

<p><span>Note that at these bitrates, Opus is not able to encode any inband FEC. It needs a minimum of 19 kbps to encode any inband FEC at 10 percent packet loss, which hurts the audio recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span>MLow internals</span></h2>
<p><span>MLow builds on the concepts of a classic CELP (Code Excited Linear Prediction) codec with advancements around excitation generation, parameter quantization, and coding schemes. Figure 3 is a high-level visual of how the codec works internally. On the left we have an input signal (raw PCM audio) feeding into the encoder, which then splits the signal into two low and high-frequency bands. Then, each band is encoded separately while making use of shared information to achieve better compression. All the output is passed through a range encoder to further compress and generate an encoded payload. The decoder does the exact opposite when given the payload to generate output audio signals.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_21288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21288"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="242" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png 1484w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?resize=916,217 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?resize=768,182 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?resize=1024,242 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?resize=96,23 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?resize=192,45 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-21288">Figure 3: High level MLow encoder and decoder architecture.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>With these split-band optimizations, we are able to encode the high band using very few bits, which lets MLow deliver SuperWideBand (32kHz sampling) using a much lower bitrate.</span></p>
<h2><span>What’s next?</span></h2>
<p><span>MLow has greatly enhanced audio quality on low-end devices while still ensuring calls are end-to-end encrypted. We are really excited about what we have accomplished in just the last two years—from developing a new codec to successfully shipping it to billions of users around the globe. We’re continuing to work on improving the audio recovery in heavy packet loss networks by pumping out more redundant audio, which MLow allows us to do efficiently. We’re excited to share more as we continue working to make it easier for all our users to make quality audio calls.&nbsp;</span></p>
