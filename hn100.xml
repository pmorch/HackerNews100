<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>A new feature on X has revealed that a huge number of large, divisive political accounts claiming to be Trump supporters are actually operating out of foreign countries. The discovery — likely the most sweeping public exposure of covert foreign activity on a major platform since the revelations about Russia in 2016 — raises serious concerns about covert foreign influence in U.S. political discourse, mirroring the Russian disinformation campaign in which operatives from Russia’s Internet Research Agency posed as U.S. persons to interfere in the election.</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1992335925322613127?s=46" rel="">new feature</a><span> on X allows users to see the approximate place where an account was created and is primarily operating from, rather than having to rely solely on an account operator’s self-reported location. The move was made to boost transparency and enhance the authenticity of discussions on the platform, but it immediately became apparent that the new feature would have an additional effect: exposing foreign accounts that are posing as Americans.</span></p><p><span>On Saturday, X users </span><a href="https://x.com/alex2yc/status/1992077299295072387?s=46" rel="">found scores of pro-Trump and MAGA accounts</a><span> that were trying to pass as Americans but were operated from countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and elsewhere. X acknowledges that some of the operating locations may actually be the location of a VPN service rather than the location of the account owner, but the sheer number of accounts operating from outside of the United States makes it clear that not all of these are simply proxy locations. Furthermore, some of these accounts had listed their locations as being within the U.S., and some were operating with usernames such as (@)American despite being operated from overseas. As X Product Chief Nikita Bier </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/x-begins-rolling-out-the-about-this-account-feature-to-users-profiles/" rel="">explained</a><span>, if an account claims to be from a U.S. location but the data shows it’s based overseas, that discrepancy is a red flag suggesting the account “might have another agenda.”</span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aE8B!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5d8e116-0ae0-4296-bc3d-76af8c73e15f_1320x1030.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aE8B!,w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5d8e116-0ae0-4296-bc3d-76af8c73e15f_1320x1030.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aE8B!,w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5d8e116-0ae0-4296-bc3d-76af8c73e15f_1320x1030.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="A few examples of large MAGA accounts posing as Americans while operating from a foreign country.

For instance, a prominent account called “MAGA NATION” (with 392,000+ followers) turned out to be posting from Eastern Europe, not America. Other examples include “Dark MAGA” (15,000 followers, based in Thailand), “MAGA Scope” (51,000 followers, based in Nigeria), and an “America First” account (67,000 followers) run from Bangladesh.

In 2016, Russia’s Internet Research Agency (IRA) infamously created countless fake social media personas impersonating Americans to sow discord and denigrate Hillary Clinton/boost Trump’s candidacy. </span><a href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/social-media-content/#:~:text=%E2%80%9C,persons,%20and%20without%20revealing%20their" rel="">According to</a><span> the Mueller investigation’s conclusions and U.S. intelligence findings, these operatives “posed as U.S. persons…operated social media pages and groups designed to attract U.S. audiences…[and] falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists when, in fact, they were controlled by [foreign actors].” Their strategy included using stolen identities and pretending to be grassroots American voices, all to infiltrate online communities and influence political opinion. By mid-2016 the IRA’s campaign explicitly focused on boosting Trump and disparaging Hillary Clinton, under orders from the Kremlin.</span></p><p><span>The pattern now emerging on X suggests history may be repeating itself, albeit likely with new actors and technologies. Or perhaps even more likely, these types of tactics never actually stopped in the first place. Covert foreign influence via social media remained a live threat in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. In fact, investigative reporting by CNN in 2024 </span><a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cnr/date/2024-08-29/segment/22#:~:text=For%20now,%20we%20don't%20know,for%20Twitter,%20told%20us%20this" rel="">uncovered</a><span> a campaign on X aimed at bolstering Trump’s candidacy – a network of at least 60 fake pro-Trump accounts using profile photos stolen from real women in Europe. These fake personas, posing as enthusiastic American Trump supporters, told U.S. voters to “vote for Trump in 2024” while the actual women depicted (from countries like Denmark, the Netherlands, and even Russia) had no idea their images were being misused.</span></p><p>The discovery — likely the most sweeping public exposure of covert foreign activity on a major platform since the revelations about Russia in 2016 — raises serious concerns about covert foreign influence in U.S. political discourse.</p><p>The geographic spread of the exposed accounts hints at a variety of possible culprits and motives. Some accounts originate in countries historically linked to disinformation targeting the U.S. (e.g. Russia or Eastern European locales) while others come from places like Nigeria, India, Thailand, or Kenya with no obvious state sponsor. This suggests we could be seeing multiple layers of foreign influence: both state-sponsored influence operations (Russia and others) trying to sway U.S. politics, as well as a cottage industry of opportunists and trolls for hire globally who exploit U.S. political tribalism for clout or profit. In 2016, for example, not only did Russian agents interfere, but so did independent foreign scammers – notably the notorious “Macedonian fake news farms” where teenagers churned out pro-Trump disinformation simply because it drew huge web traffic and ad revenue. Today’s foreign MAGA accounts could likewise be profit-driven grifters – people pretending to be patriotic Americans while actually just racking up followers and perhaps soliciting donations or earning X’s ad-share payouts from viral content.</p><p>The discovery that a significant number of political accounts – especially in the pro-Trump/MAGA sphere – are operated from abroad carries far-reaching implications. It validates warnings that covert foreign influence on social media did not end with 2016, but is an ongoing challenge to U.S. democracy and societal cohesion. The immediate impact is a jolt of awareness: both the public and policymakers can now see concrete examples of how outsiders try to shape American political conversations from afar. This awareness, thanks to X’s transparency feature, is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it empowers users and authorities to identify and possibly neutralize foreign propaganda by calling it out and removing its mask of authenticity. On the other hand, it injects a new layer of skepticism and accusation into political discourse – people may reflexively dismiss opposing views as “just foreign bots,” and genuine activists might find themselves under suspicion if their location isn’t easily verified.</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://weaponizedspaces.substack.com/p/x-just-accidentally-exposed-a-vast?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Weaponized!

Lawmakers, campaigners, and journalists will need to vet online trends more carefully (e.g. check if a trending political hashtag is heavily driven by accounts from overseas). The platform implications for X are significant as well: X must decide whether it will actively clamp down on these foreign-run accounts or simply inform users and leave the content up. Its reputation as a platform for healthy political dialogue is on the line; too much manipulation could drive users to alternatives or invite regulatory backlash.</p><p>As for the rest of us, the implications are similar to those following the 2016 Russian campaign: we’re still under attack and likely have been this whole time.</p><p><em>I’ll return with a more detailed analysis of these revelations soon, so stay tuned.</em></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="test" fs-toc-element="contents" fs-toc-offsettop="8rem"><p>It's another Monday morning, sitting down at the computer. And I see a stack of alerts from the last hour of packages showing signs of malware in our triage queue. Having not yet finished my first cup of coffee, I see Shai Hulud indicators. Yikes, surely that's a false positive? Nope, welcome to Monday, Shai Hulud struck again. Strap in.</p><h2>Timeline of the Shai-Hulud Campaign</h2><p>The timing is notable, given npm’s recent announcement that it will revoke classic tokens on December 9 after the wave of supply-chain attacks. With many users still not migrated to trusted publishing, the attacker seized the moment for one more hit before npm’s deadline.</p><ul role="list"><li>August 27 - We release our report detailing the <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/popular-nx-packages-compromised-on-npm">S1ngularity campaign</a> targeting several nx packages on npm. &nbsp;</li><li>September 16 - The <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/s1ngularity-nx-attackers-strike-again">attacker strikes again</a>, launching the first wave of the Shai-Hulud attacks. &nbsp;</li><li>September 18 - We publish a <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/bugs-in-shai-hulud-debugging-the-desert">follow-up analysis</a>, diving deeper into the campaign’s technical quirks and early payload behavior. &nbsp;</li><li>November 24 - A second strike occurs, dubbed the “Second Coming” by the attackers, timed just before npm’s deadline for revoking old tokens.</li></ul><h2>What is Shai-Hulud?: A Quick Refresher </h2><p>Shai-Hulud, named after the gigantic sandworms from Dune as part of the attacker's flair for theatrics, is a self-replicating npm worm built to spread quickly through compromised developer environments. Once it infects a system, it searches for exposed secrets such as API keys and tokens using TruffleHog and publishes anything it finds to a <a href="https://github.com/search?q=Sha1-Hulud%3A+The+Second+Coming.&amp;ref=opensearch&amp;type=repositories">public GitHub repository</a>. It then attempts to push new copies of itself to npm, helping it propagate across the ecosystem, while exfiltrating data back to the attacker. Keeping with the dramatic theme, the attacker refers to this latest wave as the “Second Coming.”</p><h2>Differences from last time</h2><p>This time around, there are some significant differences in the attack:</p><ul role="list"><li>It install bun with the file <code>setup_bun.js</code> and then uses that to execute <code>bun_environment.js</code> &nbsp;which is the actual malicious code.</li><li>It creates a randomly named repository with stolen data, rather than a hardcoded name.</li><li>It will infect up to 100 npm packages, compared to 20 last time.</li><li>If it can't authenticate with GitHub or NPM, it will wipe all files in the users Home directory.</li></ul><h2>Which packages are affected?</h2><p>We've detected the following packages compromised with a new version of Shai Hulud. Between all these 492 packages, they have a total of 132 million monthly downloads:</p><ul

This gives it access to the developer’s machine, build systems, or cloud environment. It then uses an automated tool (TruffleHog) to search for sensitive information like passwords, API keys, cloud tokens, and GitHub or NPM credentials. Anything it finds is uploaded to a public GitHub repository labeled <strong>“Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.”</strong> If those stolen secrets include access to code repositories or package registries, attackers can use them to break into more accounts and publish more malicious packages, helping the attack spread further. Because trusted ecosystems were involved and millions of downloads are affected, any team using NPM should immediately check whether they were impacted and rotate any credentials that may have leaked.</p><h2>‍<br>Which actions should security teams take?</h2><ul role="list"><li>Audit all Zapier/ENS-related npm dependencies and versions.<br></li><li>Rotate <strong>all</strong> GitHub, npm, cloud, and CI/CD secrets used during installs.<br></li><li>Check GitHub for strange repos with the description&nbsp; “Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming”</li><li>Disable npm <code>postinstall</code> scripts in CI where possible.</li><li>Pin package versions and enforce MFA on GitHub and npm accounts.</li><li>Use tools like <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/safe-chain">Safe-Chain</a> to block malicious packages on NPM </li></ul><p>‍<br>Story developing...

<h2>2025.11.23: NSA and IETF, part 3: <span>Dodging the issues at hand. #pqcrypto #hybrids #nsa #ietf #dodging</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html">Normal practice</a>
in deploying post-quantum cryptography is to deploy ECC+PQ.
IETF's TLS working group is standardizing ECC+PQ.
But IETF management is also non-consensually ramming a particular NSA-driven document
through the IETF process,
a "non-hybrid" document that adds <em>just PQ</em> as another TLS option.</p>
<p>Don't worry: we're standardizing cars with seatbelts.
Also, recognizing generous funding from the National Morgue Association,
we're going to standardize cars <em>without</em> seatbelts as another option,
ignoring the safety objections.
That's okay, right?</p>
<p>Last month I posted
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html">part 1</a>
of this story.
Today's
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251123-corruption.html">part 2</a>
highlighted the corruption.
This blog post, part 3,
highlights the dodging in a particular posting at the beginning of this month
by an IETF "security area director".
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251123-scope.html">Part 4</a>
will give an example of how
dissent on this topic has been censored.</p>
<p><strong><a name="chairs"></a>Consensus means whatever the people in power want to do.</strong>
Recall from my previous blog post that
"adoption" of a document is a preliminary step
before an IETF "working group" works on, and decides whether to standardize, the document.
In April 2025,
the chairs of the IETF TLS WG called for "adoption" of this NSA-driven document.
During the call period,
20 people expressed unequivocal support for adoption,
2 people expressed conditional support for adoption,
and 7 people expressed unequivocal opposition to adoption.
(<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#agreement">Details for verification.</a>)</p>
<p>The chairs
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#chairs">claimed</a>
that "we have consensus to adopt this draft".
I promptly
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.6">asked for explanation</a>.</p>
<p>Before the chairs could even reply,
an "area director"
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.7">interrupted</a>,
claiming, inter alia, the following:
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".</p>
<p>After these lies by the "area director" were
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.10">debunked</a>,
the chairs said that they had declared consensus
"because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft"
specifically "enough people willing to review the draft".</p>
<p>I can understand not everybody being familiar with
the specific definition of "consensus" that
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards">antitrust law</a>
requires standards-development organizations to follow.
But it's astonishing to see chairs substituting a consensus-evaluation procedure
that simply ignores objections.</p>
<p><strong><a name="stonewalling"></a>Stonewalling.</strong>
The chairs said I could escalate.
IETF procedures say that an unresolved dispute can be brought
"to the attention of the Area Director(s) for the area in which the Working Group is chartered",
and then "The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute".</p>
<p>I filed a complaint with the "security area directors"
in <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250605-non-hybrid.pdf">early June 2025</a>.
One of them never replied.
The other,
the same one who had claimed that there was "clearly consensus",
sent a <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.14">series of excuses</a>
for not handling the complaint.
For example, one excuse was that the PDF format "discourages participation".</p>
<p>Do IETF procedures say "The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute
unless the dispute is documented in a PDF"?
No.</p>
<p>I sent email two days later
systematically addressing the excuses.
The "area director" never replied.</p>
<p>It isn't clear under IETF procedures whether a non-reply allows an appeal.
It is, however, clear that an appeal <em>can't</em> be filed after two months.
I escalated to the "Internet Engineering Steering Group" (IESG)
in <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250812-non-hybrid.pdf">August 2025</a>.</p>
<p>(These aren't even marginally independent groups.
The "area directors" are the IESG members.
IESG appoints the WG chairs.)</p>
<p>IESG didn't reply until October 2025.
It rejected one of the "Area Director" excuses for having ignored my complaint,
but endorsed another excuse.
I promptly filed a
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf">revised complaint</a>
with the "area director",
jumping through the hoops that IESG had set.
There were then further
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251024-rules.pdf">runarounds</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a name="switch"></a>The switch.</strong>
Suddenly,
on 1 November 2025,
IESG publicly instructed the "area director" to address the following question:
"Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the
TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?"</p>
<p>The "area director" posted his conclusion mere hours later:
"I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result
was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document".</p>
<p><strong><a name="dodging"></a>Dodging procedural objections.</strong>
Before looking at how the "area director" argued for this conclusion,
I'd like to emphasize three things that the "area director" <em>didn't</em> do.</p>
<p>First,
did the "area director" address my <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf">complaint</a>
about the chair action on this topic?
No.</p>
<p>One reason this matters is that
the law requires standards-development organizations to provide an
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards">"appeals process"</a>.
Structurally,
the "area director" isn't quoting and answering the points in my complaint;
the "area director" puts the entire burden on the reader
to try to figure out what's supposedly answering what,
and to realize that many points remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Second,
did the "area director" address the chairs claiming that
"we have consensus to adopt this draft"?
Or the previous claim from the "area director"
that there was "clearly consensus"?
No.
Instead IESG and this "area director"
quietly shifted from "consensus" to "rough consensus".
(Did you notice this shift when I quoted IESG's "rough consensus" instruction?)</p>
<p>One reason this matters is that
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards">"consensus"</a>
is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations.
The law doesn't allow "rough consensus".
Also,
IETF claims that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">"decision-making requires achieving broad consensus"</a>.
"broad consensus" is even stronger than "consensus",
since it's saying that there's consensus <em>in a broad group</em>.</p>
<p>Third,
the way that my complaint had established the
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.5">lack of consensus</a>
was, first, by reviewing the general definition of "consensus"
(which I paraphrased from the definition in the law, omitting a citation only because
the TLS chairs had threatened me with a
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251123-scope.html">list ban</a>
if I mentioned the law again),
and then applying the components of that definition to the situation at hand.
Did the area director follow this structure?
Here's the definition of "consensus", or "rough consensus" if we're switching to that,
and now let's apply that definition?
No.
Nobody reading this message from the "area director" can figure out what the "area director" believes these words mean.</p>
<p>Wow, look at that:
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards">"due process"</a>
is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations.
Part of due process is simply <em>making clear what procedures are being applied</em>.
Could it possibly be that the people writing the law
were thinking through how standardization processes could be abused?</p>
<p><strong><a name="numbers"></a>Numbers.</strong>
Without further ado,
let's look at what the "security area director" did write.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
The IESG has requested that I evaluate the WG Adoption call
results for ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3
(draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement). Please see below.

<p>As noted above,
IESG had instructed the "area director" to answer the following question:
"Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the
TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?"</p>
<p>Side note:
Given that the "area director" posted all of the following
on the same day that IESG instructed the "area director" to write this,
presumably this was all written in advance and coordinated with the rest of IESG.
I guess the real point of finally (on 1 November 2025) addressing the adoption decision (from 15 April 2025)
was to try to provide cover for the "last call" a few days later (5 November 2025).</p>

<p>These numbers are <em>much</em> closer to reality
than the "area director" previously writing
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".</p>
<p>Also, given that the "area director" is continually making claims that aren't true
(see examples below)
and seems generally allergic to providing evidence
(the text I'm quoting below has, amazingly, <em>zero</em> URLs),
it's a relief to see the "area director" providing names to back up the claimed numbers here.</p>
<p>But somehow, even after being
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.10">caught</a>
lying about the numbers before,
the "area director" still can't resist shading the numbers a bit.</p>
<p>The actual numbers were
20 people unequivocally supporting adoption,
2 people conditionally supporting adoption,
and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.
Clearly 7 is close to 6, and 20+2 is close to 23, but, hmmm, not exactly.
Let's check the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How does the "area director" end up with 6 negative votes rather than 7?
  By falsely listing Thomas Bellebaum as "ambivalent"
  and falsely attributing a "prefer not, but okay if we do" position to Bellebaum.
  In fact,
  Bellbaum had
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250813164633/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YyemGJF-4-hRVwOcJ47Rw4Nu8Js/">written</a>
  "I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids."
  (This was in reply to Stephen Farrell,
  who had written "I'm opposed to adoption, at this time.")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the "area director" end up with 23 positive votes rather than 22?
  By falsely listing the document author (Deirdre Connolly) as having stated a pro-adoption position during the call.
  The "area director" seems generally clueless about conflict-of-interest issues
  and probably doesn't find it obvious that an author <em>shouldn't</em> vote,
  but the simple fact is that the author <em>didn't</em> vote.
  She

  during the call period;
  all of those messages are merely commenting on specific points,
  not casting a vote on the adoption question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The document author didn't object to the "area director" fudging the numbers.
Bellebaum did politely
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251123055459/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/FmhDavgLrGR2y920WWbM80yMge8/">object</a>;

beyond trying to save face with comments such as "Thanks for the clarification".</p>
<p>More to the point,
the "area director" has never explained
whether or how the tallies of positive and negative votes
are supposed to be relevant to the "rough consensus" claim.
The "area director" also hasn't commented on IETF

<p>Okay,
the "area director"

The "area director" tries to defend this by saying that other documents flunk too.

<p>Wrong.
Anything+PQ, and in particular ECC+PQ,
complies with NIST's standards when the PQ part does.
See
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250924170028/https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-227.pdf">NIST SP 800-227</a>:

shared secret (i.e., S<sub>j</sub> for some j) is generated from the key-establishment methods in SP

For example, if the PQ part is ML-KEM as per FIPS 203,
then NIST allows ECC+PQ too.</p>
<p>What's next:
claiming that using PQ in an Internet protocol would violate NIST standards
unless NIST has standardized that particular Internet protocol?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I won't bother addressing the errors here,
since the bottom-line claim is orthogonal to the issue at hand.
The TLS WG already has an ECC+PQ document using NIST-approved PQ;
the question is whether to also have a document allowing the ECC seatbelt to be removed.</p>

<p>You know what would be even less complicated?

<p>There was a claim that PQ is less complex than ECC+PQ.
There was no response to

<p>Hmmm.

<p>This comment about "weight" is revealing.
What we'll see again and again is that the "area director"
is expressing the weight that <em>he</em> places on each argument
(within the arguments selected and phrased by the "area director"),
i.e., the extent to which <em>he</em> is convinced or not convinced by those arguments.</p>
<p>Given that IESG has power under IETF rules to unilaterally block publications approved by WGs,
it's unsurprising that the "area directors", in their roles as IESG members,
will end up evaluating the merits of WG-approved documents.
But <em>that isn't what this "area director" was instructed to do here</em>.
There isn't a WG-approved document at this point.
Instead the "area director" was instructed to evaluate whether the chairs "appropriately"
called "rough consensus" to "adopt" the document.
The "area director" is supposed to be evaluating procedurally what the WG decision-makers did.
Instead the "area director" is putting his thumb on the scale in favor of the document.</p>

<p>I think that the "area director" is trying to make some sort of claim here

<p>More importantly,
claiming that ML-KEM isn't "known" to have problems

It's like saying

<p>Here the "area director" is reasonably capturing
a statement from one document proponent
(original wording:
"I find it

yet we are also somehow uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true at the same time").</p>

explaining the error:
"Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a
quantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing
that as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case
the PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do
you believe they're contradictory?"</p>
<p>There was, of course, no reply at the time.
The "area director" now simply repeats the erroneous argument.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"Non-hybrid classics" is weird terminology.
Sometimes pre-quantum algorithms (ECC, RSA, etc.) are called "classical",
so I guess the claim here is that using just ECC in TLS isn't being phased out.
That's a bizarre claim.
There are intensive efforts to roll out ECC+PQ in TLS
to try to protect against quantum computers.

<p>If someone is trying to argue for removing ECC,
there's a big difference between the plausible scenario of ECC having "less" value
and the extreme scenario of ECC having "no" value.
It's wrong for the "area director" to be conflating these possibilities.</p>
<p>As I put it
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240102-hybrid.html">almost two years ago</a>:
"Concretely, think about a demo showing that spending a billion dollars on quantum computation can break a thousand X25519 keys.
Yikes! We should be aiming for much higher security than that!
We don't even want a billion-dollar attack to be able to break <em>one</em> key!
Users who care about the security of their data will be happy that we deployed post-quantum cryptography.
But are the users going to say 'Let's turn off X25519 and make each session a million dollars cheaper to attack'?
I'm skeptical.
I think users will need to see much cheaper attacks before agreeing that X25519 has negligible security value."</p>
<p>Furthermore,
let's think for a moment about the idea
that one will eventually want to transition to <em>just ML-KEM</em>,
the specific proposal that the "area director" is portraying as the future.
Here are three ways that this can easily be wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maybe ML-KEM's implementation issues
  end up convincing the community to shift to a more robust option,
  analogously to what happened with <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#safecurves">ECC</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the advances in public attacks continue to the point of breaking ML-KEM outright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the cliff stops crumbling and ML-KEM survives,
  but more efficient options also survive. 
  At this point there are quite a few options more efficient than ML-KEM.
  (Random example: <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/739">SMAUG</a>.
  The current SMAUG software isn't as fast as the ML-KEM software,
  but this is outweighed by SMAUG using less network traffic than ML-KEM.)
  Probably some options will be broken,
  but ML-KEM would have to be remarkably lucky to end up as the most efficient remaining option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this "area director" think that all of the more efficient options are going to be broken, while ML-KEM won't?
Sounds absurdly overconfident.
More likely is that the "area director" doesn't even realize that there are more efficient options.
For anyone thinking "presumably those newer options have received less scrutiny than ML-KEM":
we're talking about what to do long-term, remember?</p>
<p>Taking ML-KEM as the PQ component of ECC+PQ is working for getting something rolled out now.
Hopefully ML-KEM will turn out to not be a security disaster (or a patent disaster).
But, for guessing what will be best to do in 5 or 10 or 15 years,
picking ML-KEM is premature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
When and where to exactly draw the line of still using a

component safeguard is speculation at best.

</blockquote>
<p>Here the "area director" is <em>clearly</em> attacking a strawman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">

quantum algorithms now to gain experience
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is rolling out PQ supposed to be gaining experience
that isn't gained from the current rollout of ECC+PQ?</p>
<p>Also, I think it's important to call out the word "pure" here
as incoherent, indefensible marketing.
What we're actually talking about isn't modifying ML-KEM in any way;
it's simply hashing the ML-KEM session key together with other inputs.
Is ML-KEM no longer "pure" when it's plugged into TLS,
which also hashes session keys?
(The word "pure" also showed up in a few of the earlier quotes.)</p>

maintenance.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the "area director" is again
making the same mistake explained earlier:
ignoring the fact that ECC+PQ is already there,
and thus getting the complexity evaluation backwards.</p>
<p>The "thus add risk" logic is also wrong.
Again, all of these options are more complex than the null cipher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span color="#663319">
Additionally, the existence of draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design and the
extensive
discussions around "chempat" vs "xwing" vs "kitchensink" shows that there is
at least some complexity that is added by the hybrid solutions.
</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, the details of how to combine ECC with PQ in TLS are already settled and deployed.</p>
<p>Looking beyond TLS:
Chempat hashes the transcript (similarly to TLS),
making it robust for a wide range of protocols.
The other options add fragility by hashing less for the sake of minor cost savings.
Each of these options is under 10 lines of code.
The "area director" exaggerates the complexity by mentioning "extensive discussions",
and spends much more effort hyping this complexity as a risk
than acknowledging the risks of further PQ attacks.</p>
<p>Anyway,
it's not as if the presence of this document
has eliminated the discussions of ECC+PQ details,
nor is there any credible mechanism by which it could do so.
Again, the actual choice at hand is whether to have PQ as an option <em>alongside</em> ECC+PQ.
Adding that option <em>adds</em> complexity.
The "area director" is getting the complexity comparison backwards
by instead comparing
(1) PQ in isolation to (2) ECC+PQ in isolation.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, "known to consume"!
There was, um,

Yeah, that's the ticket.

This makes people <em>more</em> likely to see the warning,
and at the same time it removes the core problem of the bad proposal being standardized.</p>

<p>Certainly there were competition-like aspects to the process.
I tend to refer to it as a competition.

<p>Here's the objection from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250814213602/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Stephen Farrell</a>
that the "area director" isn't quoting or linking to:
"I don't see what criteria we might use in adopting this that
   wouldn't leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if
   we don't adopt other pure PQ national standards that will
   certainly arise".</p>
<p>After reading this objection,
you can see how the "area director" is sort of responding to it
by suggesting that everybody is following NIST
(i.e., that the "certainly arise" part is wrong).</p>
<p>But that's not true.
NIST's selections are controversial.
For example, ISO is
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250423-mceliece.html">considering</a>
not just ML-KEM but also</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classic McEliece,
  where NIST has

  it's waiting for ISO

  and</p>

  "will not be considered further for standardization".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ISO is also now
<a href="https://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/crypt/ntru/index.html">considering</a>
NTRU, where the

includes "All patents related to NTRU have expired"
(very different from the ML-KEM situation).</p>
<p>BSI, which sets cryptographic standards for Germany,

not just ML-KEM
but also FrodoKEM (which it describes as "more conservative" than ML-KEM)
and Classic McEliece ("conservative and very thoroughly analysed").
Meanwhile China has called for
<a href="https://www.niccs.org.cn/en/">submissions</a>
of new post-quantum proposals for standardization.</p>
<p>I could keep going,
but this is enough evidence to show that Farrell's prediction was correct;
the "area director" is once again wrong.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Notice how the "area director" is dodging Farrell's point.
If NSA can pressure the TLS WG into standardizing non-hybrid ML-KEM,
why can't China pressure the TLS WG into standardizing something China wants?
What criteria will IETF use to answer this question
without leaving the WG "open to accusations of favouritism"?
If you want people to believe that it isn't about the money

Based on the above, I believe the WG Chairs made the correct call that

</blockquote>
<p>The chairs claimed that "we have consensus to adopt this draft"
(based on claiming that "there were enough people willing to review the draft",
never mind the number of objections).
That claim is wrong.
The call for adoption failed to reach consensus.</p>
<p>The "area director" claimed that
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".
These statements still haven't been retracted;
they were and are outright lies about what happened.
Again, the
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#agreement">actual tallies</a>
were
20 people unequivocally supporting adoption,
2 people conditionally supporting adoption,
and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.</p>
<p>Without admitting error,
the "area director" has retreated to a claim of "rough consensus".
The mishmash of ad-hoc comments from the "area director"
certainly doesn't demonstrate any coherent meaning of "rough consensus".</p>
<p>It's fascinating that IETF's
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">advertising to the public</a>
claims that IETF's "decision-making requires achieving broad consensus",
but IETF's
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html">WG procedures</a>
allow controversial documents to be pushed through on the basis of "rough consensus".
To be clear,
that's only if the "area director" approves of the documents,
as you can see from the same "area director"
issuing yet another mishmash of ad-hoc comments to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251004151803/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/41gkoA74Dr-6JZYNThfpjZD0BPM/">overturn</a>
a separate chair decision in September 2025.</p>
<p>You would think that the WG procedures would <em>define</em> "rough consensus".
They don't.
All they say is that
"51% of the working group does not qualify as 'rough consensus' and 99% is better than rough",
not even making clear whether 51% of <em>voters</em> within a larger working group can qualify.
This leaves a vast range of ambiguous intermediate cases up to the people in power.</p><hr><span size="1"><b>Version:</b>

	<p>I have at least a few readers for which the sound of a man's voice saying
"government cell phone detected" will elicit a palpable reaction. In
Department of Energy facilities across the country, incidences of employees
accidentally carrying phones into secure areas are reduced through a sort of
automated nagging. A device at the door monitors for the presence of a tag;
when the tag is detected it plays an audio clip. Because this is the government,
the device in question is highly specialized, fantastically expensive, and
says "government cell phone" even though most of the phones in question are
personal devices. Look, they already did the recording, they're not changing
it now!</p>
<p>One of the things that I love is weird little wireless networks. Long ago I
wrote about <a href="https://computer.rip/2023-01-02-ANT-plus-is-PAN-for-ants.html">ANT+</a>,
for example, a failed personal area network standard designed mostly around
fitness applications. There's tons of these, and they have a lot of
similarities---so it's fun to think about the protocols that went down a
completely different path. It's even better, of course, if the protocol is
obscure outside of an important niche. And a terrible website, too? What more
could I ask for.</p>
<p>The DoE's cell-phone nagging boxes, and an array of related but more critical
applications, rely on an unusual personal area networking protocol called RuBee.</p>
<p>RuBee is a product of Visible Assets Inc., or VAI, founded in 2004 <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> by John K.
Stevens. Stevens seems a somewhat improbable founder, with a background in
biophysics and eye health, but he's a repeat entrepreneur. He's particularly fond of companies
called Visible: he founded Visible Assets after his successful tenure as CEO of
Visible Genetics. Visible Genetics was an early innovator in DNA sequencing, and
still provides a specialty laboratory service that sequences samples of HIV in
order to detect vulnerabilities to antiretroviral medications.</p>
<p>Clinical trials in the early 2000s exposed Visible Genetics to one of the more
frustrating parts of health care logistics: refrigeration. Samples being shipped
to the lab and reagents shipped out to clinics were both temperature sensitive.
Providers had to verify that these materials had stayed adequately cold throughout
shipping and handling, otherwise laboratory results could be invalid or incorrect.
Stevens became interested in technical solutions to these problems; he wanted
some way to verify that samples were at acceptable temperatures both in storage
and in transit.</p>
<p>Moreover, Stevens imagined that these sensors would be in continuous communication.
There's a lot of overlap between this application and personal area networks (PANs),
protocols like Bluetooth that provide low-power communications over short ranges.
There is also clear overlap with RFID; you can buy RFID temperature sensors.
VAI, though, coined the term <em>visibility network</em> to describe RuBee. That's
visibility as in asset visibility: somewhat different from Bluetooth or RFID,
RuBee as a protocol is explicitly designed for situations where you need to
"keep tabs" on a number of different objects. Despite the overlap with other
types of wireless communications, the set of requirements on a visibility network
have lead RuBee down a very different technical path.</p>
<p>Visibility networks have to be highly reliable. When you are trying to keep
track of an asset, a failure to communicate with it represents a fundamental
failure of the system. For visibility networks, the ability to actually convey
a payload is secondary: the main function is just reliably detecting that
endpoints exist. Visibility networks have this in common with RFID, and indeed,
despite its similarities to technologies like BLE RuBee is positioned mostly as
a competitor to technologies like UHF RFID.</p>
<p>There are several differences between RuBee and RFID; for example, RuBee uses
active (battery-powered) tags and the tags are generally powered by a complete
4-bit microcontroller. That doesn't necessarily sound like an advantage, though.
While RuBee tags advertise a battery life of "5-25 years", the need for a battery seems
mostly like a liability. The real feature is what active tags enable: RuBee
operates in the low frequency (LF) band, typically at 131 kHz.</p>
<p>At that low frequency, the wavelength is very long, about 2.5 km. With such a
long wavelength, RuBee communications all happen at much less than one wavelength
in range. RF engineers refer to this as near-field operation, and it has some
properties that are intriguingly different from more typical far-field RF
communications. In the near-field, the magnetic field created by the antenna is
more significant than the electrical field. RuBee devices are intentionally
designed to emit very little electrical RF signal. Communications within a RuBee network are
achieved through magnetic, not electrical fields. That's the core of RuBee's magic.</p>
<p>The idea of magnetic coupling is not unique to RuBee. Speaking of the near-field,
there's an obvious comparison to NFC which works much the same way. The main difference,
besides the very different logical protocols, is that NFC operates at 13.56 MHz.
At this higher frequency, the wavelength is only around 20 meters. The requirement
that near-field devices be much closer than a full wavelength leads naturally to
NFC's very short range, typically specified as 4 cm.</p>
<p>At LF frequencies, RuBee can achieve magnetic coupling at ranges up to about 30
meters. That's a range comparable to, and often much better than, RFID inventory
tracking technologies. Improved range isn't RuBee's only benefit over RFID. The
properties of magnetic fields also make it a more robust protocol. RuBee promises
significantly less vulnerability to shielding by metal or water than RFID.</p>
<p>There are two key scenarios where this comes up: the first is equipment stored in
metal containers or on metal shelves, or equipment that is itself metallic. In
that scenario, it's difficult to find a location for an RFID tag that won't suffer
from shielding by the container. The case of water might seem less important, but
keep in mind that people are made mostly of water. RFID reading is often unreliable
for objects carried on a person, which are likely to be shielded from the reader
by the water content of the body.</p>
<p>These problems are not just theoretical. WalMart is a major adopter of RFID inventory
technology, and in early rollouts struggled with low successful read rates. Metal,
moisture (including damp cardboard boxes), antenna orientation, and multipath/interference
effects could cause read failure rates as high as 33% when scanning a pallet of goods.
Low read rates are mostly addressed by using RFID "portals" with multiple antennas.
Eight antennas used as an array greatly increase read rate, but at a cost of over
ten thousand dollars per portal system. Even so, WalMart seems to now target a
success rate of only 95% during bulk scanning.</p>
<p>95% might sound pretty good, but there are a lot of visibility applications where
a failure rate of even a couple percent is unacceptable. These mostly go by the
euphemism "high value goods," which depending on your career trajectory you may
have encountered in corporate expense and property policies. High-value goods
tend to be items that are both attractive to theft and where theft has particularly
severe consequences. Classically, firearms and explosives. Throw in classified
material for good measure.</p>
<p>I wonder if Stevens was surprised by RuBee's market trajectory. He came out of
the healthcare industry and, it seems, originally developed RuBee for cold
chain visibility... but, at least in retrospect, it's quite obvious that its
most compelling application is in the armory.</p>
<p>Because RuBee tags are small and largely immune to shielding by metals, you
can embed them directly in the frames of firearms, or as an aftermarket
modification you can mill out some space under the grip. RuBee tags in
weapons will read reliably when they are stored in metal cases or on
metal shelving, as is often the case. They will even read reliably when a
weapon is carried holstered, close to a person's body.</p>
<p>Since RuBee tags incorporate an active microcontroller, there are even more
possibilities. Temperature logging is one thing, but firearm-embedded RuBee
tags can incorporate an accelerometer (NIST-traceable, VAI likes to emphasize)
and actually count the rounds fired.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sidebar time: there is a long history of political hazard around "smart guns."
The term "smart gun" is mostly used more specifically for firearms that
identify their user, for example by fingerprint authentication or detection of
an RFID fob. The idea has become vague enough, though, that mention of a
firearm with any type of RFID technology embedded would probably raise the
specter of the smart gun to gun-rights advocates.</p>
<p>Further, devices embedded in firearms that count the number of
rounds fired have been proposed for decades, if not a century, as a means of
accountability. The holder of a weapon could, in theory, be required to
positively account for every round fired. That could eliminate incidents of
unreported use of force by police, for example. In practice I think this is
less compelling than it sounds, simple counting of rounds leaves too many
opportunities to fudge the numbers and conceal real-world use of a weapon as
range training, for example.</p>
<p>That said, the NRA has long been vehemently opposed to the incorporation of any sort of
technology into weapons that could potentially be used as a means of state
control or regulation. The concern isn't completely unfounded; the state of
New Jersey did, for a time, have legislation that would have made user-identifying
"smart guns" mandatory if they were commercially available. The result of
the NRA's strident lobbying is that no such gun has ever become commercially
available; "smart guns" have been such a political third rail that any firearms
manufacturer that dared to introduce one would probably face a boycott by most
gun stores. For better or worse, a result of the NRA's powerful political
advocacy in this area is that the concept of embedding security or accountability
technology into weapons has never been seriously pursued in the US. Even a
tentative step in that direction can produce a huge volume of critical press
for everyone involved.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I think it explains some of why VAI seems a bit vague
and cagey about the round-counting capabilities of their tags. They position it
as purely a maintenance feature, allowing the armorer to keep accurate tabs on
the preventative maintenance schedule for each individual weapon (in armory
environments, firearm users are often expected to report how many rounds
they fired for maintenance tracking reasons). The resistance of RuBee tags
to concealment is only positioned as a deterrent to theft, although the idea
of RuBee-tagged firearms creates obvious potential for security screening.
Probably the most profitable option for VAI would be to promote RuBee-tagged
firearms as tool for enforcement of gun control laws, but this is
a political impossibility and bringing it up at all could cause significant
reputational harm, especially with the government as a key customer. The result
is marketing copy that is a bit odd, giving a set of capabilities that imply
an application that is never mentioned.</p>
<hr>
<p>VAI found an incredible niche with their arms-tracking application. Institutional
users of firearms, like the military, police, and security forces, are relatively
price-insensitive and may have strict accounting requirements. By the mid-'00s,
VAI was into the long sales cycle of proposing the technology to the military.
That wasn't entirely unsuccessful. RuBee shot-counting weapon inventory tags were
selected by the Naval Surface Warfare Center in 2010 for installation on SCAR
and M4 rifles. That contract had a five-year term, it's unclear to me if it was
renewed. Military contracting opened quite a few doors to VAI, though, and
created a commercial opportunity that they eagerly pursued.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, weapons applications required an impressive round of
safety and compatibility testing. RuBee tags have the fairly unique distinction
of military approval for direct attachment to ordnance, something called "zero
separation distance" as the tags do not require a minimum separation from
high explosives. Central to that certification are findings of intrinsic safety
of the tags (that they do not contain enough energy to trigger explosives) and
that the magnetic fields involved cannot convey enough energy to heat anything
to dangerous temperatures.</p>
<p>That's not the only special certification that RuBee would acquire. The military
has a lot of firearms, but military procurement is infamously slow and mercurial.
Improved weapon accountability is, almost notoriously, not a priority for the
US military which has often had stolen weapons go undetected until their later
use in crime. The Navy's interest in RuBee does not seem to have translated to
more widespread military applications.</p>
<p>Then you have police departments, probably the largest institutional owners of
firearms and a very lucrative market for technology vendors. But here we run
into the political hazard: the firearms lobby is very influential on police
departments, as are police unions which generally oppose technical accountability
measures. Besides, most police departments are fairly cash-poor and are not
likely to make a major investment in a firearms inventory system.</p>
<p>That leaves us with institutional security forces. And there is one category
of security force that are particularly well-funded, well-equipped, and
beholden to highly R&amp;D-driven, almost pedantic standards of performance:
the protection forces of atomic energy facilities.</p>
<p>Protection forces at privately-operated atomic energy facilities, such as
civilian nuclear power plants, are subject to licensing and scrutiny by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Things step up further at the many facilities
operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Protection
forces for NNSA facilities are trained at the Department of Energy's National
Training Center, at the former Manzano Base here in Albuquerque. Concern over
adequate physical protection of NNSA facilities has lead Sandia National
Laboratories to become one of the premier centers for R&amp;D in physical security.
Teams of scientists and engineers have applied sometimes comical scientific rigor to "guns,
gates, and guards," the traditional articulation of physical security in the
nuclear world.</p>
<p>That scope includes the evaluation of new technology for the management of
protection forces, which is why Oak Ridge National Laboratory launched an
evaluation program for the RuBee tagging of firearms in their armory. The
white paper on this evaluation is curiously undated, but citations "retrieved 2008"
lead me to assume that the evaluation happened right around the middle of the
'00s. At the time, VAI seems to have been involved in some ultimately unsuccessful
partnership with Oracle, leading to the branding of the RuBee system as Oracle
Dot-Tag Server. The term "Dot-Tag" never occurs outside of very limited materials
around the Oracle partnership, so I'm not sure if it was Oracle branding for
RuBee or just some passing lark. In any case, Oracle's involvement seems to have
mainly just been the use of the Oracle database for tracking inventory data---which
was naturally replaced by PostgreSQL at Oak Ridge.</p>
<p>The Oak Ridge trial apparently went well enough, and around the same time, the Pantex
Plant in Texas launched an evaluation of RuBee for tracking classified tools.
Classified tools are a tricky category, as they're often metallic and often stored
in metallic cases. During the trial period, Pantex tagged a set of sample classified
tools with RuBee tags and then transported them around the property, testing the
ability of the RuBee controllers to reliably detect them entering and exiting areas of
buildings. Simultaneously, Pantex evaluated the use of RuBee tags to track containers
of "chemical products" through the manufacturing lifecycle. Both seem to have
produced positive results.</p>
<p>There are quite a few interesting and strange aspects of the RuBee system, a
result of its purpose-built Visibility Network nature. A RuBee controller can have
multiple antennas that it cycles through. RuBee tags remain in a deep-sleep mode
for power savings until they detect a RuBee carrier during their periodic wake
cycle. When a carrier is detected, they fully wake and listen for traffic. A
RuBee controller can send an interrogate message and any number of tags can respond,
with an interesting and novel collision detection algorithm used to ensure
reliable reading of a large number of tags.</p>
<p>The actual RuBee protocol is quite simple, and can also be referred to as IEEE 1902.1
since the decision of VAI to put it through the standards process. Packets are
small and contain basic addressing info, but they can also contain arbitrary payload in both directions,
perfect for data loggers or sensors. RuBee tags are identified by something that VAI
oddly refers to as an "IP address," causing some confusion over whether or not VAI
uses IP over 1902.1. They don't, I am confident saying after reading a whole lot of
documents. RuBee tags, as standard, have three different 4-byte addresses. VAI refers
to these as "IP, subnet, and MAC," <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> but these names are more like analogies.
Really, the "IP address" and "subnet" are both configurable arbitrary addresses,
with the former intended for unicast traffic and the latter for broadcast. For example,
you would likely give each asset a unique IP address, and use subnet addresses for
categories or item types. The subnet address allows a controller to interrogate for
every item within that category at once. The MAC address is a fixed, non-configurable
address derived from the tag's serial number. They're all written in the formats
we associate with IP networks, dotted-quad notation, as a matter of convenience.</p>
<p>And that's about it as far as the protocol specification, besides of course the
physical details which are a 131,072 Hz carrier, 1024 Hz data clock, either ASK
or BPSK modulation. The specification also describes an interesting mode called
"clip," in which a set of multiple controllers interrogate in exact synchronization
and all tags then reply in exact synchronization. Somewhat counter-intuitively,
because of the ability of RuBee controllers to separate out multiple simultaneous
tag transmissions using an anti-collision algorithm based on random phase shifts
by each tag, this is ideal. It allows a room, say an armory, full of RuBee
controllers to rapidly interrogate the entire contents of the room. I think this
feature may have been added after the Oak Ridge trials...</p>
<p>RuBee is quite slow, typically 1,200 baud, so inventorying a large number of assets
can take a while (Oak Ridge found that their system could only collect data on 2-7
tags per second per controller). But it's so robust that it an achieve a 100% read
rate in some very challenging scenarios. Evaluation by the DoE and the military
produced impressive results. You can read, for example, of a military experiment in
which a RuBee antenna embedded in a roadway reliably identified rifles secured in
steel containers in passing Humvees.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, then, one of the benefits of RuBee in the military/defense context
is that it is also <em>difficult</em> to receive. Here is RuBee's most interesting trick:
somewhat oversimplified, the strength of an electrical radio signal goes as 1/r,
while the strength of a magnetic field goes as 1/r^3. RuBee equipment is optimized,
by antenna design, to produce a minimal electrical field. The result is that RuBee
tags can very reliably be contacted at short range (say, around ten feet), but are
virtually impossible to contact or even detect at ranges over a few hundred feet.
To the security-conscious buyer, this is a huge feature. RuBee tags are highly
resistant to communications or electronic intelligence collection.</p>
<p>Consider the logical implications of tagging the military's rifles. With
conventional RFID, range is limited by the size and sensitivity of the antenna.
Particularly when tags are incidentally powered by a nearby reader, an adversary
with good equipment can detect RFID tags at very long range. VAI heavily references
a 2010 DEFCON presentation, for example, that demonstrated detection of RFID tags
at a range of 80 miles. One imagines that opportunistic detection by satellite is feasible for
a state intelligence agency. That means that your rifle asset tracking is also
revealing the movements of soldiers in the field, or at least providing a way to
detect their approach.</p>
<p>Most RuBee tags have their transmit power reduced by configuration, so even the
maximum 100' range of the protocol is not achievable. VAI suggests that typical
RuBee tags cannot be detected by radio direction finding equipment at ranges
beyond 20', and that this range can be made shorter by further reducing transmit
power.</p>
<p>Once again, we have caught the attention of the Department of Energy. Because of
the short range of RuBee tags, they have generally been approved as not representing
a COMSEC or TEMPEST hazard to secure facilities. And that brings us back to the
very beginning: why does the DoE use a specialized, technically interesting, and
largely unique radio protocol to fulfill such a basic function as nagging people
that have their phones? Because RuBee's security properties have allowed it to be
approved for use adjacent to and inside of secure facilities. A RuBee tag, it is
thought, cannot be turned into a listening device because the intrinsic range
limitation of magnetic coupling will make it impossible to communicate with the
tag from outside of the building. It's a lot like how infrared microphones still
see some use in secure facilities, but so much more interesting!</p>
<p>VAI has built several different product lines around RuBee, with names like
Armory 20/20 and Shot Counting Allegro 20/20 and Store 20/20. The founder started
his career in eye health, remember. None of them are that interesting, though.
They're all pretty basic CRUD applications built around polling multiple RuBee
controllers for tags in their presence.</p>
<p>And then there's the "Alert 20/20 DoorGuard:" a metal pedestal with a RuBee
controller and audio announcement module, perfect for detecting government
cell phones.</p>
<p>One of the strangest things about RuBee is that it's hard to tell if it's still
a going concern. VAI's website has a press release section, where nothing has been
posted since 2019. The whole website feels like it was last revised even longer
ago. When RuBee was newer, back in the '00s, a lot of industry journals covered it
with headlines like "the new RFID." I think VAI was optimistic that RuBee could
displace all kinds of asset tracking applications, but despite some special
certifications in other fields (e.g. approval to use RuBee controllers and tags
around pacemakers in surgical suites), I don't think RuBee has found much success
outside of military applications.</p>
<p>RuBee's resistance to shielding is impressive, but RFID read rates have improved
considerably with new DSP techniques, antenna array designs, and the generally
reduced cost of modern RFID equipment. RuBee's unique advantages, its security
properties and resistance to even intentional exfiltration, are interesting but
not worth much money to buyers other than the military.</p>
<p>So that's the fate of RuBee and VAI: defense contracting. As far as I can tell,
RuBee and VAI are about as vital as they have ever been, but RuBee is now installed
as just one part of general defense contracts around weapons systems, armory
management, and process safety and security. IEEE standardization has opened the
door to use of RuBee by federal contractors under license, and indeed, Lockheed
Martin is repeatedly named as a licensee, as are firearms manufacturers with military
contracts like Sig Sauer.</p>
<p>Besides, RuBee continues to grow closer to the DoE. In 2021, VAI appointed Lisa
Gordon-Hagerty to it board of directors. Gordon-Hagerty was undersecretary of
Energy and had lead the NNSA until the year before. This year, the New Hampshire
Small Business Development Center wrote a glowing profile of VAI. They described
it as a 25-employee company with a goal of hitting $30 million in annual revenue in the
next two years.</p>
<p>Despite the outdated website, VAI claims over 1,200 RuBee sites in service. I wonder
how many of those are Alert 20/20 DoorGuards? Still, I do believe there are military
weapons inventory systems currently in use. RuBee probably has a bright future, as a
niche technology for a niche industry. If nothing else, they have legacy installations
and intellectual property to lean on. A spreadsheet of VAI-owned patents on RuBee,
with nearly 200 rows, encourages would-be magnetically coupled visibility network inventors
not to go it on their own. I just wish I could get my hands on a controller....</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="file-cloudflare-md" tabindex="0" role="region" aria-label="Cloudflare.md content, created by jbreckmckye on 10:58PM on November 18.">
    <article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">Cloudflare, the CDN provider, suffered a massive outage today. Some of the world's most popular apps and web services were left inaccessible for serveral hours whilst the Cloudflare team scrambled to fix a whole swathe of the internet.</p>
<p dir="auto">And that might be a good thing.</p>

<p dir="auto">The proximate cause of the outage was pretty mundane: <a href="https://x.com/dok2001/status/1990791419653484646" rel="nofollow">a bad config file triggered a latent bug in one of Cloudflare's services</a>. The file was too large (details still hazy) and this led to a cascading failure across Cloudflare operations. Probably there is some useful post-morteming about canary releases and staged rollouts.</p>
<p dir="auto">But the bigger problem, the ultimate cause, behind today's chaos is the creeping centralisation of the internet and a society that is sleepwalking into assuming the net is <strong>always on</strong> and <strong>always working</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's not just "trivial" stuff like Twitter and <em>League of Legends</em> that were affected, either. A friend of mine remarked caustically about his experience this morning</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I couldn't get air for my tyres at two garages because of cloudflare going down.
Bloody love the lack of resilience that goes into the design when the machine says "cash only" and there's no cash slot.
So flat tires for everyone! Brilliant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We are living in a society where every part of our lives is increasingly mediated through the internet: work, banking, retail, education, entertainment, dating, family, government ID and credit checks. And the internet is increasingly tied up in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/a-single-point-of-failure-triggered-the-amazon-outage-affecting-millions/" rel="nofollow">fewer and fewer points of failure</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's ironic because the internet was actually designed for decentralisation, a system that governments could use to coordinate their response in the event of nuclear war. But due to the economics of the internet, the challenges of things like bots and scrapers, more of more web services are holed up in citadels like AWS or behind content distribution networks like Cloudflare.</p>
<p dir="auto">Outages like today's are a good thing because they're a <em>warning</em>. They can force redundancy and resilience into systems. They can make the pillars of our society - governments, businesses, banks - provide reliable alternatives when things go wrong.</p>
<p dir="auto">(Ideally ones that are completely offline)</p>
<p dir="auto">You can draw a parallel to how COVID-19 shook up global supply chains: the logic up until 2020 was that you wanted your system to be as lean and efficient as possible, even if it meant relying totally on international supplies or keeping as little spare inventory as possible. After 2020 businesses realised they needed to diversify and build slack in the system to tolerate shocks.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the same way that growing one kind of banana, <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/extinct-banana-5201723" rel="nofollow">nearly resulted in bananas going extinct</a>, we're drifing towards a society that can't survive without digital infrastructure; and a digital infrastructure that can't operate without two or three key players. One day there's going to be an outage, a bug, or cyberattack from a hostile state, that demonstrates how fragile that system is.</p>
<p dir="auto">Embrace outages, and build redundancy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Block AIs from reading your text with invisible Unicode characters while preserving meaning for humans.</p><div>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> This tool inserts invisible zero-width Unicode characters between each character of your input text. The text will look the same but will be much longer and can help stop AI plagarism. It also helps to waste tokens, causing users to run into ratelimits faster.
        </p><p>
        <strong>How to use:</strong>  This tool works best when gibberifying the most important parts of an essay prompt, up to about 500 characters. This makes it harder for the AI to detect while still functioning well in Google Docs. Some AI models will crash or fail to process the gibberified text, while others will respond with confusion or simply ignore everything inside the gibberified text.
        </p><p>
        <strong>Use cases:</strong> Anti-plagiarism, text obfuscation for LLM scrapers, or just for fun!
        </p><p>
        Even just one word's worth of gibberified text is enough to block something like Flint AI from grading a session.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s Friday at 4pm. I’ve just closed my 12th bug of the week. My brain is completely fried. And I’m staring at the bug leaderboard, genuinely sad that Monday means going back to regular work. Which is weird because I <strong>love</strong> regular work. But fixit weeks have a special place in my heart.</p><h2 id="whats-a-fixit-you-ask">What’s a fixit, you ask?</h2><p>Once a quarter, my org with ~45 software engineers stops all regular work for a week. That means no roadmap work, no design work, no meetings or standups.</p><p>Instead, we fix the small things that have been annoying us and our users:</p><ul><li>an error message that’s been unclear for two years</li><li>a weird glitch when the user scrolls and zooms at the same time</li><li>a test which runs slower than it should, slowing down CI for everyone</li></ul><p>The rules are simple: 1) no bug should take over 2 days and 2) all work should focus on either small end-user bugs/features or developer productivity.</p><p>We also have a “points system” for bugs and a leaderboard showing how many points people have. And there’s a promise of t-shirts for various achievements: first bug fix, most points, most annoying bug, etc. It’s a simple structure, but it works surprisingly well.</p><h2 id="what-we-achieved">What we achieved</h2><p>Some stats from this fixit:</p><ul><li>189 bugs fixed</li><li>40 people participated</li><li>4 was the median number of bugs closed per person</li><li>12 was maximum number of bugs closed by one person</li></ul><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/5g47sxjucyfgvvp.png" alt="fixit burndown chart"></p><p><em>Bug Burndown Chart for the Q4'25 Fixit</em></p></center><p>Here are some of the highlights (sadly many people in my org work in internal-facing things so I cannot share their work!):</p><ul><li>I closed a <a href="https://github.com/google/perfetto/issues/154">feature request</a> from 2021! It’s a classic fixit issue: a small improvement that never bubbled to the priority list. It took me <strong>one day</strong> to implement. One day for something that sat there for <strong>four years</strong>. And it’s going to provide a small but significant boost to every user’s experience of Perfetto.</li><li>My colleague made this <a href="https://github.com/google/perfetto/pull/3736">small change</a> to improve team productivity. Just ~25 lines of code in a GitHub Action to avoid every UI developer taking two extra clicks to open the CI’s build. The response from the team speaks for itself:</li></ul><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/4bd7ammdnpkiwbq.png" alt=""></p><p><i>Such a simple change but the team loved it!</i></p></center><ul><li>I also fixed <a href="https://github.com/google/perfetto/issues/713">this</a> issue to provide a new “amalgamated” version of our SDK, allowing it to be easily integrated into projects. It’s one of those things that might be the difference between someone deciding to use us or not, but building it took just one hour of work (with liberal use of AI!).</li></ul><h2 id="the-benefits-of-fixits">The benefits of fixits</h2><h3 id="for-the-product-craftsmanship-and-care">For the product: craftsmanship and care</h3><p>I care deeply about any product I work on. That means asking big questions like “what should we build?” and “how do we make this fast?” But it also means asking smaller questions: “is this error message actually helpful?” or “would I be frustrated using this?”</p><p>A hallmark of any good product is attention to detail: a sense that someone has thought things through, and the pieces fit together to make a cohesive whole. And the opposite is true: a product with rough edges might be tolerated if there are no alternatives, but there will always be a sense of frustration and “I wish I could use something else”.</p><p>Fixits are a great chance to work on exactly those details that separate good products from great ones. The small things your average user might not consciously notice, but absolutely will notice if they’re wrong.</p><h3 id="for-the-individual-doing-not-thinking">For the individual: doing, not thinking</h3><p>I sometimes miss the feeling I had earlier in my career when I got to just fix things. See something broken, fix it, ship it the same day.</p><p>The more senior you get in a big company, the less you do that. Most of your time becomes thinking about what to build next, planning quarters ahead, navigating tradeoffs and getting alignment.</p><p>Fixits give me that early-career feeling back. You see the bug, you fix it, you ship it, you close it, you move on. There’s something deeply satisfying about work where the question isn’t “what should we do?” but rather “can I make this better?” And you get to answer that question multiple times in a week.</p><h3 id="for-the-team-morale-and-spirit">For the team: morale and spirit</h3><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/3vlng29gerbxakc.png" alt=""></p><p>People sharing live updates in the Fixit chatroom</p></center><p>Having 40 people across two time zones all fixing bugs together adds a whole other dimension.</p><p>The vibe of the office is different: normally we’re all heads-down on different projects, but during fixit the team spirit comes out strong. People share their bug fixes in chat rooms, post before-and-after screenshots and gather around monitors to demo a new feature or complain about a particularly nasty bug they’re wrestling.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/9wcbsgotrjqvfdz.png" alt=""></p><p><em>The daily update from Friday</em></p></center><p>The leaderboard amplifies this energy. There’s a friendly sense of competition as people try and balance quick wins with meatier bugs they can share stories about.</p><p>There’s also a short update every morning about how the previous day went:</p><ul><li>total bugs fixed</li><li>how many people have fixed at least one bug</li><li>how many different products we’ve fixed things in</li><li>who’s currently at the top of the leaderboard</li></ul><p>All of this creates real momentum, and people feel magnetically pulled into the effort.</p><h2 id="how-to-run-a-fixit">How to run a fixit</h2><p>I’ve participated in 6 fixits over the years and I’ve learned a lot about what makes them successful. Here are a few things that matter more than you’d think.</p><h3 id="preparation-is-key">Preparation is key</h3><p>Most of what makes a fixit work happens before the week even starts.</p><p>All year round, we encourage everyone to tag bugs as “good fixit candidates” as they encounter them. Then the week before fixit, each subteam goes through these bugs and sizes them:</p><ul><li>small (less than half a day)</li><li>medium (less than a day)</li><li>large (less than 2 days).</li></ul><p>They assign points accordingly: 1, 2, or 4.</p><p>We also create a shortlist of high-priority bugs we really want fixed. People start there and move to the full list once those are done. This pre-work is critical: it prevents wasting day one with people aimlessly searching for bugs to fix.</p><h3 id="the-2-day-hard-limit">The 2-day hard limit</h3><p>In one of our early fixits, someone picked up what looked like a straightforward bug. It should have been a few hours, maybe half a day. But it turned into a rabbit hole. Dependencies on other systems, unexpected edge cases, code that hadn’t been touched in years.</p><p>They spent the entire fixit week on it. And then the entire week after fixit trying to finish it. What started as a bug fix turned into a mini project.
The work was valuable! But they missed the whole point of a fixit. No closing bugs throughout the week. No momentum. No dopamine hits from shipping fixes. Just one long slog.</p><p>That’s why we have the 2-day hard limit now. If something is ballooning, cut your losses. File a proper bug, move it to the backlog, pick something else. The limit isn’t about the work being worthless - it’s about keeping fixit feeling like fixit.</p><h3 id="number-of-people-matters">Number of people matters</h3><p>We didn’t always do fixits with 40 people. Early on, this wasn’t an org-wide effort, just my subteam of 7 people. It worked okay: bugs got fixed and there was a sense of pride in making the product better. But it felt a bit hollow: in the bigger picture of our org, it didn’t feel like anyone else noticed or cared.</p><p>At ~40 people, it feels like a critical mass that changes things significantly. The magic number is probably somewhere between 7 and 40. And it probably varies based on the team. But whatever the number is, the collective energy matters. If you’re trying this with 5 people, it might still be worth doing, but it probably won’t feel the same.</p><h3 id="gamification">Gamification</h3><p>The points and leaderboard are more than a gimmick, but they have to be handled carefully.</p><p>What works for us:</p><ul><li><strong>Points are coarse, not precise</strong>: We deliberately use 1/2/4 points instead of trying to measure exact effort; the goal is “roughly right and fun”, not accurate performance evaluation.</li><li><strong>Celebrate breadth, not just volume.</strong> We give t-shirts for things like “first bug fix”, “most annoying bug fixed”, not just “most points”. That keeps newer or less experienced engineers engaged.</li><li><strong>Visibility over prizes.</strong> A shout-out in the daily update or an internal post often matters more than the actual t-shirt.</li><li><strong>No attachment to perf reviews</strong>. This is important: fixit scores do <strong>not</strong> feed into performance reviews. The moment they do, people will start gaming it and the good vibe will die.</li></ul><p>We’ve had very little “gaming” in practice. Social norms do a good job of keeping people honest and 40 is still small enough that there’s a sense of “loyalty to the cause” from folks.</p><h2 id="the-ai-factor">The AI factor</h2><p>The big challenge with fixits is context switching. Constantly changing what you’re working on means constantly figuring out new parts of the codebase, thinking about new problems.</p><p>AI tools have mitigated this in a big way. The code they write is less important than their ability to quickly search through relevant files and summarize what needs to change. They might be right or wrong, but having that starting point really reduces the cognitive load. And sometimes (rarely) they one-shot a fix.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/google/perfetto/pull/3774">docs change</a> was a perfect example of the above: an update to our docs which catches out new contributors and AI was able to one-shot the fix.</p><p>On the other hand, in my <a href="https://github.com/google/perfetto/pull/3780">record page change</a> it was more useful for giving me prototypes of what the code should look like and I had to put in significant effort to correct the bad UX it generated and its tendency to “over-generate” code. Even so, it got me to the starting line much faster.</p><h2 id="criticisms-of-fixits-and-why-i-still-like-them-anyway">Criticisms of fixits (and why I still like them anyway)</h2><p>I’ve definitely come across people who question whether fixits are actually a good idea. Some of the criticisms are fair but overall I still think it’s worth it.</p><h3 id="isnt-this-just-admitting-you-ignore-bugs-the-rest-of-the-time">“Isn’t this just admitting you ignore bugs the rest of the time?”</h3><p>To some extent, yes, this is an admission of the fact that “papercut” bugs are underweighted in importance, both by managers and engineers. It’s all too easy to tunnel on making sure a big project is successful and easier to ignore the small annoyances for users and the team.</p><p>Fixits are a way of counterbalancing that somewhat and saying “actually those bugs matter too”. That’s not to say we don’t fix important bugs during regular work; we absolutely do. But fixits recognize that there should be a place for handling the “this is slightly annoying but never quite urgent enough” class of problems.</p><p>The whole reason we started fixits in the first place is that we observed these bugs never get actioned. Given this, I think carving out some explicit time for it is a good thing.</p><h3 id="isnt-it-a-waste-to-pause-roadmap-work-for-a-whole-week">“Isn’t it a waste to pause roadmap work for a whole week?”</h3><p>It’s definitely a tradeoff. 40 engineer-weeks is a <em>lot</em> of manpower and there’s an argument to be made it should be used for actually solving roadmap problems.</p><p>But I think this underweights the importance of polish of products to users. We’ve consistently found that the product feels noticeably better afterward (including positive comments from users about things they notice!) and there’s a sense of <em>pride</em> in having a well-functioning product.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/qgw9gty38bftohb.png" alt=""></p><p><em>A user’s response to my PR to improve <a href="https://github.com/google/perfetto/pull/3780">the Perfetto UI “record” page</a></em></p></center><p>Also, many of the team productivity fixes compound (faster tests, clearer errors, smoother workflows) so the benefits carry forward well beyond the week itself.</p><h3 id="this-only-works-at-big-companies">This only works at big companies!</h3><p>I agree that a full week might be too much for tiny teams or startups. But you can still borrow the idea in smaller chunks: a “fixit Friday” once a month, or a 2-day mini-fixit each quarter. The core idea is the same: protected, collective time to fix the stuff people complain about but no one schedules time to address.</p><h2 id="fixits-are-good-for-the-soul">Fixits are good for the soul</h2><p>The official justification for fixits is that they improve product quality and
developer productivity. And of course they do this.</p><p>But the unofficial reason I love them is simpler: it just feels good to fix things. It takes me back to a simpler time, and putting thought and attention into building great products is a big part of my ethos for how software engineering should be done. I wouldn’t want to work like that all the time. But I also wouldn’t want to work somewhere that never makes time for it.</p></section><p><em>If you enjoyed this post, you can <a href="https://lalitm.com/page/about/#subscribe">subscribe</a> to my weekly roundup of recent posts, or follow via <a href="https://lalitm.com/index.xml">RSS</a>.</em></p></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In our daily lives empathy and humility are obvious virtues we aspire to. They keep our egos in check. Less obvious is that they’re practical skills in the workplace, too. I think, for developers and technical leaders in particular, that the absence of ego is the best way to further our careers and do great work.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202105/what-is-the-ego" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">the simplest of terms</a> the ego is the characteristic of personhood that enables us to practice self-reflection, self-awareness, and accountability for the actions or decisions we take.</p><p>However, the ego also motivates us to reframe our perception of the world in whatever way keeps us centered in it. Each of us is perpetually driven to justify our place in the world. This <em>constant self-justification</em> is like an engine that idles for our entire lives, and it requires constant fine-tuning. When it runs amok this is what we call a “big” ego.</p><h2>Breaking News! Developers Have Egos!</h2><p>I’m not thinking only of the 10x engineer stereotype, although I’ve worked with such folks in the past. Ego is more nuanced than that. Besides the most arrogant developer in the room throwing their weight around, our egos manifest in hundreds of ways that are much harder to detect.</p><p>As developers we’re more susceptible to letting our egos run free. The nature of our work is so technical that to others it can seem obscure, arcane, or even magical. Sometimes we don’t do enough to actively dispel that notion—and just like that half the work of self-justification is already done for us.</p><p>Very often it’s not intentional. The simplest example is the overuse of jargon and acronyms. We all do it, but as <a href="https://clearleft.com/thinking/letters-of-exclusion" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">Jeremy Keith explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Still, I get why initialisms run rampant in technical discussions. You can be sure that most discussions of particle physics would be incomprehensible to outsiders, not necessarily because of the concepts, but because of the terminology.</p></blockquote><p>Simply mashing a few letters together can be empowering for ourselves while being exclusionary for others. It’s an artifact—albeit a small one—of our egos. We know what the technobabble means. Our justified place in the universe is maintained.</p><p>Sometimes we express our egos more deliberately. Developers have a clear tendency towards gatekeeping. For most, it’s an honest mistake. There’s a fine line between holding others to a certain expectation versus actively keeping people on the outside. When we see ourselves doing this we can correct it easily enough.</p><p>Sadly there are developers who seemingly like to gatekeep. They get to feel like wizards in their towers with their dusty books and potions. But, it’s actually self-limiting. Gatekeeping by definition means you’re fixed in place and never moving, standing guard for eternity.</p><p>My point is our egos can “leak” in so many ways that it takes diligence to catch it let alone correct it. The following is a short, incomplete list of typical statements we as developers might say or hear at work. If you parse them more precisely each one is an attempt at self-justification:</p><ul role="list"><li>“That’s the way we’ve always done it.”</li><li>“It’s not that complicated! You just…”</li><li>“Yeah, I should be able to finish this in a day.”</li><li>“This legacy codebase is an absolute disaster.”</li><li>“Assign it to me. Nobody else will be able to fix it.”</li><li>“You can’t be a senior dev. You don’t know anything about…”</li><li>“Ugh, our morning standup is so useless.”</li><li>“This feature is too important to assign to the junior dev.”</li><li>“We should start using this new tool in our pipeline.”</li><li>“We should never use that new tool in our pipeline.”</li></ul><h2>Everything Is Bigger Than You</h2><p>The ego is concerned with the self but very easily becomes something harmful in the absence of new information or context. Indeed, the ego nudges us to self-justify so much that one could argue it actively <em>resists</em> new information when left unchecked.</p><p>You may have read one of the example statements above with some familiarity and thought, “But what if I’m right?”</p><p>To which I’d say: OK, but should that be your default stance? Why might you feel the need to immediately start a conversation with a self-justification? There are ways to adjust our approach, make our points, and accept new information all at the same time.</p><p>In any interaction—be it a meeting, Slack thread, or water cooler conversation—we must remember that <strong>the matter at hand is bigger than us in ways we don’t yet understand</strong>.</p><p>This is a simple enough heuristic but we need the skills to gain that understanding. We need empathy and humility. Empathy is the ability to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/speaking-in-tongues/202012/what-is-empathy" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">recognize and comprehend what someone else is thinking or feeling</a>. Humility is a resistance to our <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brainsnacks/201501/the-paradoxical-power-of-humility" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">“competitive reflexes”</a> through the practice of emotional neutrality and vulnerability. Both serve to counteract the ego.</p><p>To make these concepts more actionable I find it simpler to define them in terms of the purposes they serve. Specifically…</p><ol role="list"><li>Empathy is how we <em>gather new information</em>.</li><li>Humility is how we <em>allow information to change our behavior</em>.</li></ol><p>This framing also helps remind us what empathy and humility <em>are not</em>. It’s not about putting yourself in another’s shoes, as the saying goes. It’s not about being submissive or a pushover. It’s not about altruism or self-sacrifice. We can easily practice empathy and humility without it ever being at our own expense.</p><h2>The Pursuit Of Information</h2><p>I don’t know about you but I go to work to solve problems, be creative, and build shit. I can’t think of a single instance where an unruly ego solved anything I’ve worked on. Ego just makes an existing challenge worse. Solutions require information I don’t have yet.</p><p>Empathy and humility are usually top of mind during situations of pain or distress, but they’re really aspects of emotional intelligence that should be activated at all times. Once you adjust your mindset to treat them as basic tools for the <em>pursuit of information</em> you’ll see opportunities to leverage them everywhere.</p><p>Developers can apply this mindset with almost anybody they come into contact with. Fellow developers, naturally. But also less technical teammates (e.g., QAs, designers, product owners, stakeholders) who have their own unique skills and context that our success depends on. And of course our users should be at the center of every problem we’re working to solve. Lastly, even executives and upper management have some insight to offer if you dare (<a href="https://matthogg.fyi/how-to-care-about-your-job-when-it-doesnt-care-about-you/">but only up to a certain point</a>).</p><h2>“Be Curious, Not Judgmental”</h2><p>I’ve been waiting years for a chance to work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">Ted Lasso</a> into one of my essays. Today’s the day, readers.</p><p>The titular character is such an archetype for leadership that my jaw hit the floor when I first watched the show. The example Ted sets has spawned <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ted+lasso+leadership" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">countless think pieces about leadership and management</a>. Suffice it to say he exhibits all of my principles over the series’ 34 episodes. He’s empathy and humility sporting a mustache. He’s the absence of ego personified.</p><p>I highly recommend watching the show but to get a taste this 5 minute clip is worth your time. This is the famous “darts scene”…</p><p><iframe type="text/html" title="Ted Lasso 2020 - Darts Scene" data-src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3S16b-x5mRA" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There’s a common and derisive attitude that qualities like empathy or humility are signs of weakness. You have to get all up in your feelings. Ew! But they require enormous reserves of strength, patience, and determination. It’s those who follow their egos who are weak.</p><p>Letting your ego take control is the easiest thing in the world. Just ask any toddler throwing a temper tantrum. Resisting those impulses and remaining calm, on the other hand, has been a virtue humanity has aspired to for thousands of years. As the Roman emperor and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">Stoic</a> philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">Marcus Aurelius</a> wrote: “The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.”</p><h2>You’re Neither Ted Lasso Nor A Roman Emperor</h2><p>The practice of empathy, humility, and keeping your ego in check will <strong>test you daily</strong>. The feedback I’ve received the most from my coworkers is that I’m extraordinarily calm and even-keeled in any situation—even situations where I’d be right to freak out.</p><p>Is that just naturally my personality? Maybe in part, but <em>remaining calm is a choice</em>. I’m actively choosing to favor solutions over my own ego. To my colleagues past and present I confess to you now that any time you’ve seen me calm, cool, and collected I was very likely <strong>internally screaming</strong>.</p><p>If this sounds like a lot of work you might be wondering if it’s worth it. I think it is. At the very least your coworkers and colleagues will like you better. That’s no small thing.</p><p>In all seriousness, the positive feedback I get most about the developers I manage is when they’ve demonstrated empathy and humility while dialing back their egos. This is because they’re people we can work with—literally. Nobody wants to work with a narcissist or a rock star. Nobody is materially impressed by <a href="https://matthogg.fyi/developers-your-job-is-not-to-write-code/">how many lines of code we wrote</a>, or how fast we wrote it.</p><p>When people want to work with us—or even look forward to it—that means we have trust and respect. We’ll be on proper footing for working effectively as a group to solve problems. For developers this looks like coaching a junior developer, hopping on a quick call to pair with somebody, or understanding the business value of the next backlog item. For leaders this looks like people who feel empowered to do their work, who can proactively identify issues, or who can rally and adapt when circumstances change.</p><p>Anybody can do this! I can’t think of any other career advice that’s as universal as empathy and humility. Everybody is capable of, at any point in their lives, small yet impactful improvements.</p><p>So remember—watch your ego and look for opportunities to leverage empathy and humility in the pursuit of information so that you can solve problems together.</p><p>In <a href="https://matthogg.fyi/my-working-principles-for-managing-ego-empathy-and-humility/">my next essay on this subject</a> I’ll get into the practical. What I like about this advice is that, while there’s much we can do, we don’t have to do it all to see some benefit. We can pick and choose and try something out. We can take your time and grow. Nobody’s perfect, not even Ted Lasso. Even if we take after a character like <a href="https://ted-lasso.fandom.com/wiki/Roy_Kent" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener external">Roy Kent</a> we can still call that a win. Just watch the show, OK?</p></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    

    <div>
      <p>I used to call myself a Rust hater, but really I was doing it just to compensate for the perceivable fanboyism e.g. Rust tops on stackoverflow surveys as most-loved language. There are many reasons to hate C++, and I hate C++ too. Lots of people were waiting for a better programming language, but got Rust instead.</p>
<p>There are several core problems with Rust:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its compilation is slow. I mean SLOW. Slower than C++. <span id="continue-reading"></span> I know over years Rust became several times faster, but objectively we need it to be two orders of magnitude faster, not just two times.</li>
<li>It’s complex. Just as complex as C++. But C++ had legacy and Rust had not. The complexity of forcing your way through the jungle of <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Box&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> on every single step directly impacts the quality of the logic being implemented i.e. you can’t see the forest for the trees. Once again, C++ has the same problem, so what’s the point of the language switch in the end?</li>
<li>Memory safety is not that sacred. In fact, for many applications malfunctioning is better than crashing — particulary in the embedded world where Rust wants to be present. You cannot get 99.999% reliability with Rust — it crashes all the time.</li>
<li>When handling lots of mutable shared state (GUI, DB, stateful services, OS/hardware), the performance of native Rust memory model is subpar, and non-native unsafes just leave you with slow compilation, high complexity, and no memory safety in the end — which makes Rust practically meaningless for heavy mutable state jobs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="c-actually-sucks">C++ actually sucks</h2>
<p>There is no doubt about it. Undefined behavior (UB) is a fundamental aspec of the language, you don’t simply encounter UB — the whole language is built on UB. You do array indexing and you immediately encounter UB because the language just does not check out of bound access. I want to emphasize that lots of UB-s are not even justified by performance matters — it’s an outright sloppy design of C carried over and amplified in C++. I can go all day long about how C++ sucks:</p>
<ul>
<li>implicit type conversions, implicit copies, implicit constructors, implicit object slicing, and pretty much everything implicit;</li>
<li>function overloading (implicit), particulary considering its omnipresence in STL;</li>
<li>non-uniform error handling with exceptions as afterthought;</li>
<li>still #include-ing text files 40 years after C and One Definition Rule barely checked by compilers;</li>

</ul>
<p>So C++ is complex, unsafe, and it’s compiler is slow. How does the Rust (not) fix those issues?</p>
<h2 id="1-slow-compilation">1. Slow compilation</h2>
<p>It’s not a temporary problem — it’s by design. Here one of the designers explains why the Rust development team sacrificed the compilation speed every time:<br>
<a href="https://pingcap.medium.com/the-rust-compilation-model-calamity-1a8ce781cf6c">https://pingcap.medium.com/the-rust-compilation-model-calamity-1a8ce781cf6c</a></p>
<p><a href="https://prev.rust-lang.org/en-US/faq.html#why-is-rustc-slow">Rust FAQ</a> explains that there are many efforts to optimize it, like better frontend, MIR, and so on. But MIR effort was started at 2015 and it still fails to significantly quicken the compilation (although it speeds up compiler checks).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s impossible to make Rust compile fast. The problem is inherent to all similar generics-heavy languages, like Haskell. Arguably, Rust is closer to Haskell than it is to C++. You can also say it’s close to a template-heavy C++ — and template-heavy C++ code exhibits the same problem of slow compilation.<br>
When you do <code>for i in 0..limit {}</code> — you don’t just iterate, you create a range, you create an iterator, you iterate over it — all of it monomorphized to your concrete types and have to be optimized individually (non-optimized Rust code is insanely slow, it’s mostly unusable even for debugging).<br>
Put a non-optional borrow-checker on top of it — and there you have your insanely slow compiler. And you WILL recompile a lot, because borrow checker is relentless.</p>
<h2 id="2-complexity">2. Complexity</h2>
<p>You just cannot avoid it. You cannot go along like “I’m writing a cold path high-level code, I don’t need performance, I don’t need to go deeper into lifetime handling, I just want to write a high level logic”. You will be forced into the low level nuances every time you write a single line of Rust. There is no garbage collector for Rust and will never be — you will have to semi-manually pack all your data into a tree of ownership. You have to be fluent in ownership, borrowing, traits to write just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>As I’ve already mentioned, this makes it very hard to write high-level logic in Rust. That’s why many of early Rust adopters actually revert to Node.js and Go for less performance-sensitive services — high complexity combined with slow compilation makes it impractical to write anything complex in sole Rust.</p>
<h2 id="3-memory-safety">3. Memory safety</h2>
<p>There are two uncompromising things in the Rust fundament: performance and memory safety. I have to argue that Rust designers went wa-a-ay overboard with memory safety. You know the containers are actually implemented with <code>unsafe</code> functions, because there is just no perfect correctness possible in the Turing machine model — you have to build safe programs from carefully arranged unsafe building blocks. Node.js and Go are considered practically safe language. Rust sacrificed sanity and practicality for memory safety — and gets none of them at the end of the day, it’s still not 100% memory safe.</p>
<p>Now speaking about practicality — lots of use cases just don’t need perfect memory safety. There are ways to implement unsafe programs that still don’t execute remote code or leak secret — they only corrupt user data and act sporadically. If a pacemaker stops — telling a victim “but the memory was not corrupted in the crash” is a weak consolation. We actually had a recent Cloudflare outage caused by a crash on <code>unwrap()</code> function:<br>
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/</a></p>
<p>It’s probably the strongest point of my whining: <strong>Rust is memory safe and unreliable. The price of memory safety was reliability</strong> in addition to the developer’s sanity ­— that’s why I’m telling the language designers went overboard. They sacrificied core practical quality for an abstract principle of memory safety. Just like Haskell designers sacrificed practicality for purity — that’s why I reiterate on parallels between Rust and Haskell.</p>

<p>It’s possible, but employing mutable shared state in Rust just makes no sense. You lose most of advantages and are left with all the deficiencies of Rust. Pretty much all of the successful Rust projects are employing shared read-only state, one way data flow, acyclic data structures: rustc compiler, mdbook and pulldown-cmark Markdown tools, Actix and Axum for stateless handlers, append-only blockchains, single-threaded WASM. The model is, once again, very similar to Haskell, which also excels in parsers, stateless handler, mostly-non-interactive CLI tools, and was employed in blockchains.</p>
<p>Early prototypes of Rust actually had Software Transactional Memory (STM) as an option for safe concurrency, however, STM has performance penalties and it requires simple but significant runtime support.</p>
<p>Step into the shared mutable state — and there a memory corruption is not an exception, it’s a rule. You have to handle the corruptions, you cannot simply crash. Borrow checker, ownership? Just useless, you cannot analyze ownership in a cyclic graph without GC-like algorithm.</p>
<p>Sync/Send, Mutex and reference counting (Arc)? Unfortuantely, those lock or simply mess with CPU caches badly, so they are inefficient for multithreaded communication, at least an intensive one. They are safe, but inefficient. Which kinda destroys the first uncompromising thing in Rust — performance. So, to reiterate, the second you step into the shared mutable state you lose every single advantage of Rust. Which is kinda rational considering that the main concept of Rust was to never employ a shared mutable state.</p>
<p>Particulary, GUI is a mutable shared state. Hence we don’t see any big GUI projects in Rust. <a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed IDE</a> is still beta for so many years — I can almost feel the pain of the developers hacking their way through the borrow checker jungle just to realize their logic is bug-ridden, and they are yet to implement dozens of other features.<br>
Big databases, scalable stateful services, operating systems, at least significant Linux modules? Yet to be seen.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>So, is the Rust bad or good? It’s neither. It’s a mediocre programming language with thousands of man-month put into its development — this fact alone makes Rust a viable tool, just because you can pick it from the shelf and employ as-is. This blog was generated with Zola, written in Rust — I did not have to write a single line of Rust code to use it. And the Rust is a good fit for Zola SSG because of its non-interactive nature with one-way flow of immutable data. Just, please, don’t run around screaming “we should all switch our development to Rust because it’s the best programming language”.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I get older, I increasingly think about
whether I’m spending my time the right way
to advance my career and my life.
This is also a question that your company
asks about you every performance cycle:
is this engineering manager spending their
time effectively to advance the company or their organization?</p><p>Confusingly, in my experience, answering these nominally similar questions
has surprisingly little in common.
This piece spends some time exploring both questions in the particularly
odd moment we live in today, where managers are being told they’ve
spent the last decade doing the wrong things, and need to engage
with a new model of engineering management in order to be
valued by the latest iteration of the industry.</p><div><p>If you’d be more interested in a video version of this,
here is the recording of a practice run I gave for a talk
centered on these same ideas
(<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17lTreuVdYMNOr7k2XLzrshEJnB-StaNUzAyh9tE0b5w/edit?slide=id.g39f551c2725_0_0#slide=id.g39f551c2725_0_0">slides from talk</a>).</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJlrX4Z4QWs?si=m9HgL7y0AvdOSUq6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><h2 id="good-leadership-is-a-fad">Good leadership is a fad</h2><p>When I started my software career at Yahoo in the late 2000s, I had two 1:1s with my manager over the course of two
years. The first one came a few months after I started, and he mostly asked me about a colleague’s work quality.
The second came when I gave notice that I was leaving to <a href="https://lethain.com/digg-v4/">join Digg</a>.
A modern evaluation of this manager would be scathing, but his management style closely resembled that of the
team leader in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soul-New-Machine-Tracy-Kidder/dp/0316491977"><em>The Soul of A New Machine</em></a>:
identifying an important opportunity for the team, and navigating the broader organization that might impede progress
towards that goal.
He was, in the context we were working in, an effective manager.</p><p>Compare that leadership style to the expectations of the 2010s, where attracting, retaining, and motivating engineers
was emphasized as the most important leadership criteria in many organizations.
This made sense in <a href="https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/">the era of hypergrowth</a>, where budgets were uncapped
and many companies viewed hiring strong engineers as their constraint on growth.
This was an era where managers were explicitly told to stop writing software as the first step of their transition into management,
and it was good advice! Looking back we can argue it was bad guidance by today’s standards, but it aligned the managers with the leadership expectations
of the moment.</p><p>Then think about our current era, that started in late 2022, where higher interest rates killed <a href="https://www.readmargins.com/p/zirp-explains-the-world">zero-interest-rate-policy (ZIRP)</a>
and productized large language models are positioned as killing deep Engineering organizations.
We’ve flattened Engineering organizations where many roles that previously focused on coordination
are now expected to be hands-on keyboard, working deep in the details.
Once again, the best managers of the prior era–who did exactly what the industry asked them to do–are now reframed as bureaucrats
rather than integral leaders.</p><p>In each of these transitions, the business environment shifted, leading to a new formulation of ideal leadership.
That makes a lot of sense: of course we want leaders to fit the necessary patterns of today.
Where things get weird is that in each case a morality tale was subsequently superimposed on top of the transition:</p><ul><li>In the 2010s, the morality tale was that it was all about empowering engineers as a fundamental good.
Sure, I can get excited for that, but I don’t really believe that narrative: it happened because hiring was competitive.</li><li>In the 2020s, the morality tale is that bureaucratic middle management have made organizations stale and inefficient.
The lack of experts has crippled organizational efficiency.
Once again, I can get behind that–there’s truth here–but the much larger drivers aren’t about morality,
it’s about ZIRP-ending and optimism about productivity gains from AI tooling.</li></ul><p>The conclusion here is clear: the industry will want different things from you as it evolves,
and it will tell you that each of those shifts is because of some complex moral change,
but it’s pretty much always about business realities changing.
If you take any current morality tale as true, then you’re setting yourself up
to be severely out of position when the industry shifts again in a few years,
because “good leadership” is just a fad.</p><h2 id="self-development-across-leadership-fads">Self-development across leadership fads</h2><p>If you accept the argument that the specifically desired leadership skills of today
are the result of fads that frequently shift, then it leads to an important followup question:
what are the right skills to develop in to be effective today and to be impactful across fads?</p><p>Having been and worked with engineering managers for some time, I think there are
<a href="https://lethain.com/categories-engineering-leadership/">eight foundational engineering management skills</a>,
which I want to personally group into two clusters: core skills that are essential to operate in all roles
(including entry-level management roles), and growth skills whose presence–or absence–determines
how far you can go in your career.</p><p>The core skills are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Execution</strong>: lead team to deliver expected tangible and intangible work.
Fundamentally, management is about getting things done, and you’ll neither
get an opportunity to begin managing, nor stay long as a manager, if your
teams don’t execute.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: ship projects, manage on-call rotation, sprint planning, manage incidents</p></li><li><p><strong>Team</strong>: shape the team and the environment such that they succeed.
This is <em>not</em> working for the team, nor is it working for your leadership, it is
finding the balance between the two that works for both.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: hiring, coaching, performance management, advocate with your management</p></li><li><p><strong>Ownership</strong>: navigate reality to make consistent progress, even when reality is difficult
Finding a way to get things done, rather than finding a way that it not getting done is someone else’s fault.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: doing hard things, showing up when it’s uncomfortable, being accountable despite systemic issues</p></li><li><p><strong>Alignment</strong>: build shared understanding across leadership, stakeholders, your team, and the problem space.
Finding a realistic plan that meets the moment, without surprising or being surprised by those around you.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: document and share top problems, and updates during crises</p></li></ol><p>The growth skills are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Taste</strong>: exercise discerning judgment about what “good” looks like—technically, in business terms, and in process/strategy.
Taste is a broadchurch, and my experience is that broad taste is an somewhat universal criteria for truly senior roles.
In some ways, taste is a prerequisite to Amazon’s <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">Are Right, A Lot</a>.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: refine proposed product concept,
avoid high-risk rewrite,
find usability issues in team’s work</p></li><li><p><strong>Clarity</strong>: your team, stakeholders, and leadership know what you’re doing and why, and agree that it makes sense.
In particular, they understand how you are overcoming your biggest problems. So clarity is not, “Struggling with scalability issues”
but instead “Sharding the user logins database in a new cluster to reduce load.”</p><p><em>Examples</em>: identify levers to progress,
create plan to exit a crisis,
show progress on implementing that plan</p></li><li><p><strong>Navigating ambiguity</strong>: work from complex problem to opinionated, viable approach.
If you’re given an extremely messy, open-ended problem, can you still find a way to make progress?
(I’ve <a href="https://lethain.com/navigating-ambiguity/">written previously about this topic</a>.)</p><p><em>Examples</em>: launching a new business line,
improving developer experience,
going from 1 to N cloud regions</p></li><li><p><strong>Working across timescales</strong>: ensure your areas of responsibility make progress across both the short and long term.
There are many ways to appear successful by cutting corners today, that end in disaster tomorrow.
Success requires understanding, and being accountable for, how different timescales interact.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: have an explicit destination,
ensure short-term work steers towards it,
be long-term rigid and short-term flexible</p></li></ol><p>Having spent a fair amount of time pressure testing these, I’m pretty sure most effective managers, and manager archetypes, can be fit into these boxes.</p><h3 id="self-assessing-on-these-skills">Self-assessing on these skills</h3><p>There’s no perfect way to measure anything complex, but here are some thinking
questions for you to spend time with as you assess where you stand on each of these skills:</p><ol><li><strong>Execution</strong><ul><li>When did your team last have friction delivering work? Is that a recurring issue?</li><li>What’s something hard you shipped that went really, really well?</li><li>When were you last pulled onto solving a time-sensitive, executive-visible project?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Team</strong><ul><li>Who was the last strong performer you hired?</li><li>Have you retained your strongest performers?</li><li>What strong performers want to join your team?</li><li>Which peers consider your team highly effective?</li><li>When did an executive describe your team as exceptional?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ownership</strong><ul><li>When did you or your team overcome the odds to deliver something important? (Would your stakeholders agree?)</li><li>What’s the last difficult problem you solved that stayed solved (rather than reoccurring)?</li><li>When did you last solve the problem first before addressing cross-team gaps?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Alignment</strong><ul><li>When was the last time you were surprised by a stakeholder? What could you do to prevent that reoccuring?</li><li>How does a new stakeholder understand your prioritization tradeoffs (incl rationale)?</li><li>When did you last disappoint a stakeholder without damaging your relationship?</li><li>What stakeholders would join your company because they trust you?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Taste</strong><ul><li>What’s a recent decision that is meaningfully better because you were present?</li><li>If your product counterpart left, what decisions would you struggle to make?</li><li>Where’s a subtle clarification that significantly changed a design or launch?</li><li>How have you inflected team’s outcomes by seeing around corners?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Clarity</strong><ul><li>What’s a difficult trade-off you recently helped your team make?</li><li>How could you enable them to make that same trade-off without your direct participation?</li><li>What’s a recent decision you made that was undone? How?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Navigating ambiguity</strong><ul><li>What problem have you worked on that was stuck before assisted, and unstuck afterwards?</li><li>How did you unstick it?</li><li>Do senior leaders bring ambiguous problems to you? Why?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Working across timescales</strong><ul><li>What’s a recent trade off you made between short and long-term priorities?</li><li>How do you inform these tradeoffs across timescales?</li><li>What long-term goals are you protecting at significant short-term cost?</li></ul></li></ol><p>Most of these questions stand on their own, but it’s worth briefly explaining
the “Have you ever been pulled into a SpecificSortOfProject by an executive?” questions.
My experience is that in most companies, executives will try to poach you onto their most
important problems that correspond to your strengths.
So if they’re never attempting to pull you in then either you’re not considered as particularly
strong on that dimensions, or you’re already very saturated with other work such that it doesn’t
seem possible to pull you in.</p><h3 id="are-core-skills-the-same-over-time">Are “core skills” the same over time?</h3><p>While those groupings of “core” and “growth” skills are obvious groupings to me,
what I came to appreciate while writing this is that some skills swap between core to growth
as the fads evolve.
Where <em>execution</em> is a foundational skill today, it was less of a core skill in the hypergrowth era,
and even less in the investor era.</p><p>This is the fundamentally tricky part of succeeding as an engineering manager across fads:
you need a sufficiently broad base across each of these skills to be successful, otherwise
you’re very likely to be viewed as a weak manager when the eras unpredictably end.</p><h2 id="stay-energized-to-stay-engaged">Stay energized to stay engaged</h2><p>The “<a href="https://lethain.com/frameworks-decision-making/">Manage your priorities and energy</a>” chapter in
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Executives-Primer-Impactful-Leadership/dp/1098149483/"><em>The Engineering Executive’s Primer</em></a>
captures an important reality that took me too long to understand:
the perfect allocation of work is not the mathematically ideal allocation that maximizes impact.
Instead, it’s the balance between that mathematical ideal and doing
things that energize you enough to stay motivated over the long haul.
If you’re someone who loves writing software, that might involve writing a bit more than helpful to your team.
If you’re someone who loves streamlining an organization, it might be improving a friction-filled process that is a personal affront, even if it’s not causing <em>that much</em> overall inefficiency.</p><h2 id="forty-year-career">Forty-year career</h2><p>Similarly to the question of prioritizing activities to stay energized, there’s also understanding
where you are in your career, an idea I explored in <a href="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">A forty-year career</a>.</p><p><img src="https://lethain.com/static/blog/2019/40-year-hero.png" alt="Diagram of different ways to prioritize roles across your career"></p><p>For each role, you have the chance to prioritize across different dimensions like pace, people, prestige, profit, or learning.
There’s no “right decision,” and there are always tradeoffs.
The decisions you make early in your career will compound over the following forty years.
You also have to operate within the constraints of your life today and your possible lives tomorrow.
Early in my career, I had few responsibilities to others, and had the opportunity to work extremely hard
at places like Uber. Today, with more family responsibilities, I am unwilling to make the tradeoffs to
consistently work that way, which has real implications on how I think about which roles to prioritize
over time.</p><p>Recognizing these tradeoffs, and making them deliberately, is one of the highest value things you can do
to shape your career. Most importantly, it’s extremely hard to have a career at all if you don’t think about
these dimensions and have a healthy amount of self-awareness to understand the tradeoffs that will allow you
to stay engaged over half a lifetime.</p><p><time datetime="2025-10-26T04:00:00-07:00">Published on October 26, 2025.</time></p></div></div>]]></description>

<a href="https://www.emilysneddon.com/fransans" target="_blank">Fran Sans</a> is a display font in every sense of the term. It’s an interpretation of the destination displays found on some of the light rail vehicles that service the city of San Francisco.<media-item autoplay="true" disable-zoom="true" hash="J2600265671666234692990740506745" loop="true" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" muted="true" uses="inline-part-styles"><figcaption slot="caption">SFMTA Photo Department</figcaption></media-item><p>

I say <i>some</i> because destination displays aren’t consistently used across the city’s transit system. In fact, SF has an unusually high number of independent public transit agencies. Unlike New York, Chicago or L.A., which each have one, maybe two, San Francisco and the greater Bay Area have over two dozen. Each agency, with its own models of buses and trains, use different destination displays, creating an eclectic patchwork of typography across the city.</p><p>

Among them, one display in particular has always stood out to me: the LCD panel displays inside Muni’s Breda Light Rail Vehicles. I remember first noticing them on a Saturday in October on the N-Judah, heading to the Outer Sunset for a shrimp hoagie. This context is important, as anyone who’s spent an October weekend in SF knows this is the optimal vibe to really take in the beauty of the city.&nbsp;</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="Y2571762958662850480571347675257" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" uses="inline-part-styles"></media-item><p>
What caught my eye was how the displays look mechanical and yet distinctly personal. Constructed on a 3×5 grid, the characters are made up of geometric modules: squares, quarter-circles, and angled forms. Combined, these modules create imperfect, almost primitive letterforms, revealing a utility and charm that feels distinctly like the San Francisco I’ve come to know.</p><p>


This balance of utility and charm seems to show up everywhere in San Francisco and its history. The Golden Gate’s “International Orange” started as nothing more than a rust-proof primer, yet is now the city’s defining colour. The Painted Ladies became multicoloured icons after the 1960s Colourist movement covered decades of grey paint. Even the steepness of the streets was once an oversight in city planning but has since been romanticised in films and on postcards. So perhaps it is unsurprising that I would find this same utility and charm in a place as small and functional as a train sign.</p><p>
To learn more about these displays, I visited the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency’s (SFMTA) Electronics Shop at Balboa Park. There, technician Armando Lumbad had set up one of the signs. They each feature one large LCD panel which displays the line name, and twenty-four smaller ones to display the destination. The loose spacing of the letters and fluorescent backlighting gives the sign a raw, analogue quality. Modern LED dot-matrix displays are far more efficient and flexible, but to me, they lack the awkwardness that makes these Breda signs so delightful.</p><media-item autoplay="true" browser-default="false" disable-zoom="true" hash="A2571773420420157235690484312185" limit-by="width" loop="true" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" muted="true" scale="100" uses="inline-part-styles"></media-item><p>

Armando showed me how the signs work. He handed me a printed matrix table listing every line and destination, each paired with a three-digit code. On route, train operators punch the code into a control panel at the back of the display, and the LCD blocks light on specific segments of the grid to build each letter. I picked code 119, and Armando entered it for me. A few seconds later the panels revealed my own stop: the N-Judah at Church &amp; Duboce. There in the workshop, devoid of the context of the trains and the commute, the display looked almost monolithic, or sculptural, and I have since fantasised whether it would be possible to ship one of these home to Australia.</p><p>


Looking inside of the display, I found labels identifying the make and model. The signs were designed and manufactured by Trans-Lite, Inc., a company based in Milford, Connecticut that specialised in transport signage from 1959 until its acquisition by the Nordic firm Teknoware in 2012. After lots of amateur detective work, and with the help from an anonymous Reddit user in a Connecticut community group, I was connected with Gary Wallberg, Senior Engineer at Trans-Lite and the person responsible for the design of these very signs back in 1999.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="E2571778130962277154087875422329" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" uses="inline-part-styles"><figcaption slot="caption">Original drawings of the display, courtesy of William Maley Jnr, former owner and CEO of TRANS-LITE, INC.</figcaption></media-item><p>
Learning that the alphabet came from an engineer really explains its temperament and why I was drawn to it in the first place. The signs were designed for sufficiency: fixed segments, fixed grid, and no extras. Characters were created only as destinations required them, while other characters, like the Q, X, and much of the punctuation, were never programmed into the signs. In reducing everything to its bare essentials, somehow character emerged, and it’s what inspired me to design Fran Sans.</p><p>

I shared some initial drawings with Dave Foster of <a href="https://www.fostertype.com/" target="_blank">Foster Type</a> who encouraged me to get the font software Glyphs and turn it into my first working font. From there, I broke down the anatomy of the letters into modules, then used them like Lego to build out a full set: uppercase A–Z, numerals, core punctuation.&nbsp;</p><media-item hash="Q2572899645280231776139518191737" media-style="border-width: 0rem; border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85); border-style: solid;" uses="inline-part-styles"></media-item><p>

Some glyphs remain unsolved in this first version, for example the standard @ symbol refuses to squeeze politely into the 3×5 logic. Lowercase remains a question for the future, and would likely mean reconsidering the grid. But, as with the displays themselves, I am judging Fran Sans as sufficient for now.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="A2606685398315595430709885708409" scale="100%"><figcaption slot="caption">Grid comparison. Left is a photo of the display, right is Fran Sans.</figcaption></media-item><p>


Getting up close to these signs, you’ll notice Fran Sans’ gridlines are simplified even from its real‑life muse, but my hope is that its character remains. Specifically: the N and the zero, where the unusually thick diagonals close in on the counters; and the Z and 7, whose diagonals can feel uncomfortably thin. I’ve also noticed the centre of the M can scale strangely and read like an H at small sizes, but in fairness, this type was never designed for the kind of technical detail so many monospaced fonts aim for. Throughout the process I tried to protect these unorthodox moments, because to me, they determined the success of this interpretation.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="U2634632898338157057546050119801"></media-item><p>

Fran Sans comes in three styles: Solid, Tile, and Panel, each building in visual complexity. The decision to include variations, particularly the Solid style, was inspired by my time working at <a href="https://christopherdoyle.co/" target="_blank">Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.</a> There, we worked with Bell Shakespeare, Australia’s national theatre company dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare. The equity of the Bell Shakespeare brand lies in its typography, which is a beautiful custom typeface called Hotspur, designed and produced by none other than Dave Foster.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="C2633085234643522250621956958329" href="https://christopherdoyle.co/" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" target="_blank" uses="inline-part-styles"><figcaption slot="caption">Hotspur by DAVE FOSTER.</figcaption></media-item><p>

Often, brand fonts are chosen or designed to convey a single feeling. Maybe it’s warmth and friendliness, or a sense of tech and innovation. But what I’ve always loved about the Bell typeface is how one weight could serve both Shakespeare’s comedies and tragedies, simply by shifting scale, spacing, or alignment. Hotspur has the gravity to carry the darkness of <i>Titus Andronicus</i> and the roundness to convey the humour of <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>. And while Fran Sans Solid is technically no Hotspur, I wanted it to share that same versatility.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="K2633083737395092763912490494073" href="https://christopherdoyle.co/" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" target="_blank" uses="inline-part-styles"><figcaption slot="caption">Bell Shakespeare by CHRISTOPHER DOYLE &amp; CO.</figcaption></media-item><p>

Further inspiration for Fran Sans came from the <a href="https://letterformarchive.org/" target="_blank">Letterform Archive</a>, the world’s leading typography archive, based in San Francisco. Librarian and archivist <a href="https://www.kateallalong.com/" target="_blank">Kate Long Stellar</a> thoughtfully curated a research visit filled with modular typography spanning most of the past century. On the table were two pieces that had a significant impact on Fran Sans and are now personal must-sees at the archive. First, Joan Trochut’s <i>Tipo Veloz</i> “Fast Type” (1942) was created during the Second World War when resources were scarce. <i>Tipo Veloz</i> gave printers the ability to draw with type, rearranging modular pieces to form letters, ornaments and even illustrations.</p><p>

Second, Zuzana Licko’s process work for <i>Lo-Res</i> (1985), an Emigre typeface, opened new ways of thinking about how ideas move between the physical and the digital and then back again. Seeing how <i>Lo-Res</i> was documented through iterations and variations gave the typeface a depth and richness that changed my understanding of how fonts are built. At some point I want to explore physical applications for Fran Sans out of respect for its origins, since it is impossible to fully capture the display’s charm on screen.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="Q2572944407798912902336988096633" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" uses="inline-part-styles"><figcaption slot="caption">Letterform Archive research visit, MAY 2025.</figcaption></media-item><p>

Back at the SFMTA, Armando told me the Breda vehicles are being replaced, and with them their destination displays will be swapped for newer LED dot-matrix units that are more efficient and easier to maintain. By the end of 2025 the signs that inspired Fran Sans will disappear from the city, taking with them a small but distinctive part of the city’s voice. 
That feels like a real loss. San Francisco is always reinventing itself, yet its charm lies in how much of its history still shows through. My hope is that Fran Sans can inspire a deeper appreciation for the imperfections that give our lives and our cities character. Life is so rich when ease and efficiency are not the measure.</p></span><span>For commercial and non-commercial use of FRAN SANS, please get in touch: <a href="mailto:emily@emilysneddon.com" rel="mailto">emily@emilysneddon.com</a><p>WITH THANKS<br>Dave Foster, for being my go-to at every stage of this project.<br>Maria Doreuli, for thoughtfully reviewing Fran Sans.<br>Maddy Carrucan, for the words that always keep me dreamy.<br>Jeremy Menzies, for the photography of the Breda vehicles.<br>Kate Long Stellar, for curating a research visit on modular typography.<br>Angie Wang, for suggesting it and helping to make it happen.<br>Vasiliy Tsurkan, for inviting me into to the SFMTA workshop.<br>Armando Lumbad, for maintaining the signs that I love so much.<br>Rick Laubscher, for putting me in touch with the SFMTA.<br>William Maley Jr, for opening up the TRANS-LITE, INC. archives.<br>Gary Wallberg, for designing and engineering the original signs.<br>Gregory Wallberg, for responding to a very suspicious facebook post.<br>Reddit u/steve31086, for sleuthing the details of William Maley Jr.</p></span><span></span><span><span>OUTSIDE MY LIFE,<br>INSIDE THE DREAM.<p>

<p>This past year, Apple overhauled its design language across all of its major software platforms with the introduction of Liquid Glass. That dramatic redesign, coupled with a number of jam-packed feature releases over the past couple years, has resulted in many Apple users complaining about the overall quality of Apple software.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-23/apple-ios-27-snow-leopard-like-quality-focus-ai-features-tim-cook-retirement-mibq7jv8?cmpid=BBD112325_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=251123&amp;utm_campaign=poweron">today’s Power On newsletter</a>, Apple might finally be stepping back from new features, and instead focusing on underlying performance improvements. Let’s discuss.</p>



<h2 id="h-ios-27-to-be-a-snow-leopard-style-update">iOS 27 to be a ‘Snow Leopard-style update’</h2>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-23/apple-ios-27-snow-leopard-like-quality-focus-ai-features-tim-cook-retirement-mibq7jv8?cmpid=BBD112325_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=251123&amp;utm_campaign=poweron">Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is taking a step back from launching any major new software features at WWDC26. This applies to iOS 27 and macOS 27, as well as all of the companies smaller platforms, like watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS. </p>



<p>For the first time since iOS 12, Apple will be focusing on software quality, rather than flashy new features:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Aiming to improve the software, engineering teams are now combing through Apple’s operating systems, hunting for bloat to cut, bugs to eliminate, and any opportunity to meaningfully boost performance and overall quality. Like Snow Leopard set the groundwork for future overhauls and new types of Macs, iOS 27 will lay the foundation for&nbsp;foldable iPhones&nbsp;and&nbsp;other new hardware.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Apple won’t quite launch ‘zero new features’ like they claimed with OS X Snow Leopard back in 2009, however. According to Gurman, Apple still plans to release a number of new AI features with iOS 27, so the company doesn’t continue to fall behind in the AI race.</p>



<p>Currently, two major AI features are rumored for iOS 27: Apple’s new AI health agent – launching alongside a potential Apple Health+ subscription, as well as the companies first AI-powered web search feature. </p>



<p>These new features will shortly follow the launch of AI-infused Siri in iOS 26.4, which is largely anticipated to be powered by a special version of Google Gemini. Said custom version of Google Gemini will avoid sending data to Google’s servers, thanks to a custom-built model for Apple’s private cloud compute.</p>



<h2 id="h-wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>



<p>Outside of the heavy focus on software quality and other AI enhancements, Gurman also outlines three additional things to look out for with iOS 27:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhancements for enterprise users</li>



<li>‘Bespoke’ features for users in emerging markets</li>



<li>Design tweaks for Liquid Glass</li>
</ul>



<p>Overall, iOS 27 is shaping up to be the one update that many Apple enthusiasts have wanted for many years: one that just focuses on polishing up the software.</p>




	<p>It remains to be seen whether or not iOS 27 will truly feel as polished as iOS 12 or OS X Snow Leopard, but nonetheless, I’m really happy to see Apple is headed in this direction.</p>



<p>Does a renewed focus on stability in iOS 27 excite you? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p dir="auto">See <code>man sc_auth</code> and <code>man ssh-keychain</code> for all the options</p>
<p dir="auto">To create a Secure Enclave backed key that requires biometrics, run the
following command and press TouchID:</p>
<pre><code>% sc_auth create-ctk-identity -l ssh -k p-256-ne -t bio
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">You can confirm that the key was create with the <code>list-ctk-identities</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>arian@Mac ssh-keychain % sc_auth  list-ctk-identities

</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">It also supports listing the ssh key fingerprints instead:</p>
<pre><code>% sc_auth  list-ctk-identities -t ssh

<pre><code>% sc_auth delete-ctk-identity -h &lt;Public Key Hash&gt;

<p dir="auto">You can "download" the public / private keypair from the secure enclave using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>% ssh-keygen -w /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib -K -N ""
Enter PIN for authenticator: 
You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key download.

<p dir="auto">You can just use the empty string for PIN. For some reason <code>openssh</code> always asks for
it even if the authenticator in question does not use a PIN but a biometric.
Note that the "private" key here is just a reference to the FIDO credential. It does
not contain any secret key material. Hence I'm specifiyng <code>-N ""</code> to skip an encryption
passphrase.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now if you copy this public key to your authorized keys file, it should work!</p>
<pre><code>% ssh-copy-id -i id_ecdsa_sk_rk localhost
% ssh -o SecurityKeyProvider=/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib localhost
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Usage with <code>ssh-agent</code></h2><a id="user-content-usage-with-ssh-agent" aria-label="Permalink: Usage with ssh-agent" href="#usage-with-ssh-agent"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of downloading the public/private keypair to a file you can also directly
make the keys available to <code>ssh-agent</code>. For this you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>% ssh-add -K -S /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib
Enter PIN for authenticator:

<p dir="auto"><code>SecurityKeyProvider</code> can be configured in <code>.ssh/config</code> but I recommend setting
<code>export SSH_SK_PROVIDER=/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib</code> in your <code>.zprofile</code> instead as
that environment variable gets picked up by <code>ssh</code>, <code>ssh-add</code> and <code>ssh-keygen</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This means you can just do:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-add -K
ssh my-server
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">or</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -K
ssh -i id_ecdsa_rk_sk my-server

<p dir="auto">There's also an exportable variant where the private key is encrypted using the secure enclave as opposed to generated on the secure enclave. This is might be considered secure but is convenient for key backup.</p>
<pre><code>% sc_auth create-ctk-identity -l ssh-exportable -k p-256 -t bio
