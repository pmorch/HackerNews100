<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                        <div>

                                                            <p>ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication will not renew its contract with <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/about/newshour-west" target="_blank">PBS News Hour West</a>, ending a reporting hub that covered the western U.S. and updated the nightly news produced on the East Coast for West Coast viewers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Located on the Downtown Phoenix campus, the bureau offered internship opportunities for journalism students at the University.</p>
<p>The bureau was created to help the national News Hour program, which is broadcast by <a href="https://weta.org/" target="_blank">WETA</a>, "work more closely with PBS stations and other media partners on the West Coast," according to an <a href="https://cronkite.asu.edu/news/2019/pbs-newshour-announces-launch-of-pbs-newshour-west-at-asus-cronkite-school" target="_blank">ASU News</a> article announcing the launch of the bureau in 2019. More than 20% of News Hour's audience resides in that region.</p>
<p>News Hour West will make its last contribution to the national broadcast on Dec. 19.</p>

                                

                                <p>Michael Rancilio, the general manager of News Hour Productions and WETA's executive vice president and chief content officer, said in an email to PBS News supporters that the decision was "based on Arizona State University's revised priorities," according to <a href="https://current.org/2025/11/weta-to-cut-staff-cancel-pbs-news-weekend-and-close-news-hour-west-bureau/" target="_blank">Current</a>.</p>
<p><strong>READ MORE: </strong><a href="https://www.statepress.com/article/2025/06/politics-public-media-arizona-pbs-executive-order" target="_blank">Federal funding cuts to public media may impact Arizona PBS, students</a></p>
<p>A spokesperson for the University declined to comment on the closing, referring The State Press to PBS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both PBS News and Arizona PBS responded to the news of the closure but did not provide any reasoning for the choice.</p>
<p>"We are grateful to our partners at ASU and the Cronkite School on our effort to launch PBS News Hour West back in 2019 and the important journalism our small but nimble team there has been able to produce," PBS News' executive director of communications, Nick Massella, said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Jeremy Cauthen, the senior director of brand engagement and marketing at Arizona PBS, said in a written statement that the ASU-News Hour West partnership benefited audiences in the western U.S. as well as University students.</p>
<p>"Even though the station will no longer be providing production support for 'PBS News Hour', we'll continue our nightly broadcast of PBS' flagship news program and our ongoing commitment to keeping Arizonans informed through local news and public affairs programs like 'Arizona Horizon' and 'Horizonte,'" Cauthen said in a written statement.</p>
<p>AJ Ceglia, a senior studying journalism and mass communication, is one of the broadcast production interns at News Hour West. The internship was one of her first professional experiences, she said.</p>
<p>"I was just so relieved to find out that they were so willing to take the time to teach everything that we needed to know to produce the news at night," Ceglia said. "It's very upsetting to hear that it was shut down."</p>
<p>Ceglia said she was told that ASU made the decision, not PBS. She was only told that the contract was not being renewed and did not know any of the logistics of the closure.</p>

                                
                                                                                                    <p>The agreement between News Hour West and the University was mutually beneficial, Ceglia said. PBS got a headquarters in the West at a school with reliable broadcasting equipment, and the University's contributions were rewarded with heightened visibility.</p>
<p>An aerial shot of the Cronkite building is shown at the end of the nightly News Hour broadcast, crediting the school for its support.</p>

<p>Ceglia said News Hour West staff members will lose their jobs because of the closure.</p>
                                
                                <p>"It's just upsetting that they really enjoyed being able to support the students that did the program, and they really liked being able to share so much experience," Ceglia said.</p>
<p>Ceglia said she sympathizes with the interns who were set to work at News Hour West for the spring semester because "they're having it basically ripped out of their hands." To fulfill the internship requirement to graduate with a journalism and mass communication degree, they must now find another way to gain those credits.</p>
<p>"It's not anything my producers can control, but what (the producers are) doing is they are really trying to put those soon-to-be interns to another place to work," Ceglia said. "That is something they're very focused on right now."</p>
<p>Current interns are still able to get the internship credit, Ceglia said. Nonetheless, the closure has had a personal impact on her.</p>
<p>"I feel so strongly about it because it really was a great opportunity to learn and one of my first real professional ones," Ceglia said. "I'm sad to see it go."</p>

                <p>It’s here, the future of masonry layouts on the web! After the groundwork laid by Mozilla, years of effort by Apple’s WebKit team, and many rounds debate at the CSS Working Group with all the browsers, it’s now clear how it works.</p>
<p>Introducing CSS Grid Lanes.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>250px</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>gap</span>: <span>16px</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>How Grid Lanes work</h2>
<p>Let’s break down exactly how to create this classic layout.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-dark.png" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light.png" alt="Classic masonry-style layout of photos of various aspect ratios, all the same width, aligned in six columns" width="2000" height="1311" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light.png 2000w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light-300x197.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light-1024x671.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light-768x503.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light-1536x1007.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></picture><figcaption>You can try out this <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/photos/">demo of photo gallery layouts</a> today in Safari Technology Preview.</figcaption></figure>
<p>First, the HTML.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>main</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"container"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-1.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-2.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-3.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;!-- etc --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>main</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s start by applying <code>display: grid-lanes</code> to the <code>main</code> element to create a Grid container ready to make this kind of layout. Then we use <code>grid-template-columns</code> to create the “lanes” with the full power of CSS Grid.</p>
<p>In this case, we’ll use <code>repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))</code> to create flexible columns at least 250 pixels wide. The browser will decide how many columns to make, filling all available space.</p>
<p>And then, <code>gap: 16px</code> gives us 16 pixel gaps between the lanes, and 16 pixel gaps between items within the lanes.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>250px</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>gap</span>: <span>16px</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That’s it! In three lines of CSS, with zero media queries or container queries, we created a flexible layout that works on all screen sizes.</p>
<p>Think of it like a highway of cars in bumper-to-bumper traffic.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234.png" alt="Cartoon drawing of a highway from above. Nine cars fill four lanes of traffic, bumper to bumper. Each car has a number labeling it, showing the order these would be in HTML." width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234.png 1920w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234-300x169.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234-1024x576.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234-768x432.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>
<p>Just like the classic <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry library</a>, as the browser decides where to put each item, the next one is placed in whichever column gets it closest to the top of the window. Like traffic, each car “changes lanes” to end up in the lane that gets them “the furthest ahead”.</p>
<p>This layout makes it possible for users to tab across the lanes to all currently-visible content, (not down the first column below the fold to the very bottom, and then back to the top of the second column). It also makes it possible for you to build a site that keeps loading more content as the user scrolls, infinitely, without needing JavaScript to handle the layout.</p>
<h2>The power of Grid</h2>
<h3>Varying lane sizes</h3>
<p>Because Grid Lanes uses the full power of CSS Grid to define lanes using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/grid-template-columns"><code>grid-template-*</code></a>, it’s easy to create creative design variations.</p>
<p>For example, we can create a flexible layout with alternating narrow and wide columns — where both the first and last columns are always narrow, even as the number of columns changes with the viewport size. This is accomplished with <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(8rem, 1fr) minmax(16rem, 2fr)) minmax(8rem, 1fr)</code>.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-dark.png" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light.png" alt="Demo layout of photos, where the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th column are narrow, while the 2nd, 4th and 6th columns are twice as wide. " width="2000" height="1311" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light.png 2000w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light-300x197.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light-1024x671.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light-768x503.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light-1536x1007.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></picture><figcaption>Try out the <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/photos/">demo of photo gallery layouts</a> today in Safari Technology Preview.</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s a whole world of possibilities using <code>grid-template-*</code> syntax.</p>
<h4>Spanning items</h4>
<p>Since we have the full power of Grid layout, we can also span lanes, of course.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-dark.png" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light.png" alt="A complex layout of titles with teaser text for over two dozen articles — telling people what they'll experience if they open the article. The first teaser has a very large headline with text, and spans four columns. Five more teasers are medium-sized, bowl and next to the hero. The rest of the space available is filled in with small teasers. None of the teasers have the same amount of content as the rest. The heights of each box are random, and the layout tucks each box up against the one above it." width="2000" height="1394" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light.png 2000w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light-300x209.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light-1024x714.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light-768x535.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light-1536x1071.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></picture><figcaption>Try out the <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/newspaper/">demo of newspaper article layout</a> today in Safari Technology Preview.</figcaption></figure>
<pre><code><span>main</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>20</span><span>ch</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>gap</span>: <span>2</span><span>lh</span>;
}
<span>article</span> { 
  <span>grid-column</span>: <span>span</span> <span>1</span>; 
}
<span>@media</span> (1250<span>px</span> &lt; <span>width</span>) {
  <span>article</span>:<span>nth-child</span>(<span>1</span>) { 
    <span>grid-column</span>: <span>span</span> <span>4</span>;             
  }
  <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(2), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(3), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(4), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(5), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(6), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(7), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(8) { 
    <span>grid-column</span>: <span>span</span> <span>2</span>; 
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>All the article teasers are first set to span 1 column. Then the 1st item is specifically told to span 4 columns, while the 2nd – 8th to span 2 columns. This creates a far more dynamic graphic design than the typical symmetrical, everything the same-width, everything the same-height layout that’s dominated over the last decade.</p>
<h3>Placing items</h3>
<p>We can also explicitly place items while using Grid Lanes. Here, the header is always placed in the last column, no matter how many columns exist.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-museum.png" alt="A layout of paintings —&nbsp;each has a bit of text below the painting: title, etc. The paintings are laid out in 8 columns. Over on the right, spanning across two columns is the header of the website. " width="2000" height="1279" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-museum.png 2000w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-museum-300x192.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-museum-1024x655.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-museum-768x491.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-museum-1536x982.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"><figcaption>Try out the <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/museum/">demo of a museum website layout</a> today in Safari Technology Preview.</figcaption></figure>
<pre><code><span>main</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>24</span><span>ch</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
}
<span>header</span> {
  <span>grid-column</span>: <span>-3</span> / <span>-1</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Changing directions</h2>
<p>Yes, lanes can go either direction! All of the examples above happen to create a “waterfall” shape, where the content is laid out in columns. But Grid Lanes can be used to create a layout in the other direction, in a “brick” layout shape.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout.png" alt="Contrasting cartoon drawings: on the left, waterfall layout with boxes lined up in columns, falling down the page. And &quot;brick&quot; layout, with boxes flowing left to right, stacked like bricks in rows." width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout.png 1920w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout-300x169.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout-1024x576.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout-768x432.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>
<p>The browser automatically creates a waterfall layout when you define columns with <code>grid-template-columns</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>1</span><span>fr</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want a brick layout in the other direction, instead define the rows with <code>grid-template-rows</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>1</span><span>fr</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works automatically thanks to a new default for<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/grid-auto-flow"><code>grid-auto-flow</code></a>, the <code>normal</code> value.  It figures out whether to create columns or rows based on whether you defined the lanes using <code>grid-template-columns</code> or <code>grid-template-rows</code>.</p>
<p>The CSS Working Group is still discussing which property will explicitly control the flow orientation, and what its syntax will be. The debate is over whether to reuse <code>grid-auto-flow</code> or create new properties like <code>grid-lanes-direction</code>. If you’re interested in reading about the options being considered or chime in with your thoughts, see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12803#issuecomment-3643945412">this discussion</a>.</p>
<p>However, since <code>normal</code> will be the initial value either way, you don’t have to wait for this decision to learn Grid Lanes. When you define only one direction — <code>grid-template-rows</code> <em>or</em> <code>grid-template-columns</code> — it will Just Work™. (If it doesn’t, check if <code>grid-auto-flow</code> is set to a conflicting value. You can<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/unset"><code>unset</code></a> it if needed.)</p>
<h2>Placement sensitivity</h2>
<p>“Tolerance” is a new concept created for Grid Lanes. It lets you adjust just how picky the layout algorithm is when deciding where to place items.</p>
<p>Look at the next drawing. Notice that Car 4 is a tiny bit shorter than Car 1. When the “tolerance” is zero, Car 6 ends up in the right-most lane, while Car 7 is on the left. Car 6 ends up behind Car 4 on the right because that gets it a tiny bit closer “down the road” (closer to the top of the Grid container). Car 7 then takes the next-closest-to-the-top slot, and ends up behind Car 1 on the left. The end result? The first horizontal grouping of content is ordered 1, 2, 3, 4, and the next is 7, 5, 6.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1.png" alt="Same cartoon drawing of the highway of bumper to bumper traffic from above." width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1.png 1920w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1-300x169.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1-768x432.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>
<p>But the difference in length between Car 1 and Car 4 is tiny. Car 6 isn’t meaningfully closer to the top of the page. And having item 6 on the right, with item 7 on the left is likely an unexpected experience — especially for users who are tabbing through content, or when the content order is somehow labeled.</p>
<p>These tiny differences in size don’t matter in any practical sense. Instead, the browser should consider item sizes like Car 1 and Car 4 to be a tie. That’s why the default for <code>item-tolerance</code> is <code>1em</code> — which means only differences in content length greater than 1 em will matter when figuring out where the next item goes.</p>
<p>If you’d like the layout of items to shuffle around less, you can set a higher value for <code>item-tolerance</code>. In the next digram, the tolerance is set to half-a-car, causing the cars to lay out basically from left to right and only moving to another lane to avoid the extra-long limo. Now, the horizontal groupings of content are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 6, 7.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2.png" alt="Now the highway has the cars ordered in a fashion that's less chaotic." width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2.png 1920w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2-300x169.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2-768x432.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>
<p>Think of tolerance as how chill you want the car drivers to be. Will they change lanes to get just a few inches ahead? Or will they only move if there’s a lot of space in the other lane? The amount of space you want them to care about is the amount you set in <code>item-tolerance</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that people tabbing through the page will see each item highlighted as it comes into focus, and may be experiencing the page through a screenreader. An item tolerance that’s set too high can create an awkward experience jumping up and down the layout. An item tolerance that’s too low can result in jumping back and forth across the layout more than necessary. Adjust <code>item-tolerance</code> to something appropriate for the sizes and size variations of your content.</p>
<p>Currently, this property is named <code>item-tolerance</code> in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-3/#placement-tolerance">specification</a> and in Safari Technology Preview 234. However, there is still a chance this name will change, perhaps to something like <code>flow-tolerance</code> or <code>pack-tolerance</code>. If you have a preference, or ideas for a better name, you can <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10884#issuecomment-3658059682">chime in here</a>. Keep an eye out for updates about the final name before using this property on production websites.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
This article shows how to construct a
<em>non-recursive</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">zip bomb</a>
that achieves a high compression ratio by
overlapping files inside the zip container.
"Non-recursive" means that it does not rely on
a decompressor's recursively unpacking zip files nested within zip files:
it expands fully after a single round of decompression.
The output size increases quadratically in the input size,
reaching a compression ratio of over <data value="28442385.9286689">28&nbsp;million</data>
(<data value="9893525">10&nbsp;<abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr></data> → <data value="281395456244934">281&nbsp;<abbr title="terabyte">TB</abbr></data>)
at the limits of the zip format.
Even greater expansion is possible using
64-bit extensions.
The construction uses only the most common compression algorithm, DEFLATE,
and is compatible with most zip parsers.

<p>
Compression bombs that use the zip format
must cope with the fact that DEFLATE,
the compression algorithm most commonly supported by zip parsers,
<a href="https://www.zlib.net/zlib_tech.html">cannot achieve</a> a compression ratio greater than 1032.
For this reason, zip bombs typically rely on recursive decompression,
nesting zip files within zip files to get an extra factor of 1032 with each layer.
But the trick only works on implementations that
unzip recursively, and most do not.
The best-known zip bomb,
<a href="https://www.unforgettable.dk/">42.zip</a>,
expands to a formidable <data value="4507981343026016">4.5&nbsp;<abbr title="petabyte">PB</abbr></data>
if all six of its layers are recursively unzipped,
but a trifling <data value="558432">0.6&nbsp;<abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr></data> at the top layer.
Zip quines,
like those of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160130230432/http://www.steike.com/code/useless/zip-file-quine/">Ellingsen</a>
and <a href="https://research.swtch.com/zip">Cox</a>,
which contain a copy of themselves
and thus expand infinitely if recursively unzipped,
are likewise perfectly safe to unzip once.
</p>

<p>
This article shows how to construct a non-recursive zip bomb
whose compression ratio surpasses the DEFLATE limit of 1032.
It works by overlapping files inside the zip container,
in order to reference a "kernel" of highly compressed data
in multiple files,
without making multiple copies of it.
The zip bomb's output size grows quadratically in the input size; i.e.,
the compression ratio gets better as the bomb gets bigger.
The construction depends on features of both zip and DEFLATE—it
is not directly portable to other file formats or compression algorithms.
It is compatible with most zip parsers,
the exceptions being "streaming" parsers that
parse in one pass without first consulting the zip file's central directory.
We try to balance
two conflicting goals:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Maximize the compression ratio.
We define the compression ratio as the the sum of the sizes
of all the files contained the in the zip file,
divided by the size of the zip file itself.
It does not count filenames or other filesystem metadata,
only contents.
</li>
<li>
Be compatible.
Zip is a tricky format and parsers differ, especially
around edge cases and optional features.
Avoid taking advantage of tricks that only work with certain parsers.
We will remark on certain ways to increase the efficiency of the zip bomb
that come with some loss of compatibility.

<h2>Structure of a zip file</h2>

<p>
A&nbsp;zip file consists of
a <em>central directory</em> which references
<em>files</em>.
</p>

<img src="https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/normal.png" alt="A block diagram of the structure of a zip file. The central directory header consists of three central directory headers labeled CDH[1] (README), CDH[1] (Makefile), and CDH[3] (demo.c). The central directory headers point backwards to three local file headers LFH[1] (README), LFH[2] (Makefile), and LFH[3] (demo.c). Each local file header is joined with file data. The three joined blocks of (local file header, file data) are labeled file 1, file 2, and file 3.">
</picture>
</figure>

<p>
The central directory is at the end of the zip file.
It is a list of <em>central directory headers</em>.
Each central directory header contains metadata for a single file,
like its filename and CRC-32 checksum,
and a backwards pointer to a local file header.
A&nbsp;central directory header is 46&nbsp;bytes long,
plus the length of the filename.
</p>

<p>
A&nbsp;file consists of a <em>local file header</em>
followed by compressed <em>file data</em>.
The local file header is 30&nbsp;bytes long,
plus the length of the filename.
It contains a redundant copy
of the metadata from the central directory header,
and the compressed and uncompressed sizes of the file data
that follows.
Zip is a container format, not a compression algorithm.
Each file's data is compressed
using an algorithm specified in the metadata—usually <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951">DEFLATE</a>.
</p>



<p>
This description of the zip format omits many details that
are not needed for understanding the zip bomb.

<section id="overlap">
<h2>The first insight: overlapping files</h2>

<p>
By compressing a long string of repeated bytes,
we can produce a <em>kernel</em>
of highly compressed data.
By itself, the kernel's compression ratio cannot
exceed the DEFLATE limit of 1032,
so we want a way to reuse the kernel in many files,
without making a separate copy of it in each file.
We can do it by overlapping files:
making many central directory headers point to
a single file, whose data is the kernel.
</p>

<figure id="fig-overlap">
<picture>
<source srcset="https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/overlap.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<img src="https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/overlap.png" alt="A block diagram of a zip file with fully overlapping files. The central directory header consists of central directory headers CDH[1], CDH[2], ..., CDH[N−1], CDH[N], with filenames A, B, ..., Y, Z. There is a single local file header LFH[1] with filename A whose file data is a compressed kernel. Every one of the central directory headers points backwards to the same local file header, LFH[1]. The lone file is multiply labeled file 1, file 2, ..., file N−1, file N.">
</picture>
</figure>

<p>
Let's look at an example to see how this construction affects the compression ratio.
Suppose the kernel is <data value="1000">1000&nbsp;bytes</data> and
decompresses to <data value="1000000">1&nbsp;<abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr></data>.
Then the first <data value="1000000"><abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr></data> of output "costs"
<data value="1078">1078&nbsp;bytes</data> of input:
</p>
<ul>
<li><data value="31">31&nbsp;bytes</data> for a local file header (including a 1-byte filename)</li>
<li><data value="47">47&nbsp;bytes</data> for a central directory header (including a 1-byte filename)</li>
<li><data value="1000">1000&nbsp;bytes</data> for the kernel itself</li>
</ul>
<p>
But every <data value="1000000">1&nbsp;<abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr></data> of output
after the first costs only <data value="47">47&nbsp;bytes</data>—we don't need another local file header or another copy of the kernel,
only an additional central directory header.
So while the first reference of the kernel has a compression ratio of
1 000 000&nbsp;/&nbsp;1078 ≈&nbsp;928,
each additional reference pulls the ratio closer to
1 000 000&nbsp;/&nbsp;47 ≈&nbsp;21 277.
A&nbsp;bigger kernel raises the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
The problem with this idea is a lack of compatibility.
Because many central directory headers point to a single local file header,
the metadata—specifically the filename—cannot match for every file.
Some parsers <a href="#compatibility">balk at that</a>.
<a href="http://infozip.sourceforge.net/UnZip.html">Info-ZIP UnZip</a>
(the standard Unix <code>unzip</code> program)
extracts the files, but with warnings:
</p>
<figure>
<pre>$ <kbd>unzip overlap.zip</kbd>
<samp>  inflating: A
B:  mismatching "local" filename (A),
         continuing with "central" filename version
  inflating: B
<i>...</i></samp>
</pre>
</figure>
<p>
And the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html">zipfile</a> module
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.7.0/Lib/zipfile.py#L1486-L1489">throws an exception</a>:

<samp>Traceback (most recent call last):

</pre>
</figure>
<!--
<p>
We could make every central directory header have the same filename
as the local file header, but that too is unsatisfying
because it means that if extracted to disk,
all the files will just overwrite each other and not take up more space
than a single file.
</p>
-->

<p>
Next we will see how to modify the construction
for consistency of filenames,
while still retaining most of the advantage
of overlapping files.

<h2>The second insight: quoting local file headers</h2>

<p>
We need to separate the local file headers for each file,
while still reusing a single kernel.
Simply concatenating all the local file headers does not work,
because the zip parser will find a local file header
where it expects to find the beginning of a DEFLATE stream.
But the idea will work, with a minor modification.
We'll use a feature of DEFLATE, non-compressed blocks,
to "quote" local file headers
so that they appear to be part of the same DEFLATE stream
that terminates in the kernel.
Every local file header
(except the first)
will be interpreted in two ways:
as code (part of the structure of the zip file)
and as data (part of the contents of a file).
</p>

</figure>

<p>
A DEFLATE stream is a sequence of
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951#section-3.2.3">blocks</a>,
where each block may be compressed or non-compressed.
Compressed blocks are what we usually think of;
for example the kernel is one big compressed block.
But there are also non-compressed blocks,
which start with a
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951#section-3.2.4">5-byte header</a>
with a length field that means simply, "output the next <var>n</var> bytes verbatim."
Decompressing a non-compressed block means only stripping the 5-byte header.
Compressed and non-compressed blocks may be intermixed freely
in a DEFLATE stream.
The output is the concatenation of
decompressing all the blocks in order.
The "non-compressed" notion only has meaning at the DEFLATE layer;
the file data still counts as "compressed" at the zip layer,
no matter what kind of blocks are used.
</p>

<p>
It is easiest to understand this quoted-overlap construction from the inside out,
beginning with the last file and working backwards to the first.
Start by inserting the kernel, which will form the end of file data for every file.
Prepend a local file header LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub>
and add a central directory header CDH<sub><var>N</var></sub> that points to it.
Set the "compressed size" metadata field in the LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub> and CDH<sub><var>N</var></sub> to the compressed size of the kernel.
Now prepend a 5-byte non-compressed block header (colored green in the diagram)
whose length field is equal to the size of LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub>.
Prepend a second local file header LFH<sub><var>N</var>−1</sub>
and add a central directory header CDH<sub><var>N</var>−1</sub> that points to it.
Set the "compressed size" metadata field in both of the new headers to the compressed size of the kernel
<em>plus</em> the size of the non-compressed block header (5&nbsp;bytes)
<em>plus</em> the size of LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub>.
</p>



<p>
At this point the zip file contains two files, named "Y" and "Z".
Let's walk through what a zip parser would see while parsing it.
Suppose the compressed size of the kernel is 1000&nbsp;bytes
and the size of LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub> is 31&nbsp;bytes.
We start at CDH<sub><var>N</var>−1</sub>
and follow the pointer to LFH<sub><var>N</var>−1</sub>.
The first file's filename is "Y" and
the compressed size of its file data is 1036&nbsp;bytes.
Interpreting the next 1036 bytes as a DEFLATE stream,
we first encounter the 5-byte header of a non-compressed block
that says to copy the next 31&nbsp;bytes.
We write the next 31&nbsp;bytes,
which are LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub>,
which we decompress and append to file "Y".
Moving on in the DEFLATE stream, we find a compressed block (the kernel),
which we decompress to file "Y".
Now we have reached the end of the compressed data and are done with file "Y".
Proceeding to the next file, we follow the pointer from CDH<sub><var>N</var></sub>
to LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub> and find a file named "Z"
whose compressed size is 1000&nbsp;bytes.
Interpreting those 1000&nbsp;bytes as a DEFLATE stream,
we immediately encounter a compressed block (the kernel again)
and decompress it to the file "Z".
Now we have reached the end of the final file and are done.
The output file "Z" contains the decompressed kernel;
the output file "Y" is the same, but additionally prefixed by
the 31&nbsp;bytes of
LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub>.
</p>

<p>
We complete the construction by repeating the quoting procedure
until the zip file contains the desired number of files.
Each new file adds a central directory header,
a local file header,
and a non-compressed block to quote the immediately succeeding local file header.
Compressed file data is generally a chain of DEFLATE non-compressed blocks
(the quoted local file headers)
followed by the compressed kernel.
Each byte in the kernel contributes about
1032 <var>N</var> to the output size,
because each byte is part of all <var>N</var> files.
The output files are not all the same size:
those that appear earlier in the zip file
are larger than those that appear later,
because they contain more quoted local file headers.
The contents of the output files are not particularly meaningful,
but no one said they had to make sense.
</p>

<p>
This quoted-overlap construction has better compatibility
than the full-overlap construction of the previous section,
but the compatibility comes at the expense of the compression ratio.
There, each added file cost only a central directory header;
here, it costs a central directory header,
a local file header,
and another 5&nbsp;bytes for the quoting header.

<h2>Optimization</h2>

<p>
Now that we have the basic zip bomb construction,
we will try to make it as efficient as possible.
We want to answer two questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>For a given zip file size, what is the maximum compression ratio?</li>
<li>What is the maximum compression ratio, given the limits of the zip format?</li>
</ul>

<section id="bulkdeflate">
<h3>Kernel compression</h3>

<p>
It pays to compress the kernel as densely as possible,
because every decompressed byte gets magnified by a factor of <var>N</var>.
To that end, we use a custom DEFLATE compressor
called bulk_deflate,
specialized for compressing
a string of repeated bytes.
</p>

<!--
         engine compressed_size max_uncompressed_size
1: bulk_deflate           21090              21749401
2:         zlib           21090              21723602
3:       zopfli           21090              21734018
-->

<p>
All decent DEFLATE compressors will approach a compression ratio of 1032
when given an infinite stream of repeating bytes,
but we care more about specific finite sizes
than asymptotics.
bulk_deflate compresses more data
into the same space than the general-purpose compressors:
about 26&nbsp;kB more than zlib and Info-ZIP,
and about 15&nbsp;kB more than
<a href="https://github.com/google/zopfli">Zopfli</a>,
a compressor that trades speed for density.
</p>

<figure id="max_uncompressed_size">

The points form three lines because zlib and Info-ZIP were identical. All three lines have a slope of 1032. For a given DEFLATE stream size, bulk_deflate compresses about 15 kB more than Zopfli, and Zopfli compresses about 10 kB more than zlib/Info-ZIP.">
</picture>
</figure>

<p>
The price of bulk_deflate's high compression ratio is a lack of generality.
bulk_deflate can only compress strings of a single repeated byte,
and only those of specific lengths,
namely 517&nbsp;+&nbsp;258 <var>k</var> for integer <var>k</var>&nbsp;≥&nbsp;0.
Besides compressing densely, bulk_deflate is fast,
doing essentially constant work regardless of the input size,
aside from the work of actually writing out the compressed string.
</p>

</section>

<section id="filenames">
<h3>Filenames</h3>



<p>
For our purposes, filenames are mostly dead weight.
While filenames do contribute something to the output size
by virtue of being part of quoted local file headers,
a byte in a filename does not contribute nearly as much
as a byte in the kernel.
We want filenames to be as short as possible,
while keeping them all distinct,
and subject to compatibility considerations.
</p>



<p>
The first compatibility consideration is character encoding.
The zip format specification states that filenames
are to be interpreted as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">CP&nbsp;437</a>,
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> if a certain flag bit is set
(<a href="https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">APPNOTE.TXT Appendix&nbsp;D</a>).
But this is a major point of incompatibility
across zip parsers,
which may interpret filenames as being in
some fixed or locale-specific encoding.
So for compatibility, we must limit ourselves to characters
that have the same encoding in both
CP&nbsp;437 and UTF-8;
namely, the 95 printable characters of US-ASCII.
</p>



<p>
We are further restricted by filesystem naming limitations.
Some filesystems are case-insensitive, so "a" and "A" do not count as distinct names.
Common filesystems like FAT32
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Limits">prohibit certain characters</a>
like '*' and '?'.
</p>

<p>
As a safe but not necessarily optimal compromise,
our zip bomb will use filenames consisting of characters
drawn from a 36-character alphabet
that does not
rely on case distinctions
or use special characters:

<p>
Filenames are generated in the obvious way,
cycling each position through the possible characters
and adding a position on overflow:
</p>
<figure>
"0", "1", "2", …, "Z",<br>
"00", "01", "02", …, "0Z",<br>
…,<br>
"Z0", "Z1", "Z2", …, "ZZ",<br>
"000", "001", "002", …
</figure>

<p>
There are 36 filenames of length&nbsp;1,
36<sup>2</sup> filenames of length&nbsp;2, and so on.
The length of the <var>n</var>th filename is
⌊log<sub>36</sub>((<var>n</var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;/&nbsp;(36 / 35))⌋&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.
<!--
The sum of the lengths of the first <var>n</var> filenames is
<var>d</var><var>n</var> − ((36<sup><var>d</var></sup> − 1) ⋅ (36 / 35<sup>2</sup>) − <var>d</var> / 35),
where <var>d</var> = &lfloor;log<sub>36</sub>(<var>n</var> / (36 / 35))&rfloor;.
-->
Four bytes are enough to represent
<data value="1727604">1 727 604</data> distinct filenames.
</p>

<p>
Given that the <var>N</var> filenames in the zip file
are generally not all of the same length,
which way should we order them,
shortest to longest or longest to shortest?
A&nbsp;little reflection shows that it is better to
put the longest names last, because those names are the most quoted.
Ordering filenames longest last
adds over <data value="929872440">900&nbsp;<abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr></data> of output
to <a href="#allocation">zblg.zip</a>,
compared to ordering them longest first.
It is a minor optimization, though,
as those <data value="929872440">900&nbsp;<abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr></data>
comprise only <data value="0.000003304504104">0.0003%</data>

<section id="allocation">
<h3>Kernel size</h3>

<p>
The quoted-overlap construction
allows us to place a compressed kernel of data,
and then cheaply copy it many times.
For a given zip file size&nbsp;<var>X</var>,
how much space should we devote to storing the kernel,
and how much to making copies?
</p>

<p>
To find the optimum balance,
we only have to optimize the single variable <var>N</var>,
the number of files in the zip file.
Every value of <var>N</var> requires
a certain amount of overhead for
central directory headers,
local file headers,
quoting block headers, and filenames.
All the remaining space can be taken up by the kernel.
Because <var>N</var> has to be an integer,
and you can only fit so many files
before the kernel size drops to zero,
it suffices to test every possible value of <var>N</var>
and select the one that yields the most output.
</p>

<p>
Applying the optimization procedure to <var>X</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;42 374,
the size of 42.zip,
finds a maximum at <var>N</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;250.
Those 250 files require <data value="21195">21 195</data> bytes of overhead,
leaving <data value="21179">21 179</data> bytes for the kernel.
A&nbsp;kernel of that size decompresses to <data value="21841249">21 841 249</data> bytes
(a&nbsp;ratio of <data value="1031.2691345200435">1031.3</data>).
The 250 copies of the decompressed kernel,
plus the little bit extra that comes from the quoted local file headers,
produces an overall unzipped output of
5 461 307 620&nbsp;bytes
and a&nbsp;compression ratio of <data value="128883.45730872705">129&nbsp;thousand</data>.

<p>
Optimization produced an almost even split
between the space allocated to the kernel
and the space allocated to file headers.
It is not a coincidence.
Let's look at a simplified model of the quoted-overlap construction.
In the simplified model,
we ignore filenames,
as well as the slight increase in output file size
due to quoting local file headers.
Analysis of the simplified model will show that the optimum
split between kernel and file headers is approximately even,
and that the output size grows quadratically
when allocation is optimal.

As we make the zip file larger,
eventually we run into the limits of the zip format.
A&nbsp;zip file can contain at most 2<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 files,
and each file can have an uncompressed size of at most 2<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 bytes.
Worse than that,
<a href="#compatibility">some implementations</a>
take the maximum possible values
as an indicator of the presence of <a href="#zip64">64-bit extensions</a>,
so our limits are actually 2<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;2 and 2<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;2.

It happens that the first limit we hit is the one on uncompressed file size.
At a zip file size of 8 319 377&nbsp;bytes,
naive optimization would give us a file count of 47 837
and a largest file of
2<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;311 bytes.

Accepting that we cannot increase <var>N</var> nor the size of the kernel without bound,
we would like find the maximum compression ratio achievable
while remaining within the limits of the zip format.
The way to proceed is to make the kernel as large as possible,
and have the maximum number of files.
Even though we can no longer maintain the roughly even split
between kernel and file headers,
each added file <em>does</em> increase the compression ratio—just
not as fast as it would if we were able to keep growing the kernel, too.
In fact, as we add files we will need to <em>decrease</em> the size of the kernel
to make room for the maximum file size
that gets slightly larger with each added file.
</p>

<p>
The plan results in a zip file
that contains 2<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;2 files and a kernel that decompresses
to 2<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;2 178 825 bytes.
Files get longer towards the beginning of the zip file—the
first and largest file decompresses to
2<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;56 bytes.
That is as close as we can get using the coarse
output sizes of bulk_deflate—encoding
the final 54&nbsp;bytes would cost more bytes than they are worth.
(The zip file as a whole has a compression ratio
of 28&nbsp;million, and the final 54&nbsp;bytes would gain
at most 54&nbsp;⋅&nbsp;1032&nbsp;⋅&nbsp;(2<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;2) ≈ <data value="3652078752">36.5&nbsp;million bytes</data>,
so it only helps if the 54&nbsp;bytes can be encoded
in 1&nbsp;byte—I&nbsp;could not do it in less than&nbsp;2.)
The output size of this zip bomb, 281 395 456 244 934&nbsp;bytes,
is 99.97% of the theoretical maximum
(2<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1) ⋅ (2<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1).
<!-- 65 535 × 0xffffffff = <data value="281470681677825">281 470 681 677 825</data>. -->
Any major improvements to the compression ratio can only come
from reducing the input size,
not increasing the output size.

<h2>Efficient CRC-32 computation</h2>

<p>
Among the metadata in the central directory header and local file header
is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC-32</a>
checksum of the uncompressed file data.
This poses a problem, because directly calculating the CRC-32 of each file
requires doing work proportional to the total <em>unzipped</em> size,
which is large by design. (It's a zip bomb, after all.)
We would prefer to do work that in the worst case is
proportional to the <em>zipped</em> size.
Two factors work in our advantage:
all files share a common suffix (the kernel),
and the uncompressed kernel is a string of repeated bytes.
We will represent CRC-32 as a matrix product—this
will allow us not only to compute the checksum of the kernel quickly,
but also to reuse computation across files.
The technique described in this section is a slight extension of the
<a href="https://github.com/madler/zlib/blob/v1.2.11/crc32.c#L372"><code>crc32_combine</code></a>
function in zlib,
which Mark Adler explains
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23122312/crc-calculation-of-a-mostly-static-data-stream/23126768#23126768">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can model CRC-32 as a state machine that updates a 32-bit state register
for each incoming bit.
The basic update operations for a 0&nbsp;bit and a 1&nbsp;bit are:
</p>

<figure>
<pre><code>uint32 crc32_update_0(uint32 state) {
    // Shift out the least significant bit.
    bit b = state &amp; 1;
    state = state &gt;&gt; 1;
    // If the shifted-out bit was 1, XOR with the CRC-32 constant.
    if (b == 1)
        state = state ^ 0xedb88320;
    return state;
}

uint32 crc32_update_1(uint32 state) {
    // Do as for a 0 bit, then XOR with the CRC-32 constant.
    return crc32_update_0(state) ^ 0xedb88320;
}</code></pre>
</figure>

<p>
If you think of the state register as a 32-element binary vector,
and use XOR for addition and AND for multiplication, then
<code>crc32_update_0</code> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map">linear transformation</a>;
i.e., it can be represented as multiplication by a
32×32 binary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix">transformation matrix</a>.
To see why, observe that multiplying a matrix by a vector
is just summing the columns of the matrix,
after multiplying each column by the corresponding element of the vector.
The shift operation <code>state&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;1</code>
is just taking each bit&nbsp;<var>i</var> of the state vector
and multiplying it by a vector that is 0 everywhere except at bit <var>i</var>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1
(numbering the bits from right to left).
The conditional final XOR <code>state&nbsp;^&nbsp;0xedb88320</code>
that only happens when bit&nbsp;<code>b</code> is 1
can instead be represented as first multiplying
<code>b</code> by 0xedb88320
and then XORing it into the state.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, <code>crc32_update_1</code> is just
<code>crc32_update_0</code> plus (XOR) a&nbsp;constant.
That makes <code>crc32_update_1</code> an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation">affine transformation</a>:
a&nbsp;matrix multiplication followed by a translation (i.e., vector addition).
We can represent both the matrix multiplication and the translation
in a single step
if we enlarge the dimensions of the transformation matrix to 33×33
and append an extra element to the state vector that is always&nbsp;1.
(This representation is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix#Affine_transformations">homogeneous coordinates</a>.)

<figcaption>
The 33×33 transformation matrices <var>M</var><sub>0</sub> and <var>M</var><sub>1</sub> that compute
the CRC-32 state change effected by a 0&nbsp;bit and a 1&nbsp;bit respectively.
Column vectors are stored with the most significant bit at the bottom:
reading the first column from bottom to top, you see
the CRC-32 polynomial constant edb88320<sub>16</sub> =
<span>1</span><span>1</span><span>1</span><span>0</span><span>1</span><span>1</span><span>0</span><span>1</span><span>1</span><span>0</span><span>1</span><span>1</span><span>1</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><span>1</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><span>1</span><span>1</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><span>1</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><span>0</span><sub>2</sub>.
The two matrices differ only in the final column, which represents a translation vector
in homogeneous coordinates.
In <var>M</var><sub>0</sub> the translation is zero and
in <var>M</var><sub>1</sub> it is edb88320<sub>16</sub>, the CRC-32 polynomial constant.
The 1's just above the diagonal represent the
shift operation <code>state&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;1</code>.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Both operations <code>crc32_update_0</code> and <code>crc32_update_1</code>
can be represented by a 33×33 transformation matrix.
The matrices <var>M</var><sub>0</sub> and <var>M</var><sub>1</sub> are shown.
The benefit of a matrix representation is that matrices compose.
Suppose we want to represent the state change effected by processing
the ASCII character 'a', whose binary representation is
01100001<sub>2</sub>.
We can represent the cumulative CRC-32 state change of those 8&nbsp;bits
in a single transformation matrix:
</p>
<figure>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><var>M</var><sub>a</sub></td><td>&nbsp;= <var>M</var><sub>0</sub> <var>M</var><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub>1</sub></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</figure>
<p>
And we can represent the state change of a string of repeated 'a's
by multiplying many copies of <var>M</var><sub>a</sub> together—matrix exponentiation.
We can do matrix exponentiation quickly
using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">square-and-multiply</a> algorithm,
which allows us to compute <var>M</var><sup><var>n</var></sup>
in only about log<sub>2</sub> <var>n</var> steps.
For example, the matrix representing the state change
of a string of 9&nbsp;'a's is
</p>
<figure>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>(<var>M</var><sub><code>a</code></sub>)<sup>9</sup></td><td>&nbsp;= <var>M</var><sub><code>a</code></sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub><code>a</code></sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub><code>a</code></sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub><code>a</code></sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub><code>a</code></sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub><code>a</code></sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub><code>a</code></sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub><code>a</code></sub>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub><code>a</code></sub></td>

<p>
The square-and-multiply algorithm is useful
for computing <var>M</var><sub>kernel</sub>,
the matrix for the uncompressed kernel,
because the kernel is a string of repeated bytes.
To produce a CRC-32 checksum value from a matrix,
multiply the matrix by the zero vector.
(The zero vector in homogeneous coordinates, that is:
32&nbsp;0's followed by a&nbsp;1.
Here we omit the minor complication of pre- and post-conditioning the checksum.)
To compute the checksum for every file, we work backwards.
Start by initializing <var>M</var>&nbsp;:=&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub>kernel</sub>.
The checksum of the kernel is also the checksum
of the final file, file&nbsp;<var>N</var>,
so multiply <var>M</var> by the zero vector and store the resulting checksum in
CDH<sub><var>N</var></sub> and LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub>.
The file data of file&nbsp;<var>N</var>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 is the same as the file data of file&nbsp;<var>N</var>,
but with an added prefix of LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub>.
So compute <var>M</var><sub>LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub></sub>,
the state change matrix for LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub>,
and update <var>M</var>&nbsp;:=&nbsp;<var>M</var>&nbsp;<var>M</var><sub>LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub></sub>.
Now <var>M</var> represents the cumulative state change from processing
LFH<sub><var>N</var></sub> followed by the kernel.
Compute the checksum for file <var>N</var>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 by again multiplying <var>M</var> by the zero vector.
Continue the procedure, accumulating state change matrices into <var>M</var>,
until all the files have been processed.
</p>

<!--
<p>
The <a href=#source>source code</a> employs an additional
optimization on top of the conceptual scheme outlined in the previous paragraph.
Instead of updating
<var>M</var> := <var>M</var> <var>M</var><sub>LFH<sub><var>i</var></sub></sub>
after each file, we update
<var>M</var> := <var>M</var> (<var>M</var><sub>0</sub>)<sup>|LFH<sub><var>i</var></sub>|</sup>,
where |LFH<sub><var>i</var></sub>|
is the size of LFH<sub><var>i</var></sub> in bytes.

<h2>Extension: Zip64</h2>

<p>
<a href="#allocation">Earlier</a> we hit a wall on expansion
due to limits of the zip format—it was impossible
to produce more than about 281&nbsp;TB of output,
no matter how cleverly packed the zip file.
It is possible to surpass those limits
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)#ZIP64">Zip64</a>,
an extension to the zip format that increases
the size of certain header fields to 64&nbsp;bits.
Support for Zip64 is <a href="#compatibility">by no means universal</a>,
but it is one of the more commonly implemented extensions.
As regards the compression ratio,
the effect of Zip64 is to
increase the size of a central directory header from
46&nbsp;bytes to 58&nbsp;bytes,
and the size of a local directory header from
30&nbsp;bytes to 50&nbsp;bytes.
Referring to
<a href="#eq-S_X_N_OPT">the formula</a>
for optimal expansion in the simplified model,
we see that a zip bomb in Zip64 format
still grows quadratically,
but more slowly because of the larger denominator—this
is visible in
<a href="#zipped_size">the figure below</a>
in the Zip64 line's
slightly lower vertical placement.
In exchange for the loss of compatibility
and slower growth,
we get the removal of all practical file size limits.
</p>

<p>
Suppose we want a zip bomb that expands to
<data value="4507981343026016">4.5&nbsp;<abbr title="petabyte">PB</abbr></data>,
the same size that 42.zip recursively expands to.
How big must the zip file be?
Using binary search, we find that the smallest
zip file whose unzipped size exceeds the unzipped size of 42.zip
has a zipped size of
<data value="45876952">46&nbsp;<abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr></data>.

<p>
4.5&nbsp;<abbr title="petabyte">PB</abbr> is roughly
the size of the data captured by the Event Horizon Telescope

stacks and stacks of hard drives.
</p>

<p>
With Zip64, it's no longer practically interesting to
consider the maximum compression ratio,
because we can just keep increasing the zip file size,
and the compression ratio along with it,
until even the compressed zip file is prohibitively large.
An interesting threshold, though,
is
<data value="18446744073709551616">2<sup>64</sup>&nbsp;bytes</data>
(<data value="18446744073709551616">18&nbsp;<abbr title="exabyte">EB</abbr></data> or
<data value="18446744073709551616">16&nbsp;<abbr title="exbibyte">EiB</abbr></data>)—that
much data
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Limits">will not fit on most filesystems</a>.
Binary search finds the smallest zip bomb that produces at least that much output:
it contains <data value="12056313">12&nbsp;million</data> files
and has a compressed kernel of <data value="1482284040">1.5&nbsp;<abbr title="gigabyte">GB</abbr></data>.
The total size of the zip file is
<data value="2961656712">2.9&nbsp;<abbr title="gigabyte">GB</abbr></data>
and it unzips to
<data value="18446744085437447493">2<sup>64</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;11 727 895 877 bytes</data>,
having a compression ratio of over <data value="6228522033.190134">6.2&nbsp;billion</data>.
I&nbsp;didn't make this one downloadable,
but you can generate it yourself using the <a href="#source">source code</a>.
It contains files so large that it uncovers

<h2>Extension: bzip2</h2>



<p>
DEFLATE is the most common compression algorithm
used in the zip format, but it is only one of many options.
Probably the second most common algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2">bzip2</a>,
while not as compatible as DEFLATE,
is probably the second most commonly supported compression algorithm.
Empirically, bzip2 has a maximum compression ratio of about 1.4&nbsp;million,
which allows for denser packing of the kernel.
Ignoring the loss of compatibility,
does bzip2 enable a more efficient zip bomb?
</p>

<p>
Yes—but only for small files.
The problem is that bzip2 does not have anything like the
<a href="#quote">non-compressed blocks</a> of DEFLATE
that we used to <a href="#quote">quote local file headers</a>.
So it is not possible to overlap files and reuse the kernel—each file must have
its own copy, and therefore the overall compression ratio
is no better than the ratio of any single file.
In <a href="#zipped_size">the figure</a> we see that
no-overlap bzip2 outperforms quoted DEFLATE
only for files under about a megabyte.
</p>

<p>
There is still hope for using bzip2—an
alternative means of local file header quoting
discussed in <a href="#extra">the next section</a>.
Additionally,
if you happen to know that a certain zip parser supports bzip2
<em>and</em> tolerates mismatched filenames,
then you can use the <a href="#overlap">full-overlap construction</a>,
which has no need for quoting.

Each construction is shown with and without Zip64.
The no-overlap constructions
have a linear rate of growth,
which is visible in the 1:1 slope of the lines.
The vertical offset of the bzip2 lines shows that the compression ratio
of bzip2 is about a thousand times greater than that of DEFLATE.
The quoted-DEFLATE constructions
have a quadratic rate of growth,
as evidenced by the 2:1 slope of the lines.
The Zip64 variant is slightly less efficient,
but permits output in excess of 281&nbsp;TB.
The lines for extra-field-quoted bzip2
transition from quadratic to linear
upon reaching either the maximum file size
(<data value="65534">2<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;2 bytes</data>),
or the maximum number of files allowed by extra-field quoting.

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>
In related work,
<a href="http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/index.htm#SAR-PR-2006-04">Plötz et&nbsp;al.</a>
used overlapping files to create a
near-self-replicating zip file.
Gynvael Coldwind
has <a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=682">previously suggested</a> (slide&nbsp;47)
overlapping files.
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions/presentation/pellegrino">Pellegrino et&nbsp;al.</a>
found systems vulnerable to compression bombs
and other resource exhaustion attacks
and listed common pitfalls in specification,
implementation, and configuration.
</p>

<p>
We have designed the quoted-overlap zip bomb construction for compatibility,
taking into consideration a number of implementation differences,
some of which are shown in <a href="#compatibility">the table below</a>.
The resulting construction is compatible with zip parsers that work
in the usual back-to-front way,
first consulting the central directory
and using it as an index of files.
Among these is the example
zip parser included in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/bangert">Nail</a>,
which is automatically generated from a formal grammar.
The construction is not compatible, however,
with "streaming" parsers,
those that parse the zip file from beginning to end in one pass
without first reading the central directory.
By their nature, streaming parsers
do not permit any kind of file overlapping.
The most likely outcome is that they
will extract only the first file.
They may even raise an error besides,
as is the case with <a href="https://github.com/madler/sunzip">sunzip</a>,
which parses the central directory at the end and checks it for consistency
with the local file headers it has already seen.
</p>

<p>
If you need the extracted files to start with a certain prefix
(so that they will be identified as a certain file type, for example),
you can insert a data-carrying DEFLATE block just before the
block that quotes the next header.
Not every file has to participate in the bomb construction:
you can include ordinary files
alongside the bomb files
if you need the zip file to conform to some higher-level format.
(The <a href="#source">source code</a> has a <code>--template</code>
option to facilitate this use case.)
Many file formats use zip as a container;
examples are Java JAR, Android APK, and LibreOffice documents.
</p>

<p id="pdf">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF">PDF</a>
is in many ways similar to zip.
It has a cross-reference table at the end of the file
that points to objects earlier in the file,
and it supports DEFLATE compression of objects through
the FlateDecode filter.
Didier Stevens
<a href="https://blog.didierstevens.com/2008/05/19/pdf-stream-objects/">writes</a>
about having contained a 1&nbsp;GB stream inside a
<data value="2642">2.6&nbsp;kB</data> PDF file
by stacking FlateDecode filters.
If a PDF parser limits the amount of stacking,
then it is probably possible to use the DEFLATE quoting idea
to overlap PDF objects.
</p>



<p id="mitigation">
Detecting the specific class of zip bomb we have developed in this article is easy:
look for overlapping files.
Mark Adler has written <a href="https://github.com/madler/unzip/commits/6519bf0f8a896851d9708da11e1b63c818238c8f">a patch</a>
for Info-ZIP UnZip that does just that.

-->
In general, though, rejecting overlapping files
does not by itself make it safe to handle untrusted zip files.
There are zip bombs that do not rely on overlapping files,
and there are malicious zip files that are not bombs.
Furthermore, any such detection logic must
be implemented inside the parser itself,
not as a separate prefilter.
One of the details
omitted from <a href="#zip">the description of the zip format</a> is that
there is no single well-defined algorithm for locating
the central directory in a zip file:
two parsers may find two different central directories
and therefore
<a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=682">may not even agree on what files a zip file contains</a>
(slides 67–80).
Predicting the total uncompressed size
by summing the sizes of all files
does not work, in general,
because the sizes stored in metadata
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions/presentation/pellegrino">may not match</a>
(§4.2.2)
the actual uncompressed sizes.
(See the "permits too-short file size" row in <a href="#compatibility">the compatibility table</a>.)
Robust protection against zip bombs
involves sandboxing the parser to limit
its use of time, memory, and disk space—just
as if you were processing image files,
or any other complex file format prone to parser bugs.

zblg.zip renamed to zblg.odt or zblg.docx

It does eventually finish, and it deletes

I tried the zip bombs against a local installation of addons-server,
which is part of the software behind addons.mozilla.org.
The system handles it gracefully,
imposing a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/blob/2019.06.06/src/olympia/lib/settings_base.py#L1457-L1458">time limit</a>

The zip bomb expands as fast as the disk will let it up to the time limit,
but after that point the process is killed and the unzipped files
are eventually automatically cleaned up.

for UnZip to detect this class of zip bomb.
</p>
<p>
<time>2019-07-05</time>:
I noticed that <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13232">CVE-2019-13232</a>
was assigned for UnZip.
Personally, I would dispute that UnZip's (or any zip parser's)
ability to process a zip bomb of the kind discussed here
necessarily represents a security vulnerability, or even a bug.
It's a natural implementation and does not violate the specification
in any way that I can tell.
The type discussed in this article is only one type of zip bomb,
and there are many ways in which zip parsing can go wrong that are not bombs.
If you want to defend against resource exhaustion attacks,
you should <em>not</em> try to enumerate, detect, and block
every individual known attack;
rather you should impose external limits on time and other resources
so that the parser cannot misbehave too much,
no matter what kind of attack it faces.
There is nothing wrong with attempting to detect and reject certain
constructions as a first-pass optimization,
but you can't stop there.
If you do not eventually isolate and limit
operations on untrusted data, your system is likely still vulnerable.
Consider an analogy with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site scripting</a> in HTML:
the right defense is not to try and filter out bytes that may be interpreted as code,
it's to escape everything properly.

<a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1140748#c2">not to do anything</a>
about CVE-2019-13232.
I think both Debian's and SUSE's choices are defensible.

Shortly after the publication of this article,
Joran Dirk Greef published a
<a href="https://github.com/ronomon/zip">restrictive zip parser</a> (JavaScript)
that prohibits irregularities such as overlapping files
or unused space between files.
While it may thereby reject certain valid zip files,
the idea is to ensure that any downstream parsers
will receive only clean, easy-to-parse files.

Overall, it seems that malware scanners have slowly begun
to recognize zip bombs of this kind
(or at least the specific samples available for download)
as malicious.
It would be interesting to see whether the detection is robust or brittle.
You could reverse the order of the entries in the central directory, for example,
and see whether the zip files are still detected.
In the <a href="#source">source code</a>,
there's a recipe for generating zbsm.extra.zip,
which is like zbsm.zip except that it uses
<a href="#extra">extra-field quoting</a> instead of
<a href="#quote">DEFLATE quoting</a>—if you are a customer
of an AV service that detects zbsm.zip but not zbsm.extra.zip,
you should ask for an explanation.
Another simple variant is
<a href="https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/spacer.txt">inserting spacer files between the bomb files</a>,
which may fool certain overlap-detection algorithms.

    <p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/karpathy/unnamed.webp" alt="unnamed"></p>
<p>2025 has been a strong and eventful year of progress in LLMs. The following is a list of personally notable and mildly surprising "paradigm changes" - things that altered the landscape and stood out to me conceptually.</p>
<h3 id="1-reinforcement-learning-from-verifiable-rewards-rlvr">1. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)</h3><p>At the start of 2025, the LLM production stack in all labs looked something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pretraining (GPT-2/3 of ~2020)</li>
<li>Supervised Finetuning (InstructGPT ~2022) and</li>
<li>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF ~2022)</li>
</ol>
<p>This was the stable and proven recipe for training a production-grade LLM for a while. In 2025, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerged as the de facto new major stage to add to this mix. By training LLMs against automatically verifiable rewards across a number of environments (e.g. think math/code puzzles), the LLMs spontaneously develop strategies that look like "reasoning" to humans - they learn to break down problem solving into intermediate calculations and they learn a number of problem solving strategies for going back and forth to figure things out (see DeepSeek R1 paper for examples). These strategies would have been very difficult to achieve in the previous paradigms because it's not clear what the optimal reasoning traces and recoveries look like for the LLM - it has to find what works for it, via the optimization against rewards.</p>
<p>Unlike the SFT and RLHF stage, which are both relatively thin/short stages (minor finetunes computationally), RLVR involves training against objective (non-gameable) reward functions which allows for a lot longer optimization. Running RLVR turned out to offer high capability/$, which gobbled up the compute that was originally intended for pretraining. Therefore, most of the capability progress of 2025 was defined by the LLM labs chewing through the overhang of this new stage and overall we saw ~similar sized LLMs but a lot longer RL runs. Also unique to this new stage, we got a whole new knob (and and associated scaling law) to control capability as a function of test time compute by generating longer reasoning traces and increasing "thinking time". OpenAI o1 (late 2024) was the very first demonstration of an RLVR model, but the o3 release (early 2025) was the obvious point of inflection where you could intuitively feel the difference.</p>
<h3 id="2-ghosts-vs-animals-jagged-intelligence">2. Ghosts vs. Animals / Jagged Intelligence</h3><p>2025 is where I (and I think the rest of the industry also) first started to internalize the "shape" of LLM intelligence in a more intuitive sense. We're not "evolving/growing animals", we are "summoning ghosts". Everything about the LLM stack is different (neural architecture, training data, training algorithms, and especially optimization pressure) so it should be no surprise that we are getting very different entities in the intelligence space, which are inappropriate to think about through an animal lens. Supervision bits-wise, human neural nets are optimized for survival of a tribe in the jungle but LLM neural nets are optimized for imitating humanity's text, collecting rewards in math puzzles, and getting that upvote from a human on the LM Arena. As verifiable domains allow for RLVR, LLMs "spike" in capability in the vicinity of these domains and overall display amusingly jagged performance characteristics - they are at the same time a genius polymath and a confused and cognitively challenged grade schooler, seconds away from getting tricked by a jailbreak to exfiltrate your data.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/karpathy/g6zymj4a0amnjkj.webp" alt="G6zymj4a0AMNJkJ">(human intelligence: blue, AI intelligence: red. I like this version of the meme (I'm sorry I lost the reference to its original post on X) for pointing out that human intelligence is also jagged in its own different way.)</p>
<p>Related to all this is my general apathy and loss of trust in benchmarks in 2025. The core issue is that benchmarks are almost by construction verifiable environments and are therefore immediately susceptible to RLVR and weaker forms of it via synthetic data generation. In the typical benchmaxxing process, teams in LLM labs inevitably construct environments adjacent to little pockets of the embedding space occupied by benchmarks and grow jaggies to cover them. Training on the test set is a new art form.</p>
<p>What does it look like to crush all the benchmarks but still not get AGI?</p>
<p>I have written a lot more on the topic of this section here:</p>

<h3 id="3-cursor-new-layer-of-llm-apps">3. Cursor / new layer of LLM apps</h3><p>What I find most notable about Cursor (other than its meteoric rise this year) is that it convincingly revealed a new layer of an "LLM app" - people started to talk about "Cursor for X". As I highlighted in my Y Combinator talk this year (<a href="https://www.donnamagi.com/articles/karpathy-yc-talk">transcript</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ">video</a>), LLM apps like Cursor bundle and orchestrate LLM calls for specific verticals:</p>
<ol>
<li>They do the "context engineering"</li>
<li>They orchestrate multiple LLM calls under the hood strung into increasingly more complex DAGs, carefully balancing performance and cost tradeoffs.</li>
<li>They provide an application-specific GUI for the human in the loop</li>
<li>They offer an "autonomy slider"</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of chatter has been spent in 2025 on how "thick" this new app layer is. Will the LLM labs capture all applications or are there green pastures for LLM apps? Personally I suspect that LLM labs will trend to graduate the generally capable college student, but LLM apps will organize, finetune and actually animate teams of them into deployed professionals in specific verticals by supplying private data, sensors and actuators and feedback loops.</p>
<h3 id="4-claude-code-ai-that-lives-on-your-computer">4. Claude Code / AI that lives on your computer</h3><p>Claude Code (CC) emerged as the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like - something that in a loopy way strings together tool use and reasoning for extended problem solving. In addition, CC is notable to me in that it runs on your computer and with your private environment, data and context. I think OpenAI got this wrong because they focused their early codex / agent efforts on cloud deployments in containers orchestrated from ChatGPT instead of simply <code>localhost</code>. And while agent swarms running in the cloud feels like the "AGI endgame", we live in an intermediate and slow enough takeoff world of jagged capabilities that it makes more sense to run the agents directly on the developer's computer. Note that the primary distinction that matters is not about where the "AI ops" happen to run (in the cloud, locally or whatever), but about everything else - the already-existing and booted up computer, its installation, context, data, secrets, configuration, and the low-latency interaction. Anthropic got this order of precedence correct and packaged CC into a delightful, minimal CLI form factor that changed what AI looks like - it's not just a website you go to like Google, it's a little spirit/ghost that "lives" on your computer. This is a new, distinct paradigm of interaction with an AI.</p>
<h3 id="5-vibe-coding">5. Vibe coding</h3><p>2025 is the year that AI crossed a capability threshold necessary to build all kinds of impressive programs simply via English, forgetting that the code even exists. Amusingly, I coined the term "vibe coding" in <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">this shower of thoughts tweet</a> totally oblivious to how far it would go :). With vibe coding, programming is not strictly reserved for highly trained professionals, it is something anyone can do. In this capacity, it is yet another example of what I wrote about in <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/power-to-the-people/">Power to the people: How LLMs flip the script on technology diffusion</a>, on how (in sharp contrast to all other technology so far) regular people benefit a lot more from LLMs compared to professionals, corporations and governments. But not only does vibe coding empower regular people to approach programming, it empowers trained professionals to write a lot more (vibe coded) software that would otherwise never be written. In nanochat, I vibe coded my own custom highly efficient BPE tokenizer in Rust instead of having to adopt existing libraries or learn Rust at that level. I vibe coded many projects this year as quick app demos of something I wanted to exist (e.g. see <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/vibe-coding-menugen">menugen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council">llm-council</a>, <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/reader3">reader3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/hn-time-capsule">HN time capsule</a>). And I've vibe coded entire ephemeral apps just to find a single bug because why not - code is suddenly free, ephemeral, malleable, discardable after single use. Vibe coding will terraform software and alter job descriptions.</p>
<h3 id="6-nano-banana-llm-gui">6. Nano banana / LLM GUI</h3><p>Google Gemini Nano banana is one of the most incredible, paradigm-shifting models of 2025. In my world view, LLMs are the next major computing paradigm similar to computers of the 1970s, 80s, etc. Therefore, we are going to see similar kinds of innovations for fundamentally similar kinds of reasons. We're going to see equivalents of personal computing, of microcontrollers (cognitive core), or internet (of agents), etc etc. In particular, in terms of the UIUX, "chatting" with LLMs is a bit like issuing commands to a computer console in the 1980s. Text is the raw/favored data representation for computers (and LLMs), but it is not the favored format for people, especially at the input. People actually dislike reading text - it is slow and effortful. Instead, people love to consume information visually and spatially and this is why the GUI has been invented in traditional computing. In the same way, LLMs should speak to us in our favored format - in images, infographics, slides, whiteboards, animations/videos, web apps, etc. The early and present version of this of course are things like emoji and Markdown, which are ways to "dress up" and lay out text visually for easier consumption with titles, bold, italics, lists, tables, etc. But who is actually going to build the LLM GUI? In this world view, nano banana is a first early hint of what that might look like. And importantly, one notable aspect of it is that it's not just about the image generation itself, it's about the joint capability coming from text generation, image generation and world knowledge, all tangled up in the model weights.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>. 2025 was an exciting and mildly surprising year of LLMs. LLMs are emerging as a new kind of intelligence, simultaneously a lot smarter than I expected and a lot dumber than I expected. In any case they are extremely useful and I don't think the industry has realized anywhere near 10% of their potential even at present capability. Meanwhile, there are so many ideas to try and conceptually the field feels wide open. And as I mentioned on my <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy">Dwarkesh pod</a> earlier this year, I simultaneously (and on the surface paradoxically) believe that we will both see rapid and continued progress <em>and</em> that yet there is a lot of work to be done. Strap in.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>A few days ago, consumer products company iRobot, the maker of iconic Roomba automated vacuum cleaner, </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/roomba-dream-home-robotics/685293/" rel="">declared bankruptcy</a><span>. The CEO, a branding and mergers expert named </span><a href="https://investor.irobot.com/board-member/gary-cohen" rel="">Gary Cohen</a><span>, sadly announced that the firm could not continue as a going concern. </span></p><p>The board, full of lawyers and financiers but not robotics experts, voted to sell iRobot off to Shenzhen Picea Robotics, the Chinese company to which it had offshored manufacturing. There are about 20 million active Roomba vacuum cleaners in operation, and unless Trump regulators or antitrust enforcers act, now all the data harvested from our homes will go to China.</p><p><span>The co-founder of iRobot, Colin Angle, was not introspective about this collapse, nor did he associate it within the broader context of the many firms who have had their technology transferred to China. Instead, he, like much of Wall Street, </span><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/irobot-co-founder-says-ftcs-opposition-amazon-deal-wrong-minded-following-bankruptcy-filing" rel="">blamed</a><span> the bankruptcy on Lina Khan. Why? Well she ran the Federal Trade Commission when it investigated Amazon’s possible acquisition of the company in 2022, a deal the two companies ultimately called off. Here’s Angle:</span></p><blockquote><p>“I bet if you asked almost anyone prior to the blocking of the deal with iRobot: Would you rather see iRobot innovating like crazy, coming out with new and better robots for your home, or would you like to see it file for Chapter 11 in the process of being sold to a Chinese manufacturer?” he said. “The wrong thing probably happened.”</p></blockquote><p>Many Wall Street dealmakers and foes of antitrust enforcement echoed this sentiment. For instance, former Obama chief economist Jason Furman, who is now the Aetna Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy at Harvard, used it as an example of the problem with populist economics. Blocking mergers, he believes, leads to destructive outcomes and national security problems.</p><a href="https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/2000680885234925896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="Twitter2ToDOM"><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/2000680885234925896&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Regulators in the United States &amp;amp; Europe blocked Amazon's bid to acquire iRobot.\n\niRobot has not filed for bankruptcy and will be acquired by its main creditor, a Chinese company.\n\nThis is not a good outcome from the perspective of consumers, competition or the national interest.&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;jasonfurman&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jason Furman&quot;,&quot;profile_image_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-12-15T21:34:28.000Z&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;reply_count&quot;:0,&quot;retweet_count&quot;:36,&quot;like_count&quot;:347,&quot;impression_count&quot;:0,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:null,&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false}"><div><div title="User"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_40,h_40,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 40w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 80w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_120,h_120,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 120w" sizes="40px"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_40,h_40,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png" sizes="40px" alt="X avatar for @jasonfurman" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_40,h_40,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 40w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 80w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_120,h_120,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 120w" width="40" height="40" draggable="false"></picture></div><p><span>Jason Furman</span><span>@jasonfurman</span></p><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px;" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-width="1.8" stroke="#000" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path stroke="none" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M13.2879 19.1666L8.66337 12.575L2.87405 19.1666H0.424805L7.57674 11.0258L0.424805 0.833252H6.71309L11.0717 7.04577L16.5327 0.833252H18.982L12.1619 8.59699L19.5762 19.1666H13.2879ZM16.0154 17.3083H14.3665L3.93176 2.69159H5.58092L9.7601 8.54422L10.4828 9.55981L16.0154 17.3083Z"></path></g></svg></div><p>Regulators in the United States &amp; Europe blocked Amazon's bid to acquire iRobot.

iRobot has not filed for bankruptcy and will be acquired by its main creditor, a Chinese company.

This is not a good outcome from the perspective of consumers, competition or the national interest.</p><div><p><span>9:34 PM · Dec 15, 2025</span></p><p><span>36 Reposts</span><span> · </span><span>347 Likes</span></p></div></div></a><p>So is Furman right? This critique matters, because the goal here is to return to the economic statecraft of Bush and Obama, a time when the consensus was that concentrating capital would generate positive outcomes, while restraints on capital would hinder growth. The modest burst of populism around antitrust under Joe Biden deeply shook Furman. With iRobot’s bankruptcy, there is now an opportunity to make the claim that any attempt to restrain Wall Street is a mistake. So what exactly happened with iRobot? And what kinds of lessons should we draw? </p><p><span>I first came upon iRobot years before the Amazon merger, when I edited a </span><a href="https://www.promarket.org/2021/01/28/wall-street-danger-national-security-roomba-hedge-fund/" rel="">piece</a><span> by defense analyst Lucas Kunce on Wall Street and national security. I had gotten interested in the collapse of the defense base, a crisis which is now widely discussed, but at the time wasn’t well-understood. Part of that collapse was a result of a phenomenon where financiers would force technology companies to stop innovating.</span></p><p>iRobot fit perfectly in that story. I watched a 2017 hearing in the House Armed Services Committee where a former Vice Admiral for the Navy, Joe Dyer, testified. After leaving the Navy, Dyer worked in operations at the robotics firm, when the company was far more than a consumer firm focused on importing automated cleaning tools from China. Here’s Kunce:</p><blockquote><p><span>iRobot, which started in 1990 as a spinoff of MIT, was founded by three experts in robotics, artificial intelligence, and man-machine interface. In 1998, the company got </span><a href="http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/Company-Information/History.aspx" rel="">a grant</a><span> from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/5-inventions-darpa-gps-irobot-roomba-internet-2017-5" rel="">the government agency that financed the creation of the internet, SIRI, the predecessor to GPS, and other conveniences of modern life</a><span>. Their mission was to build an advanced robot that eventually came to be known as the PackBot. Packbot helped search the rubble after 9/11 and aided US troops in clearing mines in Iraq and Afghanistan. iRobot’s robotic technology has gone to Mars on rovers and was deployed in the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown to measure radioactivity. Its iRobot Seaglider was used to peer underwater after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.</span></p><p><span>But iRobot no longer makes anything for the military. It now focuses, instead, on branding and manufacturing vacuum cleaners in </span><a href="https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2020/01/06/irobot-begins-manufacturing-operations-in-malaysia/28231/" rel="">China and Malaysia</a><span>. </span></p></blockquote><p>In the mid-2010s, during Furman’s tenure running economic policy under Obama, the company sold its defense business, offshored production, and slashed research, a result of pressure from financiers on Wall Street.</p><blockquote><p><span>An iRobot shareholder and former Goldman Sachs partner running a hedge fund called Red Mountain Capital, Willem Mesdag, sent </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1159167/000119312515392141/d24166dsc13da1.pdf" rel="">a letter</a><span> demanding that the company sell or shut down every part of its business that didn’t have to do with robots that clean things. </span></p><p><span>He demanded that the company slash its research budget, use the excess cash for dividends, and focus on branding and extending its near-monopoly in automated vacuum cleaners (68 percent of the global market share, according to Mesdag’s letter). Mesdag engaged in a proxy fight to wrest control of the company from its engineering founders, accusing one of its founders and iRobot Chairman Colin Angle of engaging in “egregious and abusive use of shareholder capital” for </span><a href="https://www.xconomy.com/boston/2015/01/27/after-12-years-of-roomba-irobot-eyes-startups-for-sector-growth/" rel="">investing in research</a><span>. </span></p><p>Research that, according to an iRobot spokesman, was intended “to spur innovation in robotics and robotics-related areas.” Mesdag argued that the money should have been used for share buybacks to boost the stock value instead of for research…</p><p>“In my trips to Wall Street,” Dyer told the panel, “one of my analyst friends took me to lunch one day and said, ‘Joe, you have to get iRobot out of the defense business. It’s killing your stock price.’ And I countered by saying ‘Well, what about the importance of DARPA and leading-edge technology? What about the stability that sometimes comes from the defense industry? What about patriotism?’ And his response was, ‘Joe, what is it about capitalism you don’t understand?’”</p></blockquote><p><span>This is a sad story, it’s also a common one. China has captured technology and key process leadership from American and European firms, across everything from rare earths to batteries to chemicals to robotics. And the driver is that the American model of running corporations is to focus on “asset light” cream-skimming, which is to say, </span><a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2021/08/the-value-of-nothing-capital-versus-growth/" rel="">focusing</a><span> on lines of business where the return on capital is exceptionally high. </span></p><p><span>Conversely, the Chinese government, to preserve and extend its particular authoritarian model, actually suppresses the return on capital for its financiers, forcing an “asset heavy” approach. They overly emphasize factories and engineering. The net effect of these two complementary forces used to be celebrated as “</span><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/5424112/The-trillion-dollar-question-China-or-America.html" rel="">Chimerica</a><span>,” where China produces and the U.S. consumes. </span></p><p>The consequence of this dynamic is the movement of production from America to China; iRobot is just one example out of many. But there’s another dynamic aside from trade, and that has to do with a peril of market power. Like a lot of firms with seeming dominance, such as Boeing and Intel, iRobot had a big market share, but its operational capacity degraded quickly as financiers forced the company to harvest its monopoly and add nothing back. Under a trade regime overseen by men like Furman, the company offshored production, thus teaching its future rivals in China how to make robot cleaners. </p><p>At any rate, by 2022, iRobot still had a dominant share of robot vacuum cleaners, but competition had become meaningful. </p><p><span>Enter Amazon. In the late 2010s and early 2020s, big tech firms were seeking to dominate the “smart home” market, as well as building out networks around the “internet of things” and cloud computing. Amazon was engaged in a roll-up of the smart home space. It had built out the Alexa audio device, and bought the Ring security/doorbell firm (which had acquired smart lighting firm </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/ring-acquires-smart-led-light-company-mr-beams/" rel="">Mr. Beams</a><span>), as well as the wifi firm Eero in 2019, and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22704290/amazon-blink-ring-camera-doorbell-brands-smart-home-why" rel="">video camera firm Blink</a><span>. It was a very expensive strategy; Ring was nearly bankrupt when Amazon overpaid for the company. According to the Wall Street Journal, between 2017 and 2021, Amazon </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/amazon-alexa-devices-echo-losses-strategy-25f2581a?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdfXRSaceVjg_5A9Lo_20Wf30Xh_EQyLk1MS7weaLCB8GO5ZiX2ruw8qOupjUk%3D&amp;gaa_ts=694423f0&amp;gaa_sig=4RIOPDy4JL9FJ44zG_mF-QV0SLfN0oBvr8AUTtS9cFI_Xf4cqCc15_p4o1s-DsvLe6PSAHWZWS766CRa7v_vDQ%3D%3D" rel="">lost</a><span> more than $25 billion in losses from its devices business.” </span></p><p><span>But Amazon continued. In 2022, it </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amazon-and-irobot-sign-an-agreement-for-amazon-to-acquire-irobot-301600720.html" rel="">announced</a><span> the acquisition of iRobot for $1.7 billion. This deal would seemingly solve iRobot’s problems stemming from a lack of research and production capacity. It would also make people very wealthy. Angle himself would </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1159167/000119312523220091/d496206ddefm14a.htm" rel="">receive</a><span> $14 million upon completion of the deal, and the entire executive team would be paid lavishly.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WO9I!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WO9I!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WO9I!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WO9I!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WO9I!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WO9I!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png" width="881" height="272" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:272,&quot;width&quot;:881,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:77178,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/181986493?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WO9I!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WO9I!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WO9I!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WO9I!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d8b346-fa24-4d55-af17-65331f9c3fa2_881x272.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Nevertheless, Amazon is a very powerful firm, so the FTC, as well as European enforcers, began an investigation. In late 2023, the Europeans issued a </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5990" rel="">preliminary statement of objections</a><span>, which isn’t a formal challenge but a note to Amazon suggesting there might be problems. The EU argued that Amazon might self-preference its robot vacuum cleaners on its ubiquitous marketplace, and thwart competition. </span></p><p><span>The FTC didn’t bring a challenge, but nevertheless, in 2024, Amazon and iRobot </span><a href="https://investor.irobot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-and-irobot-agree-terminate-pending-acquisition" rel="">called</a><span> off the deal. The FTC issued a vague statement announcing it was pleased with the end of the transaction. “The Commission’s probe focused on Amazon’s ability and incentive to favor its own products and disfavor rivals’,” it </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/statement-regarding-termination-amazons-proposed-acquisition-irobot" rel="">wrote</a><span>, “and associated effects on innovation, entry barriers, and consumer privacy. The Commission’s investigation revealed significant concerns about the transaction’s potential competitive effects.” </span></p><p>I don’t know what the FTC found, that’s confidential. But I spoke with a former employee of Ring and Latch who explained Amazon’s monopolization strategy. This person’s view is that Amazon wasn’t trying to dominate the robot vacuum cleaner market for its own sake, but as part of a much bigger plan. With Ring, Eero, Alexa, and iRobot devices, Amazon would have the largest network of consumer internet of things (IoT) devices in the world. Here’s what this person argued about this set of acquisitions:</p><blockquote><p>Amazon wanted Ring for Iotera, a company Ring acquired in late 2017. Iotera built a proprietary protocol for smart devices. Internally, it was known as RingNet, but now it is known as Amazon Sidewalk. Unlike Wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or Z-Wave, Sidewalk requires users to use the Alexa ecosystem. Amazon has grown its Sidewalk network via Alexa and Ring devices sold below cost and acquisitions of companies like Eero and soon, iRobot.</p></blockquote><p>As these devices can connect with each other, they would become the “basis of a physical network connecting devices and sensors all over the world.”  This argument isn’t speculation; my source was the first Ringnet/sidewalk product manager at Ring, directly responsible for integrating Iotera technology into Ring camera, Mr. Beams, and Ring Alarm. This person wrote strategy docs, organized legal/business requirements, and coordinated hardware and software development across all the different units. </p><p><span>There’s also a lot of public evidence.

Amazon is now selling </span><a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/3/amazon-invites-developers-to-test-sidewalk-and-build-the-next-billion-connected-devices" rel="">access</a><span> to Sidewalk to industrial customers, linking access to Sidewalk to its cloud computing service Amazon Web Services. In other words, Amazon was seeking to become the proprietary backbone for any industrial firm who wants to link a device with 90% of America, outside of cellular networks, and that could include maps of most homes and neighborhoods. Amazon spent $25 billion on its device network, and would have been perfectly happy to engage in self-preferencing and predatory pricing of iRobot products to further its aims. </span></p><p>After this acquisition, Amazon would add iRobot’s suite of products and IP to its own portfolio, as well as the rich network and stream of data. But such a merger likely wouldn’t have helped prevent national security problems or kept robotics capacity in the U.S. Amazon is known to be aggressive about ensuring that production happens in China, so it’s almost a certainty manufacturing would continue there, and Chinese firms would likely still come to dominate most non-U.S. and European markets. For Amazon, the goal was the network, not to make robots.</p><p><span>When the deal fell apart, Amazon </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/14/how-irobot-lost-its-way-home/" rel="">paid</a><span> iRobot a $94 million break-up fee, which could be significantly more than the cost of litigating a case, so it is clear the two firms thought the FTC could have challenged it and might have won. After the failed merger, Angle stepped down as CEO, but expressed optimism, saying that “iRobot now turns toward the future with a focus and commitment to continue building thoughtful robots and intelligent home innovations that make life better, and that our customers around the world love.”</span></p><p><span>In 2024, when the two firms decided not to move forward with the deal, iRobot hired a “turnaround” specialist named Gary Cohen to run iRobot. The Carlyle Group </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/carlyle-loses-over-100-million-on-soured-loan-to-roomba-maker" rel="">had lent</a><span> $200 million to iRobot to help the company get through the merger, and when that merger fell apart, it </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazons-abandoned-acquisition-leaves-irobot-carlyle-debt-straightjacket-2024-01-31/" rel="">ended</a><span> up taking nearly 80% of the breakup fee. </span></p><p>Could iRobot have continued as a viable firm? Well Angle publicly said it could, and iRobot executives almost certainly framed it that way to the FTC. Had iRobot truly been insolvent, they could have used a legal argument known as a “failing firm” defense, meaning explaining to regulators they would have gone out of business without a merger. But that would have likely caused Amazon to reduce the price it would have paid to shareholders, including, presumably, the golden parachutes going to the executive team of iRobot. </p><p>By 2025, the board likely concluded that iRobot could never get the high returns on capital that its board of financiers expected. The losing battle with Red Mountain Capital in 2016 had taught Angle not to build robots and innovative products, but to asset strip. When his company actually had to once again build, they threw in the towel. Carlyle sold the remaining debt at a loss to Shenzhen, which then seized the remaining branding and intellectual property. </p><p>There’s an interesting question about whether Shenzhen should be allowed to acquire iRobot, but which involves not only antitrust, but foreign acquisitions and national security. There is a government body that makes such decisions. It’s called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS. And CFIUS, which presumably allowed this acquistion, is led by… Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. </p><p>In other words, the story here is Wall Street destroying a promising robotics enterprise through financial engineering, aiding the Chinese in the process, and then demanding a bailout via amnesty from antitrust laws so that shareholders wouldn’t lose any money, while refusing to acknowledge that a key Trump ally of Wall Street facilitated the transfer of the firm to China.</p><p>Of course, this bad faith is routine. None of the critics of antitrust enforcement, including Furman, care if U.S. technology flows to China or if companies fail. They in fact celebrated offshoring when it happened to 90,000 manufacturing plants from 2000 onward, and they often make the point that failure is part of capitalism. But when it comes to one specific company, where they can cherry pick information to make a case against antitrust, well then, all of a sudden iRobot’s bankruptcy is a disaster. </p><p>All that said, there is an important lesson here for anti-monopolists. Antitrust is a useful tool, but it cannot substitute for a broader national economic development strategy. Right now, America, through a whole set of policy choices, from bailouts to government contracts to pro-speculation regulations to attacks on the rights of labor and creators, ensures that financiers get an unfairly high return on capital. We can see the consequences in everything from the collapse of iRobot to the destruction of America’s cattle herd to the erosion of capacity in Hollywood to the financialized AI data center build-out. The business of America right now is extraction, not creation.</p><p>To reverse this strategy, a more assertive antitrust regime is necessary, but it’s not enough. We also have to reduce the many other public levers of support for elevated returns on capital. Only then will it make sense for companies like iRobot to invest in robots instead of share buybacks. </p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

    <p>Hi friends and welcome to the last post for this year! Whenever someone asks me how to get started with reverse engineering, I always give the same advice: buy the cheapest IP camera you can find. These devices are self-contained little ecosystems - they have firmware you can extract, network protocols you can sniff, and mobile apps you can decompile. Chances are, you’ll find something interesting. At worst, you’ll learn a lot about assembly and embedded systems. At best, you’ll find some juicy vulnerability and maybe learn how to exploit it!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/header.jpg" alt="tp-link tapo c200"></p>
<p>I own several TP-Link Tapo C200 cameras myself. They’re cheap (less than 20 EUR from Italy), surprisingly stable, and I genuinely like them - they just work. One weekend, I decided just for fun to take my own advice. The Tapo C200 has been around for a while and has had <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-11936/product_id-83493/Tp-link-Tapo-C200-Firmware.html">a few CVEs</a> discovered and more or less patched over the years, so I honestly wasn’t expecting to find much in the latest firmware. However, I wanted to use this chance to perform some <strong>AI assisted reverse engineering</strong> and test whether I could still find anything at all.</p>
<p>I documented the entire process live on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.com/channels/1100085665766572142/1396102661257957396">Arcadia</a> - my thought process, the dead ends, the AI prompts that worked and the ones that didn’t. If you want the raw, unfiltered version with screenshots and videos of things crashing, go check that out.</p>
<p>This post is the cleaned-up version of that journey, where I wanted to show how I approach firmware analysis these days, now that we have AI. You will notice that in several instances I will be particularly lazy and delegate to AI things I could have done manually and/or inferred myself after some more work. Keep in mind that while I <em>am</em> generally lazy, this was also an experiment in integrating and documenting how effective AI can be for security research and reverse engineering, and especially in making them accessible to less experienced/sophisticated researchers/attackers.</p>
<p>What started as a lazy weekend project turned into finding a few security vulnerabilities that affect about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zoomeye.ai/searchResult?q=IlRQUkktREVWSUNFIg==">25,000 of these devices directly exposed on the internet</a>.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Old friend <a href="https://java-decompiler.github.io/" target="_blank">JD-GUI</a> to reverse the Android app and get a sense of things
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">The AWS CLI</a> to download the firmware image.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk" target="_blank">binwalk</a> for firmware inspection.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://grok.com/" target="_blank">Grok</a> to give a quick AI assisted look into prior research.   
    </li>
</ul>
</small></p><p>The first step is always obtaining the firmware binary file and this time it was super easy! After some <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2017/04/27/Android-Applications-Reversing-101/">basic reversing</a> of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tplink.iot&amp;hl=it">Tapo Android app</a>, I found out that TP-Link have their entire firmware repository in an open S3 bucket. No authentication required. So, you can list and download every version of every firmware they’ve ever released for any device they ever produced:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>$ aws s3 ls s3://download.tplinkcloud.com/ --no-sign-request --recursive</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/bucket_contents.txt">The entire output is here, for the curious</a>. This provides access to the firmware image of every TP-Link device - routers, cameras, smart plugs, you name it. A reverse engineer’s candy store.</p>
<p>I grabbed version <strong>1.4.2 Build 250313 Rel.40499n</strong> for the C200 (Hardware Revision 3), named <code>Tapo_C200v3_en_1.4.2_Build_250313_Rel.40499n_up_boot-signed_1747894968535.bin</code>, and started poking around. However, the first attempt at identifying its format via binwalk was not successful, indicating that some sort of encryption or obfuscation was in place.</p>
<p>And here is where I started using AI. I used Grok to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/i/grok/share/t9RzvgCRwIluVGnXMu39VVxDx">do some deep research</a> on how to decrypt the firmware for these cameras. Since I knew other hackers worked on this before, I delegated searching into hundreds of relevant web pages to the AI:</p>

<p>Loading Ghidra and giving a quick look at the <code>tp_manage</code> binary, revealed the first interesting thing:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/certs.webp" alt="tp_manage"></p>
<p>This private key is not generated at boot. Similarly to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1099">CVE-2025-1099 for the C500</a>, the C200 embeds in its firmware the private key that serves the SSL for a few APIs. If you’re on the same network as a camera, you can MitM and decrypt their HTTPS traffic with keys you extracted from the firmware image - without ever touching the hardware. For a <em>security</em> camera streaming video of people’s homes, this is… not ideal.</p>
<p>I kept loading the other interesting binaries and exploring them in Ghidra using AI to quickly get a sense of the main features and possible entry points for an attacker.</p>
<p><strong>Asking AI to explain a function</strong> and its relation to the other functions proved to be very useful for instance to understand encryption / obfuscation routines and network protocol handlers. This allows you to go from here:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/decompiled.webp" alt="decompiled"></p>
<p>To a higher level understanding that the AI can provide:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/udpcrc.webp" alt="udp crc"></p>
<p>Another technique I found particularly effective is asking the AI to analyze a given function of interest and <strong>rename its variables and parameters to something meaningful based on context</strong>. Then do the same for the functions it calls, recursively following the branches you’re interested in. After a few iterations, what started as <code>FUN_0042eb7c(undefined2 *param_1, undefined4 param_2, int param_3)</code> becomes <code>handleConnectAp(connection *conn, int flags, json *params)</code> - and suddenly the decompiled code reads almost like the original source. </p>
<p>This iterative refinement approach, which I find a great example of human-AI collaboration where neither alone would be as efficient, is how I mapped most of the HTTP handlers, discovery protocol, and so on. What follows is the bottom line of my findings. For more details on the process, refer to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.com/channels/1100085665766572142/1396102661257957396">the original Discord thread</a>.</p>
<p>As a side note, I did not investigate (much) the exploitability of the following bugs to achieve code execution, mostly because I’m not familiar with MIPS, and it was not my intent. You can however do it relatively easily once <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.hacefresko.com/posts/tp-link-tapo-c200-unauthenticated-rce">obtained a shell via physical access</a>, due to the presence of the <code>/bin/gdbserver</code> binary in the firmware.</p>

The problem is in how it parses SOAP XML requests.</p>
<p>When processing XML elements, the parser (<code>soap_parse_and_validate_request</code> at <code>0x0045ae8c</code>) calls <code>ds_parse</code> without any bounds checking on the number of elements or total memory allocation. Send it enough XML elements, and you’ll overflow allocated memory.</p>

<p>A test on one of the devices exposed on the internet:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/aps.png" alt="aps"></p>
<p>This is particularly concerning given the number of these devices exposed on the internet. An attacker can remotely enumerate WiFi networks in the camera’s vicinity, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSIDs</strong> of nearby networks</li>
<li><strong>BSSIDs</strong> (MAC addresses of access points)</li>
<li><strong>Signal strength</strong> (useful for triangulation)</li>
<li><strong>Security configurations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s where it gets worse: tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/darkosancanin/apple_bssid_locator">apple_bssid_locator</a> can query Apple’s location services API with a BSSID and return precise GPS coordinates.</p>
<p>This means an attacker can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find an exposed Tapo camera via services like ZoomEye, Shodan or similar indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>scanApList</code> to retrieve nearby WiFi BSSIDs</li>
<li>Query Apple’s location database with those BSSIDs</li>
<li><strong>Pinpoint the camera’s physical location to within a few meters</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Remote attackers can not only see what WiFi networks exist around a camera - they can determine exactly where that camera (and by extension, the home or business it’s monitoring) is located on a map.</p>

    <p><em>Timeline &amp; Responsible Disclosure</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Initial Contact:</strong> Upon discovering this vulnerability on <strong>October 15, 2025</strong>, I immediately reached out to security contacts at Avelo Airlines via email.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>October 16, 2025:</strong> The Avelo cybersecurity team responded quickly and professionally. We had productive email exchanges where I detailed the vulnerability, including the lack of last name verification and rate limiting on reservation endpoints.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>November 13, 2025:</strong> Avelo pushed a fix to production and notified me that the vulnerabilities were patched. I independently verified the fixes were in place before publication, and informed the Avelo team of my intention to write a technical blog post about this vulnerability, highlighting their cooperative and responsive approach to security disclosure.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Publication:</strong> November 20, 2025.</em></p>

<p><em>The Avelo team was responsive, professional, and took the findings seriously throughout the disclosure process. They acknowledged the severity, worked quickly to remediate the issues, and maintained clear communication. This is a model example of how organizations should handle security disclosures.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>After my <a href="https://coursetable.com/catalog?selectSeasons=202503&amp;searchText=akkad&amp;course-modal=202503-13154">9 AM Akkadian class</a>, I sat down to change my flight out of New Haven with Avelo Airlines, and noticed that my computer was making some unusual requests. After digging a little further, I stepped into a landmine of customer information exposure. In the wrong hands, this critical vulnerability could allow an attacker to access full reservation details, including PII, government ID numbers, and partial payment info, for every Avelo passenger, past and present.</p>

<p>Before I walk you through my work on that Tuesday morning, let’s establish how airlines generally manage their reservations.</p>

<h2 id="how-airline-logins-should-work">How Airline Logins <em>Should</em> Work</h2>

<p>Normally, to access a flight reservation (which often contains sensitive information like passport numbers, Known Traveler Numbers, and partial credit card data), you need at least two pieces of information: a <strong>confirmation code</strong> and the <strong>passenger’s last name</strong>.</p>

<p>This two-factor system is generally secure. The space of all 6-character alphanumeric confirmation codes combined with all possible last names is astronomically large, making it impossible to “guess” a valid pair.</p>

<p>But what if the last name check was missing?</p>

<p>Suddenly, the problem becomes much simpler. The <em>entire</em> keyspace an attacker needs to guess is just the confirmation code. In Avelo’s case, their codes are 6-character alphanumeric strings (<code>[A-Z0-9]</code>).</p>

<p>Let’s do the math:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Keyspace:</strong> 36 characters (26 letters + 10 digits)</li>
  <li><strong>Length:</strong> 6</li>
  <li><strong>Total Combinations:</strong> 36^6 = <strong>2,176,782,336</strong> (~2.18 billion)</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a big number, but it’s not “astronomically large.” It’s well within the reach of a modern brute-force attack.</p>

<h3 id="the-attack-timeline">The Attack Timeline</h3>

<p>How long would it take to try all 2.18 billion combinations? The time is just <code>2.18 billion / (requests per second)</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At <strong>1,000 req/s</strong> (a modest script): 2.18 million seconds, or <strong>~25 days</strong>.</li>
  <li>At <strong>10,000 req/s</strong> (a decent server): 218,000 seconds, or <strong>~2.5 days</strong>.</li>
  <li>At <strong>100,000 req/s</strong> (a small cluster of servers, costing $400-$700)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>: 21,800 seconds, or <strong>~6 hours</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If Avelo’s flight system has no rate limiting and doesn’t require a last name, an adversary could extract all passenger data in about 6 hours for less than a thousand dollars.</p>

<h3 id="even-faster-than-6-hours">Even Faster Than 6 Hours</h3>

<p>Even worse, they don’t need to run for 6 hours. With an estimated 8 million tickets sold, the “hit rate” is roughly <strong>1 in every 270 guesses</strong> (2.18B / 8M). An attacker would start getting valid PII back in <em>seconds</em>.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-the-story-finding-the-flaw">Back to the Story: Finding the Flaw</h2>

<p>This was all just theory until I looked at my network traffic. As I was changing my reservation, I saw a GET request to an API endpoint:</p>

<div><pre><code>https://www.aveloair.com/payment/services/reservation/{code}
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/assets/images/avelo-security/endpoint.png" alt="Screenshot of the reservation API endpoint"></p>

<p>The parameter at the end didn’t seem like a reservation code, but the response contained all relevant reservation data, so I decided to probe further. On a hunch, I swapped that token for my <em>actual</em> 6-character code and re-sent the request.</p>

<p><strong>Voila.</strong> The server responded with a massive JSON object containing my entire reservation.</p>

<p>This endpoint wasn’t asking for my last name. The only other security was a standard authentication cookie… but was that cookie tied to <em>my</em> reservation?</p>

<p>I quickly texted a friend for their old Avelo confirmation code. I plugged it into the URL, kept <em>my own cookie</em>, and hit send. But there was no way it could poss-</p>

<p><strong>It worked.</strong></p>

<p>I was looking at their full reservation. <strong>Any</strong> valid authentication cookie could be used to query <strong>any</strong> reservation, using only the 6-character code. The theoretical flaw was real.</p>

<h2 id="executing-the-attack-no-rate-limiting">Executing the Attack: No Rate Limiting</h2>

<p>The only remaining (partial) defense was rate-limiting. I wrote a quick multi-threaded Python script to generate random 6-character codes and hit the endpoint.</p>

<p>The requests flew. There was no WAF, no IP blocking, no CAPTCHA.</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/assets/images/avelo-security/validcodes.png" alt="Valid reservation codes being discovered">
<em>The script quickly finding valid reservation codes</em></p>

<p>Within minutes, my script was logging hundreds of valid reservations. Troves of data were being returned, including from passengers flying on government business with <code>@dot.gov</code> and <code>@faa.gov</code> email addresses.</p>

<p>A successful hit returned the <em>entire</em> reservation object. This was a complete data breach for each passenger – including myself!</p>

<p>(Note: During further testing, I discovered a similar vulnerability on a different reservation endpoint. I promptly notified the Avelo team, and they patched that endpoint as well before publication.)</p>

<h2 id="what-data-was-leaked">What Data Was Leaked?</h2>

<p>For every valid code, the API returned:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Full Passenger PII:</strong> <code>FullName</code>, <code>DateOfBirth</code>, <code>Gender</code></li>
  <li><strong>Government IDs:</strong> <code>IDDocuments.IDNumber</code> (this field contained Known Traveler Numbers (KNTs) and, in other cases, Passport Numbers)</li>
  <li><strong>Contact Info:</strong> phone numbers, email addresses</li>
  <li><strong>Full Itinerary:</strong> Flight numbers, dates, times, and <code>SeatLocation</code></li>
  <li><strong>Payment Details:</strong> <code>CardNumber</code> (masked: <code>************8</code>), <code>DateTimeExpiration</code>, and billing <code>Address.PostalCode</code></li>
  <li><strong>Vouchers:</strong> <code>PaymentInternals.AccountNumber</code> and <code>Amount.Value</code></li>
  <li><strong>PCI Data:</strong> <code>PaymentCards.TrackData</code> — This field seemed to contain partial magnetic-stripe data</li>
</ul>

  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="the-fallout">The Fallout</h2>

<p>This flaw was critical. An attacker could:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run the 6-hour brute-force attack to enumerate millions of valid passenger reservation codes (PNRs) — or simply run the script for a few minutes and start harvesting valid passenger data immediately</li>
  <li>Extract comprehensive PII including full names, dates of birth, contact information, flight itineraries, and government ID numbers (Known Traveler Numbers and passport numbers) for identity theft and fraud</li>
  <li>Access partial payment card data including last 4 digits, expiration dates, and billing zip codes</li>
  <li>View complete travel history and passenger boarding status</li>
  <li>Modify or cancel all Avelo passengers’ reservations, causing widespread travel disruption</li>
</ol>

<p>I immediately disclosed this to the Avelo team. They were responsive, professional, and took the findings seriously, patching the issues promptly.</p>

<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<p>This incident is a stark reminder of how critical simple security checks are. A single missing <code>lastName</code> check and an absent rate-limit configuration exposed millions of sensitive passenger records to trivial enumeration.</p>

<p><strong>For developers:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Always require multiple factors for accessing sensitive data (e.g., confirmation code + last name)</li>
  <li>Implement rate limiting on all enumerable endpoints</li>
  <li>Ensure authentication cookies are properly scoped to user sessions</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m glad we could get this fixed, and I hope this write-up helps other developers avoid similar pitfalls.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploum">Ploum</a> on 2025-12-19</p>
<p>You probably heard about the Wall Street Journal story where they had a snack-vending machine run by a chatbot created by Anthropic.</p>
<p>At first glance, it is funny and it looks like journalists doing their job criticising the AI industry. If you are curious, the video is there (requires JS).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-claude-ai-vending-machine-agent-b7e84e34">We Let AI Run Our Office Vending Machine. It Lost Hundreds of Dollars.(www.wsj.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But what appears to be journalism is, in fact, pure advertising. For both WSJ and Anthropic. Look at how WSJ journalists are presented as "world class", how no-subtle the Anthropic guy is when telling them they are the best and how the journalist blush at it. If you are taking the story at face value, you are failing for the trap which is simple: "AI is not really good but funny, we must improve it."</p>
<p>The first thing that blew my mind was how stupid the whole idea is. Think for one second. One full second. Why do you ever want to add a chatbot to a snack vending machine? The video states it clearly: the vending machine must be stocked by humans. Customers must order and take their snack by themselves. The AI has no value at all.</p>
<p>Automated snack vending machine is a solved problem since nearly a century. Why do you want to make your vending machine more expensive, more error-prone, more fragile and less efficient for your customers?</p>
<p>What this video is really doing is normalising the fact that "even if it is completely stupid, AI will be everywhere, get used to it!"</p>
<p>The Anthropic guy himself doesn’t seem to believe his own lies, to the point of making me uncomfortable. Toward the ends, he even tries to warn us: "Claude AI could run your business but you don’t want to come one day and see you have been locked out." At which the journalist adds, "Or has ordered 100 PlayStations."</p>
<p>And then he gives up:</p>
<p>"Well, the best you can do is probably prepare for that world."</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://ploum.net/files/prepareworld.png"><img alt="Still from the video where Anthropic’s employee says &quot;probably prepare for that world&quot;" src="https://ploum.net/files/prepareworld.png" width="450"></a>
<figcaption>Still from the video where Anthropic’s employee says "probably prepare for that world"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>None of the world class journalists seemed to care. They are probably too badly paid for that. I was astonished to see how proud they were, having spent literally hours chatting with a bot just to get a free coke, even queuing for the privilege of having a free coke. A coke that cost a few minutes of minimum-wage work.</p>
<p>So the whole thing is advertising a world where chatbots will be everywhere and where world-class workers will do long queue just to get a free soda.</p>
<p>And the best advice about it is that you should probably prepare for that world.</p>

<p>The Chinese government has signed off on the deal, which involves offloading a large chunk of TikTok to billionaire <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/tiktok-sale-done-oracle-silver-lake-buyers-1236454493/">right wing Trump ally Larry Ellison</a> (fresh off his acquisition of CBS), the private equity firm Silver Lake (which has broad global investments in Chinese and Israeli hyper-surveillance), and MGX (Abu Dhabi’s state investment firm), while still somehow having large investment involvement by the Chinese:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The new U.S. operations of TikTok will have three “managing investors” that will collectively own 45 percent of the company: Oracle Corporation, Silver Lake, and MGX. Another 5 percent will be owned by other new investors, 30.1 percent will be “held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9 percent will be retained by ByteDance.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s also a smattering 5% of investors that may or may not include folks like right wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch. It’s worth noting that none of this was really legal; the law technically stated that TikTok shouldn’t have been allowed to exist for much of this year. Everyone just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/822164/tiktok-deal-trump-china">looked the other way while Trump and his cronies repeatedly ignored deadlines and hammered away at the transfer</a>. </p>
<p>The deal purportedly involves “retraining the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,” but given you can’t trust any of the companies involved, the Trump administration, or what’s left of U.S. regulators, that means absolutely nothing. Oracle will be “overseeing data protection,” but that means nothing as well given Oracle is run by an authoritarian-enabling billionaire with a <a href="https://nationalcioreview.com/articles-insights/extra-bytes/oracle-pays-115m-to-settle-massive-privacy-lawsuit/">long history</a> of his own <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/class-action-against-oracle/">privacy abuses</a>.</p>
<p>Also, this seems to ignore that three years ago, during the Biden administration, it was already announced that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/08/18/oracle-now-reviewing-tiktok-algorithms-and-content-moderation-practices/">Oracle was overseeing TikTok’s algorithms and data protection</a>. It’s kinda weird that everyone seems to have forgotten that. This is all, more or less, what was already agreed to years ago. Just shifting around the ownership structure to give Trump and his friends a “win.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t subtle that the goal was always for Trump’s buddies to just basically steal a big ownership chunk of a Chinese short form video company that U.S. tech companies <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/31/facebook-hired-pr-firm-coordinated-anti-tiktok-campaign-to-spread-bogus-moral-panics/">couldn’t out innovate</a>. Offloading the company to his friends at Oracle and Walmart was Trump’s stated goal during the first administration, only thwarted <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/10/trump-oracles-dumb-tiktok-cronyism-falls-apart/">because he lost the 2020 election</a>. Everything else was decorative. </p>
<p>You might recall that Democrats made a point to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/15/a-tiktok-ban-is-a-pointless-political-turd-for-democrats/">join forces with Republicans during election season</a> in support of a ban unless a big chunk of ownership was divested. Now that it’s happened, it’s basically shifting ownership of TikTok to a huge chunk of Trump’s authoritarian allies, while somehow still maintaining the supposed problematic tethers to the Chinese? Impressive. Great job. </p>
<p>You might also recall that folks like Brendan Carr spent literally <strong>years</strong> whining about the propaganda, privacy, and surveillance threats posed by TikTok. And their solution was ultimately just to shift a small part of ownership over to Trump’s autocratic buddies <em>while still retaining Chinese involvement</em>. Now, with the problem <strong>made worse</strong>, you can easily assume that Carr <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/11/02/fcc-commissioner-brendan-carr-still-doesnt-understand-that-banning-tiktok-doesnt-fix-the-actual-problem/">will probably never mention the threat again</a>. </p>
<p>Republicans obviously take majority responsibility for this turd of a deal and the corrupt shifting of TikTok ownership to Trump’s buddies. But <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/20/the-tiktok-ban-continues-to-be-one-of-the-biggest-turds-in-tech-policy-history/">it can’t be overstated what an own-goal supporting this whole dumb thing was for Democrats</a>, who not only helped Trump’s friends steal partial ownership of TikTok, they saber-rattled over a ban during an election season where they desperately needed young people to vote. </p>
<p>As I’ve <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/20/the-tiktok-ban-continues-to-be-one-of-the-biggest-turds-in-tech-policy-history/">spent years arguing</a>, if these folks were all so concerned about U.S. consumer privacy, they should have passed a functional modern internet privacy law applying to all U.S. companies and their executives. </p>
<p>If they cared about propaganda, they could have fought media consolidation, backed creative media literacy reform in schools, or found new ways to fund independent journalism. </p>
<p>If they cared about national security, they wouldn’t have helped elect a New York City real estate conman sex pest President, and they certainly wouldn’t have <em>actively aided his cronyism</em>. </p>
<p>This was never about addressing privacy, propaganda, or national security. It was always about the U.S. stealing ownership of one of the most popular and successful short form video apps in history because companies like Facebook were <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/31/facebook-hired-pr-firm-coordinated-anti-tiktok-campaign-to-spread-bogus-moral-panics/">too innovatively incompetent to dethrone them</a> in the open market. Ultimately this bipartisan accomplishment not only makes everything worse, it demonstrates we’re absolutely no better than the countries we criticize.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://graphite.com/blog/graphite-joins-cursor">https://graphite.com/blog/graphite-joins-cursor</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46327325">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I’m thrilled to announce that Graphite has signed a definitive agreement to join <a target="_blank" href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a>. This deal brings together the best-in-class tools for creating, reviewing, and merging code in the age of AI. Graphite will continue to operate as an independent product, now with even greater resources to help our customers ship faster.</p><h3 id="defining-the-new-developer-toolchain">Defining the new developer toolchain</h3><p>Tomas, Greg, and I started building Graphite almost five years ago because the world’s best engineering teams demanded a better code review platform. What we never expected was how dramatically tools like Cursor would transform our industry, empowering engineers to build features in hours or minutes that would have typically taken days or weeks without AI. Previously, we were limited by how quickly we could write code, but now the bottleneck is how quickly we can review it. Leading engineering orgs like Shopify, Snowflake, Robinhood, Figma, and Ramp have realized that the age of AI demands an entirely new developer toolchain, and these companies have turned to Graphite to help them review and merge code at the new speed of creation.</p><p>Listening to our customers’ journeys of AI adoption has helped us sharpen and refine our ultimate vision for Graphite: one integrated platform where humans and agents create, review, and merge code changes collaboratively. A future where PRs become self-driving, where the inner and outer loops collapse into one iterative process, and where speed and quality are no longer at odds. But realizing that vision required deep integrations with the tools our customers use to generate code, and, naturally, Cursor was our first stop.</p><h3 id="why-cursor">Why Cursor</h3><p>From our first conversations with the Cursor team, we were deeply impressed by their thoughtfulness, ambition, and craft. We quickly found that we had a lot more in common than just our largest customers and investors; we shared both a nearly identical vision for the future of software development and set of values around talent density, urgency, and craft. An acquisition wasn’t on our radar; Graphite’s growth curve, product, and team are stronger than ever, and the future of code review has never been more exciting.</p><p>We chose to join forces with Cursor because of the opportunity to create something phenomenal together: the end-to-end platform for building with AI. We’ve long dreamed of connecting the surfaces where we create, collaborate on, and validate code changes, and this deal dramatically accelerates the timeline on which we can make that a reality.</p><h3 id="what-this-means-for-graphite">What this means for Graphite</h3><p>Graphite’s product and brand aren’t going anywhere. We’ll continue to be the place where hundreds of thousands of engineers at the world’s top software companies review and merge code. The only change is that we now have far greater resources to continue to deliver an incredible product.</p><p>In the coming months, you can expect us to:</p><ul><li><p>Double down on our best-in-class stacked PRs platform and merge queue.</p></li><li><p>Ship thoughtful integrations between Cursor and Graphite to seamlessly connect local development, background agents, and pull requests.</p></li><li><p>Leverage Cursor’s expertise in coding models to make Graphite’s AI features even more intelligent.</p></li><li><p>Combine the best of Graphite’s AI Reviewer and Cursor’s Bugbot into the most powerful AI reviewer on the market.</p></li><li><p>Lay the foundations for an even bolder product vision which we’ll share more on soon.</p></li></ul><p>This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. We anticipate closing in the next few weeks, and until then, it’s business-as-usual. On closing, the entire Graphite team will join Cursor to continue building.</p><h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3><p>First and foremost, I want to thank our customers. Your feedback has made Graphite an orders-of-magnitude better product, and your willingness to trust us with such a critical piece of the developer toolchain is something we’ve never taken for granted.</p><p>To Hunter, Peter, Christine, and all of our investors: Thank you for your unwavering support. Working with you all has truly been a highlight of this journey.</p><p>To our current and former diamonds: Thank you for everything you’ve given to this company. You've worked incredibly hard and made Graphite a huge part of your lives without any certainty that doing so would pay off. Today, we can proudly say that it was all worth it.</p><p>Lastly, to our future Cursor colleagues: We’re so excited to work together. We truly can’t think of a better team to be joining forces with.</p><p>Graphite’s story has had many chapters, and today marks the start of the most exciting one yet. Together with Cursor, we can’t wait to show you what’s next.</p><p>Merrill Lutsky</p><p>Co-founder &amp; CEO</p><p><em>If you’re excited about defining the future of software development with us, we’re hiring for many open roles across the company in NYC &amp; SF.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://graphite.dev/careers"><em>Apply here</em></a><em>.</em></p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The way developers write code looks different than it did a few years ago. But reviewing those changes, merging them safely, and collaborating on them has increasingly become the bottleneck for building production-grade software.</p>
<p>The team at <a href="https://graphite.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Graphite</a> has spent the past few years thinking deeply about these workflows and have built a code review platform used by hundreds of thousands of engineers at top engineering organizations. The boundary between where you write code and where you collaborate on it feels increasingly arbitrary, and there's a lot we think we can build by collapsing that distance.</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that Graphite has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Cursor.</p>
<p>Graphite will continue to operate independently with the same team and product. Over the coming months, we'll explore connecting the two products in ways that we hope will feel natural: tighter integrations between local development and pull requests, smarter code review that learns from both systems, and some more radical ideas we can't share just yet.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Anthropic’s AI agent was the <a href="https://bun.com/blog/bun-joins-anthropic">most prolific code contributor to Bun’s GitHub repository, submitting more merged pull requests than any human developer</a>. Then Anthropic paid millions to acquire the human team anyway. The code was MIT-licensed; they could have forked it for free. Instead, they bought the people.</p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone’s heard the line: <strong>“AI will write all the code</strong>; engineering as you know it is finished.”</p>
<p>Boards repeat it. CFOs love it. Some CTOs quietly use it to justify hiring freezes and stalled promotion paths.</p>
<p>The Bun acquisition <strong>blows a hole in that story</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s a team whose project was open source, whose most active contributor was an AI agent, whose code Anthropic legally could have copied overnight. No negotiations. No equity. No retention packages.</p>
<p>Anthropic still fought competitors for the right to buy that group.</p>
<p>Publicly, AI companies talk like engineering is being automated away. Privately, they deploy millions of dollars to acquire engineers who already work with AI at full tilt. That contradiction is not a PR mistake. It is a <em>signal</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The key constraint is obvious once you say it out loud. <strong>The bottleneck isn’t code production, it is <em>judgment</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Anthropic’s own announcement barely talked about Bun’s existing codebase. It praised the team’s ability to <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone">rethink the JavaScript toolchain “from first principles”</a>.</p>
<p>That’s investor-speak for: we’re paying for how these people think, what they choose not to build, which tradeoffs they make under pressure. They didn’t buy a pile of code. They bought a track record of correct calls in a complex, fast-moving domain.</p>
<p>AI drastically increases the volume of code you can generate. It does almost nothing to increase your supply of people who know which ten lines matter, which pull request should never ship, and which “clever” optimization will explode your latency or your reliability six months from now.</p>
<p>So when Anthropic’s own AI tops the contribution charts and they still decide the scarce asset is the human team, pay attention. <strong>That’s revealed preference.</strong></p>
<p>Leaders don’t express their true beliefs in blog posts or conference quotes. They express them in hiring plans, acquisition targets, and compensation bands. If you want to understand what AI companies actually believe about engineering, <strong>follow the cap table, not the keynote.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>So what do you do with this as a technical leader?</p>
<p>Stop using AI as an excuse to devalue your best knowledge workers. Use it to give them more leverage.</p>
<p>Treat AI as force multiplication for your highest-judgment people. The ones who can design systems, navigate ambiguity, shape strategy, and smell risk before it hits. They’ll use AI to move faster, explore more options, and harden their decisions with better data.</p>
<p>Double down on developing judgment, not just syntax speed: architecture, performance modeling, incident response, security thinking, operational literacy. The skills Anthropic implicitly paid for when it bought a team famous for rethinking the stack, not just writing another bundler.</p>
<p>Be careful about starving your junior pipeline based on “coding is over” narratives. As AI pushes routine work down, the gap between senior and everyone else widens. Companies that maintain a healthy apprenticeship ladder will own the next generation of high-judgment engineers while everyone else hunts the same shrinking senior pool at auction.</p>
<p>Most important: <strong>calibrate your strategy to revealed preferences</strong>, not marketing copy. When someone’s AI writes more code than their engineers but they still pay millions for the engineers, believe the transaction, not the tweet.</p>

<p dir="auto">In total, $750,000 has been committed to a program of work to improve the experience of laptop users who run FreeBSD.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How long is this program due to run?</h3><a id="user-content-how-long-is-this-program-due-to-run" aria-label="Permalink: How long is this program due to run?" href="#how-long-is-this-program-due-to-run"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The program will start in Q4, 2024 and will likely run for 1-2 years.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How was the scope of the work decided?</h3><a id="user-content-how-was-the-scope-of-the-work-decided" aria-label="Permalink: How was the scope of the work decided?" href="#how-was-the-scope-of-the-work-decided"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The high-level scope was outlined by the FreeBSD Foundation with input from the community, including users such as program co-funder, Quantum Leap Research, and from laptop vendors including Dell, AMD and Framework.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What exactly is covered in the planned work?</h3><a id="user-content-what-exactly-is-covered-in-the-planned-work" aria-label="Permalink: What exactly is covered in the planned work?" href="#what-exactly-is-covered-in-the-planned-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The scope will be unpacked month by month as we make progress, focusing on where the most high-value functionality can be achieved with the resources and support that we have available. Our roadmap will contain work items that are candidates for future months.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Are the dates on the roadmap guaranteed?</h3><a id="user-content-are-the-dates-on-the-roadmap-guaranteed" aria-label="Permalink: Are the dates on the roadmap guaranteed?" href="#are-the-dates-on-the-roadmap-guaranteed"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">No, these are high-level placeholders to help us visualise our intended order of work and to help share our plans with the community. The actual date of delivery on any item will be subject to change based on project progress and other factors.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who will be doing the work?</h3><a id="user-content-who-will-be-doing-the-work" aria-label="Permalink: Who will be doing the work?" href="#who-will-be-doing-the-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Foundation will be managing staff and a group of contracted FreeBSD developers to work on different functional areas to deliver regular updates to the laptop experience.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How can I share my views on what would make the laptop experience better?</h3></p>
<p dir="auto">The FreeBSD community hosts a <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/LaptopDesktopWorkingGroup" rel="nofollow">Laptop and Desktop Working Group</a> where all interested parties can share their experiences, work in progress, and offer and receive help and support. You can also <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/subscription/freebsd-desktop" rel="nofollow">join the Desktop mailing list</a> for more general updates. At present there is not a dedicated Laptop mailing list, this may change if there is community support for it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who is the target user for the functionality being delivered?</h3><a id="user-content-who-is-the-target-user-for-the-functionality-being-delivered" aria-label="Permalink: Who is the target user for the functionality being delivered?" href="#who-is-the-target-user-for-the-functionality-being-delivered"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Our target user is developers. However, we hope to be able to improve the experience for all users by reducing the need to "go under the hood" to set up, manage, and use FreeBSD on a laptop.</p>

<p><span>I perform Maurice Ravel's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bol%C3%A9ro">Boléro</a> on a variety of homemade
8-bit instruments.</span></p>

</ul>

<h2>Some stats and details</h2>

<ul>
<li>9 hours and 42 minutes of footage</li>
<li>52 mixer channels</li>
<li>13 neck- and bowties</li>
<li>9 different instruments</li>
<li>1 crazy automaton</li>
<li>0 regrets</li>
</ul>

<p>This project took me a bit over half a year to finish.</p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy the video as much as I enjoyed making it! There are many
little details that I'll let you discover on your own.</p><p><a href="https://linusakesson.net/music/bolero/automaton-large.jpg"><img src="https://linusakesson.net/music/bolero/automaton-small.jpg"></a></p>

<p>It was fun to put my tools and methods to the test with this huge
undertaking. When I started out I had no idea if my mixing and video-editing
process would work at this scale, but it turned out to only need a few tweaks
here and there.</p>

<p>The nine instruments are: The <a href="https://linusakesson.net/qweremin/index.php">Qweremin</a> (breadbin / regular&nbsp;C64C
/ dark&nbsp;C64C), <a href="https://linusakesson.net/software/qwertuoso/index.php">Qwertuoso</a>
(breadbin), the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/music/paulimba/index.php">Paulimba</a>, the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/commodordion/tenor.php">Tenor&nbsp;Commodordion</a>, the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/music/family-bass/index.php">Family&nbsp;Bass</a> (albeit not as a bass
this time), my still unnamed <a href="https://linusakesson.net/music/partita-prelude/index.php">floppy-drive noise instrument</a> (1541
/ 1541-II), the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/music/glyptodont-live/index.php">C=TAR</a>, the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/chipophone/index.php">Chipophone</a>, and a newcomer: NES timpani.</p>

<p>The timpani sound is based on the famous NES staircase triangle wave. But
there is no register for controlling its volume, and yet we can hear an
envelope with a release phase. To achieve this, I rely on a neat trick that was
used already in Super Mario Bros.: It turns out that the triangle channel is
mixed with the ADPCM sample-playback channel and then fed through a non-linear
resistor network (the output is proportional to ((adpcm&nbsp;+&nbsp;triangle)⁻¹
+ C)⁻¹). Therefore, adding a constant DC offset via the sample channel makes
the triangle more or less compressed.</p>

<p>In nearly every part of this video, what you see is what you hear; the audio
and video were recorded at the same time. But the automaton is different:
Thanks to its 100% repeatable performance I could capture the sound of each
individual section of the hardware, with the microphone up close, and then mix
the parts according to taste and combine them with the visuals from a separate
take.</p>

<p>Fun fact: You can't see it in the video but the automaton is supported by
original C64 boxes:</p>

The name GotaTun is a combination of the original project, BoringTun, and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6tatunneln" rel="nofollow">Götatunneln</a>, a physical tunnel located in Gothenburg. We have integrated privacy enhancing features like <a href="https://mullvad.net/vpn/daita">DAITA</a> &amp; <a href="https://mullvad.net/help/multihop-wireguard">Multihop</a>, added first-class support for Android and used Rust to achieve great performance by using safe multi-threading and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy" rel="nofollow">zero-copy</a> memory strategies.</p>
<p>Last month we rolled it out to all our Android users, and we aim to ship it to the remaining platforms next year.</p>
<h2>Why GotaTun?</h2>
<p>Our mobile apps have relied on wireguard-go for several years, a cross-platform userspace implementation of WireGuard® in Go. wireguard-go has been the de-facto userspace implementation of WireGuard® to this date, and many VPN providers besides Mullvad use it. Since mid-2024 we have been maintaining a fork of <br>wireguard-go to support features like DAITA &amp; Multihop. While wireguard-go has served its purpose for many years it has not been without its challenges.</p>
<p>For Android apps distributed via the Google Play Store, Google collects crash reports and makes them available to developers. In the developer console we have seen that more than 85% of all crashes reported have stemmed from the wireguard-go. We have managed to solve some of the obscure issues over the years (<a href="https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/pull/6727" rel="nofollow">#6727</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/pull/7728" rel="nofollow">#7728</a> to name two examples), but many still remain. For these reasons we chose Android as the first platform to release GotaTun on, allowing us to see the impact right away.</p>
<p>Another challenge we have faced is interoperating Rust and Go. Currently, most of the service components of the Mullvad VPN app are written in Rust with the exception of wireguard-go. Crossing the boundary between Rust and Go is done using a&nbsp;<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface" rel="nofollow">foreign function interface</a> (FFI), which is inherently unsafe and complex. Since Go is a managed language with its own separate runtime, how it executes is opaque to the Rust code. If wireguard-go were to hang or crash, recovering stacktraces is not always possible which makes debugging the code cumbersome. Limited visibility insight into crashes stemming from Go has made troubleshooting and long-term maintenance tedious.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The impact has been immediate. So far not a single crash has stemmed from GotaTun, meaning that all our old crashes from wireguard-go are now gone. Since rolling out GotaTun on Android with version 2025.10 in the end of November we’ve seen a big drop in the metric <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/crash#android-vitals" rel="nofollow">user-perceived crash rate</a>, from 0.40% to 0.01%, when comparing to previous releases. The feedback from users' have also been positive, with reports of better speeds and lower battery usage.</p>
<p><img src="https://mullvad.net/media/uploads/2025/gotatun.png" alt="" width="640" height="293"></p>
<p><em>User-perceived crash rate</em></p>
<h3>Looking ahead</h3>
<p>We’ve reached the first major milestone with the release of GotaTun on Android, but we have a lot more exciting things in store for 2026.</p>
<ul>
<li>A third-party security audit will take place early next year.</li>
<li>We will replace wireguard-go&nbsp;with GotaTun across all platforms, including desktop and iOS.</li>
<li>More effort will be put into improving performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you are as excited as we are for 2026!</p><!----></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://design.google/library/google-sans-flex-font">https://design.google/library/google-sans-flex-font</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46322732">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-y-start="20" data-testid="column" data-link-style="default"><p>When Google Sans rolled out in 2018, designers were initially ecstatic. “It meant we could finally use typography for a stronger brand statement,” recalls UX Designer Miche Alvarez. “But it also created a dual-font system using Google Sans for larger display text and Roboto for smaller text. It ended up being a compromise.”</p>
<p>Designers fought for a Google Sans version that would work at smaller sizes. So the team collaborated with designers in Search and at Colophon Foundry to refine the font, ultimately launching Google Sans Text (GST) in 2020.</p>
<p>Unlike the geometric Google Sans, the characters in Google Sans Text are taller, more condensed, and less circular. The typeface also includes more spacing between characters to aid readability. The numerals are less geometric, and the angled cuts on terminals are less severe, creating a more uniform and readable experience, even at small sizes. It was also designed to match the proportions of Roboto, Android’s default typeface, to make switching from Roboto a smoother process.</p>
<p>Google Sans Text rolled out on the Pixel 3, creating a more unified typographic experience.</p></div><div data-y-start="20" data-testid="column" data-link-style="default"><p>Google Sans Mono was created in 2020 to support contexts that needed fixed-width characters for editorial design, at medium and large text sizes. Despite this, it soon got its first big product integration, replacing Roboto Mono in Google Chat. The only problem? Developers hated it.</p>
<p>Because the font wasn’t intended to be used at smaller sizes, the letterforms weren’t legible. It was especially difficult to tell the a and o apart. “That can actually be catastrophic for code,” says Tobias Kunisch. “One misplaced character can break an entire program.”</p>
<p>Recognizing this critical need, a dedicated effort was launched to craft Google Sans Code, a monospaced typeface specifically designed to make code more readable. This involved thorough research into the 20 most common programming languages and how developers interact with code, aiming to make the new coding typeface more visually appealing while reducing the ambiguity of similar-looking letterforms. Based on these insights, Google tasked the <a target="_blank" aria-label="Universal Thirst (opens in a new tab or window)" data-link-style="default" href="https://universalthirst.com/">Universal Thirst</a>  foundry to meticulously focus on specific letters, numbers, and operators to meet these requirements. The result is an eminently readable and surprisingly playful typeface.</p>
<p>Google Sans Code launched as an open-source font in 2025, and is the typeface used to display code in <a target="_blank" aria-label="Gemini (opens in a new tab or window)" data-link-style="default" href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a>.</p></div><div data-y-start="20" data-testid="column" data-link-style="default"><p>The story of Google Sans is a masterclass in need-based design — it was created not by a single flash of inspiration, but a thoughtful, human-centered evolution. Each problem, from misaligned lockups to illegible code, revealed an unmet need and ultimately led to innovation and improved user experience.</p>
<p>By making Google Sans Flex open-source, we’re extending that commitment beyond our walls. It’s an invitation to designers and developers worldwide: Use these tools, contribute to their growth, and together, let’s build clearer, more accessible, and more beautiful digital experiences for everyone. With your help, we can shape a more legible future, one character at a time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
  <article>
    
    <div>
      <p>I recently came into possession of an old Dell Precision T3610 workstation and promptly installed Proxmox to
add it to my Proxmox cluster. After performing some ludicrously silly RAM and storage upgrades (how about 96
GB of DDR3, plus a 13-disk array of 500 GB SSDs?), I decided I wanted to max out the CPU as well.</p>
<p>The Precision T3610 shipped with an <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/75780/intel-xeon-processor-e51650-v2-12m-cache-3-50-ghz/specifications.html">Intel Xeon E5-1650 v2</a>.
According to the linked Intel product page, this CPU uses the FCLGA2011 socket. <em>Easy enough,</em> I thought to
myself. <em>Just find the best CPU that supports FCLGA2011, make sure you have the latest BIOS installed, and
everything should be all hunky dory.</em> So I did some research and landed on the
<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/93790/intel-xeon-processor-e78890-v4-60m-cache-2-20-ghz/specifications.html">Xeon E7-8890 v4</a>.
It’s several years newer than the E5-1650 v2, has a whopping 24 cores (and hyperthreading bumps it to 48 logical
cores!), and can support having not one, not two, but <em>eight</em> of itself installed in a single motherboard! Most
crucially, the Intel product page says it uses the FCLGA2011 socket. When I stumbled across one of these monsters
on eBay for just $15, I snapped it up.</p>
<p>Cue my massive shock and disappointment when, a few days later, I found myself unable to install the E7-8890 v4
in my T3610. The new CPU, despite being the same physical size as the old CPU, had extra contacts on the bottom
and had a different physical keying. What? I thought Intel said this was the same socket!</p>
<p>Some amount of research later, I discovered that Intel’s LGA2011 socket has many variations. One of these
variations is also called Socket R (or LGA2011-0). The T3610, and by extension the old E5-1650 v2 CPU, uses
Socket R. The newer E7-8890 v4, meanwhile, uses a different variation called Socket R2 (or LGA2011-1). As if
this wasn’t confusing enough, there’s even a third variation of the LGA2011 socket! I’ll refer you to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_2011#Physical_design_and_socket_generations">Wikipedia</a> page for more info
on that.</p>
<p>This is obviously not a great naming scheme. Why not use unique numbers for each version of the socket instead of
tacking on a suffix? But the real kicker here is that Intel itself doesn’t seem to be able to keep up with its own
naming scheme! It appears that its CPU specifications pages refer to all variants of the LGA2011 socket as
FCLGA2011. This leaves folks like myself wondering what went wrong when their new-to-them CPUs don’t fit in their
motherboards.</p>
<p>So where does that leave me? Well, I now have a fancy paperweight. I could have returned the CPU, but return
shipping costs would have been half of what I paid for the CPU itself, so I’m hanging onto it for now in case I
ever come into possession of a server with a Socket R2 motherboard that could use a nicer CPU. At least it wasn’t
a super expensive CPU, so all in all, this isn’t the worst learning experience ever.</p>
