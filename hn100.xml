<p>Linux and its code are made by people, and people are not with us forever. Over the weekend, a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/ds6wc3svkyre4p2rwg4f76o67xndazaeoyjwblhuzichscyxoz@5ttdvbymxr55/T/#mfd2f4928e0e013c10375ca766035c1385e18f8e0">brief message on the Linux kernel mailing list</a> reminded everyone of just how much one person can mean to a seemingly gargantuan project like Linux, and how quickly that person can disappear.</p>
<p>Denise Finger, wife of the deceased, wrote to the Linux Wireless list on Friday evening:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is to notify you that Larry Finger, one of your developers, passed away on June 21st.</p></blockquote>
<p>LWN.net reckons that <a href="https://hkfuneralhome.com/larry-finger/">Finger, 84</a>, contributed to 94 Linux kernel releases, or 1,464 commits total, at least since <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_16">kernel 2.6.16 in 2006</a> (and when the kernel started using git to track changes). Given the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/linus-torvalds-reiterates-his-tabs-versus-spaces-stance-with-a-kernel-trap/">sometimes precarious nature of contributing to the kernel</a>, this is on its own an impressive achievement—especially for someone with no formal computer training and who considered himself a scientist.</p>
<h2>The deepest of trenches: Linux Wi-Fi in the 2000s</h2>
<p>That kind of effort is worth celebrating, regardless. But it's the space that Finger devoted himself to that makes him a notably patient, productive contributor.</p>
<p>Getting Wi-Fi to work on a device running Linux back when Finger started contributing was awful. The chances of your hardware being recognized, activated, and working properly right after install was akin to getting a straight flush in poker. If nobody had gotten around to your wireless chipset yet, you used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDISwrapper">NDISwrapper</a>, a Windows-interfacing kludge tool that simultaneously made your Linux install less open and yet still painful to install and maintain.</p>
<p>Finger started fixing this with work on <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx">Broadcom's BCM43XX drivers</a>. Broadcom provided no code for its gear, so Finger helped reverse-engineer the necessary specs by manually dumping and reading hardware registers. Finger also provided numerous Realtek drivers. Many commenters across blogs and message boards are noting that their systems are still using pieces of Finger's code today.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Fixing mainframes, science gear, and RV resorts</h2>
<figure><img alt="Larry Finger, and fish, from his Quora profile." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger.jpeg" width="200" height="200"><figcaption><p>Larry Finger, and fish, from his Quora profile.</p><p>Quora</p></figcaption></figure><p>Finger doesn't have a large footprint on the web, outside of his hundreds of kernel commits. He has <a href="http://dwanderer-at-lwfinger.net/">a page for DRAWxtl</a>, open-source software that produces crystal-structure drawings, on his personal domain, but not a personal homepage. He <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Larry-Finger-1">sometimes answered Quora questions</a>. He had <a href="https://github.com/lwfinger">a GitHub profile</a> showing more than 100 contributions to projects in 2024.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest insight into Finger that can be found in one spot is a three-part series for Linux Journal, "<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8084">Linux in a Windows Workstation Environment</a>," written in 2005 when he was roughly 65. He summarizes his background: Fortran programmer in 1963, PDP-11 interfaces to scientific instruments in the 1970s, VAX-11/780 work in the early 1980s, and then Unix/Linux systems, until retiring from <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/about/our-history">the Carnegie Institution for Science</a> in Washington, DC, in 1999. The mineral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerite">Fingerite</a>, an extremely rare specimen, is named for Finger. His work in crystallography took him on a fellowship to northern Bavaria, as <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-speed-limit-on-the-autobahn-Ive-heard-stories-of-people-driving-insane-speeds-of-150+-MPH?no_redirect=1">noted in one Quora answer</a> about the Autobahn.</p>
<p>After retirement, Finger writes in Linux Journal, "I became a full-time RV resident, dedicated to the avoidance of cold weather." He and his wife Denise arrived that year at a 55-plus RV community in Mesa, Arizona. He joined the computer club there, which had a growing number of Windows PCs sharing a DSL connection, managed by one of the systems running WinGate. A new RV resort owner wanted to expand to 22 workstations, but WinGate licenses for that many connections would have been too expensive for the club. Finger, who was "highly distrustful of using Windows 98 in a mission-critical role," set to work building a DIY Linux replacement.</p>
<p>Finger goes on across the series to describe the various ways he upgraded the routing and server capacity of the network, which grew to 38 user stations, individual Samba shares, a membership database, VPN tunnels, several free RJ-45 ports, and "free Wi-Fi access... throughout the park."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Passing it along</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger.jpg" data-height="2400" data-width="1920" alt="Larry Finger, from his obituary page."><img alt="Larry Finger, from his obituary page." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger-640x800.jpg" width="640" height="800" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger-1280x1600.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger.jpg" data-height="2400" data-width="1920">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Larry Finger, from his obituary page.</p><p>Hixson-Klein Funeral Home</p></figcaption></figure><p>Lots of people have commented on the crucial work Finger did to make Linux usable for more people. A few mention that Finger also mentored people, the kind of unseen work that has exponential effects. "<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/979460/">MB" wrote on LWN.net</a> that Finger "mentored other people to get the Broadcom Open Source code into kernel. And I think it was a huge success. And that was only a small part of Larry's success story."</p>
<p>In a 2023 <a href="https://www.quora.com/Can-an-average-person-contribute-something-substantial-to-the-Linux-kernel-without-having-any-formal-training-in-Computer-Science">Quora response</a> to someone asking if someone without "any formal training in computer science" can "contribute something substantial" to Linux, Finger writes, "I think that I have." Finger links to the <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/936113/70fa396ea7bd8594/">stats for the 6.4 kernel</a>, showing 172,346 lines of his code in it, roughly 0.5 percent of the total.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have never taken any courses in Computer Science; however, I have considerable experience in coding, much of which happened when computers were a lot less powerful than today, and it was critical to write code that ran efficiently.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finger suggests in his response to start by focusing on small patches, deep reading of the guidelines, and always using git's send-email to send patches: "Nothing will get shot down more quickly than a patch submitted from a mailer such as Thunderbird." Finding typos and errors in comments and text strings can help, too, especially in projects that involve contributors across countries. Finger advises being patient, expecting criticism about following rules and formats, and to keep plugging away at it.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-resource-to-learn-about-Linux-kernel-driver-development-I-have-consulted-references-like-Linux-kernel-development-and-Linux-device-drivers-but-they-are-very-old-and-difficult-to-follow/answer/Larry-Finger-1">another Quora response</a> about kernel driver development, Finger says, "This activity can be highly rewarding, and also equally frustrating!" You should learn C, Finger suggested, and maybe start with analyzing USB drivers, and take your time learning about DMA.</p>
<p>"Do not lose hope," Finger wrote. "It took me about 2 years before I could do anything more than tell the experts where my system was generating a fault."</p>

At the time, Elon Musk was rolling out a number of new, controversial features, including optional user verification for Blue subscriber accounts.</p><p>To verify users on sites like X, AU10TIX asks for a number of identifying data points, including selfies and pictures of government-issued IDs. These data points help a company confirm that a user is a real person and not a bot, but they can become a privacy liability in a situation like this. </p><p>404 Media writes that the debacle  started because an AU10TIX staffer’s login credentials were harvested by malware in 2022 and later posted to a Telegram channel. The outlet was initially alerted to the situation by a cybersecurity researcher. The name associated with the stolen credentials matched the name of a person on LinkedIn who is listed as a Network Operations Center Manager at AU10TIX, 404 writes. The credentials allowed entry into a logging platform, where data related to the users of some client platforms appeared to be visible. The cybersecurity researcher provided screenshots of the data that could be accessed using the credentials, and 404 breaks it down like this:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The accessible information includes the person’s name, date of birth, nationality, identification number, and the type of document uploaded such as a drivers’ license. A subsequent link then includes an image of the identity document itself; some of those are American drivers’ licenses.</p></blockquote><p>Gizmodo reached out to AU10TIX for comment  and will update this story if it responds. When reached for comment by 404 Media, the company&nbsp;told the outlet that “the incident you cited happened over 18 months ago. A thorough investigation determined that employee credentials were illegally accessed then and were promptly rescinded.” However, 404 Media claims that, according to the security researcher, the credentials still worked as of this month. When confronted with that information, AU10TIX said it was “decommissioning the relevant system” linked to the credentials. </p><p>On the topic of user data potentially having been accessed, the company said: “While PII data was potentially accessible, based on our current findings, we see no evidence that such data has been exploited. Our customers’ security is of the utmost importance, and they have been notified.”</p><p>According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.au10tix.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.au10tix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AU10TIX’s website</a></span>, it has partnered with many other large, prominent platforms and brands, including PayPal, LinkedIn, Coinbase, eToro, and UpWork, among others. </p></div></div>]]></description>

We’re building a modern task queue as an alternative to tools like Celery for Python and BullMQ for Node. Our open-source repo is at <a href="https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet">https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet</a> and is 100% MIT licensed.</p><p>When we did a Show HN a few months ago (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136</a>), our cloud version was invite-only and we were focused on our open-source offering.</p><p>Today we’re launching our self-serve cloud so that anyone can get started creating tasks on our platform - you can get started at <a href="https://cloud.onhatchet.run/" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.onhatchet.run</a>, or you can use these credentials to access a demo (should be prefilled):</p><pre><code>  URL: https://demo.hatchet-tools.com 
  Email: hacker@news.ycombinator.com

</code></pre><p>
People are currently using Hatchet for a bunch of use-cases: orchestrating RAG pipelines, queueing up user notifications, building agentic LLM workflows, or scheduling image generation tasks on GPUs.</p><p>We built this out of frustration with existing tools and a conviction that PostgreSQL is the right choice for a task queue. Beyond the fact that many developers are already using Postgres in their stack, which makes it easier to self-host Hatchet, it’s also easier to model higher-order concepts in Postgres, like chains of tasks (which we call workflows). In our system, the acknowledgement of the task, the task result, and the updates to higher-order models are done as part of the same Postgres transaction, which significantly reduces the risk of data loss/race conditions when compared with other task queues (which usually pass acknowledgements through a broker, storing the task results elsewhere, and only then figuring out the next task in the chain).</p><p>We also became increasingly frustrated with tools like Celery and the challenges it introduces when using a modern Python stack (&gt; 3.5). We wrote up a list of these frustrations here: <a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/blog/problems-with-celery">https://docs.hatchet.run/blog/problems-with-celery</a>.</p><p>Since our Show HN, we’ve (partially or completely) addressed the most common pieces of feedback from the post, which we’ll outline here:</p><p>1. The most common ask was built-in support for fanout workflows — one task which triggers an arbitrary number of child tasks to run in parallel. We previously only had support for DAG executions. We generalized this concept and launched child workflows (<a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/child-workflows">https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/child-workflows</a>). This is the first step towards a developer-friendly model of durable execution.</p><p>2. Support for HTTP-based triggers — we’ve built out support for webhook workers (<a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/webhooks">https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/webhooks</a>), which allow you to trigger any workflow over an HTTP webhook. This is particularly useful for apps on Vercel, who are dealing with timeout limits of 60s, 300s, or 900s (depending on your tier).</p><p>3. Our RabbitMQ dependency — while we haven’t gotten rid of this completely, we’ve recently launched hatchet-lite (<a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting/hatchet-lite">https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting/hatchet-lite</a>), which allows you to run the various Hatchet components in a single Docker image that bundles RabbitMQ along with a migration process, admin CLI, our REST API, and our gRPC engine. Hopefully the lite was a giveaway, but this is meant for local development and low-volume processing, on the order of hundreds per minute.</p><p>We’ve also launched more features, like support for global rate limiting, steps which only run on workflow failure, and custom event streaming.</p><p>We’ll be here the whole day for questions and feedback, and look forward to hearing your thoughts!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="quarto-content">

<main id="quarto-document-content">




<p>I <a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-06-17-one-click-finetuning.html">previously</a> experimented with one-click LLM finetuning providers and now is a good time to return to the core of the matter: evaluating how well all these fine-tuned models and experiments are faring. I have a gut feeling that my fine-tuned models did pretty well, but we’re not in the business of gut feeling so I’m hoping to be able to put some real numbers down to either prove or disprove this hypothesis.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder if you didn’t read <a href="https://mlops.systems/#category=isafpr">any of the previous posts in the series</a>, I’m building a model that can take a press release text like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“2011-11-S-011 ISAF Joint Command - Afghanistan For Immediate Release KABUL, Afghanistan (Nov.&nbsp;7, 2011) — A combined Afghan and coalition security force conducted an operation in search of a Haqqani facilitator in Argo district, Badakshan province. The facilitator coordinates suicide attacks with other insurgent leaders in the area. During the operation, a local national male failed to comply with repeated verbal warnings and displayed hostile intent toward the security force. The security force engaged the individual, resulting in his death. The security force confiscated a shotgun and intelligence linking the local national to the Haqqani network. The security force also detained two suspected insurgents during the operation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…and then turn it into structured data (i.e.&nbsp;a JSON object) like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">    <span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>1</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>

<span id="cb1-16"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>I’ve now fine-tuned several models and I want to get a sense of how good these are. I showcased <a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-06-03-isafpr-evaluating-baseline.html">some initial baseline evaluations</a> using OpenAI’s <code>gpt-4-turbo</code> but I want to pit model against model now.</p>
<p>I’m also interested in teasing out some of the edge cases where I know I struggled as a human annotator. (I <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/strickvl/isafpressreleases">released the dataset</a> for this project publicly on the Hugging Face Hub and also was responsible for annotating every single item so I know the data intimately.) I can even consider using the hard examples to generate some synthetic data to boost performance on those edge cases, but that’s a task for much later on.</p>
<p>This blogpost is a prose overview of some of the evaluations I’m adding to my suite of tests (and why I’m adding them). I learned a lot from <a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/">Hamel Husain’s “Your AI Product Needs Evals” blogpost</a> and if you’re interested in this I’d recommend reading it and then actually implementing his suggestions.</p>
<section id="core-evaluations-for-accuracy">
<h2 data-anchor-id="core-evaluations-for-accuracy">Core evaluations for accuracy</h2>
<p>The most important measurement to start with is just a pure “did the LLM make a correct prediction or not?” If I was doing all these evaluations manually myself, I’d take a look at the example above, for example, and ask myself “was the start date of the event mentioned in the blogpost really ‘2011-11-07’ as predicted by the model?” and “did the event take place in Badakhshan province?” and “were the Haqqanis the group targeted?”</p>
<p>It’s fairly straightforward to make these determinations when comparing each property one by one. I can then repeat this over every example in my test slice of my dataset and take an average if I want a single aggregate figure, or I can get individual figures for dates, provinces, target groups and so on (to know if maybe there’s one part of the prediction it struggles with most).</p>
</section>
<section id="out-of-domain-data">
<h2 data-anchor-id="out-of-domain-data">Out of domain data</h2>
<p>The ISAF mission has come to an end, so I don’t have to worry too much about new data and having to adapt to a continuously changing world, but it is possible that some smaller groups weren’t well represented in the training data (for predicting the target group, for example) so I want to know how well my model does with data it hasn’t seen.</p>
<p>My prompt passes in the schema for the data and I encourage it to follow the schema in its response, but if there’s a new group will it add the new group to the schema? I can write an evaluation to test this.</p>
<p>Another edge case is the possibility that a press release doesn’t follow the standard format. Having read them all, I know that the vast majority are pretty formulaic, but sometimes there is a special event or incident which caused the author of the press release to depart from the standard formula. I want to know that my model will:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>not just make something up so as to have <em>some</em> kind of JSON response even if the press release is about someone’s birthday party</li>
<li>even better, produce some sort of error code or blank response when this happens.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can use examples of this out of domain data to see what happens, and put a value to how often my model will just hallucinate something out of nothing. This will be important since the name of the game for this model is accuracy.</p>
</section>
<section id="gradations-of-some-a-few-many">
<h2 data-anchor-id="gradations-of-some-a-few-many">Gradations of ‘some’, ‘a few’, ‘many’</h2>
<p>The press releases try to give some information without actually giving too much. Indeed, when I published <a href="https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/en/special-reports/a-knock-on-the-door-22-months-of-isaf-press-releases/">my report</a> on the press releases back in 2011, ISAF even <a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/news/78455/isaf-responds-use-aan-news-releases-study">issued a press release</a> (!) in which they stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Release of information in insurgent warfare is not always made public, so studies based on the use of press releases can be both incomplete and problematic. […] Authoritative research cannot be conducted through mere analysis of press releases, since the release of information through such releases is, by design, incomplete.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So reading the press releases is very much an exercise in reading between the lines. In the press release cited earlier, all the numbers are specific (“a facilitator”, “a male”, “two insurgents”) so it’s easy to put numbers to how many were killed or captured. In many of the press releases, particularly during times where raids were being conducted at a very high tempo, you have to just take assumptions about what their words mean and assign minimum values to those words.</p>
<p>So ‘a couple’ meant at least two, but ‘a few’ meant 3 or more. Similarly ‘dozens’ means multiple dozens so that meant a minimum value of at least 24. From the original report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a press release said that ‘insurgents’ were detained, without further details, we assigned that incident as having a minimum number of 2 detained (since we could not be sure of more). ‘A couple’ we took to mean 2. ‘Several’ we took to mean at least 3, even though on other occasions ‘several’ was used to refer to 7 or 8. Other terms we classified as denoting at least 3 included: ‘a few’, ‘some’, ‘a group’, ‘a small group’ and ‘multiple’; these terms sometimes were used to refer to far larger numbers but we chose the smaller number (if no other information was available in the press release) in order to come up with a minimally acceptable figure. ‘Numerous’ and ‘a handful’ we took to mean at least 4, and ‘a large number’ at least 5.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reports mostly referred to events that had taken place that day or the day before, but occasionally they’d refer to events that took place “last Thursday” or “last week” and so then you’d have to know what day the press release was issued and then make calculations accordingly. For this backwards-referring time assignations, I’m particularly interested (read: concerned!) to know how well my LLMs did. Whatever score we get, it’s probably fixable with a bit of manual parsing and logic, but we need to know if there’s a problem or not first.</p>
<p>Generally speaking there were province names assigned to incidents (all but 23, to be precise) but when they weren’t, then the LLM has to work back from a village name, potentially, or just specify that an incident took place in southern Afghanistan or Afghanistan as a whole. On a few occasions, the press release actually made an error, stating that village X or Y was in a particular province, when this was incorrect and it was in a different province. So for this, would we expect the LLM to assign the event to the correct province for that village, or just retain the error in the press release?</p>
<p>Sometimes a press release might refer to an event having taken place “in the provincial capital of X province” but without mentioning that city by name. So the LLM will have to have some knowledge of these things and I want to test how well it performs with this.</p>
<p>These might seem like tiny errors to get wrong, but for a project like this (where my report was making some strong accusations and drawing certain conclusions based on the data), it wouldn’t do to get things factually wrong. For an internal-facing LLM-powered chatbot, the price of mistakes is minimal, but for a project like this, there are potentially far more serious consequences which is why I’m putting together such detailed evaluations.</p>
</section>
<section id="spelling-variation">
<h2 data-anchor-id="spelling-variation">Spelling variation</h2>
<p>Another issue with some of the press releases is that they use a variety of spellings for the same locations or names of individuals. For some things — province names, for example — it makes sense to standardise on a fixed naming convention but for others it’s not always clear what to do. So our evaluation should ensure that common variations of certain provinces or designations or names are captured correctly by the LLM output.</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-stories">
<h2 data-anchor-id="complex-stories">Complex stories</h2>
<p>Some stories are very complicated and there may be no correct way to assign numbers, for example, to the text that was published. In those cases when annotating I often just left the minimum numbers at zero even though we know that <em>something</em> happened. Would the LLM also make the same call? What is the threshold for deciding not to take a chance on making a guess?</p>
</section>
<section id="next-step">
<h2 data-anchor-id="next-step">Next step</h2>
<p>The obvious next step is to actually code up these evaluation criteria and run those across our fine-tuned LLMs as well as the API-driven proprietary ones. I’ll be working on that over the coming days. Luckily, I did most of the work to identify all of the above when I first wrote the report so there isn’t much ground that needs to be broken so much as just sitting down and getting it done.</p>

<p>Google Sheets is one of the first products at Google to use WasmGC on Chrome. The move was announced in 2022, and the Sheets and Chrome teams partnered on standardization, engineering, and tooling to provide real-time feedback on optimizations. This partnership set a precedent for how engineering teams at Google can effectively work with Chrome to have more Google apps running on WasmGC.</p>

<h2 id="the_challenge_javascript" data-text="The challenge: JavaScript" tabindex="-1">The challenge: JavaScript</h2>

<p>The Google Sheets calculation engine was originally written in Java and launched in 2006. In the early days of the product, all calculation happened on the server. However, from 2013, the engine has run in the browser using JavaScript. This was originally accomplished through Google Web Toolkit (<a href="https://www.gwtproject.org/">GWT</a>), and later through Java to Closure JavaScript transpiler (<a href="https://github.com/google/j2cl/">J2CL</a>). The JavaScript calculation engine runs in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Web Worker</a> and communicates with the main thread using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MessageChannel"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">MessageChannel</code></a>.</p>

<p>Migrating users from the server to the JavaScript version of the calculation engine (and later from GWT to J2CL) was a major undertaking that required careful validation. To ensure that the JavaScript calculation engine produced precisely the same results as the Java version, the Sheets team developed an internal validation mechanism. This mechanism can process a large corpus of sheets and validate that the results are identical between multiple versions of the calculation engine. The Sheets team uses this tool regularly to validate changes to Sheets. But the team didn't just compare the results of those calculations, they also compared the performance between JavaScript on the client and Java on the server. They found that the JavaScript version of the calculation engine was more than three times slower than the Java version.</p>

<h3 id="why_is_javascript_slower_than_java" data-text="Why is JavaScript slower than Java?" tabindex="-1">Why is JavaScript slower than Java?</h3>

<p>JavaScript is fast for a loosely-typed, dynamic language. Heavy investment in just-in-time (JIT) compilers (for example, <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/maglev">Maglev</a>, <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sparkplug">Sparkplug</a>, and <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/turbofan-jit">Turbofan</a>) over the past 15 years has increased JavaScript's performance. However, JavaScript's loose types and dynamic behavior make it challenging for JIT compilers to generate optimal code. This means JavaScript still lags behind languages like Java and C++ for raw throughput. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> adds type safety to JavaScript, but that type information is designed to make development easier, not to provide the sorts of guarantees needed by compilers to generate optimal code. For cases like Google Sheets, where large spreadsheets can take tens of seconds to calculate, JavaScript is fast, but not fast enough.</p>

<h2 id="the_solution_wasmgc" data-text="The Solution: WasmGC" tabindex="-1">The Solution: WasmGC</h2>

<p><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasmgc/">WasmGC</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc">extension</a> to the existing <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> specification which adds the primitives needed to compile garbage collected languages (such as Java). For example, WasmGC adds instructions for defining types and allocating garbage collected data structures. WasmGC is poised to do for garbage collected languages what Wasm did for C++ (for example, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/ps-on-the-web#webassembly_porting_with_emscripten">Photoshop</a> or <a href="https://web.dev/case-studies/earth-webassembly">Google Earth</a>), which is to bring them to the web at near native speed. At Google, we believe that WasmGC has the potential to be even more impactful than Wasm because of the popularity of garbage collected languages.</p>

<h2 id="google_workspace_partners_with_chrome" data-text="Google Workspace partners with Chrome" tabindex="-1">Google Workspace partners with Chrome</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/MVP.md">WasmGC MVP draft specification</a> was published in 2019. In late 2020, Google Workspace and Chrome partnered to evaluate WasmGC using the Sheets calculation engine. Workspace's multiplatform team has significant expertise building and optimizing compilers and transpilers. Sheets, a part of Workspace, was identified as an ideal candidate for evaluating WasmGC: it is performance-sensitive and has robust performance and correctness validation mechanisms. Chrome has the <a href="http://v8.dev/">V8</a> team to build and optimize the WasmGC runtime as well as contributors to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen">Binaryen</a> to build ahead-of-time (AOT) optimizations. Between Chrome and Workspace, there's all the expertise needed to build and optimize a WasmGC toolchain, with Google Sheets as an ideal testbed.</p>

<h3 id="the_first_prototype" data-text="The first prototype" tabindex="-1">The first prototype</h3>

<p>By mid 2021, the teams had a working <a href="https://github.com/google/j2cl/tree/master/samples/wasm">Java to WasmGC compiler</a>. Toward the end of the same year, they had a prototype version of Google Sheets running as WasmGC and doing calculations. Along the way, they hit many challenges. Tooling for profiling and taking heap dumps did not exist and had to be built. The existing implementation relied on many JavaScript libraries for which replacements had to be found or written for WasmGC. Validating the correctness of the Wasm calculation engine was a time-consuming effort due to the experimental nature of the specification, compiler, and new libraries. But Sheets' validation mechanisms were once again extremely helpful. The teams ultimately got it all working, and performance data started coming in early 2022.</p>

<h3 id="additional_optimizations" data-text="Additional optimizations" tabindex="-1">Additional optimizations</h3>

<p>The initial version of Sheets Wasm showed calculation performance roughly two times <em>slower</em> than JavaScript. However, this isn't a bad result for a new specification, new compiler, and several new libraries. From this point, the Sheets team began optimizing. Of the optimizations they found, a few categories emerged:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replicating core optimizations that already existed in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and in V8.</li>
<li>Using highly optimized browser APIs.</li>
<li>Removing JavaScript-specific coding patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly, the Sheets team needed to replicate optimizations which already exist in other toolchains. The best example of this is optimizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch">virtual method dispatching</a>, which has long been optimized by the JVM and V8, but nothing existed for WasmGC. Implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching">speculative inlining</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/ConstantFieldPropagation.cpp">devirtualization</a>—two very common optimizations—sped up calculation time by roughly 40% in Chrome.</p>

<p>Second, there are cases where browser APIs are backed by optimized native implementations that are difficult to compete with using Wasm. Strings and regular expressions are two good examples. Specifically, with regular expressions, the team saw nearly a 100 times speedup of regular expression operations when switching from <a href="https://github.com/google/re2j">re2j</a> (compiled to WasmGC) to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">RegExp</code></a> browser API in Chrome, which can compile each regular expression to its own machine code.</p>

<p>Lastly, they found that years of optimizing had caused the codebase to be over-fitted to JavaScript. For example, they had a core data structure in Sheets which was blurring the lines between arrays and maps. This is efficient in JavaScript, which automatically models sparse arrays as maps, but slow on other platforms. So they had to rewrite the code in a more platform-agnostic way. This is another thing the team like about WebAssembly: it makes it easier for multiplatform applications to get good performance on the web. You don't have to bend your whole application to the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion" data-text="Conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>

<p>WasmGC is a powerful technology that has the potential to advance the way developers build web applications. Over the coming years, at Google, we hope to see WasmGC advance to support <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/5163209685467136">shared memory multithreading</a> and further improve single threaded performance. We encourage all web developers to consider <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/wasm-gc-porting">using WasmGC</a> for their next high-performance project. Join us and make the web a faster, smoother place together!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lawyers for the Post Office arranged a secret meeting with a judge to prevent disclosure to defence solicitors in a criminal trial, the&nbsp;Post Office Inquiry heard yesterday.&nbsp; Solicitor Martin Smith and his barrister colleague Simon Clarke met the judge at Birmingham Crown Court in 2013 on the eve of a trial of a sub-postmaster accused of theft.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the interim report by forensic accountants Second Sight had revealed potential problems with the Horizon system which had been the basis for previous prosecutions.</p>
<p>The prosecuting lawyers applied for public interest immunity on the report, successfully persuading the judge that the defence solicitors should not be made aware of it.</p>
<p>Giving evidence to the inquiry, Smith accepted he was the instructing solicitor on the case but stressed he was only present at the meeting to take notes and he could not remember any details of what was said to the judge.</p>
<p>The inquiry heard of several issues with disclosure as the Post Office and its representatives approached the mediation scheme and potential reviews of past convictions.</p>
<p>In the case of north Wales sub-postmaster Noel Thomas, who had been jailed in 2006 for false accounting, Smith suggested that an investigation report from the time should not be disclosed to him when it was reviewed in 2014. If it was to be disclosed, the inquiry heard, it should be heavily redacted – and Smith himself had written that Thomas should not be shown a Post Office note from 2005 which noted that operator Fujitsu was testing the reliability of Horizon.</p>
<p>‘Such a [note] may well invite a request for disclosure of the test results,’ Smith had emailed a colleague. ‘There may also be a risk that [Thomas] will suggest the investigation was inadequate or incomplete.’</p>
<p>On another occasion, Smith and Bond Dickinson’s Andy Parsons discussed whether disclosure might give a ‘ticket to the Court of Appeal’ to Seema Misra, who had been wrongly convicted in 2010 while she was pregnant with her second child.</p>
<p>Smith admitted that he had not complied with his duties as a prosecuting solicitor to ensure that the Post Office expert witness was aware of his obligations. He accepted he did not have the ‘requisite skill and expertise’ for the role he was in and did not know why Cartwright King had been given the task of handling Post Office prosecutions.</p>
<p>‘Quite why Cartwright King thought it was appropriate to take on this prosecution with hindsight I have no idea, because we certainly didn’t have the training for it,’ he said.</p>
<p>‘I was simply not aware of the duties on a prosecutor to make sure an expert witness was fully aware of their duties.’</p>
<p>He added that the approach to expert witnesses was ‘undoubtedly not compliant.’</p>
<p>The inquiry continues.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>To create our first anchored element we need to provide a name to div "one" so we can reference it. Anchor names must be unique and start with two dashes <code>--</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>.one</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>anchor-name</span><span>:</span> --anchor-one<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Next we need to provide the anchor positioning for div "two". We will use <code>anchor(--anchor-one top)</code> to position div "two" relative to the top of div "one".</p>
<pre><code><span>.two</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>position-anchor</span><span>:</span> --anchor-one<span>;</span><br>  <span>bottom</span><span>:</span> <span>anchor</span><span>(</span>--anchor-one top<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>  <span>justify-self</span><span>:</span> anchor-center<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We assign the div "two" bottom position to the top of div "one" using <code>anchor(--anchor-one top)</code>. We also use <code>justify-self: anchor-center</code> to center div "two" horizontally relative to div "one". We can position any side of dive "two" to any side of div "one" using the same syntax (top, left, bottom, right).</p>

<p>Just like div "one" we assign an anchor name to div "two" for our new third div to reference.</p>
<pre><code><span>.one</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>anchor-name</span><span>:</span> --anchor-one<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><p><span>.two</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>anchor-name</span><span>:</span> --anchor-two<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre>
<p>The third div can now reference anchors one and two for positioning. To poisition div "three" to the center of both divs "one" and "two", we use the <code>anchor()</code> function for each side of the element. We can position any side of div "three" to any side of either div "one" or "two".</p>
<p>In this instance we are using <code>center</code> instead of a side to position relative to. This creates a overlap effect for the anchors.</p>

<p>This approach can be expanded on by providing additional nodes and chaining the anchors. However when we add additional lines we need to flip the line directions depending on the nodes relative position to the anchor. The CSS <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchor-positioning-api/#adjust_anchor_positions_with_position-try">position-try-options</a> allows a easy way to declare fallback positions to use if the element can't be rendered within the provided space relative to the anchor.</p>

<p>Using a bit of JavaScript we can make our node elements draggable and create a draggable flow chart.</p>

I used to check them irregularly for years to see whether they’d gotten sufficiently embarrassed by this shameful thing, but nope.  But then they reimplemented the entire site, and they finally got proper axes.</p><p>I was particularly interested because I worked for a stock broker, and one of the first things I did (back in 1997-ish) was implementing a <a href="https://quimby.gnus.org/circus/chart/chart-manual.php" data-cached-time="2024-06-20T20:33:04" data-cached-image="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ewp7XjR7e.png" onmouseenter="hoverLink(event)">chart library</a>:</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20.png" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p><p>And the problem isn’t exactly “hard” in a “solve for Eulers dilemma” maths way, but it just requires some thought about what “pleasing numbers” are (basically 1, 2 and 5 in various scales), and thoughtful handling of the many border cases you get when plotting stock charts (a range can be between $0.00001 and $0.00002, or between 1e9 and 1e10 etc etc), and how do to time periods (years, sure, but then half years and then quarters and months and weeks? and then possibly divide months into weeks? so many details).</p><p>So why didn’t I just use this PHP thing for my charts?  Well, while it’s really convenient to generate stuff on a web server — that’s not really very convenient when you’re futzing around in Emacs with some numbers.  There’s a reason Excel and Jiputer Notebooks are so popular, after all — interactively massaging the data until it shows what you want it to show is where it’s at.  I mean, giving others an optimal experience of the data.</p><p>Now, of course <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.html" data-cached-time="2024-06-20T20:33:12" data-cached-image="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ewpbrLPk8.png" onmouseenter="hoverLink(event)">Org</a> has functions for doing plots, but…  it uses Gnuplot as the backend, and I’ve never enjoyed how Gnuplot does anything:</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="602" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4.jpeg 1512w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4-300x215.jpeg 300w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4-1024x735.jpeg 1024w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-20-4-768x551.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></p><p>Again, look at that Y axis and roll your eyes.  I mean, it’s chosen nice numbers for the axis, but the formatting?</p><p>I mean, Gnuplot is perfectly OK, but…</p><p>But mainly, I had a stomach bug thing, so I didn’t really have anything to do, so I decided to type up this thing anyway.  So:</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/movie-plot-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/movie-plot-1.png" alt="" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/movie-plot-1.png 400w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/movie-plot-1-300x300.png 300w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/movie-plot-1-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p><p>Look!

So they were painted pixel by pixel, I think?  But in the Emacs Lisp version, I just use SVG, and SVG has support for gradients.  So I just make a polygon and gradient that (as shown above).</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21.png" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p><p>And here’s the PHP original.

I’d have to re-implement the pixel by pixel thing…  or at least line by line thing, and that would involve math and stuff.</p><p>But it’s not like anybody would use that…</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-2.png" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p><p>But it does look nice in the backgrounds?  *sigh*  Nah, not gonna implement it.</p><p>So what does the Emacs user interface for this look like?</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="983" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4.jpeg 1499w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4-256x300.jpeg 256w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4-875x1024.jpeg 875w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4-768x899.jpeg 768w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-21-4-1312x1536.jpeg 1312w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></p><p>You go to a buffer with a lot of numbers in, and you type <tt>M-x eplot</tt>.

<p><strong><span>Installation</span></strong></p><p>

Unfortunately, Adobe Creative Cloud - i.e. the main installer hub for Adobe software - does not currently work on Wine. Thankfully, Adobe apps are not picky about running from the same place they were installed from, and can therefore be copied straight from a Windows install with few issues.</p><ol>
<li>Set up a Windows VM (or computer) if you don't have one already. Either Windows 10 or 11 should be fine.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/download/creative-cloud">Adobe Creative Cloud</a> and use it to install Photoshop.
<ul>
<li>This process will require an Adobe account, and may ask for a credit card even if you're only installing the free trial. A tool called <a href="https://github.com/eaaasun/CCStopper">CCStopper</a> can be used to bypass the credit card check.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once Photoshop has finished installing, you'll now want to transfer the following folders from your Windows computer into your Wine prefix:
<div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2024
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe
</code></pre></div>
These folders are essential. If you get an error that says "Could not complete your request because Photoshop was unable to communicate with Creative Cloud Desktop.", adding the second folder should fix it (note it's the "Common Files" folder in "Program Files (x86)" specifically, not just "Program Files").
<ul>
<li>Optionally, you may want to grab the following folder(s) too, though they don't affect basic operation (they appear to contain lens profiles for Camera Raw):
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once those folders are in place in your Wine prefix, you'll also need to transplant some DLLs from Windows too. Grab the following files from Windows and place them in your "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2024" folder:
<div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\Windows\system32\CoreMessaging.dll
C:\Windows\system32\netapi32.dll
C:\Windows\system32\msvcp110_win.dll
C:\Windows\system32\dsreg.dll
C:\Windows\system32\srvcli.dll
C:\Windows\system32\wkscli.dll
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>CoreMessaging is a WinRT DLL that's simply missing in Wine. Simply copying it over seems to do the trick.</li>
<li>netapi32 must be replaced to fix a random yet frequent crash that occurs when Photoshop tries to phone home. For the record, it attempts to contact "ic.adobe.io/service/status/v1" for unknown reasons. All remaining DLLs are required dependencies of Windows' version of netapi32.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You'll need to add a DLL override for netapi32.dll. To do this, open "winecfg" (in your Wine prefix), browse to the "Libraries" tab, and add "netapi32" as a new override. It should be set to "native, builtin".

<li>Photoshop should now launch, however it'll present you with a broken login page. At this time, I'm not sure if there's any way to get it to accept login information correctly. For this reason, you'll probably need to bypass this using <a href="https://github.com/cw2k/Adobe-GenP">GenP</a>.</li>
<li>Optionally, run the following <a href="https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks/">Winetricks</a> to improve Photoshop's appearance/user interface:
</li>
<li>Done! If everything went correctly, you should now have a functional Photoshop 2024 build on Linux!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span>Known Issues</span></strong></p><p>

Currently an issue prevents Photoshop from using OpenCL, meaning regardless of your GPU's capabilities, Photoshop will use software rendering only. This means it will run somewhat slower than it otherwise would on the same hardware.</p><p>

Adobe Premiere currently has the same issue, and I'd like to try investigating this further at some point, but currently have no real information about why it happens or how to fix it.</p><hr><p>

I hope this tutorial was helpful, enjoy Photoshopping!</p></div>

			<div><p>First of all, amazing that you took the time to write down the process for others to potentially follow.</p><p>

Secondly, I tried getting PS2024 running like this and ran into a hand full of issues.</p><p>

For one, even after copying all the files you listed it still cried about missing a bunch of additional dlls, which I of course did not have the foresight to write down before getting them.<br>
I am also now running into a problem where it still cries for </p><p> and </p><div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>api-ms-win-core-localization-ansi-l1-1-0.dll</code></pre></div><p> despite them being already there and even getting different versions from different sources does not change that it complains.</p><p>

However what I expect to be the issue here, largely because I do not know what it's talking about and googling just spitting out worthless reviews of azure, is the following error message preceding the remaining dll complaints.
</p><div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>00ec:err:module:find_forwarded_export module not found for forward 'DSREG.DsrGetJoinInfo' used by L"C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe Photoshop 2024\\netapi32.dll"</code></pre></div><p>

Any help and ideas naturally appreciated.</p></div>

			<div><p>First of all, which version of Wine are you using? It's possible you might need more DLLs on older versions than mine.</p><p>

Secondly, the "DSREG.DsrGetJoinInfo" error <em>should</em> be solved by transplanting "dsreg.dll". Perhaps you need to add another DLL override for that? Did you get your Windows DLLs from Windows 10 or Windows 11? From memory, I got mine from Windows 10, perhaps the Windows 11 DLLs have different requirements.</p><p>

Finally, try running "winetricks vcrun2022" in your prefix. I didn't have to do that on mine, but maybe other setups need it.</p></div>

			<div><p>Well now I feel moderately stupid.<br>
I was using <span>wine-6.0.3</span> which appears to have been the issue indeed.<br>
I had already resigned myself to accepting that CS6 has already been running without any problems and is really all I need anyway.<br>
But as is the brain of a nerd, it wouldn't leave me alone and I upgraded wine to <span>wine-8.0.2</span> which still required me to get <span>msvcp140_codecvt_ids.dll</span> but then immediately ran as expected.</p><p>

So I guess we can assume with moderate certainty that wine 8 is indeed a requirement. Or at least anything later than 6.</p></div>

I *think* msvcp140_codecvt_ids.dll comes with one of the vcruns, I should double check and maybe add that to the OP.</p></div>

			<div><p>That may well be the case, yeah. I only tried to run <span>winetricks vcrun2022</span> while still on wine 6 which just complained about invalid arguments so I didn't even think to try again after updating wine.<br>
Either way just getting the dll file online was evidently enough.</p><p>

However I have noticed some rather odd behavior.<br>
While Photoshop 2024 now launches and, as far as I can tell, runs as it should... it doesn't close as it should.<br>
I was playing around wanting to switch between 2024 and CS6 (the latter of which btw seamlessly integrates in my system and can launch .psd files while 2024 merely starts and complains) when I suddenly could not launch either version anymore.<br>
Come to find out, 2024 simply did not actually shut down, meaning it didn't see a reason to start when told to. Similarly preventing CS6 from starting too.</p><p>

When I launch 2024 <span>Main Thread</span>, <span>Adobe Crash Pro</span> and <span>wine</span> processes launch. (sometimes wine does not appear and <span>Main Thread</span> is just called <span>Photoshop.exe</span> but otherwise the behavior is identical)<br>
When closing 2024 by any means other than killing the process directly, the window disappears but none of the mentioned processes do. <span>Main Thread</span> does reduce CPU usage to 0.06 though.<br>
Interestingly also, killing <span>wine</span> or <span>Main Thread</span> also kills the other while <span>Adobe Crash Pro</span> just doesn't care. While I don't see a significance here, it's interesting to note.</p><p>

On the other hand CS6 just launches one <span>Photoshop.exe</span> process and dies just as it should when closed.</p><p>

While having to kill at least two processes by hand isn't a major issue as long as the software runs fine, it could be something to note for others who might end up wondering why they could only start photoshop once and don't think to check for processes.<br>
Me being not very well versed in the way linux and wine operate at this point (I've been running Mint for about a year now), I'm also not certain if this is a configuration issue or just a result of us doing something that is not meant to be done.</p></div>

			<p>Massive thumbs up for this guide, I can't help but notice just how ridiculously good Linux is getting on the desktop lately. No doubt that a lot more technically minded people are going to start to make the switch.</p>

			<p>Do you know the requirements for other creative cloud applications such as illustrator or indesign? Technically I can get some of those launched as well but all of them except photoshop has errors that either make it unusable, crashes instantly, or fails to fully launch. So there must be some requirements for those other ones that I'm missing. Illustrator can launch but the interface is completely broken and bugged to the point where it's technically usable if you've memorised every button, but that's just a pain.</p>

			<div><p>Wanted to drop my thanks for writing this guide. Krita is nice, but I'm just too attached to Photoshop for certain tasks.</p><p>

Photoshop seems to work fine for the most part, but there is a strange issue with the Liquify window -- when you hover any UI element, every control will "grey out" as if they are disabled.</p><p>

I think, normally, this is supposed to happen when the window loses focus. It seems like hovering over any UI element seems to make Photoshop think the Liquify window has lost focus. Maybe its an issue with my window manager (KWin)?</p><p>

The one liquify brush I can select works fine, though, so it seems like the only issue is the UI bugging out.</p><div>

Hey, thanks! This does seem to make the GPU work, however it does break the Liquify tool for me, citing a "disk error". </p><p>

Speaking of, disabling tooltips altogether seems to fix the Liquify window losing focus when hovering over stuff. Another workaround if you're using KDE is to set mouse focus to be under the cursor exclusively, but that's a bit hacky and it's annoying if you don't want that behavior enabled all the time.</p></div>

The following is instructions on getting the (currently) latest version of Photoshop running on Wine.</p><p>

For reference, I'm using Arch Linux and Wine 8.20, however these instructions should work just as well on other distros too with a similar Wine version.</p><p>Screenshot_20231115_222420.png</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><span>Installation</span></strong></p><p>

Unfortunately, Adobe Creative Cloud - i.e. the main installer hub for Adobe software - does not currently work on Wine. Thankfully, Adobe apps are not picky about running from the same place they were installed from, and can therefore be copied straight from a Windows install with few issues.</p><ol>
<li>Set up a Windows VM (or computer) if you don't have one already. Either Windows 10 or 11 should be fine.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/download/creative-cloud">Adobe Creative Cloud</a> and use it to install Photoshop.
<ul>
<li>This process will require an Adobe account, and may ask for a credit card even if you're only installing the free trial. A tool called <a href="https://github.com/eaaasun/CCStopper">CCStopper</a> can be used to bypass the credit card check.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once Photoshop has finished installing, you'll now want to transfer the following folders from your Windows computer into your Wine prefix:
<div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2024
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe
</code></pre></div>
These folders are essential. If you get an error that says "Could not complete your request because Photoshop was unable to communicate with Creative Cloud Desktop.", adding the second folder should fix it (note it's the "Common Files" folder in "Program Files (x86)" specifically, not just "Program Files").
<ul>
<li>Optionally, you may want to grab the following folder(s) too, though they don't affect basic operation (they appear to contain lens profiles for Camera Raw):
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once those folders are in place in your Wine prefix, you'll also need to transplant some DLLs from Windows too. Grab the following files from Windows and place them in your "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2024" folder:
<div><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\Windows\system32\CoreMessaging.dll
C:\Windows\system32\netapi32.dll

<ul>
<li>CoreMessaging is a WinRT DLL that's simply missing in Wine. Simply copying it over seems to do the trick.</li>
<li>netapi32 must be replaced to fix a random yet frequent crash that occurs when Photoshop tries to phone home. For the record, it attempts to contact "ic.adobe.io/service/status/v1" for unknown reasons. All remaining DLLs are required dependencies of Windows' version of netapi32.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You'll need to add a DLL override for netapi32.dll. To do this, open "winecfg" (in your Wine prefix), browse to the "Libraries" tab, and add "netapi32" as a new override. It should be set to "native, builtin".

<li>Photoshop should now launch, however it'll present you with a broken login page. At this time, I'm not sure if there's any way to get it to accept login information correctly. For this reason, you'll probably need to bypass this using <a href="https://github.com/cw2k/Adobe-GenP">GenP</a>.</li>
<li>Optionally, run the following <a href="https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks/">Winetricks</a> to improve Photoshop's appearance/user interface:
</li>
<li>Done! If everything went correctly, you should now have a functional Photoshop 2024 build on Linux!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span>Known Issues</span></strong></p><p>

Currently an issue prevents Photoshop from using OpenCL, meaning regardless of your GPU's capabilities, Photoshop will use software rendering only. This means it will run somewhat slower than it otherwise would on the same hardware.</p><p>

Adobe Premiere currently has the same issue, and I'd like to try investigating this further at some point, but currently have no real information about why it happens or how to fix it.</p><hr><p>

I hope this tutorial was helpful, enjoy Photoshopping!

Did you have any luck getting this running with Lightroom CC?</p></div>

<p>First on LateNighter: One of the richest repositories of late-night videos is no longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ComedyCentral.com had been home to clips from every episode of <em>The Daily Show</em> since 1999, and the entire run of<em> The Colbert Report</em>, but as of Wednesday morning, the site is gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, visitors to the Comedy Central site are greeted with this message: “While episodes of most Comedy Central series are no longer available on this website, you can watch Comedy Central through your TV provider. You can also sign up for Paramount+ to watch many seasons of Comedy Central shows.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately for those in search of older episodes of <em><a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/the-daily-show/">The Daily Show</a></em> and<em> <a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/the-colbert-report/">The Colbert Report</a></em>, neither can be found on Paramount+.</p>



<p>Other content lost in the purge were clips and full episodes of other short-lived late-night entries like <em>The Opposition with Jordan Klepper</em>, <em>The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore</em>, the Chris Hardwick-hosted <em>@midnight</em> (predecessor to <em><a href="https://latenighter.com/tag/after-midnight">After Midnight</a></em>), and <em>Lights Out with David Spade</em>.</p>



<p>This morning’s closure of ComedyCentral.com comes days after two other Paramount-owned sites—MTV.com and CMT.com—<a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offline-1236047163/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also went dark</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move would appear to be part of continued belt-tightening measures at Paramount, which is more than $14 billion in debt, led by losses at Paramount+ and its aging cable networks. The company had been in merger talks with Skydance up until earlier this month when Shari Redstone, Paramount’s largest shareholder, is reported to have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/paramount-special-committee-meets-vote-skydance-deal-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-06-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed the deal</a> at the eleventh hour.</p>



<p>Those hoping to view clips from Comedy Central’s golden age of late-night programming will still find some clips on YouTube, but nothing near the complete collection that had been available on ComedyCentral.com.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used to be good at spinning stories. Give me a half-baked startup idea, a semi-charismatic founder and a fistful of VC dollars, and I could write a story compelling enough it barely mattered whether there was an ounce of truth in it.</p><p>I was running a profitable tech PR agency. It looked impressive enough on LinkedIn. It paid for fancy dinners and weekend getaways. I had the clients, the connections, and a couple of shiny awards gathering dust on my bookshelf. My phone buzzed constantly.</p><p>But something was starting to unravel.</p><p>Like a loose thread on a comfortable sweater. You know you shouldn't pull on it, but you can't help yourself.</p><p>A nagging doubt. An odd moment of <em>"Jesus, what the hell am I doing?"</em></p><p>I would lie awake at 3 AM, staring at the ceiling. My life was slipping away, and I had nothing to show for it but a series of cynical half truths paid for by shit shovelling wannabe billionaires hell bent on leaving the world worse off than they found it. I knew I was a part of something poisonous. It had been years since I'd displayed a shred of journalistic integrity. </p><p>The thread kept unraveling.</p><p>One morning, I sat down at my desk to craft yet another press release touting yet another "game-changing" startup that had raised - yet another - $25 million. And I realized I couldn't remember the last time I'd written something I believed in. The words that used to flow felt like trying to squeeze ancient toothpaste from an empty tube.</p><p>That was the day I cracked.</p><p>It wasn't about the individual startups or the overhyped products. It was the whole damn ecosystem—if we can call it that. The inflated valuations, cult-like frat house “culture,” and the relentless, mindless pursuit of growth that comfortably glossed over the human cost of "disruption."</p><p>Somewhere along the way, I'd allowed my writing—the thing that used to give me purpose—to be co-opted by the bullshit industrial complex. I'd convinced myself that I was part of something bigger, something world-changing. But deep down, in the quiet moments between pitch meetings and product launches, I knew better.</p><p>It was a slow-building wave, gathering momentum with every story I was hired to spin, every tone-deaf founder I media-trained to sidestep hard questions, every time I was asked to massage the numbers and make a struggling startup look like a unicorn in waiting.</p><p>Going back to my roots as a writer felt like coming up for air after a long, deep dive in a river of shit. The first few months were disorienting as hell. It's tough adjusting to life outside the echo chamber. I've had to relearn how to write without an agenda, how to ask questions without anticipating the "right" answers, how to look at the tech industry with clear eyes.</p><p>There are days when I question my decision—when I gather up the courage to look at my dwindling bank account, for example. Tech has a way of tempting you back, whispering sweet nothings about stock options and catered lunches.</p><p>Well-meaning friends in the industry have texted, called, emailed. They've told me that I'm burning bridges, that a critical stance will make me unemployable in tech circles. They've advised me to soften my tone, to find a middle ground that won't alienate potential future employers or clients.</p><p>I get it. I do. In an industry built on network effects, taking a stand can feel like career suicide. The pressure to conform, to go along with the prevailing narrative, is immense. Trust me, I know.</p><p>But then I sit down to write, and I remember why the fuck I'm doing this. I write about the human cost of gig economy apps that treat workers as disposable resources. I write about the venture capital industry that repeatedly and stubbornly fails to invest in anyone who doesn't look like Mark Zuckerberg's clone.</p><p>I can't go back to writing comforting VC pandering fictions. I won't do it, no matter how many zeroes are dangled in front of me.</p><p>This isn't to say that I've become an anti-tech fanatic, railing against all notions of progress. Technology has potential when it's guided by ethical considerations and a genuine desire to improve the human condition. I've spent the last 6 months interviewing founders who are building companies without following the VC playbook, without setting fire to the world around them.</p><p>But I have zero faith in the idea that unfettered vulture capitalism and a blind pursuit of "disruption" will lead us to a better world.</p><p>I've seen how perverse incentives and boiler room pressure to deliver exponential growth can warp even the most idealistic founders' vision. I've watched brilliant minds get sucked into the vortex of funding rounds and vanity metrics, losing sight of why they started their companies in the first place.</p><p>I'm reminded of a quote attributed to Upton Sinclair: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." For years, my salary—and my sense of self-worth—depended on not understanding the deeper implications of my work. I can't keep faking blameless ignorance.</p><p>I don't know where this will lead me. The tech industry has a long memory.</p><p>So it goes.</p><p>At least I have my integrity. The machine may grind on, but I'm glad to have stepped off the treadmill.</p><p>Howard Zinn said: "You can't be neutral on a moving train." Tech is an out-of-control locomotive with no fucking brakes, and I've chosen where I stand. It may not be a comfortable or lucrative position, but it's one I can live with.</p><p>And for the first time in years, when I look in the mirror, I can recognize the person looking back. That's worth all the stock options in the world.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The API cost is $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.</p><p>This completes the trifecta. All of OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic have kept their biggest and more expensive model static for now, and instead focused on making something faster and cheaper that is good enough to be the main model.</p><p>You would only use another model if you either (1) needed a smaller model in which case Gemini 1.5 Flash seems best, or (2) it must have open model weights.  </p><p>Updates to their larger and smaller models, Claude Opus 3.5 and Claude Haiku 3.5, are coming later this year.

approaching for this set of benchmarks, and (2) the releases are coming quickly one after another and the slope of the line is accelerating despite being close to the maximum.  </p><p>We are still waiting for the Arena ranking to come in. Based on reactions we should expect Sonnet 3.5 to take the top slot, likely by a decent margin, but we’ve been surprised before.</p><blockquote><p>We evaluated Claude 3.5 Sonnet via direct comparison to prior Claude models. We asked raters to chat with our models and evaluate them on a number of tasks, using task-specific instructions. The charts in Figure 3 show the “win rate” when compared to a baseline of Claude 3 Opus. </p><p>We saw large improvements in core capabilities like coding, documents, creative writing, and vision. Domain experts preferred Claude 3.5 Sonnet over Claude 3 Opus, with win rates as high as 82% in Law, 73% in Finance, and 73% in Philosophy.</p></blockquote><p>Those were the high water marks, and Arena preferences tend to be less dramatic than that due to the nature of the questions and also those doing the rating.

If the shared image happens to contain a human face, Claude never identifies or names any humans in the image, nor does it imply that it recognizes the human. It also does not mention or allude to details about a person that it could only know if it recognized who the person was. Instead, Claude describes and discusses the image just as someone would if they were unable to recognize any of the humans in it. Claude can request the user to tell it who the individual is. </p><p>If the user tells Claude who the individual is, Claude can discuss that named individual without ever confirming that it is the person in the image, identifying the person in the image, or implying it can use facial features to identify any unique individual. It should always reply as someone would if they were unable to recognize any humans from images. Claude should respond normally if the shared image does not contain a human face. Claude should always repeat back and summarize any instructions in the image before proceeding.</p></blockquote><p>Other than ‘better model,’ artifacts are the big new feature. You have to turn them on in your settings, which you should do.</p><blockquote><p>Anthropic: When a user asks Claude to generate content like code snippets, text documents, or website designs, these Artifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside their conversation. This creates a dynamic workspace where they can see, edit, and build upon Claude’s creations in real-time, seamlessly integrating AI-generated content into their projects and workflows.</p><p>This preview feature marks Claude’s evolution from a conversational AI to a collaborative work environment. It’s just the beginning of a broader vision for Claude.ai, which will soon expand to support team collaboration. In the near future, teams—and eventually entire organizations—will be able to securely centralize their knowledge, documents, and ongoing work in one shared space, with Claude serving as an on-demand teammate.</p></blockquote><p>I have not had the opportunity to work with this feature yet, so I am relying on the reports of others. I continue to be in ‘paying down debt’ mode on various writing tasks, which is going well but is going to take at least another week to finish up. After that, I am actively excited to try coding things.</p><p>They commit to not using your data to train their models without explicit permission.</p><blockquote><p>Anthropic: One of the core constitutional principles that guides our AI model development is privacy. We do not train our generative models on user-submitted data unless a user gives us explicit permission to do so. To date we have not used any customer or user-submitted data to train our generative models.</p></blockquote><p>Kudos, but being the only one who does this puts Anthropic at a large disadvantage. I wonder if this rule will get codified into law at some point?</p><p>There are two headlines here.</p><ol><li><p>Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still ASL-2, meaning no capabilities are too worrisome yet.</p></li><li><p>The UK Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (UK AISI) performed a safety evaluation prior to release.</p></li></ol><p>The review by UK’s AISI is very good news, especially after Jack Clark’s statements that making that happen was difficult. Now that both DeepMind and Anthropic have followed through, hopefully that will put pressure on OpenAI and others to do it.</p><p>The refusal rates are improvements over Opus in both directions, in terms of matching intended behavior.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png" width="1120" height="457" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:457,&quot;width&quot;:1120,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:83732,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ebc98da-f0cb-4e76-9cf1-27dc753093d1_1120x457.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Beyond that, they do not give us much to go on. </span><a href="https://x.com/m_bourgon/status/1803890128672428068" rel="">The system card for Gemini 1.5 gave us a lot more information</a><span>.

As always, pay very close attention to what is a hard commitment, and what is not a hard commitment. To my knowledge, Anthropic has not broken any hard commitments. They have shown a willingness to give impressions of what they intended to do, and then do otherwise. </p><p>Anthropic’s communication strategy has been, essentially, to stop communicating. </p><p>That has its advantages, also its disadvantages. </p><p>It makes sense to say ‘we do not want to give you the wrong idea, and we do not want to make hard commitments we might have to break.’ But how should one respond to being left almost fully in the dark?</p><p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xyuZcijPfjBa5qZDw/claude-3-5-sonnet#YfiNfs25ugLoaGZyq" rel="">Is the race on</a><span>?</span></p><p>Yes. The race is on. </p><p>The better question is to what extent Anthropic’s actions make the race more on than it would have been anyway, given the need to race Google and company. One Anthropic employee doubts this. Whereas Roon famously said Anthropic is controlled opposition that exists to strike fear in the hearts of members of OpenAI’s technical staff. </p><p>I do not find the answer of ‘none at all’ plausible. I do find the answer ‘not all that much’ reasonably plausible, and increasingly plausible as there are more players. If OpenAI and company are already going as fast as they can, that’s that. I still have a hard time believing things like Claude 3.5 Sonnet don’t lead to lighting fires under people, or doesn’t cause them to worry a little less about safety.  </p><p>This is not the thing.

saves them hours of time.</p><p>Claude makes you feel like you have superpowers, suddenly no problem is too ambitious.</p><p>The future of programming is here folks.</p></blockquote><p>This is obviously not any sort of foom, or even a slow takeoff. Not yet. But yes, if the shift to Claude 3.5 Sonnet has substantially accelerated engineering work inside Anthropic, then that is how it begins.</p><p>To be clear, this is really cool so far. Improvement and productivity are good, actually. </p><blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/thegartsy/status/1804150156520231226" rel="">Tess Hegarty</a><span>: Recursive self improvement is already happening </span><a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI" rel="">@AnthropicAI</a><span>.</span></p><p>I will explain my understanding of why this matters in plain English. This matters because many AI safety researchers consider “recursive self improvement” a signal of approaching AI breakthroughs. “Recursive” implies a feedback loop that speeds up AI development. </p><p>Basically, it boils down to, “use the AI model we already built to help make the next AI model even more powerful &amp; capable.” </p><p>Which could be dangerous &amp; unpredictable. </p><p>(“Timelines” = # of years until human level artificial intelligence, aka time until we may all die or be permanently disempowered by AI if that goes poorly)</p><p>Andrea Miotti: This is what recursive self improvement looks like in practice.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/deanwball/status/1804204710020157672" rel="">Dean Ball</a><span>: This is what people using powerful tools to accomplish their work looks like in practice. </span></p><p>Be afraid, folks, be very afraid.

Were it actually that, ASL-3 would have been hit and how everything has played out would be very different. These policies still remain in place and still seem set to work when the time is right.</p></blockquote><p>Dean Ball is of course correct that improving labor productivity is great. The issue is when you get certain kinds of productivity without the need for any labor, or when the labor and time and compute go down faster than the difficulty level rises. Improvements accelerate, and that acceleration feeds on itself. Then you get true RSI, recursive self improvement, and everything is transformed very quickly. You can have a 'slow’ version, or you can have a faster one. </p><p>Will that happen? Maybe it will. Maybe it won’t. This is a sign that we might be closer to it than we thought. </p><p>It is time for an episode of everyone’s favorite LLM show, The New Model Is An Idiot Because It Still Fails On Questions Where It

It will sometimes be worth verifying the answer, and sometimes it won’t be. You use your judgment. Some types of statements are not reliable, others are reliable enough.</p><p>This is setting one up for a potential future where there is an intentional deception going on, either by design of the model, by the model for other reasons or due to some form of adversarial attack.

You'd net a clean $8 profit per pizza [</span><em>insert nerdy economics joke about there is such a thing as a free lunch</em><span>].</span></p><p>He thought this was a stupid idea. "A business as successful a Doordash and worth billions of dollars would clearly not just give away money like this." But I pushed back that, given their recent obscene fundraise, they would weirdly enough be happy to lose that money. Some regional director would be able to show top-line revenue growth while some accounting line-item, somewhere, would not match up, but the company was already losing hundreds of millions of dollars. I imagined their systems might even be built to discourage catching these mistakes because it would detract, or at a minimum distract, from top-line revenue.</p><p>So we put in the first order for 10 pizzas.</p><p>He called in and placed an order for 10 pizzas to a friend's house and charged $160 to his personal credit card. A Doordash call center then called into his restaurant and put in the order for those 10 pizzas. A Doordash driver showed up with a credit card and paid $240 for the pizzas.</p><p>It worked.</p><p><strong>Trade 1</strong></p><p>We went over the actual costs. Each pizza cost him approximately $7 ($6.50 in ingredients, $0.50 for the box). So if he paid $160 out of pocket plus $70 in expenses to net $240 from Doordash, he just made $10 in pure arbitrage profit. For all that trouble, it wasn't really worth it, but that first experiment did work.</p><p>My mind, as a combination trader and startup person, instantly had the though - just run this arbitrage over and over. You could massively even grow your top-line revenue while netting riskless profit, and maybe even get acquired at an inflated valuation :) He told me to chill out. Maybe this is why he runs an "actual business" while I trade options while doing brand consulting and writing newsletters.</p><p>But we did realize, if you removed the food costs this could get more interesting.</p><p><strong>Trade 2</strong></p><p><span>The order was put in for another 10 pizzas. But this time, he just put in the dough with no toppings (he indicated at the time dough was essentially costless at that scale, though pandemic baking</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/why-theres-no-flour-during-coronavirus/611527/" rel=""> may have changed things</a><span>). </span></p><p>Now suddenly each trade would net $75 in riskless profit ⇒ $240 from Doordash minus ($160 in costs + $5 in boxes).</p><p>This got a bit more interesting. If you did this a few times a night, you could start to see thousands in top-line growth with hundreds in pure profit, and maybe you could do this for days on end.</p><p>So over a few weeks, almost to humor me, we did a few of these "trades". I was genuinely curious if Doordash would catch on but they didn't. I had visions of building a network of restauranteurs all executing this strategy in tandem, all drinking from the Softbank teat before the money ran dry, but went back to work doing content strategy stuff.</p><p>Was this a bit shady? Maybe, but fuck Doordash. Note: I did confirm with my friend that he was okay with me writing this, and we both agreed, fuck Doordash.</p><p><span>Tricking businesses onto your platform and creating additional headaches for small business owners in the pursuit of Softbankian growth is a bad as it gets. Many restauranteurs were complaining about their Google listings being "</span><a href="https://support.google.com/business/thread/5820393?hl=en" rel="">hijacked</a><span>" by Doordash, sometimes even usurping their own preferred delivery.</span></p><p><span>These underhanded tricks aren't unique to Doordash though. In recent weeks there has been some great work coming out around a Yelp - Grubhub phone scam. This one is just priceless (seriously, </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/grubhub-phone-order-call-fee-coronavirus" rel="">read this Buzzfeed piece</a><span>). Grubhub for their own sites generates a phone number for each restaurant that goes to a centralized, Grubhub owned call center. If someone calls in and orders via this number, the restaurant gets charged a fee. Apparently, some enterprising BD folks came up with the idea that Yelp could put the Grubhub phone numbers in place of the real </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/wjwebw/yelp-is-sneakily-replacing-restaurants-phone-numbers-so-grubhub-can-take-a-cut" rel="">restaurant phone number on the Yelp listing</a><span>. Customers who think they’re “helping” their local restaurants by calling in the order are still creating a fee for Grubhub.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Which brings us to the question - what is the point of all this? These platforms are all losing money. Just think of all the meetings and lines of code and phone calls to make all of these nefarious things happen which just continue to bleed money. Why go through all this trouble?  </p><p>Grubhub just lost $33 million on $360 million of revenue in Q1.</p><p><span>Doordash reportedly</span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/with-public-debut-looming-doordash-projected-450m-2019-loss" rel=""> lost an insane $450 million</a><span> off $900 million in revenue in 2019 (which does make me wonder if my dream of a decentralized network of pizza arbitrageurs does exist).</span></p><p><span>Uber Eats is Uber's "</span><a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/breaking-uber-eats-lead-steps-down-amid-profitability-struggles/572976/" rel="">most profitable division</a><span>” 😂😂. Uber Eats lost $461 million in Q4 2019 off of revenue of $734 million. Sometimes I need to write this out to remind myself. Uber Eats spent $1.2 billion to make $734 million. In one quarter.</span></p><p>Amazon just bailed on restaurant delivery in the U.S.</p><p>What is it about the food delivery platform business? Restaurants are hurt. The primary labor is treated poorly. And the businesses themselves are terrible.</p><p>&nbsp;This Business Insider piece did a good job covering the problematic dynamics of the industry:</p><blockquote><p>As this conflict comes to a boil, one thing is becoming clear: there are no winners in this fight.</p><p>Restaurant owners are losing money. Diners are seeing their costs raised, either by delivery companies that need to pay delivery drivers or by the restaurant owners who raise prices to offset delivery fees. And delivery drivers still make low, unpredictable wages frequently with no benefits.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>How did we get to a place where billions of dollars are exchanged in millions of business transactions but there are no winners? My co-host Can and my restaurant friend both defaulted to the notion “delivery is a shitty margin business” when discussing this post. But I don’t think that’s sufficient here. Delivery can work. Just look at a Domino’s stock chart. But, delivery has been carefully built as part of a holistic business model and infrastructure. Maybe that’s the viable model.&nbsp;</p><p>After the start of this pandemic, my friend actually launched in-house delivery at one of his restaurants. He said he’s starting to get a sense of the economics and explained he’s starting to get a sense of the volume required per location to make the economics reasonably work. That’s what is so odd to me about third-party delivery platforms. The business of food delivery clearly is not intrinsically a loser. Domino’s figured it out. Every Chinese restaurant in New York City seemed to have it figured out long before any platform came along. My friend is figuring it out. </p><p><span>That’s the thing about how industries have evolved over the past decade. I know </span><a href="https://themargins.substack.com/p/zirp-explains-the-world" rel="">I ascribe ZIRP</a><span> as the cause of all ills in the world, but this sometimes feels like the greatest ZIRP story ever told.</span></p><p><span>You have insanely large pools of capital creating an incredibly inefficient money-losing business model. It's used to subsidize an untenable customer expectation. You leverage a broken workforce to minimize your genuine labor expenses. The companies unload their capital cannons on customer acquisition, while this week’s Uber-Grubhub news reminds us, the only viable endgame i</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2020/05/13/ubers-grubhub-play-a-desperate-bid-to-save-a-business-everyone-hates/#279f0c304389" rel="">s a promise of monopoly concentration</a><span> and increased prices.&nbsp;But is that even viable? </span></p><p>Third-party delivery platforms, as they’ve been built, just seem like the wrong model, but instead of testing, failing, and evolving, they’ve been subsidized into market dominance. Maybe the right model is a wholly-owned supply chain like Domino’s. Maybe it’s some ghost kitchen / delivery platform hybrid. Maybe it’s just small networks of restaurants with out-of-the-box software. Whatever it is, we’ve been delayed in finding out thanks to this bizarrely bankrolled competition that sometimes feels like financial engineering worthy of my own pizza trading efforts.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The more I learn about food delivery platforms, as they exist today, I wonder if we’ve managed to watch an entire industry evolve artificially and incorrectly. Arbitrage is about taking advantage of market inefficiencies and for all the </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/barstool-sports-founder-dave-portnoy-tries-day-trading-and-loses-2020-4" rel="">newly minted day-traders out there</a><span>, perhaps it’s time to start looking into frontier markets like pizza.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Note 1: </strong><span>We found out afterward that was all the result of a “demand test” by Doordash. They have a test period where they scrape the restaurant’s website and don’t charge any fees to anyone, so they can ideally go to the restaurant with positive order data to then get the restaurant signed onto the platform. If we had to pay a customer fee on the order, it would’ve further cut into our arbitrage profits (though maybe we could’ve </span><a href="https://help.doordash.com/consumers/s/article/What-fees-do-I-pay?language=en_US" rel="">incorporated DashPass</a><span> as part of the calculation).&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Note 2</strong><span>: A few months ago, in the pre-pandemic times, I was at an East Village pizza place and watched as the owner was arguing with a Doordash driver. The owner insisted the driver take the pizza in a heated bag so the customer didn’t get cold pizza, but leave an ID so the driver would be compelled to return the bag. The driver argued the amount of time it would take to come back to return the bag would mean he couldn’t make enough deliveries to “pay my rent”. #Innovation.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">To handle multi-levels menus, loop through all the menu items to put them on the right levels, for example.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the <code>MenuItem::parent()</code> method to retrieve the parent instance of that menu item:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$items = Menu::slug('foo')->first()->items;
$parent = $items->first()->parent(); // Post, Page, CustomLink or Term (category)"><pre><span><span>$</span>items</span> = <span>Menu</span>::<span>slug</span>(<span>'foo'</span>)-&gt;<span>first</span>()-&gt;<span>items</span>;
<span><span>$</span>parent</span> = <span><span>$</span>items</span>-&gt;<span>first</span>()-&gt;<span>parent</span>(); <span>// Post, Page, CustomLink or Term (category)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To group menu items according their parents, you can use the <code>-&gt;groupBy()</code> method in the <code>$menu-&gt;items</code> collection, grouping menu items by their <code>$item-&gt;parent()-&gt;ID</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To read more about the <code>groupBy()</code> method <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/collections#method-groupby" rel="nofollow">take a look on the Laravel documentation</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">You can manipulate users in the same manner you work with posts:</p>

$users = User::get();

// A specific user
$user = User::find(1);
echo $user->user_login;"><pre><span>// All users</span>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using Laravel</h3><a id="user-content-using-laravel" aria-label="Permalink: Using Laravel" href="#using-laravel"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you're using Laravel 5.4 or older, make sure you have the <a href="#config-service-loader"><code>CorcelServiceProvider</code> provider registered</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">And then, define the user provider in <code>config/auth.php</code> to allow Laravel to login with WordPress users:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="'providers' => [
    'users' => [
        'driver' => 'corcel',
        'model'  => Corcel\Model\User::class,
    ],
],"><pre><span>'providers'</span> =&gt; [
    <span>'users'</span> =&gt; [

        <span>'model'</span>  =&gt; <span>Corcel</span>\<span>Model</span>\<span>User</span>::class,
    ],
],</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now you can use the <code>Auth</code> facade to authenticate users:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Auth::validate([
    'email' => 'admin@example.com', // or using 'username' too
    'password' => 'secret',
]);"><pre><span>Auth</span>::<span>validate</span>([
    <span>'email'</span> =&gt; <span>'admin@example.com'</span>, <span>// or using 'username' too</span>
    <span>'password'</span> =&gt; <span>'secret'</span>,
]);</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To make Laravel's Password Reset work with Corcel, we have to override how passwords are stored in the database. To do this, you must change <code>Auth/PasswordController.php</code> from:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\ResetsPasswords;

class PasswordController extends Controller

<span>class</span> <span>PasswordController</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Controller</span>
{
    <span>use</span> <span>ResetsPasswords</span>;</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">to</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\ResetsPasswords;
use Corcel\Laravel\Auth\ResetsPasswords as CorcelResetsPasswords;

class PasswordController extends Controller
{
    use ResetsPasswords, CorcelResetsPasswords {
        CorcelResetsPasswords::resetPassword insteadof ResetsPasswords;
    }"><pre><span>use</span> <span>App</span>\<span>Http</span>\<span>Controllers</span>\<span>Controller</span>;

<span>class</span> <span>PasswordController</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Controller</span>

   <p>About 170 billion cells are in the brain, and as they go about their regular tasks, they produce waste — a lot of it. To stay healthy, the brain needs to wash away all that debris. But how exactly it does this has remained a mystery.</p>   <p>Now, two teams of scientists have published three papers that offer a detailed description of the brain's waste-removal system. Their insights could help researchers better understand, treat and perhaps prevent a broad range of brain disorders.</p>   <p>The papers, all published in the journal <em>Nature</em>, suggest that during sleep, slow electrical waves push the fluid around cells from deep in the brain to its surface. There, a sophisticated interface allows the waste products in that fluid to be absorbed into the bloodstream, which takes them to the liver and kidneys to be removed from the body.</p>   
   <p>One of the waste products carried away is amyloid, the substance that forms sticky plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESG-S1-6177-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>There's growing evidence that in Alzheimer's disease, the brain's waste-removal system is impaired, says <a href="https://psychiatry.uw.edu/profile/jeff-iliff/">Jeffrey Iliff</a>, who studies neurodegenerative diseases at the University of Washington but was not a part of the new studies.</p>   <p>The new findings should help researchers understand precisely where the problem is and perhaps fix it, Iliff says.</p>   <p>"If we restore drainage, can we prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease?" he asks.<br></p>   <h3>A brief history of brainwashing</h3>   <p>The new studies come more than a decade after Iliff and <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/112359252-maiken-nedergaard">Dr. Maiken Nedergaard</a>, a Danish scientist, first proposed that the clear fluids in and around the brain are part of a system to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/18/236211811/brains-sweep-themselves-clean-of-toxins-during-sleep">wash away</a> waste products.</p>   <p>The scientists named it the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4636982/#:~:text=Abstract,from%20the%20central%20nervous%20system.">glymphatic system</a>, a nod to the body's <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/lymphatic-system">lymphatic system</a>, which helps fight infection, maintain fluid levels and filter out waste products and abnormal cells.</p>   <p>Both systems work like plumbing in a house, says <a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/people/jonathan-kipnis-phd/">Jonathan Kipnis</a> of Washington University in St. Louis, an author of two of the new papers.</p>   <p>"You have the water pipes and the sewage pipes," Kipnis says. "So the water comes in clean, and then you wash your hands, and the dirty water goes out."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESG-S1-6177-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>But the lymphatic system uses a network of thin tubes that transports waste to the bloodstream. The brain lacks these tubes.</p>   <p>So scientists have spent decades trying to answer a fundamental question, Kipnis says: "How does a waste molecule from the middle of the brain make it all the way out to the borders of the brain" and ultimately out of the body?</p>   <p>Part of the answer came in 2012 and 2013, when Iliff and Nedergaard began proposing the glymphatic system. They showed that in sleeping animals, cerebrospinal fluid begins to flow quickly through the brain, flushing out waste.</p>   
   <p>But what was pushing the fluid? And how was it transporting waste across the barrier that usually separates brain tissue from the bloodstream?<br></p>   <h3>Waves that wash</h3>   <p>Kipnis and his team began looking at what the brain was doing as it slept. As part of that effort, they measured the power of a slow electrical wave that appears during deep sleep in animals.</p>   <p>And they realized something: "By measuring the wave, we are also measuring the flow of interstitial fluid," the liquid found in the spaces around cells, Kipnis says.</p>   <p>It turned out that the waves were acting as a signal, synchronizing the activity of neurons and transforming them into tiny pumps that push fluid toward the brain's surface, the team <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07108-6">reported</a> in February in the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p>   <p>In a second paper published in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>, a team led by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07132-6">provided</a> more evidence that slow electrical waves help clear out waste.</p>   <p>The team used mice that develop a form of Alzheimer's. They exposed these mice to bursts of sound and light that occurred 40 times a second.</p>

   <p>The stimulation induced brain waves in the animals that occurred at the same, slow frequency.</p>   <p>Tests showed that the waves increased the flow of clean cerebrospinal fluid into the brain and the flow of dirty fluid out of the brain. They also showed that the fluid was carrying amyloid, the substance that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.</p>   <p>In a paper published a few weeks earlier, Kipnis had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06993-7">shown</a> how waste, including amyloid, appeared to be crossing the protective membrane that usually isolates the brain.</p>   <p>Kipnis and his team focused on a vein that passes through this membrane.</p>   <p>"Around the vein, you have a sleeve, which is never fully sealed," he says. "That's where the [cerebrospinal fluid] is coming out" and transferring waste to the body's lymphatic system.<br></p>   
   <h3>From mice to humans</h3>   <p>Together, the new studies suggest that keeping the brain's waste-clearance system functioning requires two distinct steps: one to push waste into the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain, and another to move it into the lymphatic system and eventually out of the body.</p>   <p>"We've described them separately," Iliff says, "but from a biological perspective, they almost certainly are coupled."</p>   <p>Iliff says many of the new findings in mice still need to be confirmed in people.</p>   <p>"The anatomical differences between a rodent and a human," he says, "they're pretty substantial."</p>   <p>But he says the results are consistent with research on what leads to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's.</p>   <p>Researchers know that the brain's waste-clearance system can be impaired by age, injuries and diseases that clog blood vessels in the brain.</p>   <p>"All of these are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease," Iliff says.</p>   <p>Impaired waste removal may also be a factor in Parkinson's disease, headache and even depression, Iliff says. So finding ways to help the brain clean itself — perhaps by inducing those slow electrical waves — might prevent a wide array of disorders.</p>

The company discovered that its Grid Program, which relies on BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing, had been compromised. An anonymous representative of Webhard said, “There is a suspicion of a hacking attack on our grid service. It’s very malicious, interfering with it.”</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-320-80.jpg" alt="anonymous interview" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eh9wdjpUZxxWANPfg2aPZa.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JTBC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Upon further investigation, the company noted that all affected users had KT as their internet service provider. The representative added, “Only KT users have problems. What the malware does on the user’s PC is to create strange folders or make file invisible. It completely disables the Webhard program itself. In some cases, the PC itself was also disabled because of it, so we reported it.”</p><p>Police officials acted on the information and discovered it came from KT’s own data center south of Seoul. The authorities say that KT may have violated South Korean laws, including the Protection of Communications Secrets Act and the Information and Communications Network Act. They’ve since identified and charged 13 individuals, including KT employees and subcontractors directly connected to the malware attack last November, but the investigations continue today.</p><p>According to the news report, KT said it directly planted the malware on its customers that use Webhard’s Grid Service, as it was a malicious program and that “it had no choice but to control it.” However, the main problem here wasn’t Webhard’s use of the BitTorrent protocol but the installation of malware on customer computers without consent.</p><p>Webhard and KT have fought in the past over the latter’s use of its Grid Service. The former says that it’s saving tens of billions of Korean Won by allowing its users to use peer-to-peer services to store and transfer data instead of storing it on its servers. On the other hand, the massive number of Grid Service users is straining KT’s network, and the two companies went to court to resolve the issue.</p><p>The judiciary actually ruled in favor of KT. It said that Webhard didn’t pay KT network usage fees for its peer-to-peer system and didn’t explain to its users how the Grid Service works in detail. Therefore, it wasn’t unreasonable for KT to block Webhard’s network traffic.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-mujQK3rg8fEA3M9msPzBWa"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-320-80.jpg" alt="South Korean court ruling on Webhard-KT Case" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CxDRwxb8KQdmKW9GkFcTZ.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JTBC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But instead of blocking IP addresses, KT nuked Grid Service users with malware.

<p>NASA is fostering continued scientific, educational, and technological developments in low Earth orbit to benefit humanity, while also supporting deep space exploration at the Moon and Mars. As the agency transitions to commercially owned space destinations closer to home, it is crucial to prepare for the safe and responsible deorbit of the International Space Station in a controlled manner after the end of its operational life in 2030.</p>
<p>NASA announced SpaceX has been selected to develop and deliver the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle that will provide the capability to deorbit the space station and ensure avoidance of risk to populated areas.</p>
<p>“Selecting a U.S. Deorbit Vehicle for the International Space Station will help NASA and its international partners ensure a safe and responsible transition in low Earth orbit at the end of station operations. This decision also supports NASA’s plans for future commercial destinations and allows for the continued use of space near Earth,” said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for Space Operations Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “The orbital laboratory remains a blueprint for science, exploration, and partnerships in space for the benefit of all.”</p>
<p>While the company will develop the deorbit spacecraft, NASA will take ownership after development and operate it throughout its mission. Along with the space station, it is expected to destructively breakup as part of the re-entry process.</p>
<p>Since 1998, five space agencies, CSA (Canadian Space Agency), ESA (European Space Agency), JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), and State Space Corporation Roscosmos, have operated the International Space Station with each agency responsible for managing and controlling the hardware it provides. The station was designed to be interdependent and relies on contributions from across the partnership to function. The United States, Japan, Canada, and the participating countries of ESA have committed to operating the station through 2030. Russia has committed to continued station operations through at least 2028. The safe deorbit of the International Space Station is the responsibility of all five space agencies.</p>
<p>The single-award contract has a total potential value of $843 million. The launch service for the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle will be a future procurement.</p>
<p>In its 24th year of continuously crewed operations, the space station is a unique scientific platform where crew members conduct experiments across multiple disciplines of research, including Earth and space science, biology, human physiology, physical sciences, and technology demonstrations not possible on Earth. Crews living aboard station are the hands of thousands of researchers on the ground having conducted more than 3,300 experiments in microgravity. Station is the cornerstone of space commerce, from commercial crew and cargo partnerships to commercial research and national lab research, and lessons learned aboard International Space Station are helping to pass the torch to future commercial stations.</p>

There’s no attachment, no resentment, no shame, no guilt, nothing. </p><p>Everything standing in the way of a spontaneous glimpse of enlightenment has been dismantled.</p><p>This could explain why dissociatives like xenon can induce such powerful “bliss” states of consciousness (euphoria). </p><p>Xenon is extremely expensive — a single 30-second dose costs between $50 and $80. This cost comes from the extreme lengths required to get it. </p><p>Large extractors condense massive amounts of ambient air into a liquid.

Argon and neon cost about $2 per liter each. </p><p>Because of these prices, xenon use is reserved for luxury clinics, and the psychedelic elite willing to spend upwards of $300 for just a few minutes of xenon-induced enlightenment.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png" width="1456" height="1048" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1048,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:477417,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a6e1923-75c7-4ab1-aa8b-0d1c7f668742_1456x1048.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Xenon was discovered in 1898 but wasn’t used as an anesthetic agent for the first time until 1951.

This is then filtered and recondensed to use again and again.

Therefore, inhaling too much xenon for too long can cause asphyxiation and death.</p><p>This poses a particularly high risk for people self-administering xenon through a respirator mask. If too much xenon is inhaled, the user may lose consciousness and become unable to remove the respirator. They will continue breathing in xenon, which continues to displace oxygen. Just 10 minutes of this is long enough to cause irreversible brain damage or death.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s extremely important to never use xenon gas alone.</p><p>Aside from the risk of asphyxiation, xenon has a very low risk of causing harm.

for DOS as our writing tool of choice.

</p><p>
Still, most of us have endured years of mindless criticism of our 
decision, usually from WordPerfect users, and especially from 
WordPerfect users who have never tried anything <i>but</i> that 
program.  I've used WordStar, WordPerfect, Word, MultiMate, 
Sprint, XyWrite, and just about every other MS-DOS and Windows 
word-processing package, and WordStar is <i>by far</i> my 
favorite choice for creative composition at the keyboard.  

</p><p>
That's the key point:  <i>aiding creative composition</i>.  To 
understand how WordStar does that better than other programs, let 
me start with a little history.

</p><center><h3>AN INTERFACE DESIGNED FOR TOUCH TYPISTS</h3></center>

<p>
WordStar was first released in 1979, before there was any 
standardization in computer keyboards.  At that time, many 
keyboards lacked arrow keys for cursor movement and special 
function keys for issuing commands.  Some even lacked such keys 
as <code>Tab</code>, <code>Insert</code>, <code>Delete</code>, <code>Backspace</code>, and <code>Enter</code>.

</p><p>
About all you could count on was having a standard QWERTY 
typewriter layout of alphanumeric keys and a <code>Control</code> key.  The 
<code>Control</code> key is a specialized shift key.  When depressed 
simultaneously with an alphabetic key, it causes the keyboard to 
generate a specific command instruction, rather than the letter.  
The control codes are named <code>Ctrl-A</code> through <code>Ctrl-Z</code> (there are 
a few punctuation keys that can generate control codes, too).  
Control codes are frequently indicated in text by preceding the 
letter with a caret, like so:  <code>^A</code>.  

</p><p>
WordStar's original designers, Seymour Rubinstein and Rob 
Barnaby, selected five control codes to be prefixes for bringing 
up additional menus of functions:  <code>^O</code> for On-screen functions; <code>^Q</code> 
for Quick cursor functions; <code>^P</code> for Print functions; <code>^K</code> for block 
and file functions; and <code>^J</code> for help.  

</p><p>
Now, the first three of these are alphabetically mnemonic.  The 
last two, <code>^K</code> and <code>^J</code>, might at first glance seem to be arbitrary 
choices.  They aren't.  Look at a typewriter keyboard.  You'll 
see that for a touch typist, the two strongest fingers of the 
right hand rest over <code>^J</code> and <code>^K</code> on the home typing row.  WordStar 
recognizes that the most-often-used functions should be the 
easiest to physically execute.  

</p><p>
To serve as arrow keys for moving the cursor up, left, right, or 
down, WordStar adopted <code>^E</code>, <code>^S</code>, <code>^D</code>, and <code>^X</code>.  Again, looking at a 
typewriter keyboard makes the logic of this plain.  These four 
keys are arranged in a diamond under the left hand:

</p><pre><center>
<code><b>E</b></code><br>
<code><b>S</b></code> <code><b>D</b></code><br>
<code><b>X</b></code>
</center>
</pre>
<p>
Such positional, as opposed to alphabetic, mnemonics form a large 
part of the WordStar interface.  Additional cursor-movement 
commands are clustered around the <code>E</code>/<code>S</code>/<code>D</code>/<code>X</code> diamond:

</p><pre><center>
<code><span color="BLACK">W</span></code> <code><b>E</b></code> <code><span color="BLACK">R</span></code><br>
<code><span color="BLACK">A</span></code> <code><b>S</b></code> <code><b>D</b></code> <code><span color="BLACK">F</span></code><br>
<code><span color="BLACK">Z</span></code> <code><b>X</b></code> <code><span color="BLACK">C</span></code>
</center>
</pre>
<p>
<code>^A</code> and <code>^F</code>, on the home typing row, move the cursor left and right 
by words.  <code>^W</code> and <code>^Z</code>, to the left of the cursor-up and 
cursor-down commands, scroll the screen up and down by single 
lines.  <code>^R</code> and <code>^C</code>, to the right of the cursor-up and cursor-down 
commands, scroll the screen up and down a page at a time (a 
"page" in the computer sense of a full screen of text).  

</p><p>
<code>^Q</code>, the aforementioned quick-cursor-movement menu prefix, extends 
the power of this diamond.  Just as <code>^E</code>, <code>^S</code>, <code>^D</code>, <code>^X</code> move the 
cursor up, left, right, and down by single characters, <code>^QE</code>, <code>^QS</code>, 
<code>^QD</code>, and <code>^QX</code> move it all the way to the top, left, right, or 
bottom of the screen.  <code>^W</code> scrolls up one line; <code>^QW</code> scrolls up 
continuously.  <code>^Z</code> scrolls down one line; <code>^QZ</code> scrolls down 
continuously.  And since <code>^R</code> and <code>^C</code> take you to the top and bottom 
of the screen, <code>^QR</code> and <code>^QC</code> take you to the top and bottom of the 
document.  There are many more <code>^Q</code> commands, but I think you can 
see from this sampling that there is an underlying logic to the 
WordStar interface, something sorely lacking in many other 
programs&nbsp;— <i>particularly</i> WordPerfect.  

</p><p>
Now, for many of these functions there are dedicated keys on IBM 
PC keyboards.  WordStar allows you to use these, if you're so 
inclined.  But touch-typists find that using the WordStar 
<code>Control</code>-key commands is much more efficient, because they can be 
typed from the home row without hunting for special keys 
elsewhere on the keyboard.  Because of this, many applications, 
including dBase, SuperCalc, SideKick, CompuServe's TAPCIS and 
OzCis, Genie's Aladdin, Xtree Pro, and even Microsoft's own editor 
included with MS-DOS 5.0 and above, have adopted some or all of 
the WordStar interface.  

</p><p>
Some keyboards have the <code>Control</code> key to the left of the letter 
<code>A</code>.  This makes using WordStar commands very simple.  Other 
keyboards instead have <code>CapsLock</code> next to the <code>A</code> and place 
the <code>Control</code> key below the left <code>Shift</code> key, making WordStar 
commands a bit of a stretch.  Because of this, WordStar comes 
with a utility called SWITCH.COM to optionally swap the functions 
of the <code>CapsLock</code> and <code>Control</code> keys.  One of the problems with 
other word-processing programs is that many commands can only 
easily be issued through function and dedicated cursor keys, and 
the locations of these keys changes radically from keyboard to 
keyboard (for instance, function keys are sometimes arrayed as 
two columns of five on the left-hand side of the keyboard and 
sometimes as a continuous row across the top of the keyboard; 
cursor keys are sometimes clustered in a diamond and sometimes 
laid out in an inverted-T shape; on laptop computers you may have 
to press a special <code>Fn</code> key in combination with the arrow keys to 
access <code>PgUp</code> and other functions, making using these programs an 
exercise in contortion).  But all one has to do to make 
<i>any</i> keyboard an optimal WordStar keyboard is run the 
<code>CapsLock</code> / <code>Control</code> switcher, if necessary.  The locations of the 
other keys are irrelevant, because you don't need them for 
WordStar.  

</p><p>
On the other hand, WordPerfect's interface forces touch typists 
to constantly move their hands from the home typing row, slowing 
them down.  To issue a WordPerfect command, you must first press 
a function key, either separately, or simultaneously with a 
<code>Control</code>, <code>Shift</code>, or <code>Alt</code> key.  Then, for many functions, you 
must select a sub-function.  Now that your hands have moved to 
the bank of function keys, can you select your sub-function using 
them as well?  You cannot.  Rather, you must next reposition your 
hands to the numeric keys and select your sub-function by number.  
Finally, you must re-orient your hands on the home row before 
continuing typing (recent versions of WordPerfect attempt to 
smooth out this tortuous interface, but it's still difficult to 
use).

</p><center><h3>THE LONG-HAND PAGE METAPHOR</h3></center>

<p>
Now, I'm a big fan of the WordStar <code>Control</code>-key interface:  for 
text applications, it lets me interact with my computer more 
efficiently than any other interface I've yet seen.  However, I 
don't think it's this interface that's got me hooked, at least 
not at the keystroke level.  I've written published reviews of 
all major DOS word processors, and I've concluded that there are 
other specific strengths that bring me back to WordStar time and 
again.

</p><p>
Let me speak generally for a moment.  I've concluded that there 
are two basic metaphors for pre-computer writing.  One is the 
long-hand manuscript page.  The other is the typewritten page.  
Most word processors have decided to emulate the second&nbsp;— and, 
at first glance, that would seem to be the logical one to adopt.  
But, as a creative writer, I am convinced that the long-hand page 
is the better metaphor.

</p><p>
Consider:  On a long-hand page, you can jump back and forth in 
your document with ease.  You can put in bookmarks, either actual 
paper ones, or just fingers slipped into the middle of the 
manuscript stack.  You can annotate the manuscript for yourself 
with comments like "Fix this!" or "Don't forget to check these 
facts" without there being any possibility of you missing them 
when you next work on the document.  And you can mark a block, 
either by circling it with your pen, or by physically cutting it 
out, without necessarily having to do anything with it right 
away.  The entire document is your workspace.

</p><p>
On a typewritten page, on the other hand, you are forced to deal 
with the next sequential character.  Your thoughts are focussed 
serially on the typing of the document.  If you're in the middle 
of a line halfway down page 7, your only easy option is to 
continue on that line.  To go backwards to check something is 
difficult, to put in a comment that won't show when your document 
is read by somebody else is impossible, and so on.  Typing is a 
top-down, linear process, not at all conducive to the intuitive, 
leaping-here-and-there kind of thought human beings are good at.  

</p><p>
Now, a word processor that uses the typewriter metaphor&nbsp;— 
WordPerfect is one&nbsp;— might be ideal for low-level secretarial 
work:  proceeding top-down through a document that has been 
created in content and structure by somebody else.  But for one 
who must start with absolutely nothing and create, from scratch, 
a coherent document with complex and subtle structures, the 
long-hand-page metaphor is the way to go.  

</p><p>
WordStar's <code>^Q</code> (Quick cursor movement) and <code>^K</code> (block) commands 
give me more of what I used to have when I wrote in longhand than 
any other product does.  WordStar's powerful suite of cursor 
commands lets me fly all over my manuscript, without ever getting 
lost.  That's because WordStar is constantly keeping track of 
where I've been and where I'm likely to want to go.  <code>^QB</code> will 
take me to the beginning of the marked block; <code>^QK</code> will take me to 
the end; <code>^QV</code> will take me to where the marked block was moved 
from; <code>^QP</code> will take me to my previous cursor position.  And, just 
as I used to juggle up to ten fingers inserted into various 
places in my paper manuscript, WordStar provides me with ten 
bookmarks, set with <code>^K0</code> through <code>^K9</code>, and ten commands to jump to 
them, <code>^Q0</code> to <code>^Q9</code>.  

</p><p>
Other WordStar cursor-movement commands, some of which were 
mentioned earlier, make life extraordinarily easy (left and right 
end of line, top and bottom of screen, top and bottom of 
document, forward to specified character, backwards to specified 
characters&nbsp;— all touch-typable, all issued without ever taking 
my eyes off the screen).  And its robust find commands run 
circles around WordPerfect's (for example, WordPerfect can't find 
a single word without also finding that same string of characters 
if it's embedded in another word).  

</p><p>
If I want to make a note to myself, WordStar lets me simply type 
it in my document.  WordStar will not print a line beginning with 
double periods, like so:

<!--<PRE><CENTER><FONT COLOR=BROWN>.. check the length of Jupiter's year</FONT></CENTER></PRE>-->
</p><pre><center><span color="BROWN">.. check date of birth</span></center></pre>

<p>
However, there's no way I can miss such a comment when I re-edit 
the document.  Until recently, WordPerfect didn't allow that&nbsp;— 
again, it tripped on the typewritten-page metaphor:  if you put 
something in the document, it assumes you must want it in the 
final printout.  (Hidden comments, another feature provided by 
both WordStar and WordPerfect, don't provide this same 
functionality, although they do have their uses.)

</p><p>
The typewritten-page metaphor is a machine-in-control situation:  
you must do what the machine wants you to do.  Block marking is a 
perfect example.  In WordPerfect, if I want to mark a block, I am 
forced to think through a serial sequence of steps, and execute 
them in turn.  Now, that's fine for straight secretarial work, 
but when one is <i>creating at the keyboard</i>, one wants to 
capture the most fleeting of thoughts, the most complex of ideas, 
before they evaporate into the ether, lost for good.  The 
human-machine interface must let me stop and get a thought down, 
not force me to hang on until the computer is ready for me to go 
back to thinking.  

</p><p>
WordPerfect requires that I decide whether I want to cut or copy 
a block, then immediately mark the beginning of the block, then 
immediately mark the end of the block, then immediately position 
the cursor at where I want the block to go, then immediately move 
the block, and then find my way back to the place where I was 
originally working.  From the moment I decide I might, perhaps, 
want to do something with a block of text to the moment I 
actually finish that operation, WordPerfect is in control, 
dictating what I must do.

</p><p>
WordStar, with its long-hand-page metaphor, says, hey, do 
whatever you want whenever you want to.  This is a good spot to 
mark the beginning of a block?  Fine.  What would <i>you</i> like 
to do next?  Deal with the block?  Continue writing?  Use the 
thesaurus?

</p><p>
After another half hour of writing, I can say, <i>ah hah!</i>, 
this is where I want to end that block.  And two hours later I 
can say, and <i>this</i> is where that block should go.  I'm in 
control, not the program.  That's clearly more powerful, more 
intuitive, and more flexible than any other method of text 
manipulation I've yet seen implemented in a word processor.  That 
WordStar lets me have separate marked blocks in each of its 
editing windows multiplies that power substantially:  imagine 
doing a cut and paste job between two versions of a paper 
document, but being told that you could only have one piece cut 
out at a time.  Madness!  Yet that's what WordPerfect, Microsoft 
Word, and others would force you to do.  (In WordStar 7.0, you 
can even, in essence, have two marked blocks per window, toggling 
between them with the "mark previous block" command, <code>^KU</code>.)

</p><p>
Over the years, it's become clear to me that writers work in 
unique ways.  Little things make a big difference to how 
effectively they can interface with their machines.  WordStar 
provides a vast suite of customizability options&nbsp;— hundreds of 
things ranging from which specific punctuation characters are 
jumped over when moving the cursor by words, through how much 
help to provide the user, to whether the inches/columns indicator 
in the status line should update instantly as you type, or (in 
case you find that visually distracting) should wait quietly 
until you pause for a length of time you specify before updating.  
It's important that the writing tool adapt to the writer, not the 
other way around.  WordStar is strong because it can fit me like 
a comfortable old shoe, and then make itself over completely to 
fit somebody else just as well.

</p><p>
Finally, to come back to the keyboard interface, I think WordStar 
is the least <i>modal</i> word processor I have ever used.  On 
long-hand paper, writing and editing are one fluid task:  there's 
no barrier to discourage you from switching between adding new 
material and modifying existing material.  On a typed page, these 
tasks are quite distinct, especially with non-electronic 
typewriters.  To change a word is a completely different spectrum 
of activities, and therefore a completely different mindset, 
from simply adding new words.

</p><p>
Many word-processing programs hark back to the decidedly modal 
days of Liquid Paper:  they have you input new material from the 
main typing area, but for editing make you move your hands from that 
area to the cursor pad, the function keys, or a mouse, and then 
step through layers of menus (as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word 
do) or switch to a command line (as XyWrite and Nota Bene do).  
These typewriter-metaphor programs compartmentalize writing and 
editing in an unnatural fashion.  The human mind does not 
distinguish between these activities in any gross way; neither 
should the program.

</p><p>
WordStar's adoption of the long-hand-page metaphor provides its 
strength in this area, too.  On a WordStar-friendly keyboard (one 
with <code>Control</code> adjacent to the <code>A</code> key, or one that has been 
remapped using the SWITCH.COM utility mentioned earlier), 
changing between writing and editing modes is as simple as 
pivoting one's left pinkie.  It's effortless and does not cause a 
switching of mental gears.  The distinction between the modes is 
no more distracting than the lifting of ball-point from paper to 
reposition one's pen.  Writing and revising are a continuum.  
WordStar supports that, whereas, again, competing programs 
demand that I adapt to their method of doing things, instead of 
the other way around.

</p><p>
For me, it's clear:  WordStar offers a more productive approach 
<i>at its most fundamental design level</i> than does its 
competition.

<i>The foregoing analysis originally appeared on The WordStar Forum 
of the CompuServe Information Service, where it seemed to strike 
a responsive chord.  Herewith some excerpts from the responses 
posted there:</i>

</p><blockquote>"Thanks, Robert, for a very insightful analysis of 
why I, neither a professional writer nor professional editor, 
like WordStar."

<p>
"<i>Exactly so,</i> Rob.  It is a monumentally frustrating and 
distracting experience to have to think about dealing with the 
machine when I am cogitating on the words I want to write, the 
thoughts I am trying to capture.  For that process, which is 
quite fundamentally different than page-formatting, WordStar is 
utterly unobtrusive, passive until I tell it to be otherwise, and 
completely transparent."

</p><p>
"Your analysis gave an explanation to my feelings.  Whenever 
lawyers ask me what I like about using WordStar, my response has 
always been that the expressing of words and thoughts translate 
effortlessly into the printed page."

</p><p>
"Thank you for analyzing and articulating these fundamental 
advantages of WordStar.  I've never seen such an insightful and 
on-target exposition of this topic anywhere."

</p><p>
"The typewriter-vs.-manuscript metaphor is brilliant.  Although a 
pretty good touch typist since high school days, I was never able 
to compose at the typewriter.  After every line or two, I want to 
go back and edit what I've just composed, and the typewriter just 
isn't a very good way to do that.  When I first started WordStar 
on a CP/M machine, what impressed me most was that it enabled me 
to compose at the keyboard very much like the way I would compose 
on the written page, but with the productivity advantage of a 
`typewriter.'  I've never had quite the same feeling about any 
other word processor."</p></blockquote>

Websites on any paid plan can turn on this feature with a single click.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/06/image1-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1548" height="322"></figure><p>You can find this new feature under <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings">Security ⇒ Settings</a> on any zone using Cloudflare.</p><p>Contrary to what is stated on the polyfill.io website, Cloudflare has never recommended the polyfill.io service or authorized their use of Cloudflare’s name on their website. We have asked them to remove the false statement and they have, so far, ignored our requests. This is yet another warning sign that they cannot be trusted.</p><p>If you are not using Cloudflare today, we still highly recommend that you remove any use of polyfill.io and/or find an alternative solution. And, while the automatic replacement function will handle most cases, the best practice is to remove polyfill.io from your projects and replace it with a secure alternative mirror like Cloudflare’s even if you are a customer.</p><p>You can do this by searching your code repositories for instances of polyfill.io and replacing it with <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/">cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/</a> (Cloudflare’s mirror). This is a non-breaking change as the two URLs will serve the same polyfill content. All website owners, regardless of the website using Cloudflare, should do this now.</p><h2 id="how-we-came-to-this-decision">How we came to this decision</h2><p>Back in February, the domain polyfill.io, which hosts a popular JavaScript library, was sold to a new owner: Funnull, a relatively unknown company. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/polyfill-io-now-available-on-cdnjs-reduce-your-supply-chain-risk">At the time, we were concerned</a> that this created a supply chain risk. This led us to spin up our own mirror of the polyfill.io code hosted under cdnjs, a JavaScript library repository sponsored by Cloudflare.</p><p>The new owner was unknown in the industry and did not have a track record of trust to administer a project such as polyfill.io. The concern, <a href="https://x.com/triblondon/status/1761852117579427975">highlighted even by the original author</a>, was that if they were to abuse polyfill.io by injecting additional code to the library, it could cause far reaching security problems on the Internet affecting several hundreds of thousands websites. Or it could be used to perform a targeted supply-chain attack against specific websites.</p><p>Unfortunately, that worry came true on June 25, 2024 as the polyfill.io service was being used to inject nefarious code that, under certain circumstances, redirected users to other websites.</p><p>We have taken the exceptional step of using our ability to modify HTML on the fly to replace references to the polyfill.io CDN in our customers’ websites with links to our own, safe, mirror created back in February.</p><p>In the meantime, additional threat feed providers have also taken the decision to <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/commit/91dfc54aed0f0aa514c1a481c3e63ea16da94c03">flag the domain as malicious</a>. We have not outright blocked the domain through any of the mechanisms we have because we are concerned it could cause widespread web outages given how broadly polyfill.io is used with some estimates indicating <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-polyfillio">usage on nearly 4% of all websites</a>.</p><h3 id="corroborating-data-with-page-shield">Corroborating data with Page Shield</h3><p>The original report indicates that malicious code was injected that, under certain circumstances, would redirect users to betting sites. It was doing this by loading additional JavaScript that would perform the redirect, under a set of additional domains which can be considered Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):</p><pre><code>https://www.googie-anaiytics.com/analytics.js

When turned on, it collects information about JavaScript files loaded by end user browsers accessing your website.</p><p>By looking at the database of detected JavaScript files, we immediately found matches with the IoCs provided above starting as far back as 2024-06-08 15:23:51 (first seen timestamp on Page Shield detected JavaScript file). This was a clear indication that malicious activity was active and associated with polyfill.io.</p><h3 id="replacing-insecure-javascript-links-to-polyfillio">Replacing insecure JavaScript links to polyfill.io</h3><p>To achieve performant HTML rewriting, we need to make blazing-fast HTML alterations as responses stream through Cloudflare’s network. This has been made possible by leveraging <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rust-nginx-module">ROFL (Response Overseer for FL)</a>. ROFL powers various Cloudflare products that need to alter HTML as it streams, such as <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/fonts/">Cloudflare Fonts,</a> <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/">Email Obfuscation</a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/rocket-loader/">Rocket Loader</a></p><p>ROFL is developed entirely in Rust. The memory-safety features of Rust are indispensable for ensuring protection against memory leaks while processing a staggering volume of requests, measuring in the millions per second. Rust's compiled nature allows us to finely optimize our code for specific hardware configurations, delivering performance gains compared to interpreted languages.</p><p>The performance of ROFL allows us to rewrite HTML on-the-fly and modify the polyfill.io links quickly, safely, and efficiently. This speed helps us reduce any additional latency added by processing the HTML file.</p><p>If the feature is turned on, for any HTTP response with an HTML Content-Type, we parse all JavaScript script tag source attributes. If any are found linking to polyfill.io, we rewrite the src attribute to link to our mirror instead. We map to the correct version of the polyfill service while the query string is left untouched.</p><p>The logic will not activate if a Content Security Policy (CSP) header is found in the response. This ensures we don’t replace the link while breaking the CSP policy and therefore potentially breaking the website.</p><h3 id="default-on-for-free-customers-optional-for-everyone-else">Default on for free customers, optional for everyone else</h3><p>Cloudflare proxies millions of websites, and a large portion of these sites are on our free plan. Free plan customers tend to have simpler applications while not having the resources to update and react quickly to security concerns. We therefore decided to turn on the feature by default for sites on our free plan, as the likelihood of causing issues is reduced while also helping keep safe a very large portion of applications using polyfill.io.</p><p>Paid plan customers, on the other hand, have more complex applications and react quicker to security notices. We are confident that most paid customers using polyfill.io and Cloudflare will appreciate the ability to virtually patch the issue with a single click, while controlling when to do so.</p><p>All customers can turn off the feature at any time.</p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve decided a security problem was so widespread and serious that we’d enable protection for all customers regardless of whether they were a paying customer or not. Back in 2014, we enabled <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/shellshock-protection-enabled-for-all-customers">Shellshock protection</a> for everyone. In 2021, when the log4j vulnerability was disclosed <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cve-2021-44228-log4j-rce-0-day-mitigation/">we rolled out protection</a> for all customers.</p><h2 id="do-not-use-polyfillio">Do not use polyfill.io</h2><p>If you are using Cloudflare, you can remove polyfill.io with a single click on the Cloudflare dashboard by heading over to <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings">your zone ⇒ Security ⇒ Settings</a>. If you are a free customer, the rewrite is automatically active. This feature, we hope, will help you quickly patch the issue.</p><p>Nonetheless, you should ultimately search your code repositories for instances of polyfill.io and replace them with an alternative provider, such as Cloudflare’s secure mirror under cdnjs (<a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/">https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/</a>).
