            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-10-25-2%5E18-dollars-to-open-source.html">https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-10-25-2%5E18-dollars-to-open-source.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38010244">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
Yesterday I read a great article from Sentry entitled
<a href="https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-500-000-dollars-to-open-source-maintainers/">"We
Just Gave $500,000 to Open Source Maintainers"</a>, and it made me wonder
just how much <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a> had spent
on supporting open source software over the years.  Ever since
<a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-12.html">December 2009</a>
Tarsnap has spent 100% of its December operating profits on supporting
open source software — which, since needs for support aren't limited
to December, means that Tarsnap hands out money throughout the year, and
at the end of the year (when I know how much profit Tarsnap made in
December) I send whatever is left in the "budget" to the
<a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation</a>.
Going through 14 years of accounting spreadsheets brought me to a total
of $274,482 — or in binary terms, slightly over 2^18 USD.
</p><p>
The largest recipient of this funding every year has been the FreeBSD
Foundation, and to date they have received $173,920.  It's hard to
overstate the importance of the work the Foundation does; they provide
hardware which keeps the FreeBSD project running, they fund a myriad
of independent projects, and they have full-time developers who get
thrown in to fixing whatever needs to be fixed from time to time.
While FreeBSD is unusual among open source projects in that the FreeBSD
project governance is entirely independent of the FreeBSD Foundation,
the FreeBSD project would be immeasurably worse off without the support
of the FreeBSD Foundation.
</p><p>
The second largest recipient of support from Tarsnap has been the
<a href="https://www.bsdnow.tv/">BSD Now</a> podcast, which has received
$47,500 to date.  Now at their 529th episode, they fill an important
niche in the BSD world, being one of the only places people can hear
what's going on across all the BSD operating systems.  As developers,
we're generally lousy at communication, and while technical journalists
(e.g., Phoronix) sometimes report on things happening in the BSD world,
they generally lack the technical knowledge to be consistently accurate.
BSD Now, being produced by <i>actual developers</i>, bridges the two
solitudes.
</p><p>
Third comes <a href="https://www.bsdcan.org/">BSDCan</a>, which has
received $23,188 to date.  In addition to being in Canada — which,
as a Canadian, I have to admit influences me somewhat — BSDCan is
the largest BSD conference in the world and plays an essential role in
bringing together developers to discuss and learn about each others'
work.  Email and IRC are great, but sometimes face-to-face conversations
make a huge difference.
</p><p>
Next comes the annual FreeBSD developer summits held at BSDCan.  These
"piggy back" on BSDCan in the sense that they can take advantage of the
fact that BSDCan is already getting a lot of people to travel to one
spot — but BSDCan does not pay for the rooms, A/V, coffee, or any
of the other miscellaneous costs associated with running a developer
summit.  Tarsnap has contributed $11,062 to those.
</p><p>
While most of the money Tarsnap contributes to open source software is
focused on the BSD world — that's what Tarsnap uses — it does
provide funding for an
<a href="https://awards-search.sfu.ca/Home/AwardDetail/72006">annual
award</a> at my Alma Mater for students who contribute to open source
software.  To date Tarsnap has contributed $7,839 to this.
</p><p>
Finally there's a bunch of miscellaneous sponsorships — conferences,
developers, travel grants, etc. — adding up to $10,972.  (Or maybe
a bit more; there were a lot of these and I might have missed some while
I was putting together my list.)
</p><p>
Tarsnap's 2^18 USD of financial support for open source software over the
past 14 years is only a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed, and
indeed I wish we could contribute more; Tarsnap would not exist without
all of the open source software if runs on.  On the other hand, maybe it's
not a bad total for a two-person company; there are certainly much larger
companies which contribute far less.
</p><p>
If you're at a startup which relies heavily on open source software, please
take a moment to ask yourself: How much does your company contribute back?

<p>Microsoft is making some interesting (and potentially controversial) moves to try and encourage users to its browser, Edge, instead of its arch-rival Google Chrome. If you want to download the installer for Google Chrome using Edge (which is the only web browser pre-installed in Windows 10 and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11">Windows 11</a>), Microsoft now apparently demands to know why in a poll.&nbsp;</p><p>If you use Edge for any browsing, you’ll probably have noticed that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-edge-is-bombarding-people-with-ads" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-edge-is-bombarding-people-with-ads">it’s already peppered with ads, banners, and pop-ups</a> to urge you to keep Edge as your default browser, and it looks like <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> thinks it’s not been putting enough pressure on its users.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/">NeoWin made the discovery</a> when trying to download Chrome while using Microsoft Edge. When users open and wait for the Chrome download to begin, Microsoft opens a sidebar and presents users with a poll that interrogates users on why they think they need another browser.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Nothing is permanent. Everything changes. That’s the one thing we know for sure in this world,” Calvin says to Hobbes in the first panel of a two-panel strip that ran in more than two thousand newspapers on Monday, July 17, 1995. The two friends are in a wagon, plummeting perilously forward into the unseen—a common pastime for them. Outside the world of the cartoon, it’s less than half a year before Bill Watterson, thirty-seven at the time, will retire from producing his wildly beloved work. “Calvin and Hobbes,” which débuted in 1985, centered on six-year-old Calvin and his best friend, Hobbes, a tiger who to everyone other than Calvin appears to be a stuffed animal. Six days a week, the strip appeared in short form, in black-and-white, and each Sunday it was longer and in color. The second panel of the July 17th strip is wide, with detailed trees in the foreground, the wagon airborne, and Calvin concluding his thought: “But I’m still going to gripe about it.”</p><p>After retiring, Watterson assiduously avoided becoming a public figure. He turned his attention to painting, music, and family life. He kept the work he made to himself; he gave few, but not zero, interviews. (When asked in an e-mail interview that ran in 2013 in <em>Mental Floss</em> why he didn’t share his paintings, he replied, “It’s all catch and release—just tiny fish that aren’t really worth the trouble to clean and cook.”) Still, now and again his handiwork appeared. He wrote twice about Charles&nbsp;M. Schulz, the creator of “Peanuts,” whom he never met. For the charity of the cartoonist Richard Thompson, who had been given a diagnosis of Parkinson’s, Watterson illustrated three strips for “Pearls Before Swine,” by Stephan Pastis, and also donated a painting for auction. In other words, he came out for the team.</p><p>In 2014, he gave an extensive and chatty interview to Jenny Robb, the curator of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum, on the occasion of his second show there. Robb asked if he was surprised that his strip was still so popular. “It seems the less I have to do with it, the higher the strip’s reputation gets!” he said. In the interview, he comes across as levelheaded, not egotistical, not very pleased with electronic devices, the Internet, the diminished size of cartoons—and also quietly intense, like the dad figure in the strip, who enthusiastically sets out on a bike ride through heavy snow. As a college student at Kenyon, Watterson spent much of a school year painting his dorm-room ceiling like that of the Sistine Chapel, and then, at the end of the year, painted it back dorm-room drab.</p><p>My ten-year-old daughter makes a detailed argument (it involves bicycles, ropes, and scratch marks) that Hobbes is indisputably real; millions of us have the more decisively illusory experience of having grown up with Watterson. But we haven’t! Will we be disturbed if, now that time has passed, he has changed? When word came out that Watterson was releasing a new book this year—“The Mysteries,” a “fable for grown-ups,” written by Watterson and illustrated in collaboration with the renowned caricaturist John Kascht—there was more than passing interest. There were also very few clues about the content, save that there’s a kingdom in trouble, living in fear of mysteries. With a different artist, I might interpret this as an enticement, but it seems more likely that Watterson is merely averse to marketing—he did no publicity for his first “Calvin and Hobbes” collection, and fought for years to prevent Hobbes and Calvin from appearing in snow globes, on pajamas, on chip-bag clips, on trading cards. (“If I’d wanted to sell plush garbage, I’d have gone to work as a carny,” he once said.) Yet Calvin and Hobbes are still everywhere, and forever young. Somewhere on the outskirts of Cleveland, their creator is probably irked that his old characters are pouncing into all these reviews of this other endeavor. As Calvin put it, the universe should have a toll-free hotline for complaints.</p><p>“The Mysteries” is clothbound and black, about eight inches square, with gray endpapers. The title font looks medieval; the text font looks contemporary. Words appear on the left page of each spread: one or two sentences in black, surrounded by a field of white. The images appear on the right, taking up most of the page, framed by a thick black line. Some of the illustrations appear to be photographs of small clay sculptures alongside elements composed in graphite and maybe paint—but the materials aren’t specified. Think Chris Van Allsburg’s “Jumanji” gone darker, crossed with Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis.” The characters, unnamed, are drawn from that strange eternal medieval world of fantasy: knights, wizards, a king; peasants with faces like Leonardo grotesques, wearing kerchiefs or hoods. There are forty-three sentences in total, and one exclamation point. The magic of condensation that is characteristic of cartoons is also here, in a story with a quick, fairy-tale beginning: “Long ago, the forest was dark and deep.”</p><p>It all sounds rather sombre, but also it doesn’t take long to read it nine or ten times. (The illustrations, slower to process, do much of the storytelling work.) The story is: Unseen mysteries have kept the populace in a state of fear. In response, a king bids his knights to capture a mystery, so that perhaps its “secrets could be learned” and its “powers could be thwarted.” When mysteries are caught, the public finds them disappointing, ordinary. One illustration is of a vender at a newspaper stand, looking askance. Below him are newspapers with headlines such as “So what?,” “Yawn,” and “Boring.” But modern technologies begin to appear: cars, skyscrapers, televisions. Mastering the secrets of the mysteries brought about a lot of technological marvels, and made the people less fearful. Or you might say insufficiently fearful: the woods are cut down, the air becomes acrid, and eventually the land looks prehistoric, desiccated, hostile to life. In one read, “The Mysteries” is a nephew of Dr. Seuss’s “The Lorax.”</p><p>It’s also kin to the ancient story of Prometheus, a myth we now associate with technological advancements. Prometheus took pity on the struggling humans, and stole fire from the gods to share it with them. And how has that magnificently useful fire gone for the humans? Pretty well by some measures, pretty catastrophically by others. If only humans heeded the warnings within mysteries as well as they followed the blueprints for making Teflon pans and missiles. I don’t think I’ll spoil the plot of “The Mysteries” if I say that the story finds a distinctive and unsettling path to its final three words, which are “happily ever after.”</p><p>“It’s a funny world, Hobbes,” Calvin says, plummeting again down a hill in a wagon with his friend. “But it’s not a hilarious world,” he says, as they fall out of their wagon. “Unless you like sick humor,” Hobbes says after he and Calvin have both crashed to the ground.</p><p>Watterson has said, of the illustrations in “Calvin and Hobbes,” “One of the jokes I really like is that the fantasies are drawn more realistically than reality, since that says a lot about what’s going on in Calvin’s head.” Only one reality in “Calvin and Hobbes” is drawn with a level of detail comparable to the scenes of Calvin’s imagination: the natural world. The woods, the streams, the snowy hills the friends career off—the natural world is a space as enchanted and real as Hobbes himself.</p><p>Enchantment! If disenchantment is the loss of myth and illusion in our lives, then what is the chant that calls those essentials back? An ongoing enchantment is at the heart of “Calvin and Hobbes.” It’s at the heart of “Don Quixote” and “Peter Pan,” too. These are stories about difficult and not infrequently destructive characters who are lost in their own worlds. At the same time, these characters embody most of what is good: the gifts of play, of the inner life, of imagining something other than what is there. If “The Mysteries” is a fable, then its moral might be that, when we believe we’ve understood the mysteries, we are misunderstanding; when we think we’ve solved them and have moved on, that error can be our dissolution.</p><p>Calvin offers the means of enchantment for seeing reality properly. This is well illustrated in the June 3, 1995, daily. (The brief black-and-white weekday strips of “Calvin and Hobbes” often feel as whole as the epic Sunday ones.) Calvin is digging a deep hole and Hobbes asks why. Calvin answers that he’s looking for buried treasure. Has he found any? Calvin replies, “A few dirty rocks, a weird root, and some disgusting grubs.” In the final panel, Hobbes: “On your first try??” Calvin: “There’s treasure everywhere!”</p><p>While rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” comics for this piece, I was surprised that almost all of them were not entirely forgotten. If I saw them on a crowded subway platform, I would recognize them, even after years of separation. Some of the silliest and most untethered of the strips have stayed with me the most: one in which Hobbes repeats the word “smock” again and again, just happy to say it; another in which Calvin writes down, “How many boards would the Mongol hoard, if the Mongol hordes got bored?”—then crumples up the paper.</p><p>Watterson has written, “Whenever the strip got ponderous, I put Calvin and Hobbes in their wagon and send them over a cliff. It had a nice way of undercutting the serious subjects.” “The Mysteries” doesn’t entirely lack that lightness—the contrast of modern and medieval in the illustrations is often funny—but humor is not its main tool. Reading “The Mysteries” after rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” reminded me of the Brothers Grimm story “The Goblins.” Goblins steal a mother’s child and replace it with a ravenous changeling. When the woman asks a neighbor for advice on how to get her child back, she is told to make the changeling laugh, because “when a changeling laughs, that’s the end of him.” She makes him laugh (by boiling water in eggshells? A trick perhaps lost across the centuries), and the goblins take the changeling away and return her child. She counters tragedy with a deliberate silliness—and it succeeds, even as the dark persists. In that sense, the old strip and the new fable work best, maybe, together. I’m also reminded of the strip in which Hobbes says, “I suppose if we couldn’t laugh at things that don’t make sense, we couldn’t react to a lot of life.”</p><p>One of the cozy pleasures of “Calvin and Hobbes” is the prominence of the seasons. This was felt even more acutely when the comics appeared daily in the paper, as they did throughout my childhood, when my brother used to call the Sunday comics insert “the intellectual pages.” (Now we both read the nearly comic-free online news instead of the material papers, into which, Watterson has said, “little jokes” were placed as a respite from “atrocities described in the rest of the newspaper.”) In the fall, a leaf pile transforms into a Calvin-eating monster; in winter, Calvin sculpts a snowman swimming away from snow-shark fins; spring is rainy, and in summer the days are just packed. Time hurries along through the year, but the years never pass—a great comfort. In “The Mysteries,” time’s arrow can’t be missed for a moment. Though the story starts in the misty forever-medieval, it quickly javelins forward. By its close, aeons have passed, and the perspective is no longer even earthbound. The book reads like someone saying goodbye. The outcome feels inevitable.</p><p>Calvin isn’t the only comic-strip character who doesn’t age. The characters in “Peanuts” never grow up, either. Schulz drew the strip for fifty years, and the final strip was published the day after he died. George Herriman drew “Krazy Kat” for more than thirty years, through to the year of his death, 1944. The characters in “Krazy Kat” also didn’t age or really change much: Krazy Kat is a black cat forever in love with Ignatz, a white mouse who serially hits Krazy with bricks, an action that Krazy misinterprets as a sign of love. Watterson has expressed admiration for both Schulz and Herriman. Yet Watterson, after ten years, moved on to other interests.</p><p>“Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography,” by David Michaelis, makes vivid that no amount of success ever separated Schulz from his sense of himself, carried over from childhood, as a lonely and overlooked “nothing.” In 2007, Watterson reviewed the biography for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and reminded readers that “Peanuts” had as much darkness—fear, sadness, bullying—as it had charm. “Schulz illustrates the conflict in his life, not in a self-justifying or vengeful manner but with a larger human understanding that implicates himself in the sad comedy,” Watterson wrote. “I think that’s a wonderfully sane way to process a hurtful world.” Herriman, born in the nineteenth century in New Orleans to a mixed-race family, often presented himself, in his adult life, as Greek. It would be oversimplifying to say that Herriman’s background fuelled “Krazy Kat,” just as it would be oversimplifying to say that Schulz was forever a Charlie Brown—but it would be delusional to think that the persistent situations and sentiments of those comics weren’t inflected by their makers’ lives. As Krazy Kat put it, in that magic mixed-up Kat language, “An’ who but me can moddil for me, but I!”</p><p>Watterson must have been working out something in his strip, too. By his own account, he had a pretty nice childhood, with supportive parents and a house that bordered a mysterious wood. It’s possible that Watterson quit because he tired of the demanding work, or because he’d said all he had to say, or because he was worn out by the legal battles over his characters. But maybe he just changed. Growing up is always a loss—a loss of an enchanted way of seeing, at the very least—and for some people growing up is more of a loss than for others. Perhaps part of what drove Watterson, “Ahab-like” by his own telling, back to the drawing board with his boy and his tiger day after day was a subconscious commitment to staying a child. Maybe he chose to stop publishing because, in some way, for whatever reasons, he became O.K. with growing up.</p><p>In a Sunday strip on April 22, 1990, Calvin’s dad tells Calvin and Hobbes a bedtime story, by request, that is about Calvin and Hobbes. All he does, pretty much, is describe, to his rapt audience, the first part of their actual day. Calvin complains that his dad ends the story too early, that he hasn’t even gotten to lunchtime. His dad says the story has no end, because Calvin and Hobbes will go on writing it “tomorrow and every day after.” The friends are pleased to learn they’re in a story that doesn’t end.</p><p>Here’s another story, kindred to “The Mysteries,” about a knight who journeys into a dark and unknown wood. The first scene of “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” which is thought to have been written in the late fourteenth century, takes place in Camelot during New Year’s festivities. A good time, with feasting and friends, is interrupted by the arrival of a stranger: a massive knight, whose skin and hair are all green, who is dressed all in green, who is riding an all-green horse. The knight carries a huge axe and makes a strange proposal, in such a way that the honor of the whole court feels at stake. He invites someone to swing at his neck with his axe; in return, he will have a chance, a year and a day later, to swing the same axe at the neck of the volunteer, who ends up being Sir Gawain. The resonance of the story with facing the perils of a dark and unknown wood, of nature itself, is pretty clear.</p><p>Gawain chops off the head of the Green Knight, who then picks up his head; says, See you in a year; and rides away. Pretty quickly, the feasting and the merry mood return. How, I remember thinking the first time I read the tale, could this possibly end? It’s not satisfying if the Green Knight is killed, or if Gawain is. Maybe both of them die, I supposed.</p><p>But no. Gawain keeps his word, despite the perilous terms. En route to his meeting with the Green Knight, in the Green Chapel, he tries to behave well with the seductive wife of the lord who graciously hosts him. Then he bravely bares his neck for the terrifying Green Knight—but he learns it was an enchantment! To me, the ending follows from both good behavior and enchantment—good behavior being something Calvin despises, and enchantment being the realm in which he is king.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<!-- cache hit 1130:single/related:690e5e62d1484f6bd44b961aaf8929be --><!-- empty -->
<p>Drug store giant CVS revealed late last week that it is voluntarily pulling some common cold and flu medicines from its shelves because they don't work—while many other ineffective products remain on the shelves.</p>
<p>The move by CVS comes after an advisory panel for the Food and Drug Administration last month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/the-spectacular-downfall-of-a-common-useless-cold-medicine/">voted unanimously that the common decongestant, phenylephrine, is ineffective at treating a stuffy nose</a>. But it comes ahead of the FDA itself acting on the vote, which will likely lead the agency to revoke phenylephrine's approval, eventually.
</p><p>In a statement to Ars, a CVS spokesperson suggested the FDA advisory panel's vote was the impetus for the change, but that it would "follow direction from the FDA."</p>
<p>"We are removing a small number of oral decongestant products that contain phenylephrine as the only active ingredient from CVS Pharmacy stores but will continue offering many other oral cough and cold products to meet consumer needs," CVS's statement read. It didn't provide additional details on which or how many products would be removed, or when the removals would be complete.</p>
<p>The culling of phenylephrine products from drug-store shelves is a long-sought win for both researchers and consumers. Since at least 2007, researchers have expressed doubt about the effectiveness of phenylephrine, which is in popular oral medicines with brand names including Sudafed, Mucinex, Nyquil, and Benadryl. The small studies from the 1960s and 1970s that formed the basis of the FDA's initial approval in 1976 were found to be seriously flawed. And three large clinical trials since 2007 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/10/common-decongestant-may-be-worthless-study-finds/">showed the drug doesn't work</a>. Pharmacological studies showed why: Phenylephrine is highly metabolized in the gut, with less than 1 percent of active drug remaining bioavailable. Consumers, meanwhile, were largely in the dark, spending nearly $2 billion in 2022 on these products that researchers have said for years don't work.
</p><p>But as these useless drugs finally vanish from CVS shelves, left behind is an entire class of products that are equally useless: homeopathic products.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>“Snake oil” remains</h2>
<p>These bogus treatments are based on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2007/09/the-pseudoscience-behind-homeopathy/">centuries-old pseudoscience and have repeatedly been proven to be no more effective than placebo</a>. In fact, if they were to prove effective, it would upend fundamental scientific understandings. For decades, consumer advocates and watchdogs <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/outrage-of-the-month-fda-guidance-on-homeopathic-drugs-an-ongoing-public-health-failure/">have railed against them</a>, yet these products are readily available on the shelves of every major drug store.</p>
<p>Homeopathy relies on two false ideas: the "law of similars" aka "like cures like," meaning a substance that causes a specific symptom in a healthy person can treat conditions and diseases in an ill person with that same symptom; and the "law of infinitesimals," which states that diluting a supposedly curative substance renders it more potent at treating medical conditions. As such, homeopathic products often start with bizarre, sometimes toxic substances that end up being diluted into oblivion in ritualistic procedures. The result is simply water or inactive filler ingredients. Homeopaths have acknowledged this and sometimes counter that water molecules have a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_memory#:~:text=%5BBenveniste's%5D%20latest%20theory%2C%20and,to%20a%20container%20of%20ordinary">memory</a>" of substances (they don't).</p>

<p>Sound absurd? It is. And yet, homeopathic products are not only available in major drug stores and retailers around the country, they're often sold on the same shelves, side by side with evidence-based medicines that have gone through rigorous FDA safety and efficacy evaluations.</p>
<p>The FDA does have the authority to regulate homeopathic products. But, based on the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, homeopathic products are generally <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1513393">considered exempt from pre-market FDA safety and efficacy reviews</a> as long as the active ingredient is included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, a published list of substances approved by homeopaths. As such, homeopathic products enter the market without any FDA review—and sit on shelves with FDA-approved, evidence-based medicines.</p>
<p>"Most people don't know what this stuff is," Nicholas Little, vice president and legal director for the consumer advocacy organization the Center for Inquiry (CFI), said of homeopathic products in an interview with Ars.</p>

<p>Hundreds of driverless cars are now an everyday part of traffic in San Francisco as they shuttle passengers across town, but how safe are they and how do they compare to human drivers?  Waymo, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, just released a new study that attempts to shed light on its own track record as one of San Francisco's largest driverless car companies.  The findings, described as first-of-its-kind research, make the case that Waymo's driverless fleet is able to steer clear of certain types of collisions at a higher rate than human drivers.</p>

<p>“It shows that we’re safe,” said Trent Victor, Waymo Director of Safety Research and Best Practices. “We're seeing the fruits of our focus on safety.”</p>

<p>Waymo, in partnership with insurance giant Swiss Re, analyzed insurance liability claims in an effort to collect collision data involving both driverless vehicles and human-driven cars.  The study utilized 600,000 claims stretching over 125 billion miles to create a "baseline" for human driver collisions that could be compared against Waymo's record involving 3.8 million miles traveled without a human in the driver's seat.</p>

<p>Attempting to draw fair comparisons between the safety record of driverless cars versus human drivers is a complex feat that has repeatedly proven difficult for the autonomous vehicle industry, according to experts.</p>


<p>“The kind of reporting that is used in insurance is much more standardized than any other kind of collision data that you have around,” said Luigi Di Lillo, Head of Products and Partnerships for Swiss Re.&nbsp;“The novelty of this study is to connect the insurance claims data to safety directly.”</p>

<p>Waymo’s driverless vehicles, which currently operate in San Francisco and Phoenix, experienced 76% fewer accidents involving property damage compared to human-driven cars, according to the study.  For every million miles traveled, human drivers filed 3.26 property damage claims compared to 0.78 for Waymo's driverless cars.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>I think this is an opportunity for people to get to know Waymo as something that’s different than our competitors.</p><cite>Trent Victor, Waymo Director of Safety Research and Best Practices</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>“This is an amazing moment,” said Victor, who spoke to the Investigative Unit in his only television interview.  “I think this is an opportunity for people to get to know Waymo as something that’s different than our competitors.”</p>

<p>Waymo’s main competition is GM’s Cruise, which recently cut its fleet of driverless cars in half at the direction of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.&nbsp;The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/california-dmv-san-francisco-cruise-driverless-cars/3299222/" target="_blank">DMV announced its request</a> at the same time it revealed it was launching an investigation into Cruise’s safety record following a series of headline-making accidents, including a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/cruise-driverless-car-crash/3298626/" target="_blank">collision with a San Francisco fire truck</a>.&nbsp; According to Cruise, its vehicle had a green light when it struck the fire engine, which had its sirens on and appeared to be en route to an emergency scene.  </p>

<p>Following the state's request to reduce Cruise's fleet, a company spokesperson provided NBC Bay Area with a statement, noting "Cruise positively impacts overall road safety," adding that Cruise looks forward to "working with the DMV to make any improvements and provide any data they need to reinforce the safety and efficiency of our fleet."</p>

<p>While the DMV continues its investigation, Cruise’s driverless fleet will be capped at 50 cars during the day and 150 cars at night. In August, Waymo told state regulators it possessed a total fleet of 250 driverless cars in San Francisco, of which about 100 are on the road at any given time.&nbsp;Those figures remain largely unchanged, according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>

<p>Just last month, state regulators with the California Public Utilities Commission <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/cpuc-vote-driverless-car-operations-expansion-san-francisco/3293096/" target="_blank">granted approval</a> to both Waymo and Cruise to expand their ride-hailing services across San Francisco 24/7, with no limits on how many driverless cars they can put on the road.</p>

<p>Waymo’s new study also notes the company’s driverless vehicles have not been involved in a single crash resulting in “bodily injury,” however, some critics have questioned whether the cars have been on the road long enough to begin making fair comparisons to human drivers.&nbsp;For example, Waymo’s driverless cars have traveled roughly 4 million miles, but traffic-related fatalities are routinely measured per 100 million miles.  Across America's roadways last year, there were 1.37 fatalities for every 100 million miles traveled, totaling 42,795 lives lost in vehicle traffic crashes, according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/traffic-crash-death-estimates-2022" target="_blank">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.  Each year, human drivers log more than 3 trillion miles on the road.</p>

<p>“It’s interesting that we were able to show statistical significance with so little data,” Victor said.&nbsp;“That has to do with two things: one is that we have very robust baselines from Swiss Re, and the other is that we have incredible safety performance.”</p>

<p>Waymo did not release the raw data it used to come up with its findings, saying that information is “proprietary.” </p>

<p>"The information they released is the results of the study rather than all the details," said Steven Shladover, a research engineer with the Berkeley's Institute of Transportation Studies.  "Of course, as researchers, we like to look more at the details and the methods for the analysis."</p>

<p>Shladover said he was also "disappointed" the study grouped its findings for both San Francisco and Phoenix instead of sharing separate data points for each city.  While Waymo's study only offered combined figures, it examined different time spans for each city: Waymo's Phoenix data spanned more than four years (March 2019 to Aug. 1, 2023), while Waymo's San Francisco data incorporated less than two years' worth of driving (March 2022 to Aug. 1, 2023), according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>

<p>"It lumped them all together and those are quite different areas," he said.  "I think it would have been more interesting to see a comparison for San Francisco and then a separate comparison for Phoenix."</p>

<p>Leaders at Waymo and Swiss Re said they plan to eventually submit their study to a scientific journal so that it can be independently reviewed, however, neither company would say when that might happen.</p>

<p>“We are targeting the right journal,” said Di Lillo.&nbsp;“I’m very picky on that.”</p>

<p>
								Hundreds of driverless cars are now an everyday part of traffic in San Francisco, but how safe are they and how do they compare to human drivers?&nbsp;Google’s Waymo, one of the largest driverless car companies in the city, just released a new study that attempts to shed light on its own track record.

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>October 24, 2023</strong></p>



<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles today issued the following statement on the immediate suspension of Cruise LLC’s deployment and driverless testing permits:</p>



<p><em>Public safety remains the California DMV’s top priority, and the department’s autonomous vehicle regulations provide a framework to facilitate the safe testing and deployment of this technology on California public roads. When there is an unreasonable risk to public safety, the DMV can immediately suspend or revoke permits. There is no set time for a suspension.</em></p>



<p><em>The California DMV today notified Cruise that the department is suspending Cruise’s autonomous vehicle deployment and driverless testing permits, effective immediately. The DMV has provided Cruise with the steps needed to apply to reinstate its suspended permits, which the DMV will not approve until the company has fulfilled the requirements to the department’s satisfaction. This decision does not impact the company’s permit for testing with a safety driver.</em></p>



<p><em><span>Today’s suspensions are based on</span> the following:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em><span>13 CCR §228.20 (b) (6)</span> – Based upon the performance of the vehicles, the Department determines the manufacturer’s vehicles are not safe for the public’s operation.</em></li>



<li><em><span>13 CCR §228.20 (b) (3)</span> – The manufacturer has misrepresented any information related to safety of the autonomous technology of its vehicles.</em></li>



<li><em><span>13 CCR §227.42 (b) (5)</span> – Any act or omission of the manufacturer or one of its agents, employees, contractors, or designees which the department finds makes the conduct of autonomous vehicle testing on public roads by the manufacturer an unreasonable risk to the public.</em></li>



<li><em><span>13 CCR §227.42 (c)</span> – The department shall immediately suspend or revoke the Manufacturer’s Testing Permit or a Manufacturer’s Testing Permit – Driverless Vehicles if a manufacturer is engaging in a practice in such a manner that immediate suspension is required for the safety of persons on a public road.</em></li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<section>
										<p>
					This is a guest post by Kate Krauss, a digital rights advocate based in Philadelphia.				</p>
			
						<div itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>On Oct. 6, 23andMe announced the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">loss of customer data</a>&nbsp;to hackers who targeted Ashkenazi Jews. The data of as many as a million people was reportedly stolen and is currently being sold anonymously on the Internet. The hack exploited customers who reused passwords and the platform’s feature called “DNA Relatives,” linking one person to another.</p>
<p id="3524" data-selectable-paragraph="">We won’t easily forget this awful hack — but every year, tens of millions of Americans become victims of information leaks, so many that they have begun to blur together. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/chinese-hackers-stole-60000-emails-us-state-department-microsoft-hack-senate-2023-09-27/" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>, for one, has been hacked at least 10 times since 2018.</p>
<p id="4825" data-selectable-paragraph="">Victims range from ordinary people, like those in the 23andMe hack, to the most politically sensitive: the State Department’s China diplomats; the Secretary of Commerce. Hackers access people’s email and steal their social security numbers or their home addresses, and in one case, in-depth psychological profiles needed for top security clearances.</p>
<p id="ec6a" data-selectable-paragraph="">If we use the frog-in-hot-water analogy for Americans and their information privacy, this frog is dead.</p>
<h2 id="a27b">Weak laws let companies get away with weak security.</h2>
<p id="210e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Current US privacy laws are so ineffective that Europeans are afraid to send their data here lest it be hacked, leaked, or surveilled. This fear was the basis of the tensely negotiated “<a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_3752" rel="noopener">Data Privacy Framework</a>” between the EU and the US over whether and how to allow the personal data of European citizens to be sent to this country.</p>
<p id="3c18" data-selectable-paragraph="">Without the risk of a giant fine or, say, jail time, many tech giants can and do get away with managing their data security badly. They fail to update security keys, encrypt users’ credit card numbers or enforce multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p id="1de7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Weak laws let companies get away with weak security. For instance, 23andMe didn’t require users to use two-factor authentication or warn users about the dangers of enabling “DNA Relatives.” If they have to pay a small fine — small to them — that’s the cost of doing business.</p>
<p id="2813" data-selectable-paragraph="">In 2019, the year that the Cambridge Analytica scandal caught up with Facebook, the company paid&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/494520-federal-judge-approves-facebook-ftc-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">$5 billion to the FTC</a>&nbsp;for illegally sharing the data of 87 million people.</p>
<h2 id="e428">How much would Cambridge Analytica have cost Facebook if it had to face California’s new privacy laws?</h2>
<p id="f334" data-selectable-paragraph="">Although it was the worst privacy violation in Facebook’s storied history of privacy violations, the company still got to keep 80% of its&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2019-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">massive profits</a>&nbsp;that year. Financially, the scandal was just a speed bump for Facebook.</p>
<p id="54bf" data-selectable-paragraph="">How does this happen? Unlike Europe, the US lacks a strong, comprehensive national privacy law. Many Big Tech companies, including Facebook, say they support one, but through relentless lobbying they seem to benefit by dragging out the process of actually passing it. Not just big companies but also government agencies are building huge databases of citizens’ data.</p>
<p id="eacf" data-selectable-paragraph="">According to a recent WIRED article: “A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/odni-commercially-available-information-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">government report</a> declassified by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in June, 2023 revealed that US intelligence agencies were avoiding judicial review by buying a ‘large amount’ of ‘sensitive and intimate information’ about Americans, including data that can be used to track people’s locations over extended periods of time.”</p>
<p id="36a3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Nothing to worry about there, right?</p>
<p id="a1ca" data-selectable-paragraph="">Dozens of privacy bills have been introduced into Congress, but partisan gridlock, an army of tech company lobbyists, the complexity of the issue and lack of public awareness have combined to prevent a major privacy bill from making it into law.</p>
<p id="69c8" data-selectable-paragraph="">Last year, Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft combined spent over <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries/summary?cycle=2022&amp;filter=s&amp;id=B13" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">$60 million</a>&nbsp;to lobby the federal government. Meanwhile, the Davids to these Goliaths — small nonprofits that focus on online privacy — are legally forced to limit lobbying to a tiny fraction of their work.</p>
<p id="84b1" data-selectable-paragraph="">The FTC, which is charged with regulating companies against unfair or deceptive business practices, currently has its hands full prosecuting major anti-trust cases. It is underfunded and understaffed, and it’s mandated to cover every big company from Walmart to Tiktok. The US might benefit from a separate federal agency that specializes in dealing with privacy concerns. So far, none exists.</p>
<p id="cf48" data-selectable-paragraph="">So what is the answer?</p>
<p id="0c31" data-selectable-paragraph="">Countries that have managed internet privacy better than we do point the way. Russia and China run major state hacking operations. Countries that live in their shadow, like Estonia and Taiwan, have built independent, grassroots citizen tech groups that successfully fend off widespread hacking and disinformation that might undermine their democracies. People in these countries recognize the stakes: It’s considered patriotic to protect online privacy.</p>
<p id="0f13" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the US, we also need nonpartisan groups that can learn to protect online privacy and push back against the lack of federal and state protection. Think: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ffa.org/about-us/what-is-ffa/" rel="noopener">Future Farmers of America</a>, except all ages, learning and teaching online privacy in their communities. (Conflict disclosure: I’m an enthusiastic former member of FFA.)</p>

<p id="ed47" data-selectable-paragraph="">Other successful community models are community-oriented “CryptoParties” like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cryptoharlem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">CryptoHarlem</a>, and arguably the most inclusive, powerful citizen data protection movement ever, Taiwan’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0v" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">g0v</a>.</p>
<p id="c48e" data-selectable-paragraph="">The 0 stands for humility. This friendly, creative, and innovative grassroots hacker movement responds to the needs of Taiwan’s regular people and creates the right tools at the right time to fend off disinformation and hacking from its nearby neighbor. (Also, their meetings involve delicious meals, always a winner in community organizing. Taiwanese food is legendary. But I digress.)</p>
<p id="690b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Next, we must awkwardly embrace the dreaded patchwork of state laws.</p>
<p id="2524" data-selectable-paragraph="">In response to a public outcry for better data protection, California passed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">The California Consumer Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;in 2018 (CCPA). Californians now have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold about them, the right to delete it, and the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information.</p>
<p id="05a8" data-selectable-paragraph="">The&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">California Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;of 2020 created a new California Privacy Protection Agency that manages the enforcement of California’s privacy laws and advises both the public and the legislature on privacy issues (because this stuff gets complicated).</p>
<p id="c70a" data-selectable-paragraph="">The law also prohibits the collection and sale of biometric data including fingerprints, face scans, and voice recognition data without explicit user consent. A small percentage of corporate fine money can be used to fund nonprofit organizations engaged in online privacy projects (see what they did there?).</p>
<p id="7adc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Nice, right? These California laws make great model legislation that could theoretically be passed, separately, in every state in the union.</p>
<p id="3e76" data-selectable-paragraph="">If companies break these California laws, they incur giant fines. At $2,500 per affected user, the Cambridge Analytica scandal would have cost Facebook $217 billion, not $5 billion.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>That’s a meaningful fine — 40 times the money — that might change their behavior. No wonder they’re lobbying hard against privacy legislation.</p>
<p id="1903" data-selectable-paragraph="">Other states have also passed more piecemeal privacy legislation that is still valuable. Illinois has a new&nbsp;<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/illinois/2021/chapter-5/act-5-ilcs-855/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Protecting Household Privacy Act</a> (the “Video Doorbell Act”). It mandates that law enforcement agencies are prohibited from obtaining household electronic data or directing private third parties to acquire household electronic data without a warrant. The law, which took effect in January 2022, covers security cameras, virtual assistants, video doorbells and smart appliances that connect to the internet.</p>
<p id="1896" data-selectable-paragraph="">Who opposes some of these laws? Check out TechNet — the long, lobbying arm of companies like Amazon and Facebook. See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technet.org/our-story/members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">TechNet’s members</a>: Apple, Facebook, etc. — and there’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technet.org/public-policy/50-state-advocacy-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">a handy map</a>&nbsp;on their website below the animated American flag that shows who is lobbying in your neck of the woods.</p>
<p id="6430" data-selectable-paragraph="">What’s the downside of a multitude of state laws? Big companies (and most comprehensive laws only apply to big companies) have to comply with laws that may conflict with each other. For them, this is expensive, inefficient and time consuming.</p>
<p id="cb24" data-selectable-paragraph="">However, by aggressively pursuing the near-term passage of state laws, ordinary people will be much better protected from the ongoing abuse of their personal information for profit and power. And the federal lobbying by TechNet and others is forcing states to try to fend for themselves on behalf of their citizens.</p>
<h2 id="9bfe">People &gt; companies</h2>
<p id="ee53" data-selectable-paragraph="">A coordinated national effort to pass strong state privacy laws is a useful step for protecting vulnerable American citizens (and most of us are pretty vulnerable at the moment) until Congress enacts a federal privacy law, which could take years.</p>
<p id="c9bb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Will every state adopt California’s laws? That’s unlikely. Will some states enact wacky or dumb privacy laws? We’re living through a wacky, dumb era, so yes, but there’s nothing to prevent a state from passing another, stronger law, especially with the models that are available to them.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is the third chief executive of the software giant to admit the company has made some serious mobile mistakes. Satya Nadella took over from former CEO Steve Ballmer in 2014 and, just over a year later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910999/microsoft-job-cuts-2015-nokia-write-off">wrote off $7.6 billion</a> related to Microsoft’s acquisition of the Nokia phone business.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-interview-ai-activision-blizzard-axel-springer-2023-10?r=US&amp;IR=T">interview with <em>Business Insider</em></a>, Nadella admitted that Microsoft’s “exit” from the mobile phone business could have been handled better. Asked about a strategic mistake or wrong decision that he might regret, Nadella responds:</p><div><blockquote><p>The decision I think a lot of people talk about – and one of the most difficult decisions I made when I became CEO — was our exit of what I’ll call the mobile phone as defined then. In retrospect, I think there could have been ways we could have made it work by perhaps reinventing the category of computing between PCs, tablets, and phones.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p>Microsoft finally confirmed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446280/microsoft-finally-admits-windows-phone-is-dead">Windows Phone was dead</a> a few years after the Nokia phone business write-off, but it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/28/10864034/windows-phone-is-dead">was clear six months after that decision</a> that Windows Phone was over. Microsoft has since launched its Android-powered Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2 handsets, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23548511/microsoft-surface-duo-foldable-screen-rumor">without a successor in sight</a> and a lack of software updates, it’s not clear what the future holds for the Surface Duo.</p><p>Nadella is now the third Microsoft CEO to admit to the company’s mobile mistakes. Microsoft co-founder and former CEO <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715202/microsoft-bill-gates-android-biggest-mistake-interview">Bill Gates said his “greatest mistake ever”</a> was Microsoft losing to Android. Google acquired Android in 2005 for $50 million, and former CEO Eric Schmidt admitted in 2012 that Google’s initial focus was beating Microsoft’s early Windows Mobile efforts.</p><p>Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was also slow to respond to Android and the iPhone threat, focusing the company’s efforts on Windows Mobile while <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Deywi0h_Y5_U&amp;xcust=___vg__p_18479243__t_w__r_https://www.google.com/__d_D">famously laughing at the iPhone</a>, calling it the “most expensive phone in the world and it doesn’t appeal to business customers because it doesn’t have a keyboard.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4750086/ballmer-almost-no-mobile-share-microsoft-opportunity">Ballmer admitted in 2013</a> that he regretted not focusing on the phone much earlier. “I regret there was a period in the early 2000s when we were so focused on what we had to do around Windows [Vista] that we weren’t able to redeploy talent to the new device called the phone,” explained Ballmer. “That is [the] thing I regret the most.”</p><p>Microsoft has been focused on apps for Android and iOS over the past decade, though.

<p><strong><span color="087294"><em>Researchers achieve landmark in quantum squeezing </em></span></strong></p>

<hr>
<p>In 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, made history when it made the first direct detection of gravitational waves, or ripples in space and time, produced by a pair of colliding black holes. Since then, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded LIGO and its sister detector in Europe, Virgo, have detected gravitational waves from dozens of mergers between black holes as well as from collisions between a related class of stellar remnants called neutron stars. At the heart of LIGO's success is its ability to measure the stretching and squeezing of the fabric of spacetime on scales 10 thousand trillion times smaller than a human hair.</p>

<p>As incomprehensibly small as these measurements are, LIGO's precision has continued to be limited by the laws of quantum physics. At very tiny, subatomic scales, empty space is filled with a faint crackling of quantum noise, which interferes with LIGO's measurements and restricts how sensitive the observatory can be. Now, writing in the journal <em>Physical Review X</em>, LIGO researchers report a significant advance in a quantum technology called "squeezing" that allows them to skirt around this limit and measure undulations in spacetime across the entire range of gravitational frequencies detected by LIGO.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j2oH9bq-FAE?si=hlGfRs0nISVGWssr" title="YouTube video player" width="400"></iframe></p>

<p>This new "frequency-dependent squeezing" technology, in operation at LIGO since it <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20230524">turned back on in May of this year</a>, means that the detectors can now probe a larger volume of the Universe and are expected to detect about 60 percent more mergers than before. This greatly boosts LIGO's ability to study the exotic events that shake space and time.</p>

<p>"We can't control nature, but we can control our detectors," says Lisa Barsotti, a senior research scientist at MIT who oversaw the development of the new LIGO technology, a project that originally involved research experiments at MIT led by Professor of Physics Matt Evans (PhD '02) and Professor of Astrophysics Nergis Mavalvala. The effort now includes dozens of scientists and engineers based at MIT, Caltech, and the twin LIGO observatories in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana.</p>

<p>"A project of this scale requires multiple people, from facilities to engineering and optics—basically the full extent of the LIGO Lab with important contributions from the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. It was a grand effort made even more challenging by the pandemic," Barsotti says.</p>

<p>"Now that we have surpassed this quantum limit, we can do a lot more astronomy," explains Lee McCuller, assistant professor of physics at Caltech and one of the leaders of the new study. "LIGO uses lasers and large mirrors to make its observations, but we are working at a level of sensitivity that means the device is affected by the quantum realm."</p>

<p>The results also have ramifications for future quantum technologies such as quantum computers and other microelectronics as well as for fundamental physics experiments. "We can take what we have learned from LIGO and apply it to problems that require measuring subatomic-scale distances with incredible accuracy," McCuller says.</p>

<p>“When NSF first invested in building the twin LIGO detectors in the late 1990s, we were enthusiastic about the potential to observe gravitational waves,” says NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “Not only did these detectors make possible groundbreaking discoveries, they also unleashed the design and development of novel technologies.&nbsp;This is truly exemplar of the DNA of NSF—curiosity-driven explorations coupled with use-inspired innovations. Through decades of continuing investments and expansion of international partnerships, LIGO is further poised to advance rich discoveries and technological progress."</p>

<p>The laws of quantum physics dictate that particles, including photons, will randomly pop in and out of empty space, creating a background hiss of quantum noise that brings a level of uncertainty to LIGO's laser-based measurements. Quantum squeezing, which has roots in the late 1970s, is a method for hushing quantum noise or, more specifically, for pushing the noise from one place to another with the goal of making more precise measurements.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="220" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q5lnamXhnfI?si=LWX6P3ZU39u_zgcU" title="YouTube video player" width="391"></iframe></p>

<p>The term squeezing refers to the fact that light can be manipulated like a balloon animal. To make a dog or giraffe, one might pinch one section of a long balloon into a small precisely located joint. But then the other side of the balloon will swell out to a larger, less precise size. Light can similarly be squeezed to be more precise in one trait, such as its frequency, but the result is that it becomes more uncertain in another trait, such as its power. This limitation is based on a fundamental law of quantum mechanics called the <a href="https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/uncertainty-principle">uncertainty principle</a>, which states that you cannot know both the position and momentum of objects (or the frequency and power of light) at the same time.</p>

<p>Since 2019, LIGO's twin detectors have been squeezing light in such a way as to improve their sensitivity to the upper frequency range of gravitational waves they detect. But, in the same way that squeezing one side of a balloon results in the expansion of the other side, squeezing light has a price. By making LIGO's measurements more precise at the high frequencies, the measurements became less precise at the lower frequencies.</p>

<p>"At some point, if you do more squeezing, you aren't going to gain much. We needed to prepare for what was to come next in our ability to detect gravitational waves," Barsotti explains.</p>

<p>Now, LIGO's new frequency-dependent optical cavities—long tubes about the length of three football fields—allow the team to squeeze light in different ways depending on the frequency of gravitational waves of interest, thereby reducing noise across the whole LIGO frequency range.</p>

<div><p><a alt="Squeezing Picture4_MJDoherty" href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/media_files/binaries/763/original/Picture4_MJDoherty.jpeg?1697147715" target="_blank" title="Squeezing Picture4_MJDoherty"><img alt="Squeezing Picture4_MJDoherty" src="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/media_files/binaries/763/large/Picture4_MJDoherty.jpeg?1697147715" title="Squeezing Picture4_MJDoherty"></a></p><p><strong>Vacuum tube hosting LIGO's 300-meter filter cavity used to implement frequency-dependent squeezing.

</div>

<p>"Before, we had to choose where we wanted LIGO to be more precise," says LIGO team member Rana Adhikari, a professor of physics at Caltech. "Now we can eat our cake and have it too. We've known for a while how to write down the equations to make this work, but it was not clear that we could actually make it work until now. It's like science fiction."</p>



<p><strong>Uncertainty in the Quantum Realm </strong></p>

<p>Each LIGO facility is made up of two 4-kilometer-long arms connected to form an "L" shape. Laser beams travel down each arm, hit giant suspended mirrors, and then travel back to where they started. As gravitational waves sweep by Earth, they cause LIGO's arms to stretch and squeeze, <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/video/ligo20160211v6">pushing the laser beams out of sync</a>. This causes the light in the two beams to interfere with each other in a specific way, revealing the presence of gravitational waves.</p>

<p>However, the quantum noise that lurks inside the vacuum tubes that encase LIGO's laser beams can alter the timing of the photons in the beams by minutely small amounts. McCuller likens this uncertainty in the laser light to a can of BBs. "Imagine dumping out a can full of BBs. They all hit the ground and click and clack independently. The BBs are randomly hitting the ground, and that creates a noise. The light photons are like the BBs and hit LIGO's mirrors at irregular times," he said in a <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/at-the-edge-of-physics">Caltech interview</a>.</p>

<p>The squeezing technologies that have been in place since 2019 make "the photons arrive more regularly, as if the photons are holding hands rather than traveling independently," McCuller said. The idea is to make the frequency, or timing, of the light more certain and the amplitude, or power, less certain as a way to tamp down the BB-like effects of the photons. This is accomplished with the help of specialized crystals that essentially turn one photon into a pair of two <a href="https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/entanglement">entangled</a>, or connected, photons with lower energy. The crystals don't directly squeeze light in LIGO's laser beams; rather, they squeeze stray light in the vacuum of the LIGO tubes, and this light interacts with the laser beams to indirectly squeeze the laser light.</p>

<p>"The quantum nature of the light creates the problem, but quantum physics also gives us the solution," Barsotti says.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>An Idea That Began Decades Ago</strong></p>

<p>The concept for squeezing itself dates back to the late 1970s, beginning with theoretical studies by the late Russian physicist Vladimir Braginsky; Caltech's&nbsp;Kip Thorne, Richard P. Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics, Emeritus; and Carlton Caves, a former Caltech research fellow now at the University of New Mexico. The researchers had been thinking about the limits of quantum-based measurements and communications, and this work inspired one of the first experimental demonstrations of squeezing in 1986 by&nbsp;H. Jeff Kimble, Caltech's William L. Valentine Professor of Physics, Emeritus. Kimble compared squeezed light to a cucumber; the certainty of the light measurements are pushed into only one direction, or feature, turning "quantum cabbages into quantum cucumbers," he wrote in an <a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3746/1/Kimble.pdf">article in Caltech's </a><a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3746/1/Kimble.pdf"><em>Engineering &amp; Science</em></a><a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3746/1/Kimble.pdf"> magazine in 1993</a>.</p>

<p>In 2002, researchers began thinking about how to squeeze light in the LIGO detectors, and, in 2008, the first experimental demonstration of the technique was achieved at the 40-meter test facility at Caltech. In 2010, MIT researchers developed a preliminary design for a LIGO squeezer, which they tested at LIGO's Hanford site.&nbsp;Parallel work done at the GEO600 detector in Germany also convinced researchers that squeezing would work. Nine years later, in 2019, after many trials and careful teamwork, <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/ligo-reach-quantum-noise-wave-1205">LIGO began squeezing light for the first time</a>.</p>

<p>"We went through a lot of troubleshooting," says Sheila Dwyer, who has been working on the project since 2008, first as a graduate student at MIT and then as a scientist at the LIGO Hanford Observatory beginning in 2013. "Squeezing was first thought of in the late 1970s, but it took decades to get it right."</p>



<p><strong>Too Much of a Good Thing</strong></p>

<p>However, as noted earlier, there is a tradeoff that comes with squeezing. By moving the quantum noise out of the timing, or frequency, of the laser light, the researchers put the noise into the amplitude, or power, of the laser light. The more powerful laser beams then push LIGO's heavy mirrors around causing a rumbling of unwanted noise corresponding to lower frequencies of gravitational waves. These rumbles mask the detectors' ability to sense low-frequency gravitational waves.</p>

<p>"Even though we are using squeezing to put order into our system, reducing the chaos, it doesn't mean we are winning everywhere," says Dhruva Ganapathy, a graduate student at MIT and one of four co-lead authors of the new study. "We are still bound by the laws of physics." The other three lead authors of the study are MIT graduate student Wenxuan Jia, LIGO Livingston postdoctoral scholar Masayuki Nakano, and MIT postdoctoral scholar Victoria Xu.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this troublesome rumbling becomes even more of a problem when the LIGO team turns up the power on its lasers. "Both squeezing and the act of turning up the power improve our quantum-sensing precision to the point where we are impacted by quantum uncertainty," McCuller says. "Both cause more pushing of photons, which leads to the rumbling of the mirrors. Laser power simply adds more photons, while squeezing makes them more clumpy and thus rumbly."</p>

<p><strong>A Win-Win</strong></p>

<p>The solution is to squeeze light in one way for high frequencies of gravitational waves and another way for low frequencies. It's like going back and forth between squeezing a balloon from the top and bottom and from the sides.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by LIGO's new frequency-dependent squeezing cavity, which controls the relative phases of the light waves in such a way that the researchers can selectively move the quantum noise into different features of light (phase or amplitude) depending on the frequency range of gravitational waves.</p>

<p>"It is true that we are doing this really cool quantum thing, but the real reason for this is that it's the simplest way to improve LIGO's sensitivity," Ganapathy says. "Otherwise, we would have to turn up the laser, which has its own problems, or we would have to greatly increase the sizes of the mirrors, which would be expensive."</p>

<p>LIGO's partner observatory, Virgo, will likely also use frequency-dependent squeezing technology within the current run, which will continue until roughly the end of 2024. Next-generation larger gravitational-wave detectors, such as the planned ground-based <a href="https://cosmicexplorer.org/">Cosmic Explorer</a>, will also reap the benefits of squeezed light.</p>

<p>With its new frequency-dependent squeezing cavity, LIGO can now detect even more black hole and neutron star collisions. Ganapathy says he's most excited about catching more neutron star smashups. "With more detections, we can watch the neutron stars rip each other apart and learn more about what's inside."</p>

<p>"We are finally taking advantage of our gravitational universe," Barsotti says. "In the future, we can improve our sensitivity even more. I would like to see how far we can push it."</p>

<p>The <em>Physical Review X</em> study is titled "Broadband quantum enhancement of the LIGO detectors with frequency-dependent squeezing." Many additional researchers contributed to the development of the squeezing and frequency-dependent squeezing work, including Mike Zucker of MIT and GariLynn Billingsley&nbsp;of Caltech, the leads of the "Advanced LIGO Plus" upgrades that includes the frequency-dependent squeezing cavity; Daniel Sigg of LIGO Hanford Observatory; Adam Mullavey&nbsp;of LIGO Livingston Laboratory; and David McClelland's group from the Australian National University.</p>

<p>The LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Collaboration operates a network of gravitational-wave detectors in the United States, Italy, and Japan. LIGO Laboratory is operated by Caltech and MIT, and is funded by the NSF with contributions to the Advanced LIGO detectors from Germany (Max Planck Society), the U.K. (Science and Technology Facilities Council), and Australia (Australian Research Council). Virgo is managed by the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO) and is funded by the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in France, the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) in Italy, and the National Institute for Subatomic Physics (Nikhef) in the Netherlands. KAGRA is hosted by the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR) at the University of Tokyo and co-hosted by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) and the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK).</p>

				<p id="speakable-summary">A controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM)-scanning proposal that’s under discussion by lawmakers in Europe is both the wrong response to tackling a sensitive and multifaceted societal problem and a direct threat to democratic values in a free and open society, a seminar organized by the European Data Protection Supervisor heard yesterday.</p>
<p>More than 20 speakers at the three hour event voiced opposition to a European Union legislative proposal that would require messaging services to scan the contents of users’ communications for known and unknown CSAM, and to try to detect grooming taking place in real-time — putting the comms of all users of apps subject to detection orders under an automatic and non-targeted surveillance dragnet.</p>
<p>Critics argue the approach runs counter to the fundamental freedoms that are pivotal to democratic societies. The European Commission has pushed back aggressively against this sort of criticism to date — arguing the proposal is a proportionate and targeted response to a growing problem. It was even<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/law-enforcement/news/eu-commissions-microtargeting-to-promote-law-on-child-abuse-under-scrutiny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spotted recently using microtargeted ads to promote the plan</a>, apparently turning to<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2023-003037_EN.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> covert targeting to attack critics</a> by suggesting they do not support child protection (despite the existence of another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/">live EU legislative proposal that seeks to restrict the use of political microtargeting</a>… so, er, oops!).</p>
<p>The contentious debate is still live as it’s now up to EU co-legislators, in the European Parliament and Member States, via the Council, to hash out (no pun intended!) a way forward — which means there’s still time for regional lawmakers to pull back.</p>
<p>And the need for the bloc to pull back from this brink was absolutely the message from yesterday’s event.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) himself, Wojciech Wiewiórowski, suggested the EU could be at a point of no return if lawmakers go ahead and pass a law that mandates the systemic, mass surveillance of private messaging. In his opening remarks, he suggested the Commission’s proposal could bring consequences that go “well beyond what concerns with the protection of children”.</p>
<p>“It is often being used in the debate that this proposal is only about protecting children. I would like this to be the case — but it’s not,” he went on, arguing that the Commission’s proposal questions the “foundations” of what privacy means in a democratic society; and pointing out that privacy, once undermined, leads to “the radical shift from which there might be no return”, as he put it.</p>
<p>Without amendments, the proposal would “fundamentally change the Internet and the digital communication as we know it”, Wiewiórowski also warned at the event’s close — invoking his personal childhood experience of living under surveillance and restrictions on freedom of expression imposed by the Communist regime in Poland. And, most certainly, it’s an awkward comparison for the EU’s executive to be asked to contemplate coming from the mouth of one of its own expert advisors.</p>
<p>The EDPS, an EU institution which advises the Commission on data protection and privacy, is not a newly converted critic of the Commission proposal either. Indeed, the Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board put out a <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/edpbedps-joint-opinion/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-042022-proposal_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint opinion</a> a full year ago that warned the legislative plan raises “serious data protection and privacy concerns” — including for encryption. But that joint expression of concern from inside the EU has — so far — failed to persuade Johansson or the Commission to rethink their full-throated backing for mass surveillance of citizens’ private communications.</p>
<p>Seminar attendees heard that Johansson had been invited to attend but the event but had declined to do so. Nor did anyone else from the Commission agree to attend. (We’ve reached out to the Commission and Johansson’s office about her decision not to participate and will update our report if we get a response).</p>
<h2>Mounting concerns</h2>
<p>The Commission presented its draft CSAM legislation back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/eu-csam-detection-plan/">May 2022</a>. Since then opposition has been building over human rights impacts as the implications of the proposal have become clearer. While concerns — and even suspicions — about the driving forces behind the proposal have mounted, not helped by a perceived lack of engagement from the Commission with civil society organizations and others expressing genuinely held misgivings. The emotive debate has also, at times, lent itself to unhelpful polarization.</p>
<p>Even from the start there were clear questions about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/09/eu-scam-scanning-unlawful-advice/">legality</a> of the proposal. EU law requires any interferences with fundamental rights like privacy and freedom of expression to be necessary and proportionate. While the imposition of a general content monitoring obligation on online platforms is prohibited — so how does that square with a law that could put the messages of hundreds of millions of Europeans under watch by design?</p>
<p>Giving a perspective on the legality at yesterday’s seminar, Frederik Borgesius, professor at iHub, Radboud University, in the Netherlands, said in his view the Commission’s proposal is not a proportionate way of interfering with fundamental rights. He referred back to case law on data retention for terrorism — as the most relevant comparison — which has seen the bloc’s top court repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/cjeu-bulk-data-rulings-germany-france/">strike down general and indiscriminate storage</a> of Europeans’ metadata. (Not that that’s stopped Member States from keeping on breaking the law, though… )</p>
<p>“Actually, the court might not even get to a proportionality test because the data retention cases were about metadata. And this is about analysing the <em>content</em> of communications,” he went on. “The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights has an element that says if the essence of a fundamental right is violated then the measure is illegal by definition — there’s not even a need for a proportionality test.”</p>
<p>Borgesius also pointed out there’s case law on this essence point too. “When is the essence violated? Well, the court has said — in a different case — if authorities can access the contents of communications on such a large scale then the discussion is over,” he explained. “No room for proportionality test — the essence of the right to privacy would be violated, and therefore such a measure would be illegal.”</p>
<p>Legality is just one element the seminar considered. Multiple critics of the Commission’s proposal speaking at the event also argued it’s even ill-fitted in its main claimed purpose — of addressing the complex societal problem of child sexual abuse — and actually risks causing unintended consequences, including for children.</p>
<p>The seminar heard repeated concerns from panellists that minors could end up being harmed because of the regulation’s single-minded focus on scanning private comms, with speakers emphasizing the importance of evidence-based policymaking in such a sensitive area, rather than a blinding rushing down the road of technosolutionism.</p>
<p>One issue several speakers raised is that a large proportion of the sexualized content involving minors that’s being shared online is actually being done so by (and between) consenting minors (i.e. sexting). The Commission proposal could therefore lead to children being investigated and even criminalizing for exploring their own sexual identities, they suggested — since understanding what is and isn’t CSAM is not something that can necessarily be done by simply reviewing the imagery itself.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal hinges on the idea of forcing messaging platforms which are suspected of hosting CSAM to scan for illegal content (and grooming activity) and pass flagged content to a European Center to carry out initial checks — but also potentially send reported content on to law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Certainly in the case of new CSAM (i.e. suspected CSAM content that has not been previously seen, investigated and confirmed as illegal child sexual abuse material), context is essential to any assessment of what is being depicted. This is not something an AI scanning tool, or even a trained human looped in to review flagged imagery, can inherently know just by looking at a piece of content, the seminar heard.</p>
<p>So a law that automates CSAM scanning and reporting without there being a foolproof way to distinguish between actual CSAM, innocent sexting between kids, or even just a parent sending a family holiday snap to a relative via a private messaging channel they believe to be a safe way to share personal stories, looks the opposite of an intelligent response to child sexual abuse.</p>
<p>“A big part of the material that we see is not a result of sexual abuse,” Arda Gerkens, chair of the board of The Netherlands’ Authority for the Prevention of Online Terrorist Content and Child Sexual Abuse Material, told the seminar. “The material’s indeed being spread by the Internet — but it’s a growing number which is a result of sexual activity of young people themselves.”</p>
<p>The risk of “leaked images and sextortion” are “even more reason why we should keep the Internet safe and secure”, she also suggested — pointing out children can be put in an exceptionally vulnerable position if their accounts are hacked and their private comms fall into the hands of someone who wants to manipulate and abuse them.</p>
<p>“The scanning of private communication will certainly flag problematic situations — I definitely know that that’s already happening — but it’s not the solution to combat this sexual child abuse,” she went on, speaking up in favor of a narrower practice of scanning for <em>known</em> CSAM on image hosting websites to stop the further spread of material — “but not to prosecute”.</p>
<p>The legislation proposed by the Commission doesn’t properly address image hosting websites as potential repositories of CSAM, she suggested, because it’s too focused on “private communication and subsequently prosecution”. She therefore predicted the EU’s approach will be “counterproductive” when it comes to detecting perpetrators and ending domestic sexual violence.</p>
<p>“The sheer amount of images will overflow the systems we have and put even more pressure on the fragile law enforcement systems,” she suggested, adding: “It would be much better to invest in those systems and strengthen collaborations between the EU countries.”</p>
<p>Another speaker, Susan Landau, bridge professor in cyber security and Policy at Tufts University, also argued the Commission’s proposal misunderstands a multifaceted and highly sensitive issue — failing to respond to different (and distinct) types of child sexual abuse and exploitation that can occur over the Internet.</p>
<p>An approach that’s centered on investigation and prosecution, as the Commission’s is, would hit a wall in many cases, she also predicted — pointing out, for example, that an overwhelming majority of Internet-enabled sex trafficking cases involve victims being abused by people close to them, who they do not want to report.</p>
<p>“What you need there, as well as with real time abuse, is spaces that make children safe. Community spaces. Online safety education. Education about online security and safety by design,” she suggested.</p>
<p>“The point is that the law requires scanning to handle the child sexual abuse and exploitation issue misunderstands the issue,” Landau added. “There are multiple ways… to prevent and investigate the crime [of child sexual abuse] that are not affected by end-to-end encryption (E2EE) . Meanwhile, end-to-end encryption is a technology that secures both children and adults.”</p>
<p>Also speaking during the event was Alexander Hanff, a privacy expert and advocate — who is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/05/school-sexual-abuse-justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">himself a survivor of child sexual abuse</a>. He too asserted that a lot of sexualized imagery of children that’s shared online is being done privately between consenting minors. But the impact the Commission’s proposal would have on minors who sext is not something the EU’s executive appears to have considered.</p>
<p>“If we now introduce a law which requires the scanning of all digital communications, and by that we’re talking billions, tens of billions of communications every single day across the EU, those images would then be sent to multiple individuals along the chain of investigation —&nbsp; including Europol and various law enforcement bodies, etc — creating victims,” he warned. “Because one of the things that we see in relation to CSAM, and speaking as a survivor myself, is the impact on the dignity of the individuals for whom it relates.</p>
<p>“The very fact that people are viewing these images — which is exactly the intent of the Commission to try and overcome — is a form of abuse itself. So if we now take innocent pictures, which have been shared among consenting individuals, and expose them to potentially hundreds of other individuals down the investigation chain then we are indeed actually creating more victims as a result of this.”</p>
<p>Another attendee — WhatsApp’s public policy director, Helen Charles — chipped into the discussion to offer an industry view, saying that while the Meta-owned messaging platform supports EU lawmakers in their aim of tackling child sexual abuse, it shares concerns that the Commission’s approach is not well targeted at this multifaceted problem; and that it risks major unintended consequences for web users of all ages.</p>
<p>“We think that any outcome that requires scanning of content in end-to-end encrypted messaging would undermine fundamental rights, as several colleagues have set out,” she told the seminar. “Instead, the draft regulation should set the right conditions for services like WhatsApp and other end-to-end encrypted services to mitigate the misuse of our services in a way that’s reasonable and proportionate but that also considers both the different nature of harm…&nbsp;but also includes things like prevention and other upstream measures that could help tackle these kinds of harms.”</p>
<p>Charles went on to advocate for EU lawmakers to give platforms more leeway to use “traffic data” (i.e. metadata; not comms content) for the prevention of child sexual abuse under the EU’s existing ePrivacy Directive — noting that the current (temporary) ePrivacy derogation for platforms, which lets them scan non-E2EE messages for CSAM, only covers detection, reporting and takedown, not prevention.</p>
<p>“Having access to some data can be helpful in a targeted proportionate way to address those risks,” she argued. “Where it is legal Meta does deploy techniques, including the use of traffic data, to identify potentially problematic behaviour. This is not just about detection, though. This is also about prevention… [T]raffic data can be an important signal when used with other signals to help services proactively disrupt violating message groups and accounts who may be seeking to abuse our services.</p>
<p>“So we would encourage institutions, when they’re thinking about the way forward here, to both ensure end-to-end encryption is protected and that services can tackle CSAM without accessing message content but also look at ways that EPG traffic data can be processed in a proportionate and targeted manner, including for prevention. We think, in this way, the regulation will move closer to achieving its objectives.”</p>
<p>The seminar also heard concerns about the limitations of the current state of the art in AI-based CSAM detection. A big issue here is AI tools used to detect known CSAM are proprietary — with no independent verification of claims made for their accuracy, said Jaap-Henk Hoepman, visiting professor in computer science at Karlstad University. “The problem is that the [CSAM detection] techniques being discussed — either PhotoDNA [developed by Microsoft] or NeuralHash [made by Apple] — are proprietary and therefore not publicly available and known and study-able algorithms — which means that we simply have to rely on the figures provided by the companies on how effective these technologies are.”</p>
<p>He also pointed to work by academics and other researchers who have reverse engineered PhotoDNA that he said revealed some elementary flaws — such as evidence it’s particularly easy to evade detection against a known CSAM fingerprint by simply rotating or mirroring the image.</p>
<p>“Clearly this has implications for the proportionality of the [Commission] proposal, because a serious breach of privacy is being proposed for an not-so-effective measure,” he added, going on to warn about risks from “targeted false positives” — where attackers seek to manipulate an image so that an algorithm detects it as CSAM when, to the human eye, it looks innocuous — either to frame an innocent person or trick app users into forwarding a doctored image (and, if enough people share it, he warned it could flood detection systems and even cause a DDoS-like event).</p>
<p>“This technology is not free from error — and we’re talking many billions of communications [being scanned] every day. So even if we have a 0.1% error rate that accounts for many millions of false positives or false negatives on a daily basis. Which is not something that we can subscribe to in a democracy,” Hanff also warned, chiming in with a technosocial perspective on flawed AI tools.</p>
<p>Claudia Peersman, a senior research associate in the Cyber Security Research Group of the University of Bristol, had a pertinent assessment to offer related to work she’d been involved with at the Rephrain Centre. The expert academic group recently independently assessed five proof-of-concept projects, developed in the U.K. with government backing, to scan E2EE content for CSAM without — per the Home Office’s headline claim — compromising people’s privacy.</p>

<p>The problem is, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/20/braverman-warns-meta-over-e2e-encryption/">none of the projects lived up to that billing</a>. “None of these tools were able to meet [our assessment] criteria. I think this is the most important part of our conclusion. Which does not mean that we do not support the development of AI supported tools for online child protection in general. We just believe that the tools are not ready to be deployed on such a large scale on private messages within end-to-end encrypted environments,” she told the seminar.</p>
<p>Delegates also heard a warning that client-side scanning — the technology experts suggest the EU law will force onto E2EE platforms such as WhatsApp if/when they’re served with a CSAM detection order — is far too new and immature to be rushed into mainstream application.</p>
<p>“As computer science researchers we’ve just begun to look at this technology,” said Matthew Green, a cryptographer p<span>rofessor at The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. “</span>I want to stress how completely new the idea of client side scanning is — the very first computer science research papers on the topic appeared in 2021 and we’re not even two years later, and we’re already discussing laws that mandate it.”</p>
<p>“The problem of building systems where [content scanning] algorithms are confidential and can’t be exploited is something we’re just beginning to research. And so far, many of our technical results are negative — negative in the sense that we keep finding ways to break these systems,” he also told the seminar. “Break them means that we will ultimately violate the confidentiality of many users. We will cause false positives. We will cause bad data to be injected into the system.</p>
<p>“And, in some cases, there’s this possibility that abuse victims may be re traumatised if the systems are built poorly… I’m just a computer scientist. I’m not a legislator or a lawyer. My request to this community is please, please give us time. To actually do the research, to figure out whether and how to do this safely before we start to deploy these systems and mandate them by law.”</p>
<h2>Children’s rights being ignored?</h2>
<p>A number of speakers also had passionate critiques that the views (and rights) of children themselves are being ignored by lawmakers — with several accusing the Commission of failing to consult kids about a proposal with severe implications for children’s rights, as well as for the privacy and fundamental rights of everyone who uses digital comms tools.</p>
<p>“We should involve the children,” said Gerkens. “We are speaking here about them. We are judging about what they do online. We have a moral opinion about it. But we’re not talking to them. They are the ones we are speaking about. We haven’t involved them in this legislation. I think we should.”</p>
<p>Sabine Witting, assistant professor at Leiden University, also warned over a raft of “negative” impacts on kids’ rights — saying the EU proposal will affect children’s right to privacy, personal data protection, freedom of expression and access to information.</p>
<p>“In this context, I really would like to highlight that — from a children’s rights perspective — privacy and protection are not contradicting each other. Actually, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and its General Comment number 25, made it very clear that privacy is actually vital for children’s safety. So privacy is not a hindrance of children’s safety as it’s often projected. It’s actually an important precondition to safety,” she said.</p>
<p>Witting also had a strong message about the harms that could accrue for adolescents whose private texts to each other get sucked up and caught in a CSAM-scanning dragnet. “The investigation alone can already be very, very harmful for affected adolescents, especially in cases where we have adolescents from marginalised communities. For example, LGBTQ+ children,” she warned. “Because this kind of investigation might lead to false disclosure, further marginalisation and in a worst case scenario, also political persecution or the like, so children and adolescents being targets of a criminal investigation is already harmful in and of themselves.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately the proposal will not be able to prevent that from happening. So this whole process of scanning private communications among adolescents of the most intimate nature, the further review by private sector, by government, the potential involvement of law enforcement, all of that is really a significant violation of children’s right to privacy.”</p>
<p>Witting said she’d raised this issue with the Commission — but had no response. “I think because there is just no simple answer,” she added. “Because it lies in the nature of the subject matter that these kinds of cases will not be able to be filtered out along the process.”</p>
<p>The idea of the EU passing a law that sanctions warrantless searches of everyone’s “digital worlds” was skewered more generally by Iverna McGowan, director of the European office of the Center for Democracy and Technology.</p>
<p>“What essentially the detection orders amount to are warrantless searches of our digital worlds,” she argued. “We would of course never expect or accept that law enforcement would enter our homes, or private setting, with no warrants and no reasonable suspicion to search everything belonging to us. And so we cannot of course, allow that to happen on the online space either because it would be a death knell to the rule of law and criminal law as we know it in the digital context.”</p>
<p>Going on to offer some thoughts on how to salvage something from the Commission proposal — i.e. to undo the existential threat is poses to European values and democracy — would, she suggested, require a fundamental rewriting of the detection order provisions.&nbsp;Including to ensure provisions are formulated with “sufficient precision” to not apply to people whose conduct is not suspected of being criminal.</p>
<p>She also argued for an independent judicial authority being invoked to sign off searches and verify the purposes and basis upon which individuals or groups of people are suspected. Plus proportionality tests built in — to determine whether the law allows for a truly independent assessment.</p>
<p>“If you consider that all of these different elements would have to be in line in order for detection order to be lawful then I think we’re in a very challenging situation at the moment with the text that’s on the table before us,” she cautioned.</p>
<p>Mission creep was another concern raised by several speakers — with panellists pointing to<a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/29/europol-sought-unlimited-data-access-in-online-child-sexual-abuse-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> documents obtained by journalists</a> that suggest Europol wants unfiltered access to data obtained under the CSAM-scanning proposal.</p>
<p>“[We] know that the objective of Europol is to become a data hub and to also enlarge and strengthen its missions,” said MEP Saskia Bricmont. “Is there a risk of function creep? I think there is obviously, not only because of what has happened before in the evolution of the legislation around Europol but also because it seems that Europol has been pushing to obtain, in this legislation, what it aims for — namely, collect data, extend access to data and filter data — and which is also reflected in the Commission’s proposal.”</p>
<p>She noted this requires all reports “not manifestly unfounded” to be sent simultaneously to Europol and national law enforcement agencies. “So far the European Parliament’s position is not going in that direction… But, nevertheless, the initial proposal of the Commission is going in that direction and… <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/29/europol-sought-unlimited-data-access-in-online-child-sexual-abuse-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Europol has been also pushing for extended detection to other crime areas</a> beyond CSAM.”</p>
<h2>No dialogue</h2>
<p>The event was being held two days before Ylva Johansson, the bloc’s commissioner for Home Affairs — who has been the driving force behind the CSAM-scanning proposal — is due to attend a hearing with the European Parliament’s civil rights committee.</p>
<p>Critics have accused Johansson personally, and the Commission generally, of a lack of transparency and accountability around the controversial proposal. So the meeting will be closely watched and, most likely, rather a tense affair (to put it mildly).</p>
<p>One key criticism — also aired during the seminar — is that EU lawmakers are using the highly sensitive and emotive issue of child abuse to push a blanket surveillance plan on the region that would drastically impact the fundamental rights of hundreds of millions of Europeans.</p>
<p>“What I find really problematic is the instrumentalization of such a sensitive topic, emotional question also related to the fight — and legitimate fight and prior fights — against child sexual abuse,” said Bricmont. “And this is also what we as MEPs as European parliament have to dig into, and we will have the exchanges with the commissioner in our LIBE Committee. Because we want to know more about this and other revelations of <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BalkanInsight’s [investigative reporting]</a> when it comes to potential conflicts of interests.”</p>
<p>“Let us regret the absence of the Commission because I think we need dialogue,” she added. “I think we need to share knowledge and information in this file and that the fact that there’s a closed door [increases] suspicion also. If we want to believe that the intentions are positive and to fight against child sexual abuse then it means that every party, every person needs to be also open to the counter arguments and bring founded arguments to explain why they want to go into that direction.</p>
<p>“So the question is, is the Commission misled? Misinformed? What is it? And this is also true for the Council side — because we know [there is there] probably also a lack of understanding of what is discussed today, and the risks related to the end of end-to-end encryption.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month Johansson responded to critics by penning a <a href="https://commissioners.ec.europa.eu/news/setting-record-straight-2023-10-15_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that denounced what she suggested had included personal attacks on her and attacked those who have been raising doubts, including over opaque lobbying around the file — after <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journalists questioned</a> the level of access given to lobbyists for commercial entities involved in selling so-called safety tech who stand to benefit from a law that makes use of such tools mandatary.</p>
<p>She went so far as to suggest that civil society opposition to the CSAM-scanning proposal may be acting as a sock puppet for Big Tech interests.</p>
<p>“The biggest digital rights NGO in Europe gets funding from the biggest tech company in the world. EDRI, the European Digital Rights NGO, publishes on its website that it receives funding from Apple,” she wrote. “Apple was accused of moving encryption keys to China, which critics say could endanger customer data. Yet no-one asks if these are strange bedfellows, no-one assumes Apple is drafting EDRI’s speaking points.”</p>
<p>Ella Jakubowska, senior policy advisor at EDRi, did not engage directly with the commissioner’s attack on her employer during her own contribution to the seminar. Instead she dedicated her two-to-three minutes of speaking time to calling out the Commission for asking Europeans to make a false choice between privacy and safety.</p>
<p>“This disingenuous narrative has been reiterated in surveys which have crassly asked people if they agree that the ability to detect child abuse is more important than the right to online privacy,” she said. “This is a misrepresentation of both privacy and safety — as if we can all altruistically give up some of our privacy in order to keep children safe online. It doesn’t work in that way. And this sort of attitude really failed to grasp the deep social roots of the crime that we are talking about. To the contrary, I think it’s clear that privacy and safety are mutually reinforcing.”</p>
<p>Jakubowska also accused the EU’s executive of seeking to manipulate public support for its proposal by deploying leading survey questions. (Johansson’s blog post pointed to a new Eurobarometer<a href="https://ecpat.org/breaking-eu-citizens-support-child-safety-online/"> poll</a> which she claimed showed massive public support for laws that regulate online service providers to fight child sexual abuse, including 81% supporting platforms having obligations to detect, report and remove child sexual abuse.)</p>
<p>She went on to highlight concerns that the proposal poses risks to professional secrecy (such as lawyer client privilege), warning: “This of course, on the surface should be of concern to all of us in a democratic society. But even more so when we’re thinking about this crime of child sexual abuse, where securing convictions of perpetrators is so deeply important. The idea that this law could stand in the way of already fragile access to justice for survivors should not be taken lightly. But this element was not even considered in the Commission’s proposal.”</p>
<p>She also highlighted the risk of negative impacts on children’s political participation — which she said is an angle that’s been under-examined by lawmakers, despite children’s rights law requiring their voices to be listened to in legislation that will impact young people.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard very little from children and young people themselves. In fact, in a representative survey that was undertaken earlier this year, it was found that 80% of young people aged between 13 and 17 from across 13 EU Member States would not feel comfortably being politically active or exploring their sexuality if authorities were able to monitor their digital communication. And that was specifically asked if it was being done for the purpose of scanning for child sexual abuse. So it’s really clear when we asked young people if this is the sort of measure that they want to keep them safe that this is not the answer,” she suggested.</p>
<p>The final panellist to speak during the event was MEP Patrick Breyer who has been a stalwart voice raised in opposition of the CSAM-scanning proposal — aka, “Chatcontrol” as he’s pithily dubbed it — ever since the controversial plan popped up on the EU’s horizon.</p>
<p>During the seminar he described the proposal as “unprecedented in the free world”, suggesting it has led to unhelpfully polarized arguments both for and against. The more fruitful approach for policymakers would, he argued, be to work for consensus <span>— to “try to bring the two sides together”, by keeping bits of the proposal everyone can get behind and then — “consensually” — adding “new, effective approaches” to push for something that “can protect children much better”.</span></p>
<p>Discussing how the proposal might be amended to reduce negative impacts and bolster protections for kids, Breyer<span> said a new approach is needed — one that doesn’t just remove the controversial detection orders but focused on prevention by </span><span>“strictly limiting the scanning of communications to persons presumably involved in child sexual exploitation”. So targeted investigations, not Chatcontrol. </span><span>“That’s the only way to avoid involvement in court and achieving nothing at all for our children,” he argued.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Per Breyer, MEPs who support reforming the proposal are working hard to achieve such changes in the Parliament. But — so far — he said the Council is “r<span>efusing any measure of targeting”. </span></p>
<p><span>“We also need to avoid un-targeted voluntary detection by industry, both concerning content and metadata, because it suffers the same problems for proportionality as the mandated detected,” he went on. “And the same goes for not turning our personal devices into scanners, in order to back door encryption. So we need to explicitly exclude client-side scanning… </span><span>What the Council is looking at — some vague commitments to how important encryption is — does not do the job.”</span></p>
<p><span>On detection, as an alternative to unacceptable mass surveillance he spoke up in favor of proactive crawling of publicly accessible material — which he noted is already being done the U.K. and Canada — as a way to “clean the web”. Th</span><span>e proposed new EU Centre could be tasked with doing that, he suggested, along with focusing on crime prevention, victim support and best practices for law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>In wider remarks, he also urged lawmakers to resist calls to impose mandatory age verification on platforms as another ill-thought through child safety measure — suggesting the focus should instead be placed on making services safe by design.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t profiles be restricted to being private unless the user explicitly wants to make them publicly visible? Should anybody be able to reach out to new users and to send them all sorts of photos without the user even being asked? And shouldn’t the users have the right to decide whether they want to see nude photos? It’s possible to tell on the device without giving any information to the provider. Such confirmation could also go a long way to warning teenagers and children of what could be the consequences — and maybe offering them to reach out for support.”</p>
<p>But non-technical solutions are ultimately “key” to preventing child sexual abuse, he suggested, emphasizing: “<span>We can’t focus just on technical approaches only. </span></p>
<p><span>The stakes if EU lawmakers fail to reach a sensible revision of the proposal in trilogue negotiations on this file are grave indeed, he also warned — with the possibility that a CSAM-scanning law could mean “</span><span>the end of truly confidential private messaging and secure encryption” — and also “pave the way to introducing unprecedented authoritarian methods to democracies”. </span></p>
<p>It is the thin end of the wedge, in Breyer’s view. “<span>If they start scanning our communications without cause what prevents them from scanning our devices, or even from scanning our homes? There is technology of shot detection; everything can be done with AI. And I think if that precedent is set — that it is justified to intrude in personal and private spaces just because they could be some hint of a crime — then this very much destroys the essence of the right to privacy,” he suggested.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“But if we prevail with our views, I think we can set a global example for protecting children online in line with our values. And that’s what I’m fighting for. Not just for our generation but also for our children, because I want them to grow up in a free world where we trust each other and not in a surveillance state of mutual fear.”</span></p>

<p>Sentry is an Open Source company, and our mission is to help developers ship with confidence. Part of shipping with confidence is knowing that Open Source dependencies are well-maintained, and one major way to ensure that dependencies are maintained is to fund them sustainably. We’ve always done our part since the beginning of <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome">Sentry</a>, and we really got organized two years ago when we <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-154-999-dollars-and-89-cents-to-open-source-maintainers/">gave $154,999.89</a> to over 100 noncommercial projects. Last year we repeated the program and <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-260-028-dollars-to-open-source-maintainers/">gave $260,028</a> to almost 200 projects. For our third Open Source Fund Fest, we’re nearly doubling our commitment again, to $500,000 for 500+ Open Source maintainers. This equates to <strong>$3,700 per developer</strong> employed at Sentry, which we think is quite reasonable compensation for the value we receive from the noncommercial, sponsorship-seeking part of the Open Source community. Thank you for your work!</p>

<p>Our program this year focused on two aspects: <strong>breadth</strong> and <strong>depth</strong>. We wanted to give at least a little bit to all of our dependencies (and other projects nominated by our employees). We then wanted to give larger amounts to some projects based on how heavily we depend on them in our company. The two partners we are working with to allocate and distribute funds are <a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> and <a href="https://thanks.dev/">Thanks.dev</a>—thanks to both of them for helping us!</p>

<p>We dedicated 10% of our budget to giving small amounts (in the $4 to $10 per month range) to as many dependencies on GitHub Sponsors as we could. We were able to achieve 95% or greater coverage of our fundable dependencies in our three primary GitHub organizations (<code>getsentry</code>, <code>codecov</code>, and <code>syntaxfm</code>). We were not able to reach 100% because some of our dependencies have minimum sponsorships higher than $10, and a few of our dependencies are maintained by employees. Sentry is the first company to approach 100% coverage of all of our fundable dependencies through GitHub Sponsors. Nobody else even comes close (I asked).</p>

<p>Some frown on small amounts. They’re wrong. Even small sponsorships can bring great motivation to individual maintainers. For many of our dependencies, we are likely their first and sole sponsor. That feels great, and helps maintainers stay motivated and keep pushing their projects forward.</p>

<p>If 1,000 companies gave $5 per month to an average of 100 maintainers each, that would be $6,000,000 per year. That would probably get 90% of the sponsorship-seeking part of the Open Source community from zero to one, and for some it would be <a href="https://twitter.com/fossfunders/status/1711831844117778682">life-changing</a>. That would be something to celebrate, and it seems quite achievable!</p>

<p>Small amounts drive gratitude, but of course we do need to go further to sustain maintainers over the long haul. The remaining 90% of our budget went through Thanks.dev (except for $15,000 to the Open Source Initiative, which we paid directly earlier in the year in order to kick off <a href="https://code.librehq.com/ots/dosp-research">research on the phenomenon of “delayed Open Source publication”</a>). Notable recipients this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb">rrweb</a> ($15,000), which is the basis for our <a href="https://sentry.io/for/session-replay/">Replay</a> product,</li>
<li>the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">PHP</a> ($10,000) and <a href="https://rubycentral.org/">Ruby</a> ($6,000) foundations, and</li>
<li><a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a> ($1,750), the framework <a href="https://syntax.fm/">Syntax</a> uses for <a href="https://twitter.com/syntaxfm/status/1716498085273125131">their new site</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks.dev has been a crucial partner for us to achieve our goals. With <strong>500+ maintainers and 3,000+ projects</strong> to fund across <strong>1,000+ repos in three GitHub organizations</strong>, our program has outgrown what I can easily keep up with on my own. Thanks.dev has the closest thing to a scalable funding platform, with both automatic discovery and manual inclusions, and the ability to weight allocations at the org, repo, ecosystem, and individual project level.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Thanks.dev team is extremely responsive. Ali and Armin rapidly iterate on their software to accommodate us, and they hustle hard to discover and implement workarounds where needed. Sentry supports nine larger foundations. Thanks.dev did the grunt work of long back-and-forth email cycles to renew our sponsorships with these foundations, get invoices generated and processed, and place our logo. For the long tail of smaller projects, Thanks.dev individually emailed hundreds of maintainers and supported them through onboarding to the platform. It’s hard to imagine a better team to work with, and I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to run an Open Source funding program like ours.</p>

</a>Creating Change Through FOSS Funders and Beyond</h2>
<p>Because Thanks.dev did so much of the grunt work this year, I was able to focus my time on building up a group called <a href="https://fossfunders.com/">FOSS Funders</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duaneobrien/">Duane O’Brien</a> started FOSS Funders two years ago as a recurring Zoom call for decision-makers at companies who fund Open Source. I joined early on. A couple months ago, I built a website for the group, and started actively recruiting other companies to join. We are up to seven logos. <a href="https://github.com/fossfunders/fossfunders.com#readme">Let’s make yours next</a>! :-)</p>

<p>FOSS Funders is important, because the problem of Open Source sustainability will not be solved without a widespread cultural change in our industry towards meaningful voluntary sponsorship (the second major component of long-term change is taxation-based programs such as the <a href="https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>). We need to make it weird for companies not to support Open Source, and FOSS Funders is the best venue I’ve found for driving that change together with like-minded colleagues at <a href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/ecosystem/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/cto/community/#foss-contributor-fund">SourceGraph</a>, and elsewhere. Thanks to Duane and all of my fellow FOSS Funders for leading this change together. Let’s tell more stories about companies funding Open Source!</p>
<p>The reason Sentry can give meaningful amounts of money to the noncommercial, sponsorship-seeking part of the Open Source community is because we are a successful commercial member of the Open Source community. Balancing user freedom with developer sustainability is the core of <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/sentrys-open-source-values/">our Open Source values</a>, and one of the keys to our own sustainability was relicensing Sentry four years ago in order to protect ourselves from rapacious competitors. While the license we chose has served us well, it does have flaws, and we are working on writing a new license called the <a href="https://fsl.software/">Functional Source License</a>. If you are building an Open Source company, consider working with us to foment <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/loose-confederation/issues/4">a “sustainable source” movement</a> around this new license.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are following up on this blog post with a livestream conversation with two other leaders in Open Source sustainability from a funder’s perspective, Kara Sowles Deloss of GitHub Accelerator, and Fiona Krakenbürger of Sovereign Tech Fund. <a href="https://sentry.io/resources/the-future-of-open-source-the-state-of-sustainability/">Register to join us on October 26</a> for that.</p>
<p>Thank you maintainers! Thank you funders! Thank you platforms! Let’s keep telling these stories and changing the industry together! 💃</p></div></div>]]></description>

That Time the City of Seattle Accidentally Gave Me 32m Emails for 40 Dollars
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #201810190552.11# -->
<p>October 19, 2018 — 
Matt Chapman

<!-- text begin -->

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>In my last post, I wrote about my adventure of requesting metadata for both phone calls and emails from the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor.  The work there - and its associated frustration - sent me down a path of sending requests throughout the US to both learn whether these sorts of problems are systemic (megaspoiler: they are) and to also start mapping communication across the United States. Since then, I’ve submitted over a hundred requests for email metadata across the United States – at least two per state.</p>

<p>The first large batch of requests for email metadata were sent to the largest cities of fourteen arbitrary states in a trial run of sorts. In the end of that batch, only two cities were willing to continue with the request - Houston and Seattle. Houston complied surprisingly quickly and snail mailed the metadata for 6m emails.</p>

<p>Seattle on the other hand...</p>

<h3>The Request</h3>

<p>On April 2, 2017 I sent this fairly boilerplate request to Seattle's IT department:</p>

<pre><code>For all emails sent to/from any Seattle owned email address in 2017, please provide the following information:

1. From address
2. To address
3. bcc addresses
4. cc addresses
5. Time
6. Date
</code></pre>

<p>Technically this request can done with a single line powershell command. At a policy level, though, it usually gets a lot of pushback. Seattle's first response included a bit of gobsmackery that I’ve <em>almost</em> become used to:</p>

<pre><code>Based on my preliminary research, there have been 5.5 million emails sent and 26.8 million emails received by seattle.gov email addresses in the past 90 days. This is a significant amount of records that will need to be reviewed prior to sharing them with you. Do you have a more targeted list of email addresses you might be interested in? If not, I will work to find out how long review will take and will be in touch.
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, I still want the records, so -</p>

<pre><code>I would like to stick with this request as-is for all ~32m emails.&nbsp; Since this request is for metadata only, the amount of review needed should be relatively small.
</code></pre>

<h3>Fee Estimate of 33 Million Dollars</h3>

<center><a href="https://mchap.io/assets/fee_estimate.png"><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/fee_estimate.png"></a></center>

<p>A week later, I received this glorious response. Each paragraph is interesting in itself, so let’s break most of it down piece by piece.</p>

<h4>Rewording of request</h4>

<pre><code>This acknowledges receipt of your public disclosure request C012032-041017 received on April 03, 2017 regarding:

    All emails sent to/from any Seattle owned email address in 2017 including metadata:1. From address2. To address3. bcc addresses4. cc addresses5. Time6. Date
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the change of language from the original wording.  Their rewording completely changes the scope of the request so that it's not just for metadata, but also the emails <em>contents</em>. No idea why they did that.</p>

<h4>Salary Fees</h4>

<pre><code>With that being said, Seattle IT estimates spending 30 seconds to two minutes to review each email.  It has been estimated that this work will take approximately 320 years of staff time at an expense of $33 million in salary.
</code></pre>

<p>Wot.</p>

<p>Normally, a flustered public records officer would just reject a giant request for being for “unduly burdensome”… but this sort of estimate is practically unheard of. So much so that other FOIA nerds have told me that this is the second biggest request they've ever seen. The passive aggression is <em>thick</em>. Needless to say, it's not something I'm willing to pay for! </p>

<p>The estimate of 30s per metadata entry is also a bit suspect. Especially with the use of Excel, which would be useful for removing duplicates, etc.</p>

<h4>Storage Fees</h4>

<pre><code>We estimate that this request contains 8-10 terabytes of information, for which we could need to stand up an FTP server through which the requester will be able to download cleared email meta data.  As allowed under RCW 42.56.120, we would charge the requester for the actual copying costs of fulfilling this request.  Based on the Seattle IT cost model used for internal City charge backs, the anticipated cost to the requester is $2,480 per year plus $2.11 per gigabyte of storage.  We are still working on the storage requirements for this effort.  If we assume 10 TB of storage, this would require $21,606.40/year in requester fees.
</code></pre>

<p>Heh. Any sysadmin can tell you that The costs of storage doesn’t exactly come from the storage medium itself; administration costs, supporting hardware, etc, are the bulk of the costs. But come on, let’s be realistic here. There’s very little room for good faith in their cost estimates – especially since the last time a single gigabyte cost that much <a href="http://www.mkomo.com/cost-per-gigabyte-update">was between 2002 and 2004</a>.</p>

<p>That said – some other interesting things going on here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Their file size estimation is huge. For comparison, that Houston’s email metadata dump was only 1.2GB.</li>
<li>The fact that they mention “meta data” [sic] implies that they did acknowledge that the request was for metadata.</li>
<li>Seattle already uses Amazon S3 to store public records requests’ data. At the time,  <a href="https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/aws-vs-azure-cloud-storage-comparison">S3 was charging $.023/GB</a></li>
</ol>

<h4>Continue anyway?</h4>

<pre><code>At this time, the City anticipates that it will be able to provide a first installment of records on or about May 29, 2017. However, please note that this time estimate may change depending on the clarification you provide and as we continue to process your request.&nbsp; If the City does not hear from you within 30 days, the City will consider your request closed.
</code></pre>

<p>Oddly, they don't actually close out the request and instead ask whether I wanted to continue or not.  I responded to their amazing email by asking how many records I'd receive on May 29th, but never received an answer back. </p>

<h3>Reversal of the Original Cost Estimate</h3>

<p>On June 5, they sent a new response admitting that their initial fee estimation was wrong, and asked for $1.25 for two days’ (out of three months) of records:</p>

<pre><code>At this point I can send you an exel spreadsheet with the data points you are requesting.&nbsp; The cost for the first installment is $1.25 for emails sent or received on January 1 and 2, 2017.&nbsp; Because the spreadsheet does not contain the body of the email and just the metadata that you requested, no review will be necessary, and we'll be able to get this information to you at a faster pace than the 320 years quoted you earlier.&nbsp;
</code></pre>

<p>Because they're asking for a single check for $1.25 for just two days’ worth of metadata – and wouldn’t send anything until that first check came in, my interpretation is that they’re taking a page from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/">/r/maliciouscompliance</a> and just making this request as painful as possible just for the simple sake of making it difficult. So in response, I preemptively sent them fourteen separate checks. The first thirteen checks were all around ~$1.25. That seemed to work, since they never asked for a single payment afterwards.</p>

<p>From there, my inbox went mostly silent for two months, and I mostly forgot about the request, though they eventually cashed all of the checks and made me an account for their public records portal.</p>

<h3>SNAFU</h3>

<p>Fast forward to August 22, when I randomly added that email account back to my phone. Unexpectedly, it turned out they actually finished the request! And without a bill for millions of dollars! Sure enough, their public records request portal had about 400 files available to download, which all in all contained metadata for about 32 million emails. Neat!</p>

<p>Problem though... <i>they accidentally included the first 256 characters of all 32 million emails.</i></p>

<p>Here are some things I found in the emails:</p>

<ol>
<li>Usernames and passwords.</li>
<li>Credit card numbers.</li>
<li>Social security numbers and drivers licenses.</li>
<li>Ongoing police investigations and arrest reports.</li>
<li>Texts of cheating husbands to their lovers.</li>
<li>FBI Investigations.</li>
<li>Zabbix alerts.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words... they just leaked to me a massive dataset filled with intimately private information. In the process, they very likely broke <em>many</em> laws, including the Privacy Act of 1974 and many of WA's own public records laws. Frankly, I'm still at a loss of words.</p>

<p>It’s hard to say how any of this happened exactly, but odds are that a combination of request’s rewording and the original public records officer going on vacation led to a communication breakdown. I don’t want to dwell on the mistake itself, so I’ll stop it at that.</p>

<p><em>Side note to Seattle's IT department - clean up your disks. You shouldn't have that many disks at 100%!</em></p>

<h3>Raising the Issue</h3>

<p>I responded as passively as possible in the hopes that they’d catch their mistake on their own:</p>

<pre><code>The responsive records are not consistent with my request and includes much more info than I initially requested. Could you please revisit this request and provide the records responsive to my initial request?
</code></pre>

<p>Their response:</p>

<pre><code>The information that you requestedis located in columns: 
From address = column J
To address = column K
bcc address = column M
cc address = column L
Time and date = column R&nbsp; of the reports.&nbsp; 
The records were generatedfrom a system report and I am unable to limit the report to generate only thefields you requested.&nbsp; The City has no duty to create a record that doesnot exist.&nbsp; As such, we have provided all records responsive to yourrequest and consider your request closed.
</code></pre>

<p>Disregarding the fact that they used a very common tactic of denying information on the basis that its disclosure would require the creation of new records… they didn’t get the point. I explained what information they leaked, and made it very clear how I was going to escalate this:</p>

<pre><code>Please address this matter as if it was a large data breach. For now, I will be raising this matter to the WA Office of Privacy and Data Protection. None of the files provided to me have been shared with anyone else, nor do I have any future intention of sharing.
</code></pre>

<p>Their response:</p>

<pre><code>Thank you for your email and bringing this inadvertent error to our attention so quickly. We have temporarily suspended access to GovQA while we look into the cause of this issue. We are also working on reprocessing your request and anticipate providing you with corrected copies of the records you requested through GovQA next week. In the meantime, please do not review, share, copy or otherwise use these records for any purpose.

We are sorry for any inconvenience.
</code></pre>

<h3>Phone Call</h3>

<p>Not too long after that, after contacting some folks on Seattle’s Open Data Slack, I found my way onto a conference phone call with both Seattle’s Chief Technology officer and their Chief Privacy Officer and we discussed what happened, and what should happen with the records. They thanked me for bringing the situation to their attention and all that, but the mood of the call was as if both parties had a knife behind their back. Somewhere towards the end of the call, I asked them if it was okay to keep the emails. Why not at least ask, right? </p>

<p>Funny enough, in the middle of that question, my internet died and interrupted the call for the first time in the six months I lived in that house. Odd. It came back ten minutes later, and I dialed back into the conference line, but the mood of the call pretty much 180’d. They told me:</p>

<ol>
<li>All files were to be deleted.</li>
<li>Seattle would hire <a href="https://www.kroll.com/en-us/default.aspx">Kroll</a> to scan my hard drives to prove deletion.</li>
<li>Agreeing to #1 and #2 would give me full legal indemnification.</li>
</ol>

<p>This isn't something I'm even remotely cool with, so we ended the call a couple minutes later, and agreed to have our lawyers speak going forward.</p>

<h3>Deleting the Files</h3>

<p>After that call, I asked my lawyer to reach out to their lawyer and was pretty much told that Seattle was approaching the problem as if they were pursuing Computer Fraud And Abuse (CFAA) charges. For information that they sent. <em>Jiminey Cricket..</em></p>

<p><em>So, I deleted the files.</em></p>

<p>Most of what happened next over a month or so was mostly between their lawyer and mine, so there’s not really that much for me to say. Early on I suggested that I write an affidavit that explains what happened, how I deleted the files, and I validated that the files were deleted. They mostly agreed, but still wanted to throw some silly assurance things my way – including asking me to run a <a href="https://mchap.io/assets/bashscript">bash script</a> to overwrite any unused disk space with random bits. I eventually ran <code>zerofree</code> and <code>fstrim</code> instead, and they accepted the affidavit. No more legal threats from there.</p>

<h3>Seattle’s Reaction</h3>

<p>About a week after the phone call, a Seattle city employee contacted Seattle’s KIRO7 about the incident. In KIRO7's investigation, they learned that, Seattle hadn’t sent any disclosure of the leak - something required by WA’s public records request law. Only after their investigation did Seattle actually notify its employees about the emails leak. <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/seattle-mistakenly-released-city-emails/619083415">Link to their story</a> (video inside).</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/mattmiller.png"></center>

<p>A week later, <a href="https://crosscut.com/2017/10/seattle-information-technology-department-email-leak-city-scrambles">another article</a> was published by Seattle’s Crosscut which goes into a <em>lot</em> of detail, including some history of Seattle's IT department. This line towards the bottom still makes me laugh a little:</p>

<pre><code>The buffer against potential legal and administrative chaos in this scenario is only that Chapman has turned out to be, as Armbruster described him, a "good Samaritan." Efforts to track down Chapman were not successful; Crosscut contacted several Matthew Chapmans who denied being the requester.
</code></pre>

<p>On January 19th, Seattle's CTO, Michael Mattmiller gave his resignation. Whether his resignation is related to the email leak is hard to say, but I just think the timing makes it worth mentioning.</p>

<h3>Finally – The Metadata</h3>

<p>Starting January 26th, Seattle started sending installments of the email metadata I requested. So far they've sent 27 million emails. As of the writing of this post, there are only two departments who haven’t provided their email metadata: the Police Department and Human Services.</p>

<p>You can download the raw data <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/foiachap/seattle-email-metadata">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some things about the dataset:</p>

<ol>
<li>It’s very messy – triple quotes, semicolons, commas, oh my.</li>
<li>There are a millions of systems alerts.</li>
<li>For seattle.gov → seattle.gov communication, there are two distinct metadata records.</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case, it's still somewhat workable, so I've been working on a proof of concept for its use in the greater context of public records laws. Not ready to talk much about it yet, so here's is a gephi graph of one day's worth of metadata. Its layout is Yifan Hu and filtered with a k-core minimum of 5 and a minimum degree of 5:</p>

<h3>One Last Thing: Legislative Immunity Kerfuffle</h3>

<p>This last section might not be related, but the timing is interesting, so I feel it’s worth mentioning.</p>

<p>On February 23 - between the first installment of email metadata and the second - WA’s legislature attempted to pass <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6617&amp;Year=2017&amp;BillNumber=6617&amp;Year=2017">SB6617</a>, a bill which removes requirements for disclosure of many of their records – including email exchanges - from WA’s public records laws. What’s particularly interesting about this events of this bill is that it took less than 24 hours from the time it was read for the first time to the time that it passed at both the House and Senate and sent to the Governor’s office.</p>

<p>Seattle Times wrote a  <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/without-debate-state-senate-approves-open-records-bill-that-keeps-many-lawmakers-records-closed/">good article</a> about it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, after the WA governor’s office received over 6,300 phone calls, 100 letters, and over 12,500 emails, the governor ended up vetoing the bill. Neat.</p>

<p>It's hard to say if that caused any sort of delay, but after a month and a half of waiting:</p>

<pre><code>How are the installments looking? I saw that there was some recent legislative immunity&nbsp;kerfuffle&nbsp;around emails. Is that related to any delays?
</code></pre>

<p>And got this response:</p>

<pre><code>Good news.&nbsp; The recent Washington state legislative immunity&nbsp;kerfuffle&nbsp;will not impact your installments.&nbsp; We have fixed the bug that was impacting our progress and are now on our way.&nbsp;In fact, I'll have more records for you this week.
</code></pre>

<p>A month later, they started sending the rest.</p>

<h3>What’s Next?</h3>

<p>The work done throughout this post has led to a massive trove of information that ought to be enormously useful in understanding the dynamics of one the US's biggest cities. A big hope in making this sort of information available to the public is that it will help in changing the dynamic of understanding what sorts of information is accessible.</p>

<p>That said, this is just one city of many which have given me email metadata.  As more of it comes through, I’ll be able to map out more and more, but the difficulty in requesting those records continues to get in the way.</p>

<p>Once I get some of these bigger stories out of the way, I’ll start writing fewer stories and write more about public records requesting fundamentals – particularly for digital records.</p>

<p>Next post will be about my ongoing suit against the White House OMB for email metadata from January 2017. This past Wednesday was the first court date - where the defendent's counsel never showed up.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed!</p>

  </div><div><p>Since X, formerly Twitter, changed its terms of service, fewer companies are offering customer service via the platform. Scammers are taking advantage of that by posing as companies’ customer services and actively approaching customers who have questions, <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/beurs/artikel/5414660/twitter-oplichting-fake-accounts-webcare">RTL Nieuws</a> reports.</p>

<p>The name is one of many things that changed at Twitter since Elon Musk took over. Another change is that it is no longer always possible for companies to load questions asked via DM on the platform into their customer service systems. Many companies, therefore, no longer offer customer service on X.</p>

<p>KLM is one such company. “Due to the recent changes to Twitter’s terms and conditions, our customer service through this platform is currently unavailable,” the Dutch airline warns in a post pinned to its profile. </p>

<p>However, customers must click to KLM’s profile to see that warning - it doesn’t pop up when sending the airline a post. And scammers take advantage of that by actively approaching customers who ask the airline public questions on X. </p>

<p>“We apologize for the inconvenience,” a scammer responded to a KLM customer’s post, using an account with KLM in the handle and the company logo in their profile. “Please send your telephone number so that we can help you.” According to RTL, people who send their numbers are then approached on WhatsApp, where the scammers ask for private information and credit card details. </p>

<p>“It’s a known problem,” a KLM spokesperson told the broadcaster. The company reports all fake accounts it spots to X. “But a few days later, another fake account pops up.”</p>

<p>Other companies affected by this problem include several foreign banks, Turkish Airlines, British Airways, Ryanair, Hotels.com, and LastMinute.com. </p>

<p>There are several ways to check whether an X account approaching you is reliable, according to RTL’s tech editor, Harm Teunis. “First, check whether there is a checkmark next to the account name and what color that checkmark is.” Accounts with a blue checkmark used to be verified, but anyone who pays for a subscription now gets a blue checkmark. “Verified accounts have a golden checkmark.”</p>

<p>You can also check when an account was created, how many followers the account has, and check its username and handle. “You cannot change the handle if the name is already in use. @KLM is already taken by the real company, so scammers use @KLM210, for example.” Grammatical errors can also indicate that things are dodgy. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Danny Mekić, an Amsterdam-based PhD researcher, was studying a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/europe-break-encryption-leaked-document-csa-law/">proposed European law</a> meant to combat child sexual abuse when he came across a rather odd discovery. All of a sudden, he started seeing <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/EUHomeAffairs/status/1703693679230083398" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/EUHomeAffairs/status/1703693679230083398&quot;}" href="https://x.com/EUHomeAffairs/status/1703693679230083398" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ads on X</a>, formerly Twitter, that featured young girls and sinister-looking men against a dark background, set to an eerie soundtrack. The advertisements, which displayed stats from a survey about child sexual abuse and online privacy, were paid for by the European Commission.</p><p>Mekić thought the videos were unusual for a governmental organization and decided to delve deeper. The survey findings highlighted in the videos suggested that a majority of EU citizens would support the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/europe-csam-scanning-law-chat-encryption/">scanning of all their digital communications</a>. Following closer inspection, he discovered that these findings appeared biased and otherwise flawed. The survey results were gathered by misleading the participants, <a data-offer-url="https://da.nny.nl/202310/de-europese-commissies-misleidende-desinformatiecampagne-en-illegale-advertenties-horen-niet-thuis-in-onze-democratie" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://da.nny.nl/202310/de-europese-commissies-misleidende-desinformatiecampagne-en-illegale-advertenties-horen-niet-thuis-in-onze-democratie&quot;}" href="https://da.nny.nl/202310/de-europese-commissies-misleidende-desinformatiecampagne-en-illegale-advertenties-horen-niet-thuis-in-onze-democratie" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">he claims</a>, which in turn may have misled the recipients of the ads; the conclusion that EU citizens were fine with greater surveillance couldn’t be drawn from the survey, and the findings clashed with those of <a data-offer-url="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/umfrage-72-der-buergerinnen-gegen-eu-plaene-zur-automatisierten-nachrichten-und-chatkontrolle-mit-strafanzeigeautomatik/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.patrick-breyer.de/umfrage-72-der-buergerinnen-gegen-eu-plaene-zur-automatisierten-nachrichten-und-chatkontrolle-mit-strafanzeigeautomatik/&quot;}" href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/umfrage-72-der-buergerinnen-gegen-eu-plaene-zur-automatisierten-nachrichten-und-chatkontrolle-mit-strafanzeigeautomatik/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">independent</a> <a data-offer-url="https://stopscanningme.eu/en/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://stopscanningme.eu/en/&quot;}" href="https://stopscanningme.eu/en/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">polls</a>.</p><p>The micro-targeting ad campaign categorized recipients based on religious beliefs and political orientation criteria—all considered sensitive information under EU data protection laws—and also appeared to <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785251066343473?s=20" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785251066343473?s=20&quot;}" href="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712785251066343473?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">violate</a> X’s terms of service.

The Commission’s campaign was launched a day after the EU Council met without securing sufficient support for the proposed legislation Mekić had been studying, and the targeted counties were those that did not support the draft.</p><p>The legislation in question is a controversial <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A209%3AFIN">proposal</a> by the EU Commission known as Chat Control or CSA Regulation (CSAR) that would obligate digital platforms to detect and report any trace of child sexual abuse material on their systems and in their users’ private chats, covering platforms such as Signal, WhatsApp, and other messaging apps.

Johansson’s office did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.</p><p>“There’s an inexplicable obsession with this file [CSAR] in the Commission. I don’t know where that comes from,” EU lawmaker Sophie in ’t Veld told WIRED after she submitted a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2023-003037_EN.html">priority parliamentary question</a> on the case. “Why are they doing [the campaign] while the legislative process is still ongoing?”</p><p>As the pressure on the Commission has been mounting, Johansson <a href="https://commissioners.ec.europa.eu/news/setting-record-straight-2023-10-15_en">lashed out</a> against the influential civil rights nonprofit European Digital Rights, one of the strongest critics of the legislation and a defender of end-to-end encryption. She referred to its funding from Apple, suggesting EDRi was laundering the company’s talking points. “Apple was accused of moving encryption keys to China, which critics say could endanger customer data. Yet no one asks if these are strange bedfellows, no one assumes Apple is drafting EDRI’s speaking points,” she noted in a Commission blog on October 13.</p><p>Referring to EDRi’s independence and transparent funding processes, senior policy adviser Ella Jakubowska tells WIRED: “Attempts to delegitimize civil society suggest a worrying effort to silence critical voices, in line with broader trends of shrinking civic space. When both the content and the process regarding this law are so troubling, we need to ask how the European Commission allowed it to reach this point.”</p><p>Adding to the Commission’s conspicuous ad campaign, Mekić’s discovery came on the same day the European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_4953">formally sent X</a> a request for information under the Digital Services Act, the sweeping <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-eu-is-playing-by-elon-musks-rules/">EU digital disinformation law</a>, following indications of “spreading of illegal content and disinformation” on the platform.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“The Commission’s ability to enforce the DSA could be undermined if their own services are willing to flagrantly disregard these rules. Whilst the DSA is supposed to rein in the power of big tech, the CSA Regulation would force digital service providers to become a privatized police force in all our online chats, emails, and messages,” says Jakubowska. “It’s hard to see how these regimes can coexist or more broadly, how the EU can uphold fundamental human rights if it passes a law which could violate the essence of certain rights.”</p><p>The votes in the European Parliament and EU Council are still pending. “The Commission seems to forget its own role here: It is not a legislator. It only has the prerogative of proposing legislation,” says in ’t Veld. “It has no business interfering in the internal debate, neither in the Council nor in the European Parliament. The Commission is completely out of bounds here.”</p><p>Commenting on the negotiations, the outcome of which remains uncertain, EDRi’s Jakubowska observed that “it is reassuring to see that many lawmakers are alert to just how terrifying it would be for the EU to endorse a proposal that in essence amounts to distributed spyware on everyone’s devices.”</p><p>As far as the contested ad campaign is concerned, Wiewiorowski, the European data protection supervisor, initiated a pre-investigation <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/FantaAlexx/status/1713538934993498261?s=20" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/FantaAlexx/status/1713538934993498261?s=20&quot;}" href="https://x.com/FantaAlexx/status/1713538934993498261?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">requesting</a> from the Commission “information related to the described use of microtargeted ads,” with a response due by the end of last week. Wiewiorowski’s office declined WIRED’s request to comment on the potential for a formal investigation.</p><p>Ironically, Danny Mekić now believes he’s been <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712834547488846009?s=20" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712834547488846009?s=20&quot;}" href="https://x.com/DannyMekic/status/1712834547488846009?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shadowbanned</a> by X, alongside other <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/KuypersMarieke" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/KuypersMarieke&quot;}" href="https://twitter.com/KuypersMarieke" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">journalists</a>, <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/ArmandGirbes" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/ArmandGirbes&quot;}" href="https://twitter.com/ArmandGirbes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">scientists</a>, and <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/bert_hubert" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/bert_hubert&quot;}" href="https://twitter.com/bert_hubert" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">researchers</a> who have been critical of CSAR.

It’s expensive and unrealistic to prevent security vulnerabilities entirely, so we use server-side sandboxing (also known as <a href="https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">workload isolation</a>), which we cover in detail <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/server-side-sandboxing-an-introduction/">here</a>. We’ve already <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/server-side-sandboxing-virtual-machines/">explored VMs as a sandboxing primitive</a>, so we’ll turn our attention to containers and seccomp and unpack some ways we implement container-level security isolation at&nbsp;Figma.</p><p>We’ll evaluate container isolation as we did with VMs, mainly considering two security questions:</p><ul><li>Can a malicious job inside the container break out and affect the host&nbsp;system?</li><li>Even if it can’t, can it use the container’s permissions to access other systems or otherwise do&nbsp;harm?</li></ul><h2 id="the-container-to-host-attack-surface"><a href="#the-container-to-host-attack-surface">The container-to-host attack surface</a></h2><p>Three components—runtime implementation, the OS primitives and interface available to the runtime, and runtime configuration—generally make up the attack surface for a container escape. By default, containers are not automatically secure sandboxes because the level of isolation provided depends very much on these three factors. A kernel vulnerability, a bug in the runtime implementation, and/or a runtime misconfiguration might allow a malicious workload to modify files and execute code on&nbsp;its&nbsp;host.</p><div><p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Docker</strong></a> is a platform for running container applications.</p></div><p>For example, on Linux-based systems, <strong>Docker</strong> uses the “runC” runtime, which can make use of kernel features such as namespaces, cgroups, privilege dropping, seccomp, mandatory access control via <a href="https://github.blog/2023-07-05-introduction-to-selinux/#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20SELinux%20MAC%20assigns,context%20of%20a%20Unix%20file." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SELinux</a> or <a href="https://apparmor.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AppArmor</a>, to provide isolation properties. Docker’s runtime configuration manages how such features are used and&nbsp;configured.</p><p>Unlike commodity VM solutions, containers place a much greater responsibility on the user to correctly configure the desired level of isolation. More control over security configuration also means more room to make mistakes. (“With great power…” as they say.) While many container systems have more secure default configurations than before, which may work for some sandboxing use cases, the responsibility is on the user—you—to check and make the necessary changes.</p><h2 id="compromised-containers"><a href="#compromised-containers">Compromised containers</a></h2><p>As with VMs, placing a potentially compromised workload in a container is not necessarily sufficient for security. You need to strengthen the container configuration to prevent host takeover, and the overall container infrastructure architecture should limit the impact of a compromised container. For example, one approach could involve containers without mounted network devices, credentials, or access to other data. In this case, you’d place the containers into their own isolated network with an orchestration system to safely pass input into the container and to consume the output through a controlled channel.</p><h2 id="the-seccomp-security-model"><a href="#the-seccomp-security-model">The seccomp security model</a></h2><div><p><a href="https://nsjail.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>nsjail</strong></a> is a commandline tool that leverages Linux namespaces, capabilities, filesystem restrictions, cgroups, resource limits, and seccomp to achieve isolation. <a href="https://firejail.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>firejail</strong></a> is a Set owner User ID (SUID) that allows you to sandbox different processes.</p></div><p>As we shared in our <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/server-side-sandboxing-an-introduction/">introduction to server-side sandboxing</a>, the idea behind seccomp-only sandboxes is that many programs do pure computation, and thus do not need dynamic access to the filesystem or to make network calls at all. For these programs, we can rely <em>just</em> on seccomp to restrict the system calls that they need, ideally limiting the actions they can take to allocating memory, producing output, and exiting. Seccomp is a powerful isolation primitive used in many commonly used applications like Android, Chrome, and Firefox. In fact, seccomp can be combined with containerization to provide robust, multilayered sandbox-focused systems, such as <a href="https://nsjail.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>nsjail</strong></a> and <a href="https://firejail.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>firejail</strong></a>.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="A millipede tried to get through four walls stacked side by side, each with windows at different heights.

Thus, while the attack surface is far simpler to reason about than with hypervisors or containerization primitives, seccomp-only sandboxes come with significant constraints. It is your responsibility to determine whether your program can be safely isolated <em>just</em> with seccomp and which syscalls are safe, while still enabling your program to function correctly.</p><p>Often, you’ll need to rewrite your program to not require dangerous syscalls or apply other sandboxing primitives to provide a more robust defense. Identifying which system calls are safe and which are dangerous can get complicated. The original version of seccomp, for instance, allowed only exit, sigreturn, read and write calls, under the theory that truly “pure” compute needed only these to function and that this reduced kernel attack surface enough to be defensible. Unfortunately, many things that engineers consider to be pure compute require more system&nbsp;calls.</p><p>In particular, writing code without the ability to allocate heap memory is a pretty drastic change in many developers’ working models—and language runtimes, core libraries, or tracing helpers often want to know the current system time. These operations seem innocuous, but every incremental increase in allowed system calls results in extra kernel attack surface to consider. At Figma, we restrict programs to writing output to already-open file descriptors, exiting, allocating memory and fetching the current time—and thus avoiding complex or less well-covered areas of the system such as the filesystem, network and socket management, or the&nbsp;keychain.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="A crane is moving bricks from a cube over to a blue castle that's currently under construction." width="1632" height="699" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="1632" height="699" loading="lazy" alt="A crane is moving bricks from a cube over to a blue castle that's currently under construction." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/76be9f763b9ef66cba866cf131b2e44c235c87d2-2160x925.png?w=1632&amp;h=699&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/76be9f763b9ef66cba866cf131b2e44c235c87d2-2160x925.png?w=1632&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 816w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/76be9f763b9ef66cba866cf131b2e44c235c87d2-2160x925.png?w=1632&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 1224w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/76be9f763b9ef66cba866cf131b2e44c235c87d2-2160x925.png?w=1632&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 1632w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/76be9f763b9ef66cba866cf131b2e44c235c87d2-2160x925.png?w=1632&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 2160w"></p></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="engineering-considerations"><a href="#engineering-considerations">Engineering considerations</a></h2><p>In our <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/server-side-sandboxing-an-introduction/">introduction to server-side sandboxing</a>, we shared some questions for you and your team as you consider different sandboxing solutions and their trade-offs. Let’s evaluate containers and seccomp through that&nbsp;lens.</p><h4 id="environment"><a href="#environment">Environment</a></h4><p>Out of the box, containers tend to provide a more restricted environment compared to VMs. Some programs may not work at all or may require modification to function correctly; for example, if they have specialized hardware, operating system, or rendering requirements. A seccomp-based approach requires workloads to run in a Linux system with kernel support&nbsp;for&nbsp;it.</p><h4 id="security-and-performance"><a href="#security-and-performance">Security and performance</a></h4><p>While containers and seccomp present security and performance trade-offs, direct comparison is more complicated and nuanced than&nbsp;with&nbsp;VMs.</p><h5 id="containers"><a href="#containers">Containers</a></h5><div><p><strong>gVisor</strong> is an open source sandbox that’s compatible with&nbsp;Linux.</p></div><p>Overall, it’s not straightforward to compare the level of security isolation provided by VMs versus containerization. For example, you could argue that the attack surface of a hypervisor is usually smaller than for an OS kernel, or discuss the number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_COW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">kernel exploits</a> in <a href="https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/dirty-pipe-container-escape-poc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">recent years</a> that would have allowed a container escape. On the other hand, there are <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">bugs</a> that allow a VM breakout without attacking the hypervisor itself, and newer technologies like <strong><a href="https://gvisor.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">gVisor</a> </strong>can reduce the attack surface available to containers by interposing its own hardened kernel between the OS kernel and the container process. While VMs should overall provide very strong host-guest isolation with few configuration options, typically you’ll still need to bring your own orchestration and contend with higher performance overhead. By contrast, containerization can also provide quite strong host-guest isolation and can provide fine-grained controls to do so, but will require you to correctly configure everything.</p><p>Also, as with VMs, how fine-grained your security isolation needs to be will affect the performance hit of using containers. It will also impact how much container orchestration you need to build. Generally, setting up and tearing down VMs should result in a lower performance cost than VMs. For example, the startup time of nsjail is typically on the order of small fractions of a second, tens to low hundreds of milliseconds. There is, however, still a long tail of startup times, and initializing a language runtime within the container can take substantially longer.</p><h5 id="seccomp"><a href="#seccomp">Seccomp</a></h5><p>Similarly, it’s not straightforward to compare the level of security isolation provided by VMs and containerization vs seccomp only; seccomp heavily depends on the kernel’s syscall interface and the allowlist that you configure. For example, allowing the `ptrace` syscall is <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">not safe on older Linux kernel versions</a> as it can allow a sandbox escape. Overall, it is possible to achieve extremely strong isolation if only minimal syscalls are allowed. Because syscall filtering is cheap, seccomp-only sandboxes can have significantly less performance overhead than hypervisor or container-based solutions.</p><h4 id="development-costs-and-friction"><a href="#development-costs-and-friction">Development costs and&nbsp;friction</a></h4><p>Containers and seccomp come with a hefty set of development and tuning costs, especially compared to&nbsp;VMs.</p><h5 id="containers"><a href="#containers">Containers</a></h5><p>For adopting container-based sandboxes, there are two major challenges: configuration and orchestration.</p><p>Compared to VMs, correctly configuring your security boundaries for a container-based sandbox can require much more technical expertise and experimentation. There’s a long checklist of best practices to follow, such as dropping privileges, putting the process in a new Linux namespace, and restricting mount points, to name a few. It’s important to understand what each of these defenses do, and what guarantees they provide (and what they&nbsp;do&nbsp;not).</p><p>Safely sandboxing a complex program requires a deep understanding of how the program functions and how it interacts with system resources—like which filesystem locations they read from and write to, and which capabilities they need—and how to apply available container features to minimize the available attack surface. You may need to iterate by trial-and-error to arrive at a functional and suitably secure configuration, which can add up to a non-trivial amount&nbsp;of&nbsp;work.</p><p>Security configuration is only a part of the adoption cost of sandboxing. For both VMs and containers, you may need to build your own system to manage your worker pool, safely input your workload data, and securely extract the&nbsp;output.</p><h5 id="seccomp"><a href="#seccomp">Seccomp</a></h5><p>Compared to VMs and containers, which can often be used as a drop-in sandboxing solution, adopting a seccomp-only sandbox requires much more customization. The engineering cost largely depends on how suitable seccomp is for sandboxing your program. To create the seccomp allowlist, you need to either know all possible syscalls that the program can make, or more typically, empirically construct this list by running the program with a tool like `strace` on a representative corpus of inputs to exercise all possible codepaths.</p><p>Currently, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/822256/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">one notable constraint</a> of seccomp is that it can only filter syscall arguments at the top level and can’t dereference pointer arguments or do other more complicated argument processing. Consequently, seccomp can’t selectively filter some syscalls such as `openat` based on the resource being opened because it requires dereferencing a pointer argument. In turn, you may have to rewrite the program to be more amenable to seccomp so it makes all the risky syscalls before doing the dangerous work of processing user input. (We discuss an example of how we did this in RenderServer further below.) Of course, rewriting the program is only an option if you have the source code and may not be feasible for many commodity programs.</p><p>One other benefit of the seccomp-only approach is that you can typically invoke the sandboxed program directly without having to worry about additional orchestration or&nbsp;plumbing.</p><h4 id="maintenance-and-operational-overhead"><a href="#maintenance-and-operational-overhead">Maintenance and operational overhead</a></h4><p>Both containers and seccomp take operational resources, and engineers outside the security team may need to update the program or develop new features for it. While this is less of an issue for containers, seccomp allowlists can be brittle. New program behavior may require adding more syscalls to the allowlist if they don’t significantly increase attack surface or significant rewriting if the new syscalls do add unacceptable attack&nbsp;surface.</p><p>Also, monitoring and debugging seccomp-only sandboxes can be particularly tricky. Kernel logs will indicate when a process is killed by seccomp and which syscall caused the problem, without providing much more context. It can be laborious and frustrating to debug and reproduce the issue. There are a number of reasons why it might fail: an overlooked syscall in a seldom-used codepath; recently-introduced behavior that requires a new syscall; a system change—like an upgraded library or kernel; an architectural difference between test environments and production; even a very rare instance in which the program was maliciously exploited. Good continuous integration (CI) testing for seccomp can help catch some but not all problems like this&nbsp;early.</p><h2 id="container-based-sandboxing-at-figma"><a href="#container-based-sandboxing-at-figma">Container-based sandboxing at&nbsp;Figma</a></h2><p>At Figma, we now use<a href="https://github.com/google/nsjail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> nsjail</a> for use cases where container-level security isolation is appropriate. But arriving there has been a journey, and we’ve had to evaluate our own set of&nbsp;trade-offs.</p><h3 id="using-an-nsjail-sandbox"><a href="#using-an-nsjail-sandbox">Using an nsjail sandbox</a></h3><p>Our primary use case for nsjail is to isolate RenderServer, a server version of the Figma editor written in C++ that we use to provide features like thumbnailing. RenderServer has a complex set of features, leverages Graphics Processing Units (GPU) acceleration to perform rendering, and is used in multiple backend services. When we first thought about how to sandbox RenderServer, we briefly considered <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Docker</a>, but soon realized that it would add significant upfront development work and complexity. For example, we would need to create a new service that sandboxes the RenderServer binary inside a secure Docker configuration, create an orchestration system to manage the service, and re-architect various services to make a network call to the RenderServer service instead of invoking the binary directly. A separate service might be a reasonable long term investment but didn’t allow us the flexibility to explore different options based on evolving needs. Instead, we adopted nsjail as a drop-in solution so that we could focus our efforts on securely configuring it for&nbsp;our&nbsp;needs.</p><p>This configuration leverages all of the sandboxing capabilities that nsjail offers. For each user request, nsjail starts a new RenderServer process in a new user, pid, mount, and network namespace with no network access. Nsjail will also restrict the RenderServer process to only be able to access specific filesystem mount points, such as the input file, libraries, and output folder. And of course, nsjail uses seccomp-bpf to enforce a strict list of&nbsp;syscalls.</p><p>When we first rolled out the sandboxed version of RenderServer to production, good monitoring and feature flag control allowed for a smooth deployment. On initial deployment, we saw a low but still significant number of job errors and after investigation, we observed that many errors were correlated with input files that contained large images and resulted in output files that were exactly 1 MB in size. Very suspicious! It turned out that we had not read the nsjail documentation carefully enough and that by default, <code>rlimit_fsize</code> was set to 1 MB. One quick PR later, our sandboxed RenderServer was functioning normally.</p><p>Not surprisingly, we also had to update our seccomp allowlist several times during the rollout. We hit very rare codepaths in the complex RenderServer codebase—which serves user traffic at large scale—that we didn’t encounter during testing or internal&nbsp;use.</p><h3 id="using-seccomp-only"><a href="#using-seccomp-only">Using seccomp only</a></h3><p>Eventually, we explored a seccomp-only sandbox approach for certain RenderServer use cases that did not require GPU acceleration both to reduce performance overhead and the complexity of operating nsjail. The main challenge at the outset was that we could not sufficiently restrict RenderServer’s filesystem access with seccomp alone, due to file I/O being spread out in many places across various feature codepaths in RenderServer.</p><p>Here is a basic example to illustrate the problem: Suppose we want to use RenderServer to help users export their Figma file as an SVG. In this scenario, the risky step that must be sandboxed is the processing of the Figma file, which might contain malicious input planted by an attacker who wants to hack Figma. A combination of RenderServer and various third-party libraries written in memory-unsafe languages, mostly in C++, handle processing. RenderServer will first finish generating the preview image before writing it to an output file. In case RenderServer becomes compromised by the image processing step, we want to apply a seccomp filter before image processing to prevent the compromised RenderServer process from doing malicious things such as opening and reading other sensitive files on the system. However, if we do that—by configuring our seccomp filter to prevent syscalls like <code>openat</code>—RenderServer would stop working correctly because seccomp would also terminate it upon opening other files such as its designated output&nbsp;file.</p><p>We refactored RenderServer to reorder all file opens so that they occur before any image processing happens on potentially dangerous user input—which was a lot of work. Ultimately, the refactor allowed us to add a restrictive seccomp filter via libseccomp to prevent RenderServer from doing anything else other than read from and write to only resources that it’s allowed to access. This new version of RenderServer is far easier to test and debug, and it runs significantly faster than the previous iteration using nsjail. But, it also introduces constraints on engineers who wish to add new features or improvements to RenderServer. This locks RenderServer into being a single-threaded application, and means we can’t dynamically load fonts or images later in&nbsp;the&nbsp;runtime.</p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="93" height="13" fill="none"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="currentColor"></circle><path fill="currentColor" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0 93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Container-based and seccomp sandboxes can be lighter weight solutions for application security isolation but come with important trade-offs for development and maintenance overhead.

        <section>
            <p>With all the talk recently of <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/seeds-bounty/">how the NIST curve parameters were selected</a>, a reasonable observer could wonder why we all use the same curves instead of generating them along with keys, like we do for Diffie-Hellman parameters. (You might have memories of waiting around for <code>openssl dhparam</code> to run and then configuring the result in a web server for TLS.)</p>
<p>Thing is, user-generated parameters (such as custom elliptic curves) are not safe, and have no significant benefits. This is one of the lessons learned of modern cryptography engineering, and it contradicts conventional wisdom from the ‘90s.</p>
<p>Generating parameters is supposed to help with two things: first, it solves the question of how to pick parameters we can all agree on; second, there’s the idea that if we’re all using different parameters we are not putting all our eggs in the same basket and there isn’t a juicy precomputation target for attackers.</p>
<p>Picking trustworthy standard parameters is not prohibitively hard<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, and most importantly it is a job for the relatively few people whose job is specifying cryptography, instead of falling on the many many more who use it. <em>Given the opportunity to make some people do a lot of extra work to save a lot of people some work, we should always take it.</em></p>
<p>Not putting all our eggs in one basket is a consideration that might have made sense in a thankfully gone-by era of cryptography when primitives were somewhat regularly weakened and broken.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Back then it might have been reassuring that yeah, an attacker might be able to break <em>one</em> key, but maybe they won’t get to break them all, and hopefully the damage will be limited. Today, we consider it completely unacceptable for even a single key to fall to cryptanalysis (as opposed to implementation error or side channel analysis), and we design systems accordingly. For example, device manufacturers embed the same public key in all their devices, and every mailbox user is protected by the same certificate (and really by the same root certificate authority keys), and so on.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even more generally, it’s really not of any consolation to hear that not everyone’s key is broken if <em>your</em> key is broken. Especially when whose key gets broken depends only on who the attacker concentrates their resources on, rather than on random chance.</p>
<p>The last time I can remember when custom parameters helped in practice was in 2015, for the <a href="https://weakdh.org/?ref=words.filippo.io">Logjam attack</a>. The researchers pointed out that a nation-state attacker could do a large pre-computation to target some very popular 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman parameters. However, the better take away was that 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman ￼was just too weak to be used at all.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> Also, as we will see later, the custom parameters negotiation introduced complexity that led to the worst parts of the attack.</p>
<p>In modern times, if a scheme is so close to the brink of failure that you need to edge by saying that not all keys will fall at once, we just call that broken<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>. It could be a corollary of <a href="https://www.rambus.com/blogs/a-modern-interpretation-of-kerckhoff/?ref=words.filippo.io">Kerckhoff's Principle</a>, which says that a cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cryptosystem should be secure even if all the parameters, except the key, are shared across every user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so generating parameters doesn’t help much, but isn’t it better than nothing? No, custom parameters are much worse than nothing.</p>
<p>First, it’s usually a very slow process: <code>openssl dhparam 2048</code> takes more than 17 seconds on my M2 machine, and the docs of <code>dsa.GenerateParameters</code> say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This function can take many seconds, even on fast machines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means it can’t be done on the fly, but needs to be a separate operation handled and configured by the system administrator.</p>
<p>Second, and most importantly, verifying the validity of parameters is even harder than generating them. For example, picking a random prime is way easier than <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/749?ref=words.filippo.io">adversarially checking if a given number is prime</a>. This adds a tremendous amount of complexity to the security-critical, attacker-reachable hot path. <em>Any degree of freedom given to the attacker is an opportunity to build a better attack, any required runtime check is an opportunity for an implementation bug.</em></p>
<p>There are whole classes of attacks that are just impossible given fixed parameters, such as <a href="https://www.feistyduck.com/bulletproof-tls-newsletter/issue_61_vulnerability_in_windows_allows_certificate_forgery_with_elliptic_curves?ref=words.filippo.io">the 2020 Windows vulnerability</a> that allowed complete TLS MitM and X.509 spoofing by exploiting custom curves<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>. The beauty of that attack is that the parameters weren’t even invalid, but simply controlling the parameters allowed the attacker to fake signatures. On the lower end of the severity spectrum, there’s been a string of DoS vulnerabilities because uncaught parameter edge cases could break expectations of surrounding code and cause crashes or extremely slow operations.</p>
<p>This is ultimately a big part of what made <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/dsa/">DSA much less popular and safe</a> than RSA and ECDSA. ECDSA is not the best signature algorithm, by far, but at least it (usually!) doesn’t require generating and validating parameters.</p>
<p>Moreover, when doing negotiation in a protocol, it’s much simpler (and hence safer) to pick between curves A, B, or C or groups 1, 2, or 3 than it is to pick arbitrary parameters. For the former there’s the tried and proven method of having the client advertise support and the server pick. It’s not foolproof and can lead to downgrades without a transcript, but (unfortunately but sometimes unavoidably) most protocols already do many dimensions of parameter negotiation like that. For arbitrary parameters the client expresses some complex or incomplete preferences (if you are lucky), the server produces the parameters, and the client has to check they are valid and compliant with the preferences.</p>
<p>For example, the worst part of the Logjam Attack was a downgrade where a MitM convinced the server to pick and sign weak Diffie-Hellman parameters (by requesting “export” cipher suites, even if the client didn’t support them), and then broke them and retroactively fixed the transcript. Had the DH groups been fixed and standardized, the client would have just rejected the unsupported groups injected by the MitM, but instead here the client had to just say “huh, I guess the server really likes these weak parameters, at this point I either go along with it or break the connection”. This hints at an even deeper issue in how DH parameters are negotiated in TLS 1.0–1.2, which is part of why <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-deprecate-obsolete-kex/?ref=words.filippo.io">finite field DH is being deprecated in favor of elliptic curve DH</a><sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>: there is no way for the client to express any opinions on the group selection, it can only accept the server’s choice or disconnect, too late in the handshake to select an alternative key exchange. This is also a direct consequence of the lack of standardized groups: with standardized groups the client could have listed the ones it supports, and the server could have refrained from picking DH if there was no acceptable overlap, like ECDH curves always worked. None of these are really intrinsic flaws of the finite field Diffie-Hellman primitive: DH is somewhat less efficient than ECDH, but otherwise perfectly serviceable. The issue is that DH was traditionally specified with custom parameters (groups) while ECDH was almost always specified with standardized curves, so the former ended up much less safe than the latter.</p>
<p>Finally, always operating over the same parameters allows implementers to target and optimize code, using tools like <a href="https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto?ref=words.filippo.io">fiat-crypto</a> to generate arithmetic code specifically for operations modulo a fixed prime, instead of having to resort to generic big integer libraries, which are necessarily slower and often more complex and not constant time.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> Fixed fields let us optimize memory allocations, multiplication chains for inversions, low-level carry arithmetic, and so on. An optimized P-256 curve implementation will always be faster than a generic Weierstrass curve implementation, and often safer, too.</p>
<p>In conclusion, user generated parameters are a legacy design that proved to be much more trouble than it's worth, and modern cryptography is better off with fixed parameter sets.</p>

<p>Il Ponte Rotto, the Broken Bridge of Rome, seen from Tiber Island. This easily overlooked structure in the middle of the river, hidden by vegetation, is all that's left of what was two thousand years ago the longest and most important bridge over the Tiber. It was destroyed many times over, <a href="https://www.romatoday.it/eventi/cultura/il-ponte-rotto-dell-isola-tiberina-storia-e-leggende.html?ref=words.filippo.io">to the point that there's legends about it being cursed</a> (article in Italian, but well worth a read, Google Translate does a good job). It hosted at times an aqueduct, a chapel, and even a hanging garden. One of my favorite spots.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Some cryptographers have strong opinions on how to do this: hash a string, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing-up-my-sleeve_number?ref=words.filippo.io">nothing-up-my-sleeves numbers</a>, or “rigidly” define requirements and then pick the simplest/lowest value that satisfies them. I think they are all good enough to take away enough freedom from a would-be attacker, such that if the attacker can still select a weak set, they know so much more about the scheme that it might as well be wholly broken. I also find the arguments for why one method is particularly better than the other are weak and any arguments that a method (be it using the digits of Pi or design rigidity) is ironclad seem to ignore the fact that reasonable people will disagree on what is simple, or obvious, or better, or elegant (be it the requirements, or the choice of natural constant and how to encode/use it). It’s worth reflecting on how this is mostly a problem because <a href="https://ioc.exchange/@matthew_d_green/111227865578874178?ref=words.filippo.io">the NSA poisoned the trust they need to engage in the processes we do need them to engage in</a>. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The same era and considerations gave us cryptographic agility, another conventional wisdom from the ‘90s that does more harm than good today. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3"><p>It’s kinda fun to think about what the most precious individual cryptographic key might be. A WebPKI root authority? The Apple firmware signing key? Surely not the DNSSEC root keys. <a href="#fnref3">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Another way to think about it is that there are <a href="https://ct.cloudflare.com/?ref=words.filippo.io">in the order of single-digit billions of TLS certificates in the WebPKI</a>, about 2³². This means that if there was an attack that can break one set of parameters, and every certificate used different parameters, the attacker could attack the whole WebPKI by running that attack 2³² times. In that sense, using different parameters is “buying” us only 32 bits of security against full-system compromise (although again, full-system compromise is not the only metric). We generally don’t consider 32 bits a comfortable security margin. Even the Bitcoin network can only perform approximately 2⁹⁴ operations a year, 34 bits less than the conventional 128 bit security level, and that’s a distributed attack that draws a globally noticeable amount of electricity with an extremely simple unit of operation (a single hash). <a href="#fnref4">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Theoretical cryptographers have an even stricter definition, they call a scheme broken if an attack exists that takes less than brute force, regardless of whether it is practical. I call something broken if it can be attacked in less than ~2¹⁰⁰ <em>parallelizable</em> work with practical amounts of memory. <a href="#fnref5">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn6"><p>A related shift in wisdom, due to the same dynamic where primitives are not regularly weakened, is the waning relevance of <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/05/25/strengthmatching.html?ref=words.filippo.io">security levels</a>. A scheme is either secure (&gt; 128 bits of security) or not. It’s physically impossible to perform any operation 2¹²⁸ times on Earth, so that’s all you need to rule out brute force attacks. No one targets “higher” security levels if not for compliance or marketing reasons. (There’s an asterisk about multi-user settings and birthday attacks, but really those are special scenarios where you need keys bigger than 128 bits to target a 128 bit security level.) <a href="#fnref6">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn7"><p>In Go we don’t even parse custom curves in X.509 because oh god why would we, and yet <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/953bc8f391a63adf00bac2515dba62abe8a1e2c2?ref=words.filippo.io">we had to mitigate</a> this because it was possible to target the system verifier through a Go application. <a href="#fnref7">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn8"><p>TLS 1.3 implements finite-field Diffie-Hellman with standardized groups, but it’s basically unused, since if you’re implementing TLS 1.3 you’re certainly implementing ECDH, too, which is more efficient, so there’s no incentive to add FFDH, even if now it’s properly specified. <a href="#fnref8">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn9"><p>We still need operations modulo arbitrary primes for RSA, sadly. Thankfully we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to operate modulo odd primes only, which helps a bit. Speaking of RSA, there isn’t really a concept of parameters, but I long believed we should have all agreed to hardcode the <code>e</code> value, and avoided a few DoS attacks, as well as <a href="https://words.filippo.io/bleichenbacher-06-signature-forgery-in-python-rsa/">all BB’06 attacks</a>. Hardcoding <code>e</code> <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/pull/8142?ref=words.filippo.io">saved the signature verification code I wrote a decade ago for youtube-dl</a>, actually. <a href="#fnref9">↩︎</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Certain workflows in transaction reconciliation are <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/adding-ai-to-modern-treasury-reconciliation" tabindex="0">well-suited to AI</a>, while others are math problems well-suited to deterministic <a href="#c38d26b03013">engines.</a></p><p>Imagine we have 10 identical $1 payments that we need to reconcile. Typically, on a bank statement, we would see some of those batched together, and they would appear something like this:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Transactions</th></tr><tr><td>$3</td></tr><tr><td>$2</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>This totals $10, which is what we were expecting. Now, we need to match our business payments to these transactions.</p><p>Imagine our payments are tagged A through K (omitting “I” for readability). So, one possible solution to our reconciliation problem is this:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Transactions</th><th>Payment Tags</th></tr><tr><td>$3</td><td>ABC</td></tr><tr><td>$2</td><td>DE</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td><td>F</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td><td>G</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td><td>H</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td><td>J</td></tr><tr><td>$1</td><td>K</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The question is, <em>how many other possible solutions are there?</em> If we solve the batches individually, we are selecting from a list of 10 items to put three into our “solution,” which follows this formula:</p><div><figure><img alt="Formula for possible solutions" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/8nmbzj0x/production/e8f037f4591b8e1dc4910c8a809e92b515f9943c-816x325.svg" width="816" height="325" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"></figure></div><figcaption>Formula for possible solutions</figcaption><p>And equals:</p><div><figure><img alt="applied formula" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/8nmbzj0x/production/5111d0c94ecf753f221934ce43408f6426fb42a8-816x325.svg" width="816" height="325" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"></figure></div><figcaption>Applied formula for three of 10 $1 payments</figcaption><p>Once that’s solved, we do the same with the $2 batch.</p><div><figure><img alt="applied formula 2" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/8nmbzj0x/production/304e6a895e0c868fb832d00d1a373a13b2a55a15-816x325.svg" width="816" height="325" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"></figure></div><figcaption>Applied formula for two of 10 $1 payments</figcaption><p>And finally, we have to match the remaining five transactions. That’s an easier problem to manage, since it’s one-to-one matching, so the number of possibilities is:</p><div><figure><img alt="applied formula 3" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/8nmbzj0x/production/639d2549ff55d24d98454771fe09c40e9b08009a-816x325.svg" width="816" height="325" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"></figure></div><figcaption>Applied formula for the remaining $1 payments</figcaption><p>The total number of possibilities—if you’re trying to solve all of this at once, as we are—becomes:</p><div><figure><img alt="total possibilities" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/8nmbzj0x/production/be1d05eaca84424527d45e63c3652586437b1b10-816x325.svg" width="816" height="325" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"></figure></div><figcaption>Total number of possible matches</figcaption><p>That’s a lot of possible solutions. In Computer Science terms, this type of problem is a specific variant of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization/pack/knapsack" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Knapsack problem</a>, where each item has the same weight. In the example I’ve been describing, the knapsacks are the bank statement transactions, and the items are the equally weighted $1 payments. It’s a combinatorial optimization problem for a computer.</p><p>This is why, in most cash reconciliation or audit environments, teams give up on 1:1 transaction matching and opt instead to ensure the totals are equal—because crunching 302,400 options just isn’t worth it.</p><p>But that’s what computers are good at! Reconciliation engines, like the one we’ve built at Modern Treasury, have seen a lot of transactions, and every time they see another, it adds to their ability to match. These engines are entirely deterministic, picking up on IDs and data en masse, allowing them to reconcile transactions with 100% confidence and repeatability. The consequence of picking the wrong match in finance is too high to use a probabilistic approach.</p><p>But of course, there are edge cases.</p><p>So imagine instead of 10 transactions, your business is processing one thousand $1 transactions per day, and you run those using a recon engine like Modern Treasury. Let’s say 99% of those payments reconcile automatically with software. But those pesky ten would still remain, and  though 10 out of 1000 doesn’t seem like that many, based on the math we just learned, it’s actually a lot. It’s a hard problem to solve.</p><p>This is where AI shines. Instead of trying to brute-force compute the way to a correct answer, you take in a bunch of real-world observations to train a model. It’s substituting abstract, mathematical determinism for a probabilistic model that is tuned to what our system is encountering in the real world at scale.</p><p>When you operate in money, the matches have to be 100% accurate. Therefore, the responsible way to use AI is to build it into workflows that humans oversee. It’s the combination of deterministic methods and AI that is a superpower against reconciliation as a knapsack problem.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><span>As the COVID-19 pandemic was getting underway in early 2020, doctors in Wuhan, China, began to report that many patients hospitalized with the disease had cardiac injuries. Heart attacks were frequent, especially in patients with underlying risk factors, and there were numerous cases of myocarditis, which occurs when the heart’s muscle layers become inflamed. Roughly a quarter of patients with severe COVID-19 had elevated blood levels of troponin, a protein marker for cardiac damage.</span></p><p><span>This evidence altered how COVID-19 was viewed; previously considered primarily a form of pneumonia, it now took on a coronary dimension. “We began to understand that it’s also a cardiovascular disease,” says Peter Libby, the Mallinckrodt Professor of Medicine at HMS and a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.</span></p><p><span>H</span><span>ospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have since fallen off, the result of widespread vaccinations and the population’s growing immunity against severe disease. But SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is still with us, along with the risk it poses to heart health, especially in people with blocked arteries, hypertension, diabetes, and other predisposing factors. Millions of people who recover from COVID-19 have gone on to develop lingering cardiovascular symptoms, including abnormal heartbeats, dizziness, and </span><span>s</span><span>hortness of breath.</span> &nbsp;</p><p><span>The number of COVID-19 cases is once again spiking — and the coronavirus continues to evolve. The latest omicron variant, BA.2.86, has more than thirty mutations that could allow it to evade the immune system’s defenses. Given the ongoing threat, research into COVID-19’s cardiovascular effects “remains vitally important,” says Anne-Marie Anagnostopoulos, a cardiologist and an HMS instructor in medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. “We need a greater understanding of the associated pathophysiology to develop better treatments.”</span></p><h3><span><strong>Heart ills resulting from COVID</strong></span></h3><p><span>In most people — especially those who’ve been vaccinated — COVID-19 produces flu-like symptoms that typically resolve within a few days or weeks. But other people progress to a second, and more dangerous, phase of the disease, as pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines proliferate in the blood. During this so-called cytokine storm, the immune system becomes hyperactive, “causing a different set of problems,” says Dara Lee Lewis, MD ’92, an HMS instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women’s and director of noninvasive testing and co-director of the Women’s Cardiology Program at the Lown Cardiology Group in Boston. “Patients can develop weakened heart muscles, low oxygen levels, blood clots, fluid in the lungs — problems that may require hospitalization.”</span></p><blockquote><p><span>We need a greater understanding of the associated pathophysiology to develop better treatments.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>More importantly, pre-existing cardiac risk factors, such as coronary artery disease and obesity — which can predispose patients to metabolic inflammation — raise the likelihood for poor outcomes. People with vulnerable hearts, Lee Lewis explains, are more likely to succumb to COVID-19 complications than others who do not have these risk factors. In a worst-case scenario, patients could experience a type 1 myocardial infarction, which is a heart attack caused when a blood clot blocks flow in the arteries.</span></p><p><span>But COVID-19 patients are also unusually prone to a different type of heart attack called a type 2 myocardial infarction. In these cases, the problem isn’t a blockage in the arteries, but rather a mismatch between oxygen supply and oxygen demand. Fever and inflammation accelerate heart rate and increase metabolic demands on many organs, including the heart. If infected lungs are incapable of effectively exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide, then stressed hearts might suffer damage due to insufficient oxygen.</span></p><p><span>Lee Lewis says that early in the pandemic, myocarditis was also a major concern, especially for student athletes. “These kids didn’t need to just go back to work and life,” she says. “They needed to get back to competitive play.” Some students she cared for who had been sick with COVID-19 showed up with chest pain, racing hearts, shortness of breath, and evidence of myocarditis on magnetic resonance imaging.</span></p><figure role="group"><div>

<figcaption>Dara Lee Lewis</figcaption></figure><p><span>Studies from around the world were reporting that up to one-third of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 also showed evidence of asymptomatic myocarditis on imaging studies. This was troubling, since post-viral myocarditis is a known cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. “We worried that many of our student athletes would be unable to return to competitive play,” Lee Lewis says. Fortunately, the asymptomatic cases turned out to be uneventful, and the affected students made full recoveries. “Asymptomatic myocarditis wasn’t as big an issue as we initially feared it would be,” Lee Lewis adds. “So, we stopped doing MRIs on everyone who walked in the door.”</span></p><h3><span><strong>A push to understand SARS-CoV-2</strong></span></h3><p><span>That COVID-19 could be so closely associated with heart health wasn’t entirely unexpected. Scientists already knew that other types of infections, such as flu and bacterial sepsis, can amplify cardiac risk factors. It’s not uncommon for older people to have inactive plaques in coronary arteries. The plaques can be destabilized by a localized inflammatory response to remote infections. COVID-19 put a spotlight on these connections and led to greater awareness of the interplay between infections and cardiac disease.</span></p><p><span>But as an unknown virus, SARS-CoV-2 raised many new questions. One example — whether the virus infects myocytes, the cells responsible for heart contractions — “was initially a big issue,” Libby says.</span></p><p><span>Research has since shown that myocytes for the most part escape infection. Instead, SARS-CoV-2 damages the heart indirectly by unleashing inflammatory reactions that affect cardiovascular functioning. Upon invading the body, SARS-CoV-2 latches onto cells studded with receptors that are susceptible to the coronavirus spike protein. The spike protein is key to the virus’s infectivity. Once the spike protein is docked to cell-based receptors, it acts to allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter a cell.</span></p><p><span>Respiratory epithelial cells are considered to be key targets of infection, as are pericytes, which are cells that wrap around capillaries. When infected by the virus, these cells release cytokines that, in turn, act on other cell types that collectively form the interior lining of all blood vessels in the body. This lining, known as the vascular endothelium, “can be thought of as an organ in and of itself,” Lee Lewis says. “The endothelium has a huge job in preventing inappropriate blood clots and allowing blood vessels to constrict and dilate when they normally should.”</span></p><p><span>Normally, the endothelium keeps blood flowing in a liquid state. But when cytokines activate endothelial cells, the cells transition to a defensive posture: they mobilize macrophages and other immune cells and release molecules that promote blood clotting.</span></p><p><span>“Cytokines speak to cells throughout the body,” explains Jeremy Luban, a professor at UMass Chan Medical School who also serves on the executive committee of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, an HMS-led multi-institutional effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prepare for future pandemics. “And among the cells that may be listening are endothelial cells, which constantly have to monitor for coagulation and tissue damage states and induce actions like clotting to stop bleeding and other measures to prevent harm to tissues.”</span></p><p><span>But blood clots can be lethal. They can, for instance, obstruct arteries feeding the brain. During the pandemic’s early months, arterial blockages were implicated in strokes in numerous patients, even in young people without predisposing risk factors. Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 revealed clots throughout the body and evidence of multiple organ failure. Up to one-third of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were shown to have myocardial injuries that Libby attributes to microvascular clots and endothelial dysfunction, among other conditions.</span></p><h3><span><strong>POTS and viral infection</strong></span></h3><p><span>Microvascular damage has also been implicated in the long-term symptoms that now constitute a growing focus of COVID-19 research. “Even five months after the acute phase of the illness, we can detect these disturbances,” Libby says. He adds that answers to the mystery of what causes long COVID may be found in microvascular dysfunction.</span></p><p><span>Bruce Levy, the Parker B. Francis Professor of Medicine at HMS and a co-founder of Brigham and Women’s COVID Recovery Center, agrees. The fact that microvessels are present throughout the body, Levy says, might explain why long COVID has been associated with more than 200 symptoms affecting nearly every organ. Brain fog and the confusion and forgetfulness that attends it, for instance, might result from inflammation’s effects on blood vessels in the central nervous system, while long-term cardiovascular symptoms might arise from inflammation in the small vessels leading to and surrounding the heart.</span></p><p><span>A paper that appeared in August 2023 in </span><em><span>Nature Medicine </span></em><span>reported an extensive analysis of health care data collected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs during a two-year follow-up of veterans who survived the first thirty days of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and data from a control cohort that had not shown evidence of infection. The study looked at risk of death, hospitalization, and pulmonary and nonpulmonary sequelae. Its findings showed that cardiovascular problems sometimes linger even in people who were never hospitalized for COVID-19. Levy, however, points out that severe initial disease is still the best predictor of long-term symptoms.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>POTS is something that we need to be on the lookout for. Many people suffer with it for weeks or months before getting a diagnosis.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Among the more common lingering problems — affecting up to one-third of all patients with long COVID — is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which causes the heart to beat abnormally fast. POTS can be diagnosed if a patient’s standing heart rate test measures a sustained increase of at least 30 beats per minute that persists for ten minutes or more after a patient stands. In many patients with POTS, standing heart rates exceed 120 beats per minute. People who have the condition often feel dizzy, fatigue easily, have trouble exercising, and are prone to fainting.</span></p><p><span>“POTS is something that we as cardiologists, friends, and neighbors need to be on the lookout for,” Lee Lewis says. “Many people suffer with it for weeks or months before getting a diagnosis.” POTS affects up to three million people in the United States, most of them women between the ages of 15 and 50, and often begins after pregnancy, trauma, or a major surgery. A family history of POTS also boosts the risk. But, according to Lee Lewis, POTS cases associated with COVID-19 can affect men or women. At this time clinicians are unsure what the prognosis will be for these patients.</span></p><p><span>How does virally triggered POTS develop in the first place? Mounting evidence points to inflammatory effects on nerves that control blood flow and heart rate. Apart from acting directly on the endothelium, inflammation targets small nerve fibers that dictate when blood vessels should dilate or constrict. Impulses sent through the sympathetic nervous system, for instance, normally tell blood vessels to constrict and the heart rate to increase during standing in order to maintain adequate blood pressure to the brain. However, in people with POTS, the blood vessels may not constrict appropriately. Instead, the heart rate must rise even more than normal to compensate for the “lazy” blood vessels, says Lee Lewis. Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system kicks in when the body rests, instructing blood vessels to dilate and instructing the heart to beat more slowly so the blood pressure goes down.</span></p><p><span>When people stand, blood moves to the lower extremities. To counter this drop, the brain triggers the release of a burst of norepinephrine, which signals the sympathetic nervous system to cause vessels to constrict and the heart to beat faster, moving the blood back to the brain and torso. In someone with POTS, that normal response “gets thrown out of whack,” Lee Lewis says. The vessels don’t constrict and blood stays pooled in the legs, yet the heart rate speeds up and stays elevated.</span></p><p><span>Lee Lewis often works with Peter Novak, an associate professor of neurology at Brigham and Women’s and a specialist in long COVID. He describes POTS as one of many dysautonomias resulting from imbalances in the autonomic nervous system, which includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary physiological processes; not just heart rate and blood pressure, but also breathing, digestion, and sexual arousal. Novak estimates that 60 to 80 percent of patients with long COVID have symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, with POTS being the most common.</span></p><h3><span><strong>Treatments for long COVID</strong></span></h3><p><span>Levy describes long COVID as a post-pandemic pandemic. “Something like sixty-five million people worldwide have been affected,” he says, adding that long COVID profoundly affects people’s ability to work, go to school, or both. The COVID Recovery Center at Brigham and Women’s currently sees up to 150 patients each month and has a waiting list of four to six weeks. About 10 percent of the roughly four thousand patients seen so far were evaluated for cardiovascular problems.</span></p><p><span>But that’s probably an underestimate, Levy says, since patients with POTS and other cardiovascular symptoms are likely to be referred directly to cardiology and not the recovery center for initial evaluation and treatment.</span></p><p><span>According to Anagnostopoulos, therapeutic strategies for patients with long COVID and a POTS-like syndrome or exercise intolerance and tachycardia emphasize light exercise and structured endurance training. The goal is to ward off a “deconditioning spiral” that might cause the original problem to worsen. Similar to POTS, if patients remain sedentary for too long, Anagnostopoulos says, they could develop cardiac atrophy; decreased stroke volume, meaning that the heart doesn’t pump enough blood out of the left ventricle during contraction; or compensatory tachycardia, characterized by resting heart rates that exceed 100 beats per minute.</span></p><figure role="group"><div>

<figcaption>Anne-Marie Anagnostopoulos</figcaption></figure><p><span>“It’s important to acknowledge that these patients are suffering,” Anagnostopoulos says. “Many of them are young and unaccustomed to being sick or held back in any way from what they want to do. They often feel they haven’t been taken seriously. And what they want to know is that the doctor sitting with them is developing a plan for improvement.” Anagnostopoulos points to a 2022 report on long COVID in adults by the American College of Cardiology, which cautions against starting treatment for tachycardia or POTS with upright exercise such as power walking or jogging. According to the report, these activities might “worsen fatigue, resulting in post-exertional malaise.” The report’s authors recommend instead a preliminary strategy of recumbent and semi-recumbent exercises, such as stationary biking and rowing, with increasing intensity as a patient regains functional capacity.</span></p><p><span>Researchers are also making headway on how best to approach cardiovascular threats in acutely ill patients with COVID-19. Given a high prevalence of clotting disorders, it might be assumed that anticoagulants and antiplatelet treatments would improve outcomes. But some clinicians caution that bleeding risks from those drugs may outweigh their potential benefits. Advances are also being made in the use of anticytokines, such as glucocorticoids and monoclonal antibodies, to counter systemic inflammation.</span></p><p><span>Libby emphasizes that future trials investigating COVID-19’s cardiovascular effects need to be better coordinated. An initial rush to respond to the pandemic produced a flood of observational and non-randomized studies in this area, he says, which spread more confusion than illumination.</span></p><p><span>Although the pandemic seems to be receding, Luban cautions against complacency. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer and, after declining for years, deaths from heart attack and stroke rose again as SARS-CoV-2 spread worldwide. Fortunately, the virus has not yet evolved to a more virulent form, he says, adding that “it’s heartening that vaccine protection against hospitalization and severe disease seems to be hanging in there. But who knows what will happen? This virus has surprised us every step of the way.”</span></p><p><em><span>Charles Schmidt is a writer based in Maine.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Images: Dung Hong (collage); John Soares (Lee Lewis, Anagnostopoulos)</span></em><br>&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.stackfix.com/blog/the-ideation-flywheel">https://www.stackfix.com/blog/the-ideation-flywheel</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37999164">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developing good startup ideas is hard. Great ideas and downright horrible ideas are often initially indistinguishable and somewhat bad ideas often look so tantalising until you’re really in the weeds with them. </p><p>‍</p><p>The Ideation Flywheel is a mental model to help you think about which startup ideas are worth pursuing and, more importantly, how to improve your ideas by testing them without bias.</p><p>‍</p><h2>1. Focus on problems</h2><p>‍</p><p>The first step is forgetting about startup ideas entirely - thinking only in “idea space” is a surefire way to come up with solutions in need of problems or solutions for problems that don’t really exist.</p><p>‍</p><p>So, how do we surface problems? This is actually pretty hard. For a lot of us, life is mostly good. The trick therefore, is to become someone that starts to notice problems. I know this sounds like reductive advice, but it's a necessary precondition to finding problems worth solving.</p><p>‍</p><p>You can do this in various ways, including:</p><ul role="list"><li>Keeping a notebook or note in your phone to jot down when you notice something suboptimal.</li><li>Looking back into your professional and personal life - think about your current job, your previous jobs, internships etc - what sticks out as particularly painful?</li><li>Asking people you know - what are people <em>consistently</em> complaining about in the pub or around the dinner table?</li></ul><p>The core theme in all of the above tips is to remain continuously curious of the world, people, and their problems.</p><h2>‍<br>2. Stack rank problems</h2><p>‍</p><p>Now you have a list of possible problems you could work on. How do you decide which among them is the best use of your time and resources?</p><p>‍</p><p>You need some sort of rubric to grade them. You may want to rank the problems on the following characteristics:</p><ul role="list"><li>How painful is the problem?&nbsp;Is it a mild irritation, or does it cause intense pain? Quantify this if you can - how many hours (or how much money) do people spend hacking their way round the problem, or how much time or money could be unlocked if there was a solution to it?</li><li>How large is the market (in terms of $ spent per year on this problem) or how large <em>could</em> it be at some point in the next 7 years? This is particularly important if you wish to raise VC funding.</li><li>To what extent are you uniquely capable of solving this problem? Do you have an unfair advantage in solving this problem (access, knowledge, experience)?</li><li>How strong is your personal interest in this problem? Passion sustains you when things get hard. Pick problems you're passionate about.</li><li>How confident are you that there is a path to monopoly in this market?</li><li>What is the Miracle Count? How many big bets (miracles) do you think you'll need to pull off to have success solving this problem?</li><li>Has something fundamentally changed about the market landscape? E.g. new regulation.</li><li>Has there been a step change in some technology that could be used to solve this problem? Be careful not to slip into solutionising yet, you might be wrong about this technology's suitability.</li><li>Finally, upweight problems which are either (a) Frequent, painful and pervasive, or (b) Felt sharply by a small number rather than somewhat felt by a large number (on the margin).</li></ul><p>There is no "correct" way to grade problems for stack ranking. However, I would make sure that any problem you choose to work on scores highly on both:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>‍<strong>Market, or potential market, size</strong> - <a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html">great markets pull products</a> out of startups. </li><li>‍<strong>Your personal interest in the problem</strong> - failure doesn't happen when you run out of money, it happens when you give up. Make sure you have enough interest to keep motivated through the inevitable ups and downs.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h2>3. Crisply define the problem with <em>real</em> users</h2><p>‍</p><p>It’s very tempting, once you have decided on a problem, to jump in with all the possible solutions that come to mind. Hold that thought. First, you need to deeply understand the problem.</p><p>‍</p><p>The only way to do that is to speak with people that actually have the problem. However, to gain a useful understanding you need to conduct these conversations in the correct way.</p><p>‍</p><p>The single best resource to learn how to do this is called the <a href="https://www.momtestbook.com/">Mom Test</a> by Rob Fitzpatrick. I recommend you pick up a copy before you conduct a single interview, but I’ll give you the overview here:</p><ul role="list"><li>You shouldn't ask anyone whether your business is a good idea. It's a bad question and invites everyone to lie to you at least a little.</li><li>Talk about their life instead of your idea - the goal of the interview is to extract data about the problem, not to sell your eventual solution.</li><li>Ask about specifics in the past instead of hypotheticals or opinions about the future.</li><li>Understand the context around the problem - what was their path to encountering the problem? How does this problem interact with their life? What are their motivations for tackling the problem?</li><li>Talk less and listen more - if you’re talking about your idea (or anything else) they aren’t talking about their problems - remember you’re there to learn.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62f4c9faed6f6288d7d2eb8d/6536a5c2a226f063a40382ed_Ideation%20Flywheel.png" loading="lazy" alt="Stackfix Ideation Flywheel Diagram"></p></figure><h2>4. Explore the "Idea Maze"</h2><p>‍</p><p>The first step into the <a href="https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze/">Idea Maze</a> is really understanding the problem. Hopefully, through your interviews, you will have built this understanding. Continuing to walk through the Maze is the essence of foundership because, in some sense, you’re never really out of the Maze.</p><p>‍</p><p>But what do these early steps look like?</p><ul role="list"><li>Researching what possible solutions exist to the problem you now understand.</li><li>Understanding the constraints of potential customers - budget, time, knowledge etc.</li><li>Understanding how the Maze is changing over time - you want to navigate to where the ball is going to be.</li><li>Understanding what a minimal feature set looks like to solve the core burning problem - you don’t have the luxury of years of development and tonnes of cash (and even if you did, you shouldn’t spend it now).</li><li>Understand what a 10x improvement looks like - 10x is important - you are an unknown startup, it’s not enough to be just slightly better than the competition.</li><li>Understanding how you can be <em>different</em> and not merely better - you need to be able to stand out in a crowded market - it’s good to have heretical views and seek to occupy an opposing position to incumbents. Bonus points if you set yourself up to do something they <em>cannot</em> do (e.g. because it would destroy their margins).</li></ul><p>Your journey is going to be unique to you and your idea. However, I do want to share some generally applicable tips as you start out navigating the Idea Maze.</p><ul role="list"><li>Look for clues in history - it's highly unlikely you're the first person to try to solve this problem.</li><li>Don’t be afraid of others in the Maze with you - learn what you can and recognise any problem worth solving is going to have many people trying to solve it.</li><li>Some turns lead to dead ends - that’s fantastic news, it's simply an <a href="https://blog.camin.xyz/hypothesis-driven-startup">hypothesis</a> debunked and wasted time avoided.</li></ul><p>Now things can go 1 of 2 ways. </p><p>‍</p><p>The much more likely path is that, through your exploration, you conclude that this problem is not solvable (yet), not solvable for you, or perhaps not <strong>worth</strong> solving. This may be for a multitude of reasons. Maybe the timing is not right, maybe you are not the right person, maybe you have the skills but you realise you don’t have a burning passion to work on this problem for years on end, or maybe the market is smaller than anticipated. That’s all ok, it's actually to be expected. </p><p>‍</p><p>That’s why there is a stage 5 (or why this framework is a flywheel).</p><p>‍</p><h2>5. "Linear Ideation" (restarting the flywheel)</h2><p>‍</p><p>Take what you’ve learned from your exploration and feed that back into the next round of ideation - but crucially, <strong>do not</strong> throw away your research. Retaining and using the knowledge and experience you've acquired is the principle of <a href="https://medium.com/entrepreneur-first/how-to-pivot-properly-linear-ideation-5be605f37d04">linear ideation</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>As you explored the idea maze you will have found other clues which might lead to an even greater treasure. Maybe you found new but related problems to add to your list of problems or maybe you found new information which impacts the stack ranking of your problems.</p><p>‍</p><p>Above all, you will have contacts and experience in a problem domain through your research and your interviews which can be leveraged in the next round of ideation. Don’t start all over from scratch, preserve the value you’ve created in previous rounds of ideation to propel you to the next.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Good Luck </h2><p>‍</p><p>At Stackfix we believe that startups have the potential to change the world in meaningful and hugely positive ways. We hope this framework is helpful as you begin to think about the problems you're passionate about and which you're uniquely positioned to solve. </p><p>‍</p><p><em>Camin McCluskey is Co-Founder of Stackfix.

The data show encouraging signs of clinical activity and an increased persistence of cancer-specific CAR-T cells when combined with CARVac. At the ESMO Congress 2023 in Madrid, Prof. John Haanen, M.D., Ph.D., Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), Amsterdam, Netherlands presented the data in an oral late-breaking data session which confirms the positive interim data presented at this year’s American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, USA.</p>                            <p>“Our goal is to unlock the potential of CAR-T for solid tumors and to help improve the outcomes for a broad range of hard-to-treat tumors,” said <b>Prof. Özlem Türeci, M.D., Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer at BioNTech</b>. “BNT211 aims to address two of the key limitations of CAR-T cell approaches in solid tumors, namely the lack of suitable cancer-specific cell surface targets and the limited persistence of CAR-T cells. To address this challenge, we have designed a CLDN6-specific autologous CAR-T cell therapy that we combine with our mRNA-based vaccine CARVac.”</p>                            <p>The data update included 44 patients who received CLDN6 CAR-T cells at four dose levels alone or in combination with CARVac. Patients with germ cell tumors (n=16), ovarian cancer (n=17) and other solid tumor types (n=11) were treated. In course of the dose escalation, a dose-dependent increase in adverse events was observed, with cytokine release syndromes occurring in 23 of 44 safety evaluable patients. In most cases, these were of grade 1 and 2, with one patient with a grade 3 and one with a grade 4 event. Neurotoxicity was mild and self-limiting in two patients. Of the total 44 patients, 38 were efficacy evaluable. The overall response rate (“ORR”) for these 38 patients was 45% and the disease control rate (“DCR”) 74%. Further, 27 patients were treated with CLDN6 CAR-T cells at dose level 2 (1x10<sup>8</sup> CAR-T cells) with or without CARVac. At this dose level, 13 patients showed partial responses resulting in an ORR of 59% and a DCR of 95%. Additionally, in the same cohort, patients who received CARVac showed a prolonged persistence of CAR-T cells. </p>                            <p>These results further underline the potential of BioNTech’s BNT211 program. One objective of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial is to determine the recommended dose for the initiation of a potential pivotal Phase 2 trial in patients with germ cell tumors which is expected to be initiated in 2024. </p>                                         <p><b>About BNT211</b><br>To harness the power of cell therapies for solid cancers, BioNTech has combined their CAR-T and FixVac platform technologies to develop a tumor-specific CAR-T cell therapy which is enhanced by a <b><u>C</u></b>AR-T Cell <b><u>A</u></b>mplifying <b><u>R</u></b>NA <b><u>Vac</u></b>cine (CARVac) that is based on BioNTech’s mRNA-lipoplex technology and encodes for the CAR-T target antigen. The mRNA vaccine is designed to boost CAR-T persistence and functionality. BNT211 is a CAR-T cell therapy directed against the novel oncofetal antigen Claudin-6 (CLDN6), a target expressed on multiple solid tumors such as ovarian cancer, sarcoma, testicular cancer, endometrial cancer and gastric cancer. The program is currently being evaluated in a first-in-human Phase 1/2 trial as a monotherapy and in combination with a CLDN6-encoding CARVac in patients with CLDN6-positive relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors.</p>                                         <p><b>About BioNTech</b><br>Biopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) is a next generation immunotherapy company pioneering novel therapies for cancer and other serious diseases.

        <p><em>Translations: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/itelma/blog/550620/" target="_blank">Russian</a></em></p>
        <p>In <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/">Software Disenchantment</a> we’ve seen how software has degraded in the past two decades. Recently Jonathan Blow gave a talk where he explained why it might be happening:</p>
        <figure>
          <iframe width="635" height="358" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pW-SOdj4Kkk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </figure>
        <p>The talk is very, very good, but since I already know you won’t find time to watch it here’s my interpretation.</p>
        <p>The software crisis is systemic and generational. Say, the first generation works on thing X. After X is done and becomes popular, time passes and the next generation of programmers comes and works on Y, based on X. They do not need to know, exactly, how X is built, why it was built that way, or how to write an alternative X from scratch. They are not lesser people or lazier, they just have no real need to write X<sub>2</sub> since X already exists and allows them to solve more pressing tasks.</p>
        <p>The biggest a-ha moment of the talk was that if you are working on Y and Y is based on X, that does not imply automatically that you would know X also. Even if the people who build X are still around, knowledge does not spread automatically and, without actual necessity, it will go away with the people who originally possessed it.</p>
        <p>This is counter-intuitive: most people would think that if we’ve built, for example, a space ship or a complex airplane in the past, we could build it again at any time. But no, if we weren’t building a particular plane uninterruptedly, then after just 50 years it is already easier to develop a new one from scratch rather than trying to revive old processes and documentation. <em>Knowledge does not automatically transfer to the next generation.</em></p>
        <p>In programming, we are developing abstractions at an alarming rate. When enough of those are stacked, it becomes impossible to figure out or control what’s going on down the stack. This is where my contribution begins: I believe I have found some pretty vivid examples of how the ladder of abstractions has started to fall and nobody can do anything about it now because we all are used to work only at the very tip of it.</p>
        <p>Enter macOS Catalina. Every year Apple releases a new operating system and every year it needs a flagship feature to promote it. This year it was a long-overdue standalone Music app. Well, what could be simpler, right? List of files, categories, filters, smart lists. All that has been around in iTunes at least since 2001. But even if it wasn’t, how hard is it to build a decent music player? Many companies order of magnitude smaller than Apple have done it successfully in the past.</p>
        <p>And yet, it didn’t go smoothly. Guys at <a href="https://annoying.technology/" target="_blank">Annoying.Technology</a> have some great examples.</p>
        <p>Clicking one thing <a href="https://annoying.technology/posts/04769fafdac16826/" target="_blank">shows another</a>:</p>
        <figure>

          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>The Music.app header <a href="https://annoying.technology/posts/802dfae3517d4419/" target="_blank">is rendering wrong</a>:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/musicappcatalina.png?t=1697909369" width="311" height="149">        </figure>
        <p>The problem is not limited to just Music. In Podcasts, some items are highlighted on selection, while others <a href="https://annoying.technology/posts/da8e5b3f56d9f767/" target="_blank">are not</a>:</p>
        <figure>

            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/sidebarclickable.mp4?t=1697909370" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>As Philipp correctly mentioned,</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It’s not some odd, third-party utility that somehow looks a bit funky on an obscure version of macOS. It’s the flagship rewrite of the new Music.app shipping with Catalina.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I think this is a great example because all the possible explanations you might have for this if it was some other app, any other app, do not apply here.</p>
        <p>Lack of attention? Well, they CHOSE to make Music app. They CHOSE to make it a flagship product of Catalina. So there must’ve been thousands of eyes looking and checking. Didn’t help.</p>
        <p>Lack of resources? This is Apple, a company that could’ve hired anyone in the world. There are probably more people working on Music player than on the entire Spotify business. Didn’t help.</p>
        <p>They simply do not care? Well, again, Apple has been known for its attention to detail in the past and it has served them well. I doubt they intentionally completely changed company priorities just in this case. It’s only logical to assume they did care, but it didn’t help.</p>
        <p>This is just too far-fetching for a single bug? Well, the bugs are multiple and they contaminate all Catalina apps.</p>
        <p>A bug is too obscure? Well, What could be more evident than clicking on one thing and not have it selected?</p>
        <p>Lack of expertise? They’ve been building music players for 18 years now!</p>
        <p>Is the problem too complex? Is the scope too big? Actually, no. Music app is less powerful and more limiting than iTunes. That’s expected, of course, since iTunes had its time to develop, but still. This is a freaking music player. It’s not rocket science!</p>
        <p>Yes, these particular bugs are pretty minor and probably do not affect business in the short run, only Apple’s reputation. Still, <em>it is a big deal.</em> Imagine how tall, opaque and unstable that ladder of abstractions is that it’s even possible to fail such a simple thing as selecting an item in a list??? It is a freaking list and if you click it, it should select a thing that you just clicked. How hard of a task do you think that is? Why it has worked flawlessly since the first iPod with a monochrome screen and quarter of computing power of modern watch, but can’t be done in a flagship product of the most advanced operating system in the world?</p>
        <p>Because advanced means complex. So complex that no one could reasonably understand it or have control over it, even if they wanted. Apple DID want it. But even they couldn’t. Even with all the resources in the world.</p>
        <p>At this point, you might think I’m just picking on Apple or Catalina. God knows what went wrong there. Maybe they did change priorities and re-hired all the programmers. But no. This problem is universal.</p>
        <p>Amazon can’t <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/status/1206562961688596483" target="_blank">make a screen with two checkboxes</a>:</p>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls="" width="309" height="550">
            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/amazon@2x.mp4?t=1697909369" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>I mean, yeah, Amazon was never known for producing quality software. Yet, I insist, the task is SO trivial, it’s so impossible to fail that it only demonstrates how bad people understand or control their tool.</p>
        <p>Twitter newly rebuilt UI <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkxBzJ8lYAY" target="_blank">takes 7× longer to load first tweet</a>, giving you essentially the same stuff but much later and with much more effort:</p>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls="" width="686" height="562">
            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/twitter.mp4?t=1697909370" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>I don’t have numbers, but I’ve heard Gmail rewrite also made it much slower with no apparent new functions. It’s still pretty drastic if you put GMail next to Fastmail, or Twitter next to Tweetdeck, both of which didn’t get any full rewrites in the last decade, so you can see how fast even Web UI could be if we weren’t constantly climbing up the abstraction ladder.</p>
        <p>Docker and Electron are the most hyped new technologies of the last five years. Both are not about improving things, figuring out complexity or reducing it. Both are just compromised attempts to hide accumulated complexity from developers because it became impossible to deal with.</p>
        <p>And that’s sad.</p>
