<pre>I promised a post-mortem three weeks ago after I brought the Tarsnap service
back online.  It took me an unforgivably long time to get around to writing
this, but here it is.

At approximately 2023-07-02 13:07:58 UTC, the central Tarsnap server (hosted
in Amazon's EC2 us-east-1 region) went offline suffering a "failed system
status check".  As a virtual machine, this could mean many things, including
a power outage, a hardware failure on the physical server, or an outage in
EC2's network; all I can say is that since I haven't seen reports of any
widespread EC2 issues at the same time, it was most likely just an isolated
hardware fault.

Tarsnap's monitoring systems detected the failure at 2023-07-02 13:10 UTC (I
have monitoring writing/reading/deleting archives every 5 minutes from a
different EC2 region) and alerted me.  (The text message at 13:10 UTC didn't
wake me up, but the phone call at 13:15 UTC did.)  My initial investigation
didn't reveal any clearly transient errors so I assumed the system was dead
and started spinning up a replacement EC2 instance.

At approximately 2023-07-02 13:52 UTC (45 minutes after the initial outage)
Amazon restarted the failed server on a new EC2 instance; this brought up the
operating system (FreeBSD) but did not restart the Tarsnap server code since I
don't have the system configured to start that automatically -- if anything
causes the system to unexpectedly reboot, I want to check things over before
any tarsnap traffic gets handled, since "preventing data loss if something
breaks" is far more important than "maximize service availability".

The server logs after rebooting showed filesystem corruption; it's clear that
whatever took the system offline either killed the hardware or severed it from
the Elastic Block Store which holds its filesystems.  I decided to continue
with setting up a new server rather than attempting to recover the old one.

The Tarsnap service stores data in Amazon S3 as a log-structured filesystem
with each S3 object consisting of a header with metadata for all of the log
entries, followed by (optionally) data for the log entries.  For example, a
"start write transaction" log entry has a header identifying the machine and
transaction nonce but has no log data, while a "store data block" log entry
has a header identifying the machine and block name, along with the block
data.  Under normal conditions, the log entry metadata is also cached in EC2
and is never read from Amazon S3; the only reads from Amazon S3 are to read
block data in response to requests from the tarsnap client.

The process of recovering the EC2 instance state consists of two steps: First,
reading all of the metadata headers from S3; and second, "replaying" all of
those operations locally.  (These cannot be performed at the same time, since
the use of log-structured storage means that log entries are "rewritten" to
free up storage when data is deleted; log entries contain sequence numbers
to allow them to be replayed in the correct order, but they must be sorted
into the correct order after being retrieved before they can be replayed.)

The first step proceeded without incident, completing at 2023-07-03 01:49:49
UTC.  In hindsight it probably could have been faster: I had the recovery
process configured to make 250 simultaneous requests to Amazon S3 because that
is what Amazon S3 could sustain a decade ago, but I suspect that this could be
significantly increased now.

The second step failed almost immediately, with an error telling me that a
replayed log entry was recording data belonging to a machine which didn't
exist.  This provoked some head-scratching until I realized that this was
introduced by some code I wrote in 2014: Occasionally Tarsnap users need to
move a machine between accounts, and I handle this storing a new "machine
registration" log entry and deleting the previous one.  Unfortunately while
I had tests for this, I never tested regenerating the server state after a
machine is "re-owned" *while having data stored* -- and since the new machine
"registration" log entry has a higher sequence number, the server was quite
right in objecting that data was stored belonging to a machine which didn't
exist... yet.

Once I figured out what was going on, I disabled that "seatbelt" and resumed
the state reconstruction process.  It then failed again almost immediately
complaining that it couldn't find data in Amazon S3, because my attempt at
"resuming" the process involved skipping the downloading-data-from-S3 step
and thereby left a "maximum log entry sequence number" value uninitialized
(and therefore set to zero).  A short time later I had that fixed and the
state reconstruction process continued properly.

This process was also somewhat slower than it should have been; had I realized
that it was disk throughput bound I would have configured the relevant EBS
volume for higher throughput.  Unfortunately by this point I was quite sleep
deprived so I wasn't monitoring the process closely -- otherwise I would have
noticed this (in both gstat(8) and Amazon CloudWatch) and reconfigured the
EBS volume.

By about 2023-07-03 15:10 UTC (I didn't record the exact time) the state
reconstruction process had completed.  I ran some quick tests with the server
in read-only mode and compared against the old server state (to make sure that
things matched up aside from the old server's filesystem having lost the last
few seconds of data when the server failed), and then I brought it online.
The first live post-outage traffic was at 2023-07-03 15:25:58 UTC, roughly
26 hours and 16 minutes after the outage started.

Following my ill-defined "Tarsnap doesn't have an SLA but I'll give people
credits for outages when it seems fair" policy, on 2023-07-13 (after some dust
settled and I caught up on some sleep) I credited everyone's Tarsnap accounts
with 50% of a month's storage costs.

As always, feel free to email me if you have any questions.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
      <article role="main">
        <p>Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft but not on Windows or Edge. I also don’t have
a full understanding about Web Environment Integrity, but am basing this off
what I understand. This article states my opinions, as opposed to that of my
employer.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been under a rock, you may have heard about Google’s evil
<a href="https://stackdiary.com/web-environment-integrity/">Web Environment Integrity</a>
“proposal”. Supposedly, this is to make sure a browser environemnt can be
“trusted”, but it seems Google wants this so they can kill ad blockers.</p>
<p>This looks a lot like Microsoft’s ill-fated “Palladium” they wanted to ship
with Vista. Palladium was an attempt to improve Windows security by adding
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc723472.aspx">attestation and integrity</a>,
but could also be abused to enforce DRM everywhere on your PC, block competing
but “untrusted” applications such as Firefox. The only saving grace was Vista’s
very painful and long development period where
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/whatever-happened-to-microsofts-drm-plan/">Palladium was eventually killed</a>
so Vista could actually ship.</p>
<p>Palladium was renamed “Next-Generation Secure Computing Base” but it’s easier
to call it by the former name so I’ll just use that. Also, some features such
as BitLocker, UEFI Secure Boot (Windows 8), and TPM requirements (Windows 11)
did make their way, but they can be disabled or bypassed.</p>
<p>While I was only a young child during the development of Windows Vista, I am
pretty good at reading up on tech history.</p>
<p>Going back, Google takes
<a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md">“inspiration”</a>
from their infamous Play Integrity API (also known as
SafetyNet) used on Android, which is often used to block rooted phones from
using certain apps such as Netflix, Google Pay, and banking apps.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? People who root their devices and use custom ROMs like
LineageOS (myself included) nowadays hide root from bad apps and can pass these
checks anyways. I use Google Pay all the time on my OnePlus 11 running an
unofficial LineageOS build, thanks to root hiding. Does Google not realize how
commonly bypassed Play Integrity is? In fact, it is easy even on Google’s very
own Pixel devices, as someone who previously used multiple generations of Pixel
devices, including the Pixel 7.</p>
<p>Unless you can only use an official signed Google Chrome binary, what’s
stopping people from modifying Chromium and faking these checks? Unless that’s
the strategy.</p>
<p>Even on the web today, there are bad actors like Chase Bank who claims to
<a href="https://www.chase.com/digital/resources/privacy-security/security/system-requirements">“require” only Windows or Mac</a>
(like it’s still 2003)
and uses this as justification to block BSD and Linux-on-ARM without user agent
switchers. The only reason why this isn’t in the media is because Chase allows
Linux-on-x86 and Chrome OS, due to both having &gt;2-3% market share each. In fact,
I can log into Chase.com on my Fedora laptop fine without modifications.</p>
<p>If Chase was equipped with Web Environment Integrity, they could impose the
worst of the early 2000s web on their customers, maybe only making “exceptions”
for Chromebooks and common Linux distros to avoid the obvious uproar. Or worse,
Chase could mandate your PC has Secure Boot and no ad blocker in order to pay
your credit card or mortgage. And not just Chase, but any bank. It would be
even worse for certain fintechs which require their app for customer service
and bill payments: look at the X1 credit card.</p>
<p>In many ways, if we get Web Environment Integrity, we’ll need every government
to regulate Google, Apple, Microsoft, and adtech in every way possible, and
also add unbundling requirements so any browser can attest as long as it’s not
obvious malware.</p>
<p>After all, going back to the Windows 8 era, UEFI Secure Boot couldn’t lock out
Linux since we put pressure on Microsoft to sign Linux distros. There was also
an antitrust fear if desktop Linux went extinct, which helped. We could force
Google to bless small browsers like Vivaldi and Tor Browser the same way.</p>
<p>Better off Web Environment Integrity API becomes Palladium and dies in a
long-abandoned Chromium branch. After all, Windows Longhorn pre-reset, compete
with Palladium probably still exists in source, but is full of cobwebs rotting
away on some long-forgotten-about Azure DevOps server.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible to win this fight, we won the fight against Palladium, even
with a well-resourced Microsoft combined with the PC industry, if not the NSA
and MPAA. If we fight hard, we can win against Google’s anti-user Web Integrity
attempts also.</p>
<p>So, get the EFF and FSF involved: we need to be loud.</p>

<header>

<p><time datetime="2023-04-25">April 25, 2023</time></p>
</header>
<p>I've <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/future-proof-languages.html">spent</a> <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/future-proof-languages-2.html">some</a> <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/future-proof-languages-3.html">time</a> contemplating future-proof programming languages because I want to enusre that code I write will be usable in the future. Generally, if I want to build something and share it with others, I'm a pragmatist, so I'll <del>use JavaScript</del> choose a programming language that is popular, portable, and convenient.</p>
<p>But <em>other times</em>, I just want to have fun and experiment with other programming languages and tools. In that vein, I've been monitoring a few single-syllable, intriguing-but-maybe-not-future-proof programming languages such as <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> and <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>. Sometimes these experiments open my eyes to new ways of programming or new tools that eventually become indispensible.</p>
<h2 id="janet">Janet</h2>
<p>Very recently, I ran across a newly-published (free) book about the <a href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a> programming language called <a href="https://janet.guide/">Janet for Mortals</a> and it piqued my interest. Janet is a relatively small Lisp/Clojure-inspired scripting language that tries to fill a similar niche to Lua, but with an actual standard library (and, of course, Lisp-style metaprogramming and compile-time execution via macros).</p>
<p><strong>Janet for Mortals</strong> is an entertaining and informative read, and it gave me the nudge I needed to become interested in Lisps again. I had previously abandoned using Scheme because, frankly, I ran out of free time for exploratory programming. But while I was reading about Janet, I kept coming back to one question: why should I use Janet instead of an established Lisp, e.g. Scheme?</p>
<p>For me, the most attractive qualities of Janet (other than general Lispiness) are portability, embeddability, and <a href="https://janet-lang.org/docs/peg.html">Parsing Expression Grammars</a>. Realistically, however, I don't currently have any need to embed a language, so that leaves portability and parsing. As far as portability, <a href="http://www.call-cc.org/">CHICKEN Scheme</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/clisp/">CLISP</a>, and <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> looked acceptable. For parsing, <a href="https://bford.info/packrat/">Packrat</a> looked reasonable.</p>
<p>At this point, I started to run out of reasons to pursue Janet instead of an established Lisp.</p>
<h2 id="common-lisp">Common Lisp</h2>
<p>During my research, I ran across a <a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/">blog post describing Common Lisp's (mostly) unique REPL-driven workflow</a>. In that post, the author describes handling a runtime error by just fixing the broken code--in-place, without any restarts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a function, foo, that calls some other function, bar, that is not yet defined. Now call foo. What happens?</p>
<p>Obviously, the call to foo breaks, because bar is not defined. But what happens when it breaks?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The answer to that question is the differentiating point of repl-driven programming. In an old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk environment, the break in foo drops you into a breakloop.</p>
<p>A breakloop is a full-featured repl, complete with all of the tools of the main repl, but it exists inside the dynamic environment of the broken function. From the breakloop you can roam up and down the suspended call stack, examining all variables that are lexically visible from each stack frame. In fact, you can inspect all live data in the running program.</p>
<p>What's more, you can edit all live data in the program. If you think that a break was caused by a wrong value in some particular variable or field, you can interactively change it and resume the suspended function.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Moreover, because the entire language and development system are available, unrestricted, in the repl, you can define the missing function bar, resume foo, and get a sensible result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen various (often unreliable) "edit and continue" features over the years, but I didn't realize that Common Lisp was built with this sort of workflow in mind.</p>
<p>When I first learned to program, I used "printf debugging", where I'd temporarily add in code to log values, recompile, run, and inspect the output to troubleshoot problems. Eventually, I ran into scenarios where I couldn't modify the program or rerun it, so I learned to use a debugger. Using a real debugger is definitely the right thing to do, but setting up a debugging environment is often painful (and sometimes impossible).</p>
<p>Common Lisp seems to take debugging a step further. Sure, I've modified memory in a debugger to test out potential fixes, but being able to rewrite code and patch into a live process <em>in a sane way</em> sounds amazing--almost too good to be true.</p>
<p>That new workflow is my motivation for learning Common Lisp. I want to try interactively building a program to see if it's a pleasant way to work.</p>
<p>Is it a good idea to learn a new programming language and standard library just to explore a new workflow? Maybe not, but I'm not sure there's a great alternative. I'm sure similar REPL-editor integrations exist in other languages, but I also suspect that they're buggier because they've been bolted on, rather than supported from the beginning. Additionally, if I put in the work and am not satisfied with the workflow after all, I can rest assured that I gave it the best possible chance, using standard tools.</p>
<p>Regardless, it should be an interesting adventure!</p>

Hi,

I noticed that the remote for the Exway Flex has a missing resistor on the USB-C port. This makes it so that it will not charge with a type-C to C cable. Is this problem fixed with newer revisions of the remote?

I think you misunderstood my question. My remote does indeed have a USB-C port. However, it is missing the proper resistor that tells the connected type-C cable that it draws power. As a result the remote does not charge with a type-C-to-C cable.

My question was, whether or not this is fixed in newer revisions of the remote. 

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Eric, 

Thanks for getting back 

Then we suggest you change the cable to USB- C port, C-C cable is still not able to be compatible

Hi Exway,

Thank you for the confirmation. Is a fix planned in future revisions? Because the device violates USB-C specifications by not charging with C-to-C cables.

Thanks,

Hi Eric,

Thanks for getting back 

The remote just doesn't have the agreement, not able to change it, thanks for your support

Hi Leo,

Yes, I understand that a firmware update will not resolve this issue, as it is a hardware problem.

However, for future revisions of this remote, this problem should be fixed, as USB-C spec conformity is very important for all devices shipping with a type-C port. I hope that this is forwarded over to the engineers so that they can incorporate it in future remote revisions. In fact, devices that do not meet this spec can be determined as defective in some jurisdictions.

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Eric,

I have reported your request and I referred this to the tech team, but I  got a negative answer, sorry about that

</code></pre><p>So, as of right now, it seems Exway’s stance on this issue is that it is a known issue, but not something they’re willing to address, and something they have no future plans to fix.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-problem-again">What is the problem again?</h2><p>USB-C ports are different from other ports [citation needed]. Specifically, unlike USB-A ports that give out 5 volts of power by default, USB-C requires a negotiation process before it’ll start handing out power. You may have heard about this on branding material of USB-C chargers: USB-PD, or USB Power Delivery, is the spec that devices must adhere to.</p><p>But PD negotiation chips are expensive, when compared to the overall price of the device. The electric skateboard remote in question probably costs five dollars or so to make. (In reality, it’s probably much less than that, if you mass-manufacture it.) Having a chip that costs half a dollar takes up a ton of the budget in the BoM (bill-of-materials).</p><p>But obviously, the USB-IF board thought of that, and they provide guidance on how devices should behave (or in this case, identify themselves) if they just want 5V of power, no power delivery negotiation required.</p><p>This is done by pulling down the CC pins to ground with 5.1K resistors. (Because there are two CC pins –&nbsp;CC1 and CC2 - you need two of them.) Failure to do so means that with a type-C-to-C cable and charger won’t work with said device – the charger will check the CC lines over the type-C cable, find it “floating” (as in, not pulled down with a resistor), and not send over the required 5V. (And if your device shipped with one resistor, <a href="https://medium.com/@leung.benson/how-to-design-a-proper-usb-c-power-sink-hint-not-the-way-raspberry-pi-4-did-it-f470d7a5910">or shares a resistor for the two CC pins</a> (ugh Raspberry Pi Foundation!!!), then it can lead to all sorts of wonky behavior, like the device refusing to charge if the cable is plugged in one way and charging normally when the port is flipped.)</p><p>In this case, Exway didn’t put in the required two resistors on the CC pins of the remote, and as a result it won’t charge with USB-C-to-C cables.</p><h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2><p>I know what you’re thinking. “Just charge it with a USB-A to C cable! What’s the big deal here?”</p><p>Sure, you can charge the remote with this workaround. But let’s look at the bigger picture.</p><p>These resistors cost <del>pennies</del> <a href="https://github.com/ericswpark/ericswpark.github.io-comments/issues/3#issuecomment-1652743946">a fraction of a penny</a> (thanks @rickcox on GitHub!) to include. And the instructions on how to do that is a simple Google search away. In fact, if you’re a competent electrical engineer designing circuits, you know your first job is to read the specifications before implementing them on your device.</p><p>Which means one of the following is true:</p><ul><li>Exway hired incompetent engineers that do a poor job, or</li><li>The engineers warned that the port did not follow specifications, but Exway decided not to fix it to save money, or</li><li>The engineering team at Exway made a geniune mistake and forgot to include the resistors, or didn’t know about this particular specification (I mean, the USB-C spec is really long, and probably very complicated thanks to the USB-IF committee).</li></ul><p>But I don’t think the third one is likely. Nobody caught the problem while testing this product during development? Nobody used a type-C-to-C cable to charge the remote while using engineering samples? No, it is borderline impossible for Exway to not be aware of this problem, <em>unless</em> they don’t do any sort of testing, which again I find hard to believe. (And if they don’t test their products, that’s even more horrifying.)</p><p>And now we know they’re aware of it, but they don’t care. They don’t plan to fix the problem, even when they’re made aware of it.</p><p>If they’re willing to cut corners on stuff like <em>this</em>, do you really want to risk your life and ride a electric skateboard from them, equipped with their battery? Even if we give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they did everything possible in regards to safety, I don’t think they would be very receptive to a fix if the battery spontaneously combusted, especially given the response above.</p><h2 id="so-what-can-i-do">So what can I do?</h2><p><strong>If you have an Exway board that is affected by this problem</strong>, then contact Exway and let them know that this is unacceptable. The product is defective by design, and they need to fix it.</p><p>Also, consider discontinuing the use of their skateboards.</p><p><strong>If you were considering purchasing an electric skateboard</strong>, consider alternative brands.</p><p>But most importantly, it’s important to spread the word and let manufacturers know that <strong>not conforming to USB-C spec in 2023 is absolutely unacceptable.</strong> Countless forum posts have been made about this exact issue, and there’s even a subreddit called r/USBCHardware that has constant threads on defective products like these. Help people that might not understand why their device won’t charge with certain cables by not letting these companies get away with bad design.</p><h2 id="links">Links</h2><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Exway/comments/15a5myg/exway_doesnt_care_about_usbc_conformity/">Discussion on r/Exway</a></p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/15a5o3f/oc_exway_doesnt_care_about_usbc_conformity/?">Discussion on r/USBCHardware</a></p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36886859">Discussion on Hacker News</a></p><h3>Related Posts</h3><ul><li><a href="https://ericswpark.com/blog/2021/2021-01-11-msi-laptop-usb-c-charger-design-problem/">MSI laptop USB-C charger design problem</a></li></ul></div></main></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://dwdraju.medium.com/?source=post_page-----1b9a340ca43d--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="Raju Dawadi" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*r7hrULSjglXP2M63J8Txug.png" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy"></p></div></a></div><p id="5b1f">You had things running with occasional glitches and there was always an excuse “It works in my machine” as there is rarely identical machine &amp; OS for all. So, you need a solution to avoid same excuse when code breaks. Now, someone told about a blue chip solution called “Container” which will have all dependencies packaged, works on any machine, maintains parity on dev to production environment, no conflicts at all. So stay chill !!!</p><figure></figure><p id="73ee">And you started building container images, grabbed the concept of writing Dockerfile, port mapping, package installation commands, decrease image size, follow best practices and yay its real !!!</p><figure></figure><p id="7bd8">Gradually, other developers also started using container and after sometime, you started using docker in production. Cool story !!!</p><h2 id="23a2">But … After a month …</h2><p id="74b7">People start to spend an hour daily on fixing container issue. And the voice starts raising — “<strong>It works in my container</strong>”</p><figure></figure><h2 id="8233">So, what happened?</h2><p id="4e61">Was it too early to adopt container technologies(like docker hype)? Do you need a professional before diving? Is there any issue from application or flaw in container? No ….</p><p id="7cc7"><strong>Let’s dive into why the “It works in my container” situation arises</strong></p><h2 id="576b"><strong>1. Using <em>latest</em> image tag</strong></h2><p id="935c">Yes. It’s number one thing to always keep in mind. While starting to learn we use <em>latest</em> tag of every image. But it’s like to put axe on your own foot. Consider an example:</p><pre><span id="9d76">From node:latest</span></pre><p id="4904">At the time you started to use docker, the <em>latest</em> tag was for NodeJS version let’s say 10 but after a month when someone formatted her laptop or a new guy is on-boarded, the <em>latest</em> tag is now version 12. But your application is best suite for the previous version. All of the people are using same Dockerfile but this is the reason why you are forced to say loud “It works in my container”.</p><p id="cf56">So, always use versioned tag. Use <code>ubuntu:16.04</code> or <code>node:12-alpine</code> but never <code>ubuntu:latest</code> or <code>node:alpine</code></p><h2 id="e641">2. <strong>Container engine and other environment version</strong>:</h2><p id="e214">In case of Docker, it tries to make releases with backward compatibility in concern and feature removal is communicated three releases in advance. This could be a reason if the engine is not upgraded since long time.</p><p id="bb0f">If you use Docker Compose, the changes and versioning of yml files is very important. While versioning docker-compose file, its always a good practice to specify minor release. Like, not use <code>version: “3”</code> but <code>version: "3.7"</code> because by default the prior means <code>version: "3.0"</code> and there are many updates on each release of docker-compose which is supported by the upgraded version only. It’s a way to avoid ping. <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Here</a> is the compose versioning and compatibility matrix guide.</p><h2 id="fc34">3. <strong>Dealing with variables</strong>:</h2><p id="24ad">In general, we read variables &amp; secret for applications through config file like: <code>config.json</code> or <code>.env</code> . But with docker, there are are multiple ways, that is run time and build time environment variables. A simple way to pass environment variable is:</p><pre><span id="c1a2">docker run -it -e KEY=VALUE --name nginx nginx:1.15-alpine /bin/sh -c "env | grep KEY"</span></pre><p id="945d">And through docker compose:</p><pre><span id="e8e1">web:<br>  environment:<br>    - KEY=VALUE</span></pre><p id="c00a">Additionally, with compose we can pass variables of a file:</p><pre><span id="47bf">web:<br>  env_file:<br>    - web-variables.env</span></pre><p id="a8a1">Also, we can use variables of file to another key:</p><pre><span id="5fda">web:<br>  image: "nginx:${NGINX_VERSION}"</span></pre><p id="a46e">In this case, by default compose reads <code>.env</code> file and checks for the value of <code>NGINX_VERSION</code> and adds it.</p><p id="db0e">One major difference in reading directly from file and environment variables is - in case of file, the changes in file are reflected immediately if volume is shared but if we use docker environment variables, it requires docker restart. So, in case of compose:</p><p id="0962"><code>$ docker-compose restart web</code></p><p id="c24e">Then only, new variables are available for the environment reading through <code>PROCESS.ENV</code></p><p id="074d">Additionally, there’s another variable called <code>ARG</code> which is available only at build time so that the variable is not available during run time. But <code>ENV</code> is available both during build &amp; run time.</p><h2 id="aaca">4. <strong>Image build process</strong>:</h2><p id="9898">Official docker images are not always enough. We need some customization and additional packages which takes long time and resources if we do each step on everyone’s system. So, we take a base image and build our own image by customization. Here, manual addition and commit of packages should always be avoided:</p><pre><span id="f27b">$ docker run -it --name alpine alpine:3.8 /bin/sh</span><span id="e60b">/ # apk add busybox-extras</span><span id="cc93">[CTRL+p CTRL+q]</span><span id="82d4">$ docker commit alpine alpine-custom</span><span id="ad51">$ docker push alpine-custom</span></pre><p id="5897">Here, you lost the track of state. Also, the version of <code>busybox-extras</code> that you installed now may not be available later. So, always use Dockerfile with versioning of package:</p><pre><span id="e4b1">FROM alpine:3.8<br>RUN apk add busybox-extras-1.28.4-r3</span></pre><h2 id="89f4">5. Files and folders permission:</h2><p id="a915">Let’s dive with an example:</p><pre><span id="dbdf">#docker-compose.yml<br>version: "3"<br>services:<br>  myapp:<br>    image: node:11-alpine<br>    container_name: "myapp"<br>    volumes:<br>      - ./:/app<br>    entrypoint: /bin/sh<br>    command: -c "sleep 5 &amp;&amp; cd /app &amp;&amp; yarn &amp;&amp; yarn start"</span></pre><p id="7201">After running <code>docker-compose up -d</code> , let’s check files &amp; folders permission</p><figure><figcaption>files &amp; folder permission in shared docker volume</figcaption></figure><p id="7d95">Here, we can see <code>node_modules</code> and <code>yarn.lock</code> is owned by root user as these folder &amp; file were created inside of docker. Similarly, if there are any uploads that would be owned by root(Same issue will arise only on Linux machine but not on MacOS). This will cause problem when you have to edit or add file from host system and also git will detect changes. We cannot afford to change permission each time but bring the owner of every files &amp; folders to current user. Here is how we can do that:</p><pre><span id="746c">#Updated docker-compose.yml<br>version: "3"<br>services:<br>  myapp:<br>    image: node:11-alpine<br>    container_name: "myapp"<br>    volumes:<br>      - ./:/app<br>    entrypoint: /bin/sh<br>    command: -c "sleep 5 &amp;&amp; cd /app &amp;&amp; yarn &amp;&amp; yarn start"<br>    user: ${CURRENT_UID}</span></pre><p id="40c2">Export a variable with current user and group id</p><pre><span id="a172">export CURRENT_UID=$(id -u):$(id -g)</span></pre><p id="1467">And start container</p><pre><span id="4680">CURRENT_UID=$CURRENT_UID docker-compose up -d</span></pre><p id="bb7c">Now, we can see all the files and folders owned by current host user.</p><h2 id="9b82">6. Sharing between host and container volume:</h2><p id="3dc9">Though docker was introduced with the concept of — run once &amp; run everywhere — while using volumes, there’s difference in case of MacOS. It uses osxfs as shared file system solution on Docker Desktop for Mac edition. While mounting host path inside container, additional step is to be performed. Let’s take an example:</p><p id="c35e">docker-compose.yml</p><pre><span id="cc85">version: "3.2"<br>services:<br>  myapp:<br>    container_name: myapp<br>    image: node:11-alpine<br>    volumes:<br>      - ./:/app</span></pre><p id="976b">If you run <code>docker-compose up</code> , it will throw error:</p><pre><span id="4350">ERROR: for myapp  Cannot start service myapp: b'Mounts denied: \r\nThe path /private/tmp/docker/myapp\r\nis not shared from OS X and is not known to Docker.\r\nYou can configure shared paths from Docker -&gt; Preferences... -&gt; File Sharing.\r\nSee <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces</a> for more info.\r\n.'</span></pre><p id="5808">But with same case, it runs fine on Linux environment. For mac, the path has to be added from Docker preferences menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; File sharing.</p><figure><figcaption>Add bind mount on macOS</figcaption></figure><p id="2478">Also, if there is hard coded volume path, its common to create problem for other users.</p></div><div><p id="ad72">There are other issues which might arise like:</p><ul><li id="388e">Port conflict if you have any processes running on host machine and docker uses same port</li><li id="8413">Proxy or load balancer used for sending traffic to different containers based on virtual hosts urls. There might be upload limits, additional or modified header sent by proxy</li><li id="a1c1">Using dual packages: host installed and from inside docker commands which could have different versions.</li></ul><p id="d46a">If you have any issues faced while running applications on container which raised “It works in my container” talk, feel free to share on comment.</p><p id="5e25">Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwdraju/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dwdraju" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter</a> where I share interesting updates.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <div><p><span>Congress has </span><a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/D89FC49B-0714-4124-B8B1-4F35A85F5E02"><span>resurrected the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)</span></a><span>, a bill that would increase surveillance and restrict access to information in the name of protecting children online. KOSA was introduced in 2022 but failed to gain traction, and today its authors, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), have reintroduced it with slight modifications. Though some of these changes were made in response to </span><a href="https://cdt.org/insights/coalition-letter-on-privacy-and-free-expression-threats-in-kids-online-safety-act/"><span>over 100</span></a><span> civil society organizations and LGBTQ+ rights groups’ criticisms of the bill, its latest version is still troubling. Today’s version of KOSA would still require surveillance of anyone sixteen and under. It would put the tools of censorship in the hands of state attorneys general, and would greatly endanger the rights, and safety, of young people online. And KOSA’s burdens will affect adults, too, who will likely face hurdles to accessing legal content online as a result of the bill.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-kosa-will-censor-the-internet-but-won-t-help-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TAKE ACTION</a></p>
<p><a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-kosa-will-censor-the-internet-but-won-t-help-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TELL CONGRESS:&nbsp;OPPOSE THE KIDS ONLINE SAFETY ACT</a></p>
<h3><b>KOSA Still Requires Filtering and Blocking of Legal Speech</b></h3>
<p><span>Online child safety is a complex issue, but KOSA attempts to boil it down to a single solution. The bill holds platforms liable if their designs and services do not “prevent and mitigate” a list of societal ills: anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance use disorders, physical violence, online bullying and harassment, sexual exploitation and abuse, and suicidal behaviors. Additionally, platforms would be responsible for patterns of use that indicate or encourage addiction-like behaviors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Deciding what designs or services lead to these problems would primarily be left up to the Federal Trade Commission and 50 individual state attorneys general to decide. Ultimately, this puts platforms that serve young people in an impossible situation: without clear guidance regarding what sort of design or content might lead to these harms, they would likely censor </span><i><span>any </span></i><span>discussions that could make them liable. To be clear: though the bill’s language is about “designs and services,” the designs of a platform are not causing eating disorders. As a result, KOSA would make platforms liable for the content they show minors, full stop. It will be based on vague requirements that any Attorney General could, more or less, make up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Attorneys General Would Decide What Content is Dangerous To Young People</b></h3>
<p><span>KOSA’s co-author, Sen. Blackburn of Tennessee, has referred to education about race discrimination as “</span><a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/7/why-is-critical-race-theory-dangerous-for-our-kids"><span>dangerous for kids</span></a><span>.” Many states have agreed, and recently moved to limit public education about the history of </span><a href="https://news.trust.org/item/20211001103420-4bdez"><span>race</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/594980-florida-isnt-the-only-state-with-a-dont-say-gay-bill-15"><span>gender, and sexuality</span></a><span> discrimination. If KOSA passes, platforms are likely to preemptively block conversations that discuss these topics, as well as discussions about substance use, suicide, and eating disorders. As we’ve written in </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/kids-online-safety-act-heavy-handed-plan-force-platforms-spy-young-people"><span>our previous commentary on the bill</span></a><span>, KOSA could result in loss of access to information that a majority of people would agree is not dangerous. Again, issues like substance abuse, eating disorders, and depression are complex societal issues, and there is not clear agreement on their causes or their solutions. To pick </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/07/645609248/whats-the-evidence-that-supervised-drug-injection-sites-save-lives"><span>just one example</span></a><span>: in some communities, safe injection sites are seen as part of a solution to substance abuse; in others, they are seen as part of the problem. Under KOSA, could a platform be sued for displaying content about them—or about needle exchanges, naloxone, or other harm reduction techniques?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The latest version of KOSA tries, but ultimately fails, to address this problem in two ways: first, by clarifying that the bill shouldn’t stop a platform or its users from “providing resources for the prevention or mitigation” of its listed harms; and second, by adding that claims under the law should be consistent with evidence-informed medical information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, were an Attorney General to claim that content about trans healthcare (for example) poses risks to minors’ health, they would have no shortage of ‘evidence-informed' medical information on which to base their assertion. Numerous states have laws on the books claiming that gender-affirming care for trans youth is child abuse. In an article for the </span><i><span>American Conservative</span></i><span> titled “</span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/how-big-tech-turns-kids-trans"><span>How Big Tech Turns Kids Trans</span></a><span>,” the authors point to numerous studies that indicate gender-affirming care is dangerous, despite leading medical groups </span><a href="https://transhealthproject.org/resources/medical-organization-statements/"><span>recognizing the medical necessity</span></a><span> of treatments for gender dysphoria. In the same article, the authors laud KOSA, which would prohibit “content that poses risks to minors’ physical and mental health.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The same issue exists on both sides of the political spectrum. KOSA is ambiguous enough that an Attorney General who wanted to censor content regarding gun ownership, or Christianity, could argue that it has harmful effects on young people.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b>KOSA Would Still Lead to Age Verification On Platforms</b></h3>
<p><span>Another change to KOSA comes in response to concerns that the law would lead to age verification requirements for platforms. For a platform to know whether or not it is liable for its impact on minors, it must, of course, know whether or not minors use its platform, and who they are. Age verification mandates </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/age-verification-mandates-would-undermine-anonymity-online"><span>create many issues</span></a><span> — in particular, they undermine anonymity by requiring all users to upload identity verification documentation and share private data, no matter their age. Other types of “age assurance” tools such as age estimation also require users to upload biometric information such as their photos, and have accuracy issues. Ultimately, no method is sufficiently reliable, offers complete coverage of the population, and has respect for the protection of individuals' data and privacy and their security.&nbsp; France’s National Commission on Informatics and Liberty, CNIL, reached this conclusion in a recent analysis of current age verification methods.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In response to these concerns, KOSA’s authors have made two small changes, but they’re unlikely to stop platforms from implementing age verification. Earlier versions would have held platforms liable if they “knew or should have known” that an impacted user was sixteen years of age or younger. The latest version of KOSA adds “reasonableness” to this requirement, holding platforms liable if they “know or </span><i><span>reasonably</span></i><span> should know” a user is a minor. But legally speaking, this doesn't result in giving platforms any better guidance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The second change is to add explicit language that age verification is not required under the “Privacy Protections” section of the bill. The bill now states that a covered platform is not required to implement an age gating </span><i><span>or</span></i><span> age verification functionality.&nbsp;</span><span>But there is essentially no outcome where sites don’t implement age verification. There’s no way for platforms to block nebulous categories of content for minors without explicitly requiring age verification.&nbsp;</span><span>If a 16-year-old user truthfully identifies herself, the law will hold platforms liable, unless they filter and block content. If a 16-year-old user identifies herself as an adult, and the platform does not use age verification, then it will still be held liable, because it should have “reasonably known” the user’s age.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A platform could, alternatively, skip age verification and simply institute blocking and filtering of certain types of content for all users regardless of age—which would be a terrible blow for speech online for everyone. So despite these bandaids on the bill, it still leaves platforms with no choices except to institute heavy-handed censorship and age verification requirements. These impacts would affect not just young people, but every user of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>There Are Better Ways to Fix The Internet</b></h3>
<p><span>While we appreciate that lawmakers have responded to concerns raised about the bill, its main requirements—that platforms must “prevent and mitigate” complex issues that </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/04/25/1171773181/social-media-teens-mental-health"><span>researchers don’t even agree the platforms are responsible for</span></a><span> in the first place—will lead to a more siloed, and more censored, internet. We also stand by our </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/kids-online-safety-act-heavy-handed-plan-force-platforms-spy-young-people"><span>previous criticisms of KOSA</span></a><span>—that it unreasonably buckets all young people into a single category, and that it requires surveillance of minors by parents. They&nbsp; remain troubling aspects of the law.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no question that some elements of social media today are toxic to users. Companies want users to spend as much time on their platforms as possible, because they make money from targeted ad sales, and these ad sales are fueled by invasive data collection. EFF has long supported&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/party-its-1979-og-antitrust-back-baby"><span>stronger competition laws</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/effs-recommendations-consumer-data-privacy-laws"><span>comprehensive data privacy legislation</span></a><span> in part because they can open the field to competitors to today’s social media options, and force platforms to innovate, offering more user choice. If users are unhappy with the content or design of current platforms, they should be able to move to other options that offer different forms of content moderation, better privacy protections, and other features that improve the experience for everyone, including young people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>KOSA would not enhance the ability of users to choose where they spend their time. Instead, it would shrink the number of options, by making strict requirements that only today’s largest, most profitable platforms could follow. It would solidify today’s Big Tech giants, while forcing them to collect more private data on all users. It would force them to spy on young people, and it would hand government the power to limit what topics they can see and discuss online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is not a safety bill—it is a surveillance and censorship bill. Please tell your Senators and representatives not to pass it.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<div>
		<p>This post is an update to the proposal for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/12/lets-make-wordpress-officially-support-sqlite/">officially support SQLite in WordPress</a>. The initial implementation was included in the <a href="https://w.org/plugins/performance-lab">Performance Lab</a> <span tabindex="0">plugin<span> <span>A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party</span></span></span> and then released as a <a href="https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/">stand-alone plugin</a>.</p>



<p>That initial implementation was based on <a href="https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-sqlite-db">wp-sqlite-db</a> by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aaemnnosttv/">@aaemnnosttv</a>, which in turn, was a fork of an <a href="https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-integration/">older plugin</a>. </p>



<p>Over the course of the last 6 month, issues with that implementation surfaced and the project experienced some limitations. As a result, we (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/zieladam/">@zieladam</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aristath/">@aristath</a>) decided to rewrite it using a more future-proof concept.</p>



<p>The code has been completely rewritten to use an SQL Lexer and is now stable and able to handle all WordPress queries properly. The SQL Lexer is part of the <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/sql-parser">PHPMyAdmin/SQL-Parser</a> project (licensed under the <span tabindex="0">GPL<span> <span>GNU General Public License. Also see <a href="#copyright-license">copyright license</a>.</span></span></span> 2.0) and it was adapted for WordPress, effectively implementing a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/sqlite-database-integration/pull/9">MySQL to SQLite translation engine</a>. This provides improved security, as well as compatibility.</p>



<p>The update has already been released in the standalone plugin and will soon be ported to the Performance Lab plugin. Most WordPress Unit Tests now pass, with the exception of a few that require patching WordPress <span tabindex="0">Core<span> <span>Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress.</span></span></span>.</p>



<p>The next step would be to implement these changes to WordPress core instead of using a plugin. To that end, we have a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220">draft Pull Request</a> and an accompanying <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57793">Trac ticket</a>.</p>



<h2>Why should this be in Core and not as a plugin?</h2>



<p>In its current form, the SQLite implementation is a plugin. Just like all plugins, it can only be installed on a pre-existing website. As a result, a site can only use an SQLite database if it already has a <span tabindex="0">MySQL<span> <span>MySQL is a relational database management system. A database is a structured collection of data where content, configuration and other options are stored. <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">https://www.mysql.com/</a>.</span></span></span> database – effectively negating all the benefits that SQLite can bring to WordPress.</p>



<p>Using the&nbsp;<em>featured</em>&nbsp;plugin is a great way to allow users to test the implementation and iron out any issues etc. However, long-term, it doesn’t make sense to use it as a plugin.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What are the next necessary decisions?</h2>



<p>There needs to be a decision, if the WordPress project wants to provide an option to users during WordPress installation, so they can choose whether they want to use a MySQL or an SQLite database. If no option is available in the <span tabindex="0">UI<span> <span>User interface</span></span></span>, then users would have to manually add <code>define( 'DB_ENGINE', 'sqlite' );</code> in their <code>wp-config.php</code> file.</p>



<p>Adding an option to select the database type may initially raise some eyebrows thinking that the famous 5-minute installation process will become more complicated, but in fact, it’s the exact opposite: If users pick SQLite as their database, they don’t need to create a MySQL db or enter their credentials in the installation screen, as no separate server is required.</p>



<p>A prototype of the UI changes are already available via the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220">pull request in WordPress Core</a>, to showcase how easy it would be to install WP using SQLite instead of MySQL. </p>



<p>The proof-of-concept UI in that implementation checks if the server supports SQLite and MySQL: </p>



<ul><li>If SQLite is supported but not MySQL, then it defaults to SQLite and no UI option is shown to users. This is for example what happens in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://playground.wordpress.net/" target="_blank">WordPress Playground</a>&nbsp;– it is vanilla WordPress that defaults to&nbsp;SQLite.</li>



<li>Similarly, if the server supports MySQL and not SQLite, then the installation will use MySQL and no option will be shown to users.</li>



<li>The UI option will only show if both SQLite and MySQL are supported by the server.</li>
</ul><h2>How can this implementation be tested? </h2>



<p>The next step would be to thoroughly test the implementation with all the plugins you normally use. You can use the <a href="https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/">SQLite Database Integration plugin</a> to test an SQLite database on your existing website, or better yet – you can test the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220">pull request in WordPress Core</a>.</p>



<p>If you test the plugin, keep in mind that it does not copy your current data from MySQL to SQLite, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/12/20/help-us-test-the-sqlite-implementation/#faq">as mentioned in the call-for-testing post</a>.</p>

I cannot bear the silence and isolation.</span></em></p><p><em><strong>Death:</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Emptiness is a mirror turned to your own face.&nbsp;</em></p><p>— Ingmar Bergman’s workbook, April 5, 1955</p></blockquote><p>In the early 2010s, a popular idea was to provide coworking spaces and shared living to people who were building startups. That way the founders would have a thriving social scene of peers to percolate ideas with as they figured out how to build and scale a venture. This was attempted thousands of times by different startup incubators. There are no famous success stories.</p><p>In 2015, Sam Altman, who was at the time the president of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that has helped scale startups collectively worth $600 billion, tweeted in reaction that “not [providing coworking spaces] is part of what makes YC work.” Later, in a 2019 interview with Tyler Cowen, Altman was asked to explain why.</p><blockquote><p><span>SAM ALTMAN: Good ideas — actually, no,&nbsp;</span><em>great&nbsp;</em><span>ideas are fragile. Great ideas are easy to kill. An idea in its larval stage — all the best ideas when I first heard them sound bad. And all of us, myself included, are much more affected by what other people think of us and our ideas than we like to admit.</span></p><p>If you are just four people in your own door, and you have an idea that sounds bad but is great, you can keep that self-delusion going. If you’re in a coworking space, people laugh at you, and no one wants to be the kid picked last at recess. So you change your idea to something that sounds plausible but is never going to matter. It’s true that coworking spaces do kill off the very worst ideas, but a band-pass filter for startups is a terrible thing because they kill off the best ideas, too.</p></blockquote><p>This is an insight that has been repeated by artists, too. Pablo Picasso: “Without great solitude, no serious work is possible.” James Baldwin: “Perhaps the primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid: the state of being alone.” Bob Dylan: “To be creative you’ve got to be unsociable and tight-assed.”</p><p>When expressed in aphorisms like this, you almost get the impression that creativity simply requires that you sit down in a room of your own. In practice, however, what they are referring to as solitude is rather something like “a state of mind.” They are putting themselves in a state where the opinions of others do not bother them and where they reach a heightened sensitivity for the larval ideas and vague questions that arise within them.&nbsp;</p><p><span>To get a more visceral and nuanced understanding of this state, I’ve been reading the working notes of several highly creative individuals. These notes, written not for publication but as an aid in the process of discovery, are, in a way, partial windows into minds who inhabit the solitary creative space which the quotes above point to. In particular, I’ve found the notes of the mathematician&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck" rel="">Alexander Grothendieck</a><span>&nbsp;and the film director&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" rel="">Ingmar Bergman</a><span>&nbsp;revealing. They both kept detailed track of their thoughts as they attempted to reach out toward new ideas. Or rather, invited them in. In the notes, they also repeatedly turned their probing thoughts onto themselves, trying to uncover the process that brings the new into the world. </span></p><p>This essay is not a definite description of this creative state, which takes on many shapes; my aim is rather to give a portrait of a few approaches, to point out possibilities.</p><blockquote><p>It is as if there existed, for what seems like millennia, tracing back to the very origins of mathematics and of other arts and sciences, a sort of “conspiracy of silence” surrounding [the] “unspeakable labors” which precede the birth of each new idea, both big and small[.]</p><p><span>— Alexander Grothendieck,&nbsp;</span><em>Récoltes et Semailles</em></p></blockquote><p><span>In June 1983, Alexander Grothendieck sits down to write the preface to a mathematical manuscript called&nbsp;</span><em>Pursuing Stacks</em><span>. He is concerned by what he sees as a tacit disdain for the more “feminine side” of mathematics (which is related to what I’m calling the solitary creative state) in favor of the “hammer and chisel” of the finished theorem. By elevating the finished theorems, he feels that mathematics has been&nbsp;</span><em>flattened</em><span>: people only learn how to do the mechanical work of hammering out proofs, they do not know how to enter the dreamlike states where truly original mathematics arises. To counteract this, Grothendieck in the 1980s has decided to write in a new way, detailing how the “work is carried day after day [. . .] including all the mistakes and mess-ups, the frequent look-backs as well as the sudden leaps forward”, as well as “the early steps [. . .] while still on the lookout for [. . .] initial ideas and intuitions—the latter of which often prove to be elusive and escaping the meshes of language.”</span></p><p><span>This was how he had written&nbsp;</span><em>Pursuing Stacks,&nbsp;</em><span>the manuscript at hand, and it was the method he meant to employ in the preface as well. Except here he would be probing not a theorem but his psychology and the very nature of the creative act. He would sit with his mind, observing it as he wrote, until he had been able to put in words what he meant to say. It took him 29 months.</span></p><p><span>When the preface, known as&nbsp;</span><em>Récoltes et Semailles,&nbsp;</em><span>was finished, in October 1986, it numbered, in some accounts, more than 2000 pages. It is in an unnerving piece of writing, seething with pain, curling with insanity at the edges—Grothendieck is convinced that the mathematical community is morally degraded and intent on burying his work, and aligns himself with a series of saints (and the mathematician Riemann) whom he calls&nbsp;</span><em>les mutants</em><span>.

This happened in his late teens. It was, he writes, this profound contact with himself which he established between 17 and 20 that later set him apart—he was not as strong a mathematician as his peers when he came to Paris at 20, in 1947. That wasn’t the key to his ability to do great work.</p><blockquote><p>I admired the facility with which [my fellow students] picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them from the cradle—while for myself I felt clumsy, even oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things that I had to learn (so I was assured), things I felt incapable of understanding[.]</p></blockquote><p><span>Grothendieck was, to be clear, a strong mathematician compared to most anyone, but these peers were the most talented young mathematicians in France, and unlike Grothendieck, who had spent the war in an internment camp at Rieucros, near Mende, they had been placed in the best schools and tutored. They were talented and well-trained. But the point is: being exceptionally talented and trained was, in the long run, not enough to do groundbreaking work because&nbsp;</span><em>they lacked the capacity to go beyond the context they had been raised in.</em></p><blockquote><p>In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more brilliant than I have gone on to become distinguished mathematicians. Still, from the perspective of 30 or 35 years, I can state that their imprint upon the mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve all done things, often beautiful things, in a context that was already set out before them, which they had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To have broken these bounds they would have had to rediscover in themselves that capability which was their birth-right, as it was mine: the capacity to be alone.</p></blockquote><p><em>The capacity to be alone.&nbsp;</em><span>This was what Grothendieck had developed. In the camp during the war, a fellow prisoner named Maria had taught him that a circle can be defined as all points that are equally far from a point. This clear abstraction attracted him immensely. After the war, having only a limited understanding of high school mathematics, Grothendieck ended up at the University of Montpellier, which was not an important center for mathematics. The teachers disappointed him, as did the textbooks: they couldn’t even provide a decent definition of what they meant when they said&nbsp;</span><em>length!</em><span>&nbsp;Instead of attending lectures, he spent the years from 17 to 20 catching up on high school mathematics and working out proper definitions of concepts like arc length and volume. Had he been in a good mathematical institution, he would have known that the problems he was working on had already been solved 30 years earlier. Being isolated from mentors he instead painstakingly reinvent parts of what is known as measurement theory and the Lebesgue integral.&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p>A few years after I finally established contact with the world of mathematics at Paris, I learned, among other things, that the work I’d done in my little niche [. . . had] been long known to the whole world [. . .]. In the eyes of my mentors, to whom I’d described this work, and even showed them the manuscript, I’d simply “wasted my time”, merely doing over again something that was “already known”. But I don't recall feeling any sense of disappointment. [. . .]</p></blockquote><p>The three years of solitary work at Montpellier had not been wasted in the least: that intellectual isolation was what had allowed him to access the cognitive space where new ideas arise. He had made himself at home there.</p><blockquote><p>Without recognizing it, I’d thereby familiarized myself with the conditions of solitude that are essential for the profession of mathematician, something that no-one can teach you. [. . .]</p><p><span>To state it in slightly different terms: in those critical years I learned how to&nbsp;</span><em>be alone.</em></p><p>[. . .] these three years of work in isolation, when I was thrown onto my own resources, following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously invented, instilled in me a strong degree of confidence, unassuming yet enduring, in my ability to do mathematics, which owes nothing to any consensus or to the fashions which pass as law....</p></blockquote><p><span>This experience is common in the childhoods of people who go on to do great work, as I have&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/childhoods" rel="">written elsewhere</a><span>. Nearly everyone who does great work has some episode of early solitary work. As the philosopher Bertrand Russell remarked, the development of gifted and creative individuals, such as Newton or Whitehead, seems to require a period in which there is little or no pressure for conformity, a time in which they can develop and pursue their interests no matter how unusual or bizarre. In so doing, there is often an element of reinventing the already known. Einstein reinvented parts of statistical physics. Pascal, self-teaching mathematics because his father did not approve, rederived several Euclidean proofs. There is also a lot of confusion and pursuit of dead ends. Newton looking for numerical patterns in the Bible, for instance. This might look wasteful if you think what they are doing is research. But it is not if you realize that they are building up their</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>ability to perceive the evolution of their own thought, their capacity for attention.</span></p><p><span>One thing that sets these intensely creative individuals apart, as far as I can tell, is that when sitting with their thoughts they are uncommonly willing to linger in confusion.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>To be curious about that which confuses. Not too rapidly seeking the safety of knowing or the safety of a legible question, but waiting for a more powerful and subtle question to arise from loose and open attention. This patience with confusion makes them good at surfacing&nbsp;</span><em>new questions.&nbsp;</em><span>It is this capacity to surface questions that set Grothendieck apart, more so than his capacity to answer them. When he writes that his peers were more brilliant than him, he is referring to their ability to&nbsp;</span><em>answer</em><span>&nbsp;questions</span></p><p><span>. It was just that their questions were unoriginal. As Paul Graham observes:</span></p><blockquote><p>People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who’d never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Grothendieck had a talent to notice (and admit!) that he was subtly bewildered and intrigued by things that for others seemed self-evident (what is length?) or already settled (the Lebesgue integral) or downright bizarre (as were many of his meditations on God and dreams). From this arose some truly astonishing questions, surfacing powerful ideas, such as topoi, schemas, and K-theory.</p><p><span>So far, we’ve talked about solitary work. But that has its limitations. If you want to do great work you have to interface with others—learn what they have figured out, find collaborators who can extend your vision, and other support. The trick is doing this without losing yourself. What solitude gives you is an opportunity to study&nbsp;</span><em>what personal curiosity feels like</em><span>&nbsp;in its undiluted form, free from the interference of other considerations. Being familiar with the character of this feeling makes it easier to recognize if you are reacting to the potential in the work you are doing in a genuinely personal way, or if you are giving in to  impulses that will raise your status in the group at the expense of the reach of your work.</span></p><p><span>After his three years of solitary work, Grothendieck did integrate into the world of mathematics. He learned the tools of the trade, he got up to date on the latest mathematical findings, he found mentors and collaborators—but he was doing that from&nbsp;</span><em>within</em><span>&nbsp;his framework. His peers, who had been raised within the system, had not developed this feel for themselves and so were more susceptible to the influence of others. Grothendieck knew what he found interesting and productively confusing because he had spent three years observing his thought and tracing where it wanted to go. He was not at the mercy of the social world he entered; rather, he “used” it to “further his aims.” (I put things in quotation marks here because what he’s doing isn’t exactly this deliberate.) He picked mentors that were aligned with his goals, and peers that unblock his particular genius.&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><span>I do not remember a single occasion when I was treated with condescension by one of these men, nor an occasion when my thirst for knowledge, and later, anew, my joy of discovery, was rejected by complacency or by disdain.&nbsp;</span><strong>Had it not been so, I would not have “become a mathematician” as they say—I would have chosen another profession, where I could give my whole strength without having to face scorn.&nbsp;</strong><span>[My emphasis.]</span></p></blockquote><p>He could interface with the mathematical community with integrity because he had a deep familiarity with his inner space. If he had not known the shape of his interests and aims, he would have been more vulnerable to the standards and norms of the community—at least he seems to think so.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png" width="1200" height="803.5714285714286" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:975,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61d4edd1-7d80-4abf-bd3d-5e7a0278c244_1600x1071.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Ingmar Bergman inspects the shark used in the production of Steven Spielberg’s </em><span>Jaws.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Yet. Even if you know what it feels like to be completely open to where your curiosity wants you to go, like Grothendieck, it is a fragile state. It often takes considerable work to keep the creative state from collapsing, especially as your work becomes successful and the social expectations mount. When I listen to interviews with creative people or read their workbooks, there are endless examples of them lamenting how hard it is. They keep coming up with techniques, rituals, and narratives to block off and protect the mental space they need.</p><p><span>This is evident in the workbooks that Ingmar Bergman kept from 1955 to 2001. Starting around the time he wrote&nbsp;</span><em>The Seventh Seal</em><span>, where a young Max von Sydow plays chess against Death, Bergman kept detailed notes of his thoughts, ending after he’d finished the script to his final film,&nbsp;</span><em>Saraband.</em><span>&nbsp;It is a very fluid and loose set of notes. There is no logic or structure. One second, Bergman will be writing about his frustrations with the work, and then without warning, the voice will subtly shift into something else—he’s drifting into a monologue. (Werner Herzog does the same in his diaries, making notes about his day and then abruptly veering off into narrative and feverish metaphors.) These fragments that unexpectedly ooze out of Bergman gradually coalesce into films.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png" width="1166" height="1600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:1166,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd7528a-d93e-437b-8646-7f9f98687aea_1166x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>One of Ingmar Bergman’s workbooks from 1966</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Bergman’s notebooks are filled with admonitions he gives himself, for example here, on March 18, 1960: “(I will write as I feel and as my people want. Not what outer reality demands.)” Or here, on July 16, 1955: “I must not be intimidated. It’s better to do this than a lousy comedy. The money I give no fuck about.” Being highly impressionable and introverted, he is crafting a defiant personality in the notebooks, a protective gear that allows his larval ideas to live, even those who seem too banal (“a man learns that he is dying and discovers that life is beautiful,” which turns into&nbsp;</span><em>Seventh Seal</em><span>).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Another introverted and impressionable writer is Karl Ove Knausgaard. In </span><a href="https://lithub.com/karl-ove-knausgaard-on-the-genius-of-ingmar-bergman/" rel="">a perceptive essay</a><span> about Bergman’s workbooks (an essay that is, I should point out, partly fabulated in a way that perhaps says more about how Knausgaard works than Bergman), Knausgaard makes a remark about the reminders Bergman writes himself (“I must not be intimidated” etc). These kinds of reminders are, Knausgaard claims, of little use because they “belong to thought and have no access to those cognitive spaces where the creative act takes place, but can only point to them.” To access these spaces, the thought “I will write as I feel and as my people want” is not enough. Rather, Knausgaard writes:</span></p><blockquote><p>In order to create something, Bergman had to go sub-Bergman, to the place in the mind where no name exists, where nothing is as yet nailed down, where one thing can morph into another, where boundlessness prevails. The workbook is this place—in it, Bergman could put anything he wanted, the entries he made there could be completely inane, cringingly talentless, heartrendingly commonplace, intensely transgressive, jaw-droppingly dull, and this was in part their purpose: they had to be free of censorship, in particular self-censorship, which sought to lay down constraints on a process that needed to be wholly unconstrained.</p></blockquote><p>There is a difference between knowing what you need to do (be independent and true to the potential in your ideas) and something else entirely to know how to embody that. Orienting in the right way to your thoughts is a skill. Like all skills, it takes practice. You also need to have a rich mental representation of how it is supposed to feel to embody the state so that you can orient toward that. This feeling is what you use to measure the relative success of whatever techniques you employ.</p><p>To slip more easily into the state, many develop strict habits around their work, rituals even. This is also what Bergman does.</p><p>The first few years, in the late 50s, the entries in his workbook are sparse. But as he pushes into the height of his creative career Bergman sets up a strict routine where he writes in the book for three hours every day, from 9 to 12 am, stopping mid-sentence at the strike of the clock. The book becomes the main technique he uses to induce the state where films and plays and books can be born. A non-judgemental zone. He writes that the workbook needs to be “so unpresumptuous and undemanding and is intended to sustain like the mellowest woman almost any number of my peculiarities.” </p><p>This is a fairly common practice, crafting a ritual where you sit down at the same time every day, in the same chair, writing in the same kind of notebook, creating a repetitiveness that borders on self-hypnosis. This is what Hemingway did, it is what Mario Vargas Llosa does.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some other techniques people use to access and maintain the zone:</p><ul><li><p><span>Introducing a long delay between when you do the work and when it is shown to the world. Annie Ernaux writes about this in&nbsp;</span><em>A Simple Passion,&nbsp;</em><span>a memoir about how she becomes obsessed in a banal way with a man who is having an affair with her—the thought that others will read these notes about the tacky sex life of a middle-aged woman feels, to her, almost fictional. She will be far away when it happens. Therefore, she doesn’t feel a need to protect herself.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p>Thinking of the work in religious terms, as a service to, or a search for, God. Bergman, Grothendieck, and Pascal all do this. It might be easier to summon the awe and daring necessary to push out into the unknown and against social pressure if the alternative is failing God. Or a fiendish muse.</p></li><li><p>Working with talented and open-minded collaborators, if you have the chance, can be a way to enter the zone. Nick Cave, when asked how he’s been able to reinvent himself so many times as a musician, says that his bandmates, especially Warren Ellis, simply will not play anything that sounds like what he’s done before. He has surrounded himself with people whose influence is the inverse of the social pressure of normal society and his audience.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><span>Another idea if you want to push against the mental pressure that kills good ideas, from Paul Graham’s recent essay on how to do good work: “One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for&nbsp;</span><em>someone else</em><span>&nbsp;to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to protect you.” I don’t know of anyone using this technique, but it might work.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Actively subvert expectations. Kristian Mattsson, who performs under the moniker Tallest Man on Earth, says he pays close attention to his emotions as he’s writing new songs. If he gets excited,&nbsp;</span><em>purely</em><span>, he immediately puts the guitar down—excitement means what he is playing something he knows others will like, something that retreads paths he has already explored and been socially validated for. The songs he’s looking for are the ones that he’s ashamed of liking.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Noticing these subtle differences in creative excitement requires subtle introspection. But you can be even more subtle. If we think of creative introspection as having three levels, Mattsson is on level two. (Level one is just noticing that you find an idea interesting or exciting.) Level two is noticing that your longing to be accepted can fool you to get excited about an idea that you are not actually excited about. Level three is Andrei Tarkovsky. In his diary, during preproduction of his masterpiece&nbsp;</span><em>Solaris</em><span>, the Soviet filmmaker writes that he has met a sound engineer that he considers brilliant. The sound engineer told Tarkovsky that they shouldn’t use Bach in the film because “everyone is using Bach in their films at the moment.” In the diary, Tarkovsky makes no further note, but in the film, the music is—Bach. Tarkovsky realized it didn’t matter that Bach was a popular choice that people would praise him for. It was just the right thing. This is very hard to do, so most creatives stay on level 2 and learn that what is popular is a trap. This does lead to good ideas being needlessly killed. But likely more would die if they had let what is popular kill unpopular ideas.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Work so fast that you don’t have time to self-censor. While writing the intensely confessional&nbsp;</span><em>My Struggle,&nbsp;</em><span>Knausgaard forced himself to write five pages a day to overcome his tendency to freeze up in shame. Every time he acclimated to the pace of his writing, he increased the quota so he would always be overwhelmed—at one point he forced himself to write 25,000 words in 24 hours, about a third of a normal-sized novel. It is not the best writing he has done; it kind of melts at the edges. But it is true literature and, like&nbsp;</span><em>Récoltes et Semailles&nbsp;</em><span>and Bergman’s workbooks, it is a rare opportunity to observe an uncommon and fertile mind in real-time.</span></p></li></ul><p>The mental states where new ideas can be born are hard to open up. And they are continually collapsing. The things you have to do to keep them from caving in will make people frown upon you—your tendency for isolation, working deep in the night, breaking norms. The zone is a place at the margin of society. But strangely enough, this fragile margin is where the ideas that make our society possible come from. Almost everything that makes up our world first appeared in a solitary head—the innovations, the tools, the images, the stories, the prophecies, and religions—it did not come from the center, it came from those who ran from it.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/good-ideas?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/good-ideas?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>If you’ve made it all the way down here and don’t feel like you’ve just wasted twenty minutes, consider giving the essay a like or sharing it with a friend.

On Wednesday, Grusch repeated some of those claims – although not all – under oath.</p><p>“I was informed, in the course of my official duties, of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program, to which I was denied access,” Grusch told the committee.</p><p>The hearing attracted intense global interest, and provided speculation and claims that the US is hiding evidence of alien life and technology – mixed with large doses of skepticism.</p><p>Grusch filed a whistleblower complaint in 2022. He said that in his role in the government he had been charged with investigating what military, defense and other agencies knew about aliens and alien craft, but alleged he had been prevented from accessing secret government UFO programs.</p><p>Speaking on Wednesday, Grusch said he has faced “very brutal” retaliation as a result of his allegations.</p><p>“It hurt me both professionally and personally,” Grusch said.</p><p>Under questioning, Grusch confirmed that he had knowledge of “people who have been harmed or injured” in the course of government efforts to conceal UFO information.</p><p>Asked by an oversight committee member if he had “feared for his life”, Grusch replied: “Yes definitely.”</p><p>Grusch added: “I am hopeful that my actions will ultimately lead to a positive outcome of increased transparency.”</p><p>Grusch’s allegation, aired in interviews with the Debrief and <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/we-are-not-alone-the-ufo-whistleblower-speaks/" data-link-name="in body link">NewsNation</a>, that the federal government was hiding this evidence of alien craft from Congress sparked a firestorm in June, prompting the Republican-led oversight committee to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/ufo-house-representatives-hearing-investigation" data-link-name="in body link"> launch an immediate investigation</a>.</p><p>Since then, the intrigue around what evidence the government has, or doesn’t have, around UFOs has only intensified.</p><p>Tim Burchett, a Republican congressman from Tennessee who is co-leading the UFO investigation, has claimed in recent weeks that the US had evidence of technology that “defies all of our laws of physics”, and that alien craft possess technology that could “turn us into a charcoal briquette”.</p><p>On Wednesday, however, Burchett sought to downplay, somewhat, what people would hear.</p><p>“We’re not bringing little green men or flying saucers into the hearing. Sorry to disappoint about half y’all. We’re just going to get to the facts,” Burchett said.</p><p>That announcement drew a chuckle, but Burchett became more serious as he accused government agencies of a lack of cooperation with the oversight committee investigation.</p><p>“It’s been so difficult to get here today. In the Baptist church we say that the devil is in our way, and the devil has been in our way for this thing. We’ve run into roadblocks from members, the intelligence community, [and] the Pentagon.</p><p>While there were no little green men in the hearing, Grusch did claim that the US has recovered alien beings.</p><p>After Grusch had reiterated his position that the government had possession of crashed extraterrestrial vehicles, he was asked if “we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft?”</p><p>“As I’ve stated publicly already in my NewsNation interview, biologics came with some of these recoveries,” Grusch said.</p><p>These biologics, Grusch said, were: “Non-human, and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to, that are currently still on the program.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-23" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="958eb75b-9e1e-4205-86f5-ec7e7f5269bc" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-1"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Tim Burchett, centre, who is co-leading the UFO investigation." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2811800eceecd4e7f7f394ced0fd50225ae35d4/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.152099609375" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Tim Burchett, centre, who is co-leading the UFO investigation.</span> Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>He said the government had probably had knowledge of “non-human” activity since the 1930s. At times, however, Grusch was less forthcoming under oath than he had been in media interviews.</p><p>In the interview with NewsNation in June, Grusch claimed the government had “very large, like a football-field kind of size” alien craft, while he told <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/sciences/david-grusch-lanceur-dalerte-sur-des-ovnis-ca-peut-etre-extraterrestre-ou-autre-chose-mais-pas-humain-07-06-2023-P73S2REKZJDGNGCEJQBDEIQJTU.php" data-link-name="in body link">Le Parisien</a>, a French newspaper, that the US had possession of a “bell-like craft” which Benito Mussolini’s government had recovered in northern Italy in 1933.</p><p>On Wednesday, Grusch seemed unwilling to go into details on those claims, citing issues of security. Grusch told the hearing he was prepared to elaborate in private, but his reticence prompted speculation from doubters.</p><p>Garrett Graff, a journalist and historian who is writing <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/UFO/Garrett-M-Graff/9781982196776" data-link-name="in body link">a book</a> on the government’s hunt for UFOs, tweeted: “Very interesting to me that Dave Grusch is unwilling to state and repeat under oath at the #UFOHearings the most explosive (and outlandish) of his claims from his NewsNation interview. He seems to be very carefully dancing around repeating them.”</p><p>The run-up to the hearing had been marked by accusations from Burchett and his co-investigator, Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican congresswoman from Florida, that they had been “stonewalled” by federal officials.</p><p>Yet after the hearing, Burchett, who has previously claimed alien craft possess technology that could “turn us into a charcoal briquette”, and alleged that the US has been hiding evidence of UFOs since 1947, seemed fairly satisfied.</p><p>Speaking to the Guardian, he said he had found Grusch’s claims about the recovery of “non-human” bodies to be credible.</p><p>“I don’t want to oversimplify it, but how are you going to fly one [spaceship]? You got to have somebody in it. That seems to be pretty simple,” Burchett said.</p><p>Asked what he had learned about alien craft in the course of his investigation, Burchett said: “I believe they exist. I knew that before I came in here. I didn’t learn a lot because I knew the answers already, but I was glad they put it in the record.”</p><p>The Pentagon has denied Grusch’s claims of a cover-up. In a statement, a defense department spokeswoman, Sue Gough, said investigators had not discovered “any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently”.</p><p>Other witnesses at the hearing were David Fravor, a former navy commander who on Wednesday recalled seeing a strange object in the sky while on a training mission in 2004, and Ryan Graves, a retired navy pilot who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNsxtNUeFB4" data-link-name="in body link">has claimed</a> that he saw unidentified aerial phenomena off the Atlantic coast “every day for at least a couple years”.</p><p>Graves, who has since founded Americans for Safe Aerospace, a UAP non-profit, said he was appearing “to voice the concerns of more than 30 commercial aircrews and military veterans who have confided their similar encounters with me”.</p><p>Asked if there were similarities between his sightings and others that have been reported, he said many of the UFOs reported were “dark grey or black cubes inside of clear sphere” where “the apex or tips of the cube were touching the inside of the sphere”.</p><p>For all the excitement and inevitable media speculation, some had cautioned against reading too much into what we might hear.</p><p>Grusch has not seen the alleged alien craft himself – he says his claims are based on “extensive interviews with high-level intelligence officials” – and skeptics have noted that accusations that the government is hiding information on UFOs are nothing new.</p><p>“The story aligns with a lot of similar stories that have played out, going back to the 1980s and 1970s, that together allege that the US government has kept an incredible secret, the literal most extraordinary secret that mankind could have, for not just weeks or months, but years and decades, with no meaningful leak or documentary evidence to ever come forward,” Graff previously told the Guardian.</p><p>“I think when you look at the government’s ability to keep secret other really important secrets, there’s a lot of reason to doubt the capability of the government to do that.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>People want to get along. </p><p>Few people, if they are shown some respect, will figure out a way to make peace with their coworkers. As the leader of a team wanting to create a toxic culture and have it still be going when you return from prison, you need to create a team that never reaches this peace.</p><p><strong>Foster a culture of inconsistent goals</strong></p><p>The definition of quality work should not be consistent and well-understood. Imagine that you are a working at a restaurant making soup, and a head chef decides if your soup is good enough everyday and you only get paid if it is. You make the soup the same everyday, but some days it isn't good enough. You start to imagine reasons - maybe the chef doesn't like you, maybe someone is messing with your ingredients, maybe you don’t know what you are doing, maybe you have angered the soup God - the stress of this situation given the stakes will create a paranoid and uncollaborative workforce.</p><p><span>This is your goal - create a culture in which only your approval is a measure of good or bad. Make this approval infrequent and inconsistent. As soon as the soupmaker starts to feel empowered, spit out his soup. Occassionly say things like “this soup is OK, but Barbara doesn’t like it”.

<p>Apple is notoriously strict with iPhones. You may own the phone, but it’s Apple that gets to decide what apps you’re allowed to run on it.</p>
<p>If Apple decides an app isn’t allowed in the App Store, you’re not allowed to use it.</p>
<p>While many app developers have spent months or even years working on apps for iPhones, only to find that <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/apple-bans-pewdiepies-new-game-poopdie-from-the-app-store/">Apple rejects their app</a> and <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/shadow-banned-from-app-store/">refuses their access to the market</a> – Apple seems to be making exceptions for China’s WeChat app.</p>
<p>Why would notoriously-draconian Apple allow China’s most popular app to skirt the rules?</p>
<p>WeChat is so popular that Chinese citizens beg to be allowed back on the platform <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/wechat-users-banned-coronavirus/">when they get banned for criticizing the Chinese government</a>, or when they <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/wechat-coronavirus-censorship/">try to warn people about certain viral outbreaks</a>, or when they <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/wechat-is-censoring-us-citizens-hong-kong/">support Hong Kong.</a></p>
<p>Ironically, Apple, which helped the mobile app gain popularity, is now being seriously threatened by the app’s popularity.</p>
<p>WeChat is developed by Chinese state-backed Tencent and combines the functionality of messaging, social media, and e-payments.</p>
<p>Due to these functionalities, WeChat has become the most important application for many Chinese smartphone users. WeChat became widely popular especially when its iPhone app was launched several years ago.</p>
<p>In itself, WeChat is a stand-alone app. But it is also capable of running mini-programs within the app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat.png" alt="" width="1513" height="1040" srcset="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat.png 1513w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat-300x206.png 300w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat-1024x704.png 1024w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat-768x528.png 768w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat-360x247.png 360w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wechat-545x375.png 545w" sizes="(max-width: 1513px) 100vw, 1513px"></p>
<p>But here’s the rub, for Apple:</p>
<p>Since these are “apps within an app”, many of these mini-programs are flouting the App Store rules since they were not downloaded from the App Store.</p>
<p>Some representatives of Tencent hoodwinked Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2017 that these “mini-programs” are not apps so Apple doesn’t have to worry about them being used on WeChat.</p>
<p>But these mini-programs have evolved through time. Whereas before, these “mini-programs” didn’t compete with full-blown apps, now they do.</p>
<p>Some of these mini-programs are even capable of live video streaming, augmented reality and other advanced functionality.</p>
<p>Shanghai-based app developer Sinia Spasojevic told <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-tencents-wechat-poses-creeping-threat-to-apple">The Information</a> that WeChat is breaking App Store rules through the propagation of these mini-programs.</p>
<p>We already know Apple is willing to take drastic action <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/facebook-research-app-scandal/">against the US’s own Facebook for breaking the rules</a>, so why not China’s WeChat?</p>
<p>WeChat and its mini-programs are starting to become so important to Chinese users that most are starting to put more importance on the capability of a smartphone to run WeChat regardless of whether its an iPhone or Android.</p>
<p>Today, there are more than 2.4 million mini-programs that can be run within WeChat. If this trend continues, there will come a time when developers will concentrate on developing new useful mini-programs to run on WeChat instead of stand-alone apps which have to abide by certain rules before it becomes available on the App Store.</p>
<p>If Apple cracks down on WeChat’s practices, Chinese customers will have little reason to ever buy an iPhone.</p>
<p>So, if Apple wants the Chinese to continue to buy iPhones, they have to let WeChat – one of the most privacy-invasive and censorship driven apps on the planet, continue to ignore its App Store rules.</p>
<p>And with <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/apple-rejects-freedom-of-expression/">Apple’s shareholders not in agreement</a> to actually put their money where their mouth is when it comes to human rights, it’s not likely Apple is going to go against China anytime soon.</p>

<h2>Experts warn that ISPs would use black-box AI to comply</h2>
<p>Like our piece on <a href="https://easydns.com/blog/2023/01/27/canadas-bill-c-26-yet-another-government-power-grab/">Canada’s Cyber-Security Bill earlier this year</a>, this item was flagged in my work for the <a href="https://internetsociety.ca/">Internet Society, Canada Chapter</a>, but <strong><em><span>this post does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the ISCC.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>It concerns <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/publications/legal-advice-on-prior-restraint-provisions-in-the-online-safety-bill/">a legal opinion drafted</a> by the UK’s Open Rights Group (similar mission to Internet Society and other civil society groups), on that country’s planned “Online Harms Bill”.</p>
<p>Recall that here in Canada, we also have Online Harms legislation in the works. When Steven Guilbeault was Heritage Minister,&nbsp; he began crafting Bill C-36, which would seek (among other things), to designate political dissent as “hate speech”, criminalize the criticism of politicians and may <a href="https://bombthrower.com/canada-to-censor-political-taunts-constituents-remain-fair-game/">require ISPs to implement “<em><strong>an internet kill switch to block websites deemed hurtful”.</strong></em></a></p>
<p>The major red flag in the UK bill is the concept of <strong>“prior restraint</strong>“. In communications to the ISOC, Dr Monica Horten expressed Open Rights Group’s concerns that,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“This is the concept of <strong>banning content before publication</strong>, or <strong>blocking publication without&nbsp; due process</strong>, and may be interpreted as an <strong>‘upload filter’</strong>. </em></p>
<p><em>Whilst the legal Advice does not directly address the provisions that affect encrypted messaging services, it could have implications. It addresses Clause 9 (2) which <strong>requires online providers to ‘prevent users encountering’ illegal content.</strong> The same language is used in Clause 111 which establishes the power for Ofcom <strong>to require encrypted messaging services to screen users’ communications.</strong> For this reason, we would like to draw your attention to it. </em></p>
<p><em>The Advice&nbsp; warns that the Online Safety Bill could <strong>fundamentally alter online communication by enforcing ‘prior restraint&nbsp; through AI</strong>, stifling freedom of expression by <strong>blocking content deemed ‘illegal’ without – explanation</strong>, <strong>notification or due process</strong>‘ for the censored user. </em></p>
<p><em>The Advice considers that Clause 9 (2)&nbsp; provides for <strong>state-sanctioned ‘prior restraint’ on freedom of expression</strong> <strong>through the use of proprietorial processes by private companies.</strong> This will lead to interference with freedom of expression which is not “prescribed by law”&nbsp; –&nbsp; meaning that it would not be&nbsp; sufficiently accessible, clear and foreseeable to allow individuals to regulate their conduct accordingly for the purposes of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As Thomas Sowell would say, “Oh dear, where to begin?”</p>
<p>We saw under the Covid years how pre-emptive shaping of permissible speech on the part of governments, the Big Tech platforms and various private “fact checking” rackets, resulted in wholesale censorship, deplatforming, and even coordinated defamation and professional harm.</p>
<p>In short, people had their lives and careers destroyed for speaking out, for questioning the “official” narrative, or for proposing alternative mitigation methodologies than those espoused by unelected, unaccountable technocrats.</p>
<p>In many cases, those prevailing, official narratives have turned out to be fallacious or incorrect to the point of being somewhere on a spectrum between misinformation and institutionalized gaslighting.</p>
<p>Governments, Big Tech, and the corporate media should be slinking off into a corner and licking the wounds of their now shattered credibility, while trying to figure out ways to rebuild trust amongst a public that they have <em>all&nbsp;</em>betrayed beyond redemption.</p>
<p>Instead, they are trying to ram through new legislation, more rules, and opaque algos that would seek to further penalize dissent, criminalize non-conforming thought, and as Dr. Horten spells out plainly: violate universal human rights.</p>
<p>It would also thrust the implementation phase of this Brave New World onto ISPs, service providers and communications services, which for the most part, are built to do the exact <em>opposite&nbsp;</em>of what these new initiatives propose. In many cases we are now dealing with decentralized, open source protocols for which such new legislation would be pointless and unenforcible, if not absurd.</p>
<p>All so that they can double-down on their own failures and escape facing any accountability for getting every meaningful talking point around the pandemic dead wrong.</p>
<h2>Meanwhile, In Canada…</h2>
<p>Moving the Online Safety legislation down the field is now under the purview of Pablo Rodriguez, Canada’s <span>current</span> former Heritage Minister (he’s out in a cabinet reshuffle moments ago), who was currently <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2023/07/what-if-it-isnt-a-bluff-the-consequences-of-the-governments-epic-bill-c-18-miscalculation-begin-to-set-in/">embroiled in the debacle</a> of having single-handedly deplatformed the Canadian corporate media from Big Tech platforms with the deeply flawed Bill C-18 (C-36’s original architect Steven Guilbeault is currently Environment Minister).</p>
<p>On it’s own C-36 would be bad enough, but in concert with the myriad other pieces of legislation</p>
<ul>
<li>C-11 put the Internet under the regulatory oversight of the CRTC</li>
<li>C-26 (the Cyber-Security bill) would grant sweeping, unsupervised power to bureaucrats and even quasi-government agencies to literally command and censor internet communications by decree</li>
<li>C-18 – aforementioned – trying to strong arm tech platforms into subsidizing Canada’s flailing corporate media</li>
</ul>
<p>…we continue to see some very disturbing convergences both here at home and internationally.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">AI startup Stability AI continues to refine its generative AI models in the face of increasing competition — and ethical challenges.</p>
<p>Today, Stability AI announced the launch of Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, a text-to-image model that the company describes as its “most advanced” release to date. Available in open source on GitHub in addition to Stability’s API and consumer apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/13/stability-ai-releases-stable-doodle-a-sketch-to-image-tool/">Clipdrop</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/stability-ai-open-sources-its-ai-powered-design-studio/">DreamStudio</a>, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 delivers “more vibrant” and “accurate” colors and better contrast, shadows and lighting compared to its predecessor, Stability claims.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Joe Penna, Stability AI’s head of applied machine learning, noted that Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, which contains 3.5 billion parameters, can yield full 1-megapixel resolution images “in seconds” in multiple aspect ratios. “Parameters” are the parts of a model learned from training data and essentially define the skill of the model on a problem, in this case generating images.</p>
<p>The previous-gen Stable Diffusion model, Stable Diffusion XL 0.9, could produce higher-resolution images as well, but required more computational might.</p>
<p>“Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 is customizable, ready for fine-tuning for concepts and styles,” Penna said. “It’s also easier to use, capable of complex designs with basic natural language processing prompting.”</p>
<p>Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 is improved in the area of text generation, in addition. While many of the best text-to-image models struggle to generate images with legible logos, much less calligraphy or fonts, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 is capable of “advanced” text generation and legibility, Penna says.</p>
<p>And, as reported by <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2023/07/26/stability-ai-launches-stable-diffusion-xl-1-0-amazon-bedrock/">SiliconAngle</a> and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stability-ai-levels-up-image-generation-launch-new-stable-diffusion-base-model/">VentureBeat</a>, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 supports inpainting (reconstructing missing parts of an image), outpainting (extending existing images) and “image-to-image” prompts — meaning users can input an image and add some text prompts to create more detailed variations of that picture. Moreover, the model understands complicated, multi-part instructions given in short prompts, whereas previous Stable Diffusion models needed longer text prompts.</p>
<div id="attachment_2574796"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2574796" decoding="async" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png" alt="Stable Diffusion XL 1.0" width="798" height="798" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png 798w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Old-man-Image.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2574796">An image generated by Stable Diffusion XL 1.0.</p></div>
<p>“We hope that by releasing this much more powerful open source model, the resolution of the images will not be the only thing that quadruples, but also advancements that will greatly benefit all users,” he added.</p>
<p>But as with previous versions of Stable Diffusion, the model raises sticky moral issues.</p>
<p>The open source version of Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 can, in theory, be used by bad actors to generate toxic or harmful content, like nonconsensual deepfakes. That’s partially a reflection of the data that was used to train it: millions of images from around the web.</p>
<p>Countless <a href="https://gizmodo.com/stability-ai-xl-deep-fake-stable-diffusion-1850334500">tutorials</a> demonstrate how to use Stability AI’s own tools, including DreamStudio, an open source frontend for Stable Diffusion, to create deepfakes. Countless others show how to <a href="https://betterwaifu.com/stable-diffusion-nsfw/">fine-tune</a> the base Stable Diffusion models to generate porn.</p>
<p>Penna doesn’t deny that abuse is possible — and acknowledges that the model contains certain <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ai-dall-e-stability-ai-stable-diffusion-1849728302">biases</a>, as well. But he added that Stability AI’s taken “extra steps” to mitigate harmful content generation by filtering the model’s training data for “unsafe” imagery, releasing new warnings related to problematic prompts and blocking as many individual problematic terms in the tool as possible.</p>
<p>Stable Diffusion XL 1.0’s training set also includes artwork from artists who’ve protested against companies including Stability AI using their work as training data for generative AI models. Stability AI claims that it’s shielded from legal liability by fair use doctrine, at least in the U.S. But that hasn’t stopped several artists and stock photo company Getty Images from filing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/the-current-legal-cases-against-generative-ai-are-just-the-beginning/">lawsuits</a> to stop the practice.</p>
<p>Stability AI, which has a partnership with startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/03/spawning-lays-out-its-plans-for-letting-creators-opt-out-of-generative-ai-training/">Spawning</a> to respect “opt-out” requests from these artists, says that it hasn’t removed all flagged artwork from its training data sets but that it “continues to incorporate artists’ requests.”</p>
<p>“We are constantly improving the safety functionality of Stable Diffusion <span>and are serious about continuing to iterate on these measures,” Penna said. “</span>Moreover, we are committed to respecting artists’ requests to be removed from training data sets.”</p>
<p>To coincide with the release of Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, Stability AI is releasing fine-tuning feature in beta for its API that’ll allow users to use as few as five images to “specialize” generation on specific people, products and more. The company is also bringing Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 to Bedrock, Amazon’s cloud platform for hosting generative AI models — expanding on its previously-announced collaboration with AWS.</p>
<p>The push for partnerships and new capabilities comes as Stability suffers a lull in its commercial endeavors — facing stiff competition from OpenAI, Midjourney and others. In April, Semafor <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/07/2023/stability-ai-is-on-shaky-ground-as-it-burns-through-cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Stability AI, which has raised over $100 million in venture capital to date, was burning through cash — spurring the closing of a $25 million convertible note in June and an executive hunt to help ramp up sales.</p>
<p>“The latest SDXL model represents the next step in Stability AI’s innovation heritage and ability to bring the most cutting-edge open access models to market for the AI community,” Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque said in a press release. “Unveiling 1.0 on Amazon Bedrock demonstrates our strong commitment to work alongside AWS to provide the best solutions for developers and our clients.”</p>

<p>What impacts do agrochemicals have on the ongoing global insect decline? Biologists at the University of Konstanz have found out that aversive learning is impaired in bumblebees exposed to glyphosate. Their study is published in the journal <i>Science of the Total Environment</i>.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>"With global insect decline going on at alarming rates, we have to examine the contribution of agrochemicals more closely, going beyond mere assessment of mortality rates," says Morgane Nouvian, biologist and fellow at the Zukunftskolleg (Institute for Advanced Study for early career researchers) at the University of Konstanz.
</p><p>With Anja Weidenmüller and James J. Foster she investigated the impact of long-term exposure to glyphosate on locomotion, phototaxis—that is the movement in response to light—and learning abilities in bumblebees. For the researchers, non-lethal effects on fitness are equally important to insect conservation as lethal ones, as they can reduce an individual's chances at reproduction and survival.
</p><p>A year ago, Weidenmüller had discovered that the collective thermal behavior of bumblebee colonies that have been chronically exposed to glyphosate is affected when resources become scarce. Studying their ability to regulate the temperature of their brood, she found that these bumblebees cannot keep their brood warm for as long. And she warned that if they cannot maintain the necessary brood temperature, their brood will develop more slowly, or not at all.
</p><h2>Absence of aversive learning</h2>
<p>In their current study, the biologists tested more than 400 <a href="https://phys.org/tags/bumblebee/" rel="tag">bumblebee</a> workers. The Konstanz scientists demonstrate that bumblebees chronically exposed to glyphosate cannot associate a possible threat (aversive stimulus) with a visual cue during a differential learning task. "As far as we can see, they don't learn at all anymore," Nouvian says.
</p><p>In contrast, a control group of bumblebees that had not been exposed to glyphosate showed good aversive learning abilities. "The ability to associate a noxious stimulus with particular cues is a fundamental pre-requisite for survival," says Nouvian.
</p><p>"Through this adaptive behavior, animals have a better chance of avoiding encounters with poisons, predators and parasites. This is why the learning impairment that we have demonstrated, caused by exposure to glyphosate, could substantially increase the mortality rate of foragers. Such depletion of the workforce would have an obvious impact on colony success, although this remains to be confirmed experimentally," she says.
</p><p>As for the experiments on locomotion and phototaxis, glyphosate exposure slightly reduced the bumblebees' walking speed but only while they habituated to the training apparatus, and left the phototactic drive largely unaffected. However, it reduced attraction to ultraviolet light if compared to blue light.
</p><p>In their study, the biologists warn that even a slight shift in UV sensitivity could have broad implications for these pollinators, potentially affecting their navigation and their foraging efficiency.
</p><h2>Risk assessment put to test</h2>
<p>Glyphosate is currently approved for use in the EU until 15 December 2023, when <a href="https://phys.org/tags/decision-making/" rel="tag">decision-making</a> on the Glyphosate Renewal Group's (GRG) application for renewal is to be finalized according to information from the European Community website.
</p><p>On 6 July 2023, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a press release concluding it "did not identify any critical areas of concern in its peer review of the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/risk+assessment/" rel="tag">risk assessment</a> of the active substance <a href="https://phys.org/tags/glyphosate/" rel="tag">glyphosate</a> in relation to the risk it poses to humans and animals or the environment." At the same time, EFSA reported "some data gaps […] as issues that could not be finalized or outstanding issues […]."
</p><p>Concluding their study, the scientists proposed their assay—the so-called yAPIS, a fully automated, high throughput apparatus—as a method to investigate the impact of agrochemicals on insects, especially pollinators, more systematically.
</p><p>In particular, this approach could complement the mortality rates assessments that are currently used to evaluate the toxicity of agrochemicals, by providing data about their potential non-lethal effects.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Window management is one of those areas I’m fascinated with because even after 50 years, nobody’s fully cracked it yet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto">Ever since the dawn of time</a> we’ve relied on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)">window metaphor</a> as the primary way of multitasking on the desktop. In this metaphor, each app can spawn one or more rectangular windows, which are stacked by most recently used, and moved or resized manually.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9934" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9934"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/floating-windows2-1-1024x576.png" alt="" width="660" height="371" srcset="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/floating-windows2-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/floating-windows2-1-300x169.png 300w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/floating-windows2-1-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/floating-windows2-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/floating-windows2-1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9934">Overlapping windows can get messy quickly</figcaption></figure>
<p>The traditional windowing system works well as long as you only have a handful of small windows, but issues emerge as soon the number and size of the windows grows. As new windows are opened, existing ones are obscured, sometimes completely hiding them from view. Or, when you open a maximized window, suddenly every other window is hidden.</p>
<p>Over the decades, different OSes have added different tools and workflows to deal with these issues, including workspaces, taskbars, and switchers. However, the basic primitives have not changed <a href="http://toastytech.com/guis/alto3.html">since the 70s</a> and, as a result, the issues have never gone away.</p>
<p>While most of us are used to this system and its quirks, that doesn’t mean it’s without problems. This is especially apparent when you do user research with people who are new to computing, including children and older people. Manually placing and sizing windows can be fiddly work, and requires close attention and precise motor control. It’s also what we jokingly refer to as <a href="https://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work">shit work</a>: it is work that the user has to do, which is generated by the system itself, and has no other purpose.</p>
<p>Most of the time you don’t care about exact window sizes and positions and just want to see the windows that you need for your current task. Often that’s just a single, maximized window. Sometimes it’s two or three windows next to each other. It’s incredibly rare that you need a dozen different overlapping windows. Yet this is what you end up with by default today, when you simply use the computer, opening apps as you need them. Messy is the default, and it’s up to you to clean it up.</p>
<h4>What about tiling?</h4>
<p>Traditional tiling window managers solve the hidden window problem by preventing windows from overlapping. While this works well in some cases, it falls short as a general replacement for stacked, floating windows. The first reason for this is that tiling window managers size windows according to the amount of available screen space, yet most apps are designed to be used at a certain size and aspect ratio. For example, chat apps are inherently narrow and end up having large amounts of empty space at large sizes. Similarly, reading a PDF in a tiny window is not fun.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9949" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9949"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/forge2-1024x576.png" alt="" width="660" height="371" srcset="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/forge2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/forge2-300x169.png 300w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/forge2-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/forge2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/forge2.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9949">GNOME 44 with the “<a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4481/forge">Forge</a>” tiling extension. Just because windows <em>can</em> be tall and narrow doesn’t mean they should be :)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another issue with tiling window manager is that they place new windows in seemingly arbitrary positions. This is a consequence of them not having knowledge about the content of a window or the context in which it is being used, and leads to having to manually move or resize windows after the fact, which is exactly the kind of fiddling we want to avoid in the first place.</p>

<p>More constrained tiling window managers such as on iPadOS are interesting in that they’re more purposeful (you always intentionally create the tiling groups). However, this approach only allows tiling two windows side-by-side, and does not scale well to larger screens.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>This topic has been of interest to the design team for a <a href="https://cassidyjames.com/blog/gnome-west-coast-summit">very long time</a>. I remember discussing it with Jakub at my first GUADEC in 2017, and there have been countless discussions, ideas, and concepts since. Some particular milestones in our thinking were the concept work leading up to <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2020/12/18/gnome-shell-ux-plans-for-gnome-40">GNOME 40</a> in <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2019/12/02/gnome-shell-hackfest-2019">2019</a> and 2020, and the design sessions at the <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2022/07/30/berlin-mini-guadec-2022">Berlin Mini GUADEC in 2022</a> and the Brno hackfest in 2023.</p>

<p>I personally have a bit of a tradition working on this problem for at least a few weeks per year. For example, during the first lockdown in 2020 I spent quite a bit of time trying to envision a tiling-first version of GNOME Shell.</p>

<h4>Problems with our current tiling</h4>
<p>GNOME has had basic tiling functionality since early in the GNOME 3 series. While this is nice to have, it has obvious limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s completely manual</li>
<li>Only 2 windows are supported, and the current implementation is not extensible to more complex layouts</li>
<li>Tiled windows are not grouped in the window stack, so both windows are not raised simultaneously and other windows get in the way</li>
<li>Workspaces are manual, and not integrated into the workflow</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_9957" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9957"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/tiling-status-quo-1024x576.png" alt="" width="660" height="371" srcset="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/tiling-status-quo-1024x576.png 1024w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/tiling-status-quo-300x169.png 300w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/tiling-status-quo-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/tiling-status-quo-1536x864.png 1536w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/tiling-status-quo.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9957">Because tiled windows are are currently mixed with overlapping floating windows they’re not really helping make things less messy in practice.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We’ve wanted <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/os-mockups/-/issues/58">more powerful tiling</a> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/os-mockups/-/issues/169">for years</a>, but there has not been much progress due to the huge amount of work involved on the technical side and the lack of a clear design direction we were happy with. We now finally feel like the design is at a stage where we can take concrete next steps towards making it happen, which is very exciting!</p>
<h4>Get out of my way</h4>
<p>The key point we keep coming back to with this work is that, if we do add a new kind of window management to GNOME, it needs to be good enough to be the default. We don’t want to add yet another manual opt-in tool that doesn’t solve the problems the majority of people face.</p>
<p>To do this we landed on a number of high level ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically do what people probably want, allow adjusting if needed</li>
<li>Make use of workspaces as a fully integrated part of the workflow</li>
<li>Richer metadata from apps to allow for better integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Our current concept imagines windows having three potential layout states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mosaic</strong>, a new window management mode which combines the best parts of tiling and floating</li>
<li><strong>Edge Tiling</strong>, i.e. windows splitting the screen edge-to-edge</li>
<li><strong>Floating</strong>, the classic stacked windows model</li>
</ul>
<p><video id="video-9880-2" width="660" height="495" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/webm" src="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-open-close.webm?_=2"><a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-open-close.webm">https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-open-close.webm</a></video></p>
<p>Mosaic is the default behavior. You open a window, it opens centered on the screen at a size that makes the most sense for the app. For a web browser that might be maximized, for a weather app maybe only 700×500 pixels.</p>
<p><video id="video-9880-3" width="660" height="495" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/webm" src="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-maximize.webm?_=3"><a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-maximize.webm">https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-maximize.webm</a></video></p>
<p>As you open more windows, the existing windows move aside to make room for the new ones. If a new window doesn’t fit (e.g. because it wants to be maximized) it moves to its own workspace. If the window layout comes close to filling the screen, the windows are automatically tiled.</p>
<p><video id="video-9880-4" width="660" height="495" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/webm" src="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-tile2.webm?_=4"><a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-tile2.webm">https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-tile2.webm</a></video></p>
<p>You can also manually tile windows. If there’s enough space, other windows are left in a mosaic layout. However, if there’s not enough space for this mosaic layout, you’re prompted to pick another window to tile alongside.</p>
<p><video id="video-9880-5" width="660" height="495" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/webm" src="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-tile3.webm?_=5"><a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-tile3.webm">https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-tile3.webm</a></video></p>
<p>You’re not limited to tiling just two windows side by side. Any tile (or the remaining space) can be split by dragging another window over it, and freely resized as the window minimum sizes allow.</p>
<p><video id="video-9880-6" width="660" height="495" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/webm" src="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-vertical-tile.webm?_=6"><a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-vertical-tile.webm">https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/mosaic-vertical-tile.webm</a></video></p>
<p>There are always going to be cases that require placing a window in a specific position on the screen. The new system allows windows to be used with the classic floating behavior, on a layer above the mosaic/tiling windows. However, we think that this floating behaviour is going to be a relatively uncommon, similar to the existing “always on top” behavior that we have today.</p>
<p>There’s of course much more to this, but hopefully this gives an idea of what we have in mind in terms of behavior.</p>
<h4>New window metadata</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, to avoid the pitfalls of traditional tiling window managers we need more information from windows about their content. Windows can already set a fixed size and they have an implicit minimum size, but to build a great tiling experience we need more.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9972" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9972"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/huge-clocks-1024x576.png" alt="" width="660" height="371" srcset="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/huge-clocks-1024x576.png 1024w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/huge-clocks-300x169.png 300w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/huge-clocks-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/huge-clocks-1536x864.png 1536w, https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/files/2023/07/huge-clocks-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9972">Some apps should probably never be maximized/tiled on a 4K monitor…</figcaption></figure>
<p>One important missing piece is having information on the maximum desired size of a window. This is the size beyond which the window content stops looking good. Not having this information is one of the reasons that traditional tiling window managers have issues, especially on larger screens. This maximum size would not be a hard limit and manual resizing would still be possible. Instead, the system would use the maximum size as one factor when it calculates an optimal window layout. For example, when tiling to the side of the screen, a window would only grow as wide as its maximum width rather than filling exactly half of the screen.</p>
<p>In addition, it’d be helpful to know the range of ideal sizes where an app works best. While an app may technically work at mobile sizes that’s probably not the best way to use that app if you have a large display. To stay with our chat example, you probably want to avoid folding the sidebar if it can be avoided, so the range of ideal sizes would be between the point where it becomes single pane and its maximum usable size.</p>
<p>Ideally these properties could be set dynamically depending on the window content. For example, a spreadsheet with a lot of columns but few rows could have a wider ideal size than one with lots of rows.</p>
<p>Depending on apps using new system APIs can be challenging and slow — it’s not easy to move the entire ecosystem! However, we think there’s a good chance of success in this case, due to the simplicity and universal usefulness of the API.</p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>At the Brno hackfest in April we had an initial discussion with GNOME Shell developers about many of the technical details. There is tentative agreement that we want to move in the direction outlined in this post, but there’s still a lot of work ahead.</p>
<p>On the design side, the biggest uncertainty is the mosaic behavior — it’s a novel approach to window management without much prior art. That’s exciting, but also makes it a bit risky to jump head-first into implementation. We’d like to do user research to validate some of our assumptions on different aspects of this, but it’s the kind of project that’s very difficult to test outside of an actual prototype that’s usable day to day.</p>
<p>If you’d like to get involved with this initiative, one great way to help out would be to work on an extension that implements (parts of) the mosaic behavior for testing and refining the interactions. If you’re interested in this, please reach out :)</p>
<p>There’s no timeline or roadmap at this stage, but it’s definitely 46+ material and likely to take multiple cycles. There are individual parts of this that could be worked on independently ahead of the more contingent pieces, for example tiling groups or new window metadata. Help in any of these areas would be appreciated.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Specify UTF-8 as the default charset of the standard Java APIs. With this change, APIs that depend upon the default charset will behave consistently across all implementations, operating systems, locales, and configurations.</p>
<h2 id="Goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make Java programs more predictable and portable when their code relies on the default charset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarify where the standard Java API uses the default charset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardize on UTF-8 throughout the standard Java APIs, except for console I/O.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Non-Goals">Non-Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is not a goal to define new standard Java APIs or supported JDK APIs, although this effort may identify opportunities where new convenience methods might make existing APIs more approachable or easier to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no intent to deprecate or remove standard Java APIs that rely on the default charset rather than taking an explicit charset parameter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Standard Java APIs for reading and writing files and for processing text allow a <em>charset</em> to be passed as an argument. A charset governs the conversion between raw bytes and the 16-bit <code>char</code> values of the Java programming language. Supported charsets include, for example, US-ASCII, UTF-8, and ISO-8859-1.</p>
<p>If a charset argument is not passed, then standard Java APIs typically use the <em>default charset</em>. The JDK chooses the default charset at startup based upon the run-time environment: the operating system, the user's locale, and other factors.</p>
<p>Because the default charset is not the same everywhere, APIs that use the default charset pose many non-obvious hazards, even to experienced developers.</p>
<p>Consider an application that creates a <code>java.io.FileWriter</code> without passing a charset, and then uses it to write some text to a file. The resulting file will contain a sequence of bytes encoded using the default charset of the JDK running the application. A second application, run on a different machine or by a different user on the same machine, creates a <code>java.io.FileReader</code> without passing a charset and uses it to read the bytes in that file. The resulting text contains a sequence of characters decoded using the default charset of the JDK running the second application. If the default charset differs between the JDK of the first application and the JDK of the second application then the resulting text may be silently corrupted or incomplete, since the <code>FileReader</code> cannot tell that it decoded the text using the <em>wrong</em> charset relative to the <code>FileWriter</code>. Here is an example of this hazard, where a Japanese text file encoded in <code>UTF-8</code> on macOS is corrupted when read on Windows in US-English or Japanese locales:</p>
<pre><code>java.io.FileReader(“hello.txt”) -&gt; “こんにちは” (macOS)
java.io.FileReader(“hello.txt”) -&gt; “ã?“ã‚“ã?«ã?¡ã? ” (Windows (en-US))
java.io.FileReader(“hello.txt”) -&gt; “縺ォ縺。縺ッ” (Windows (ja-JP)</code></pre>
<p>Developers familiar with such hazards can use methods and constructors that take a charset argument explicitly. However, having to pass an argument prevents methods and constructors from being used via method references (::) in stream pipelines.</p>
<p>Developers sometimes attempt to configure the default charset by setting the system property <code>file.encoding</code> on the command line (i.e., <code>java -Dfile.encoding=...</code>), but this has never been supported. Furthermore, attempting to set the property programmatically (i.e., <code>System.setProperty(...)</code>) after the Java runtime has started does not work.</p>
<p>Not all standard Java APIs defer to the JDK's choice of default charset. For example, the methods in <code>java.nio.file.Files</code> that read or write files without a <code>Charset</code> argument are specified to always use UTF-8. The fact that newer APIs default to using UTF-8 while older APIs default to using the default charset is a hazard for applications that use a mix of APIs.</p>
<p>The entire Java ecosystem would benefit if the default charset were specified to be the same everywhere. Applications that are not concerned with portability will see little impact, while applications that embrace portability by passing charset arguments will see no impact. UTF-8 has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popularity_of_text_encodings#Popularity_on_the_World_Wide_Web">long been the most common charset on the World Wide Web</a>. UTF-8 is standard for the XML and JSON files processed by vast numbers of Java programs, and Java's own APIs increasingly favor UTF-8 in, e.g., the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#readString(java.nio.file.Path)">NIO API</a> and for <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/intl/internationalization-enhancements-jdk-9.htm#JSINT-GUID-5ED91AA9-B2E3-4E05-8E99-6A009D2B36AF">property files</a>. It therefore makes sense to specify UTF-8 as the default charset for all Java APIs.</p>
<p>We recognize that this change could have a widespread compatibility impact on programs that migrate to JDK 18. For this reason, it will always be possible to recover the pre-JDK 18 behavior, where the default charset is environment-dependent.</p>
<h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
<p>In JDK 17 and earlier, the default charset is determined when the Java runtime starts. On macOS, it is UTF-8 except in the POSIX C locale. On other operating systems, it depends upon the user's locale and the default encoding, e.g., on Windows, it is a codepage-based charset such as <code>windows-1252</code> or <code>windows-31j</code>. The method <code>java.nio.charsets.Charset.defaultCharset()</code> returns the default charset. A quick way to see the default charset of the current JDK is with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>java -XshowSettings:properties -version 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep file.encoding</code></pre>
<p>Several standard Java APIs use the default charset, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the <code>java.io</code> package, <code>InputStreamReader</code>, <code>FileReader</code>, <code>OutputStreamWriter</code>, <code>FileWriter</code>, and <code>PrintStream</code> define constructors to create readers, writers, and print streams that encode or decode using the default charset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <code>java.util</code> package, <code>Formatter</code> and <code>Scanner</code> define constructors whose results use the default charset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <code>java.net</code> package, <code>URLEncoder</code> and <code>URLDecoder</code> define deprecated methods that use the default charset.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We propose to change the specification of <code>Charset.defaultCharset()</code> to say that the default charset is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/charset/Charset.html#standard">UTF-8</a> unless configured otherwise by an implementation-specific means. (See below for how to configure the JDK.) The UTF-8 charset is specified by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt">RFC 2279</a>; the transformation format upon which it is based is specified in Amendment 2 of ISO 10646-1 and is also described in the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html">Unicode Standard</a>. It is not to be confused with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/io/DataInput.html#modified-utf-8">Modified UTF-8</a>.</p>
<p>We will update the specifications of all standard Java APIs that use the default charset to cross-reference <code>Charset.defaultCharset()</code>. Those APIs include the ones listed above, but not <code>System.out</code> and <code>System.err</code>, whose charset will be as specified by <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8264208"><code>Console.charset()</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="The-file-encoding-and-native-encoding-system-properties">The <code>file.encoding</code> and <code>native.encoding</code> system properties</h3>
<p>As envisaged by the specification of <code>Charset.defaultCharset()</code>, the JDK will allow the default charset to be configured to something other than UTF-8. We will revise the treatment of the system property <code>file.encoding</code> so that setting it on the command line is the supported means of configuring the default charset. We will specify this in an implementation note of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.html#getProperties()"><code>System.getProperties()</code></a> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <code>file.encoding</code> is set to <code>"COMPAT"</code> (i.e., <code>java -Dfile.encoding=COMPAT</code>), then the default charset will be the charset chosen by the algorithm in JDK 17 and earlier, based on the user's operating system, locale, and other factors. The value of <code>file.encoding</code> will be set to the name of that charset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <code>file.encoding</code> is set to <code>"UTF-8"</code> (i.e., <code>java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</code>), then the default charset will be UTF-8. This no-op value is defined in order to preserve the behavior of existing command lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treatment of values other than <code>"COMPAT"</code> and <code>"UTF-8"</code> are not specified. They are not supported, but if such a value worked in JDK 17 then it will likely continue to work in JDK 18.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prior to deploying on a JDK where UTF-8 is the default charset, developers are strongly encouraged to check for charset issues by starting the Java runtime with <code>java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 ...</code> on their current JDK (8-17).</strong></p>
<p>JDK 17 introduced the <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8265989"><code>native.encoding</code></a> system property as a standard way for programs to obtain the charset chosen by the JDK's algorithm, regardless of whether the default charset is actually configured to be that charset. In JDK 18, if <code>file.encoding</code> is set to <code>COMPAT</code> on the command line, then the run-time value of <code>file.encoding</code> will be the same as the run-time value of <code>native.encoding</code>; if <code>file.encoding</code> is set to <code>UTF-8</code> on the command line, then the run-time value of <code>file.encoding</code> may differ from the run-time value of <code>native.encoding</code>.</p>
<p>In <em>Risks and Assumptions</em> below, we discuss how to mitigate the possible incompatibilities that arise from this change to <code>file.encoding</code>, as well as the <code>native.encoding</code> system property and recommendations for applications.</p>
<p>There are three charset-related system properties used internally by the JDK. They remain unspecified and unsupported, but are documented here for completeness:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>sun.stdout.encoding</code> and <code>sun.stderr.encoding</code> — the names of the charsets used for the standard output stream (<code>System.out</code>) and standard error stream (<code>System.err</code>), and in the <code>java.io.Console</code> API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sun.jnu.encoding</code> — the name of the charset used by the implementation of <code>java.nio.file</code> when encoding or decoding filename paths, as opposed to file contents. On macOS its value is <code>"UTF-8"</code>; on other platforms it is typically the default charset.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Source-file-encoding">Source file encoding</h3>
<p>The Java language allows source code to express Unicode characters in a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se16/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.1">UTF-16 encoding</a>, and this is unaffected by the choice of UTF-8 for the default charset. However, the <code>javac</code> compiler is affected because it assumes that <code>.java</code> source files are encoded with the default charset, unless configured otherwise by the <code>-encoding</code> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/specs/man/javac.html#standard-options">option</a>. If source files were saved with a non-UTF-8 encoding and compiled with an earlier JDK, then recompiling on JDK 18 or later may cause problems. For example, if a non-UTF-8 source file has string literals that contain non-ASCII characters, then those literals may be misinterpreted by <code>javac</code> in JDK 18 or later unless <code>-encoding</code> is used.</p>
<p><strong>Prior to compiling on a JDK where UTF-8 is the default charset, developers are strongly encouraged to check for charset issues by compiling with <code>javac -encoding UTF-8 ...</code> on their current JDK (8-17). Alternatively, developers who prefer to save source files with a non-UTF-8 encoding can prevent <code>javac</code> from assuming UTF-8 by setting the <code>-encoding</code> option to the value of the <code>native.encoding</code> system property on JDK 17 and later.</strong></p>
<h3 id="The-legacy-default-charset">The legacy <code>default</code> charset</h3>
<p>In JDK 17 and earlier, the name <code>default</code> is recognized as an alias for the <code>US-ASCII</code> charset. That is, <code>Charset.forName("default")</code> produces the same result as <code>Charset.forName("US-ASCII")</code>. The <code>default</code> alias was introduced in JDK 1.5 to ensure that legacy code which used <code>sun.io</code> converters could migrate to the <code>java.nio.charset</code> framework introduced in JDK 1.4.</p>
<p>It would be extremely confusing for JDK 18 to preserve <code>default</code> as an alias for <code>US-ASCII</code> when the default charset is specified to be <code>UTF-8</code>. It would also be confusing for <code>default</code> to mean <code>US-ASCII</code> when the user configures the default charset to its pre-JDK 18 value by setting <code>-Dfile.encoding=COMPAT</code> on the command line. Redefining <code>default</code> to be an alias not for <code>US-ASCII</code> but rather for the default charset (whether <code>UTF-8</code> or user-configured) would cause subtle behavioral changes in the (few) programs that call <code>Charset.forName("default")</code>.</p>
<p>We believe that continuing to recognize <code>default</code> in JDK 18 would be prolonging a poor decision. It is not defined by the Java SE Platform, nor is it recognized by IANA as the name or alias of any character set. In fact, for ASCII-based network protocols, IANA encourages use of the canonical name <code>US-ASCII</code> rather than just <code>ASCII</code> or obscure aliases such as <code>ANSI_X3.4-1968</code> -- plainly, use of the JDK-specific alias <code>default</code> goes counter to that advice. Java programs can use the enum constant <code>StandardCharsets.US_ASCII</code> to make their intent clear, rather than passing a string to <code>Charset.forName(...)</code>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in JDK 18, <code>Charset.forName("default")</code> will throw an <code>UnsupportedCharsetException</code>. This will give developers a chance to detect use of the idiom and migrate to either <code>US-ASCII</code> or to the result of <code>Charset.defaultCharset()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Testing">Testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Significant testing is required to understand the extent of the compatibility impact of this change. Testing by developers or organizations with geographically diverse user populations will be needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers can check for issues with an existing JDK release by running with <code>-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</code> in advance of any early-access or GA release with this change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Risks-and-Assumptions">Risks and Assumptions</h2>
<p>We assume that applications in many environments will see no impact from Java's choice of <code>UTF-8</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On macOS, the default charset has been UTF-8 for several releases, except when configured to use the POSIX C locale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In many Linux distributions, though not all, the default charset is UTF-8, so no change will be discernible in those environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many server applications are already started with <code>-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</code>, so they will not experience any change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other environments, the risk of changing the default charset to <code>UTF-8</code> after more than 20 years may be significant. The most obvious risk is that applications which implicitly depend on the default charset (e.g., by not passing an explicit charset argument to APIs) will behave incorrectly when processing data produced when the default charset was unspecified. A further risk is that data corruption may silently occur. We expect the main impact will be to users of Windows in Asian locales, and possibly some server environments in Asian and other locales. Possible scenarios include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If an application that has been running for years with <code>windows-31j</code> as the default charset is upgraded to a JDK release that uses UTF-8 as the default charset then it will experience problems when reading files that are encoded in <code>windows-31j</code>. In this case, the application code could be changed to pass the <code>windows-31j</code> charset when opening such files. If the code cannot be changed, then starting the Java runtime with <code>-Dfile.encoding=COMPAT</code> will force the default charset to be <code>windows-31j</code> until the application is updated or the files are converted to UTF-8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In environments where several JDK versions are in use, users might not be able to exchange file data.  If, e.g., one user uses an older JDK release where <code>windows-31j</code> is the default and another uses a newer JDK where UTF-8 is the default, then text files created by the first user might not be readable by the second. In this case the user on the older JDK release could specify <code>-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</code> when starting applications, or the user on the newer release could specify <code>-Dfile.encoding=COMPAT</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Where application code can be changed, then we recommend it is changed to pass a charset argument to constructors. If an application has no particular preference among charsets, and is satisfied with the traditional environment-driven selection for the default charset, then the following code can be used <em>on all Java releases</em> to obtain the charset determined from the environment:</p>
<pre><code>String encoding = System.getProperty("native.encoding");  // Populated on Java 18 and later
Charset cs = (encoding != null) ? Charset.forName(encoding) : Charset.defaultCharset();
var reader = new FileReader("file.txt", cs);</code></pre>
<p>If neither application code nor Java startup can be changed, then it will be necessary to inspect the application code to determine manually whether it will run compatibly on JDK 18.</p>
<h2 id="Alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Preserve the status quo</em> — This does not eliminate the hazards described above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Deprecate all methods in the Java API that use the default charset</em> — This would encourage developers to use constructors and methods that take a charset parameter, but the resulting code would be more verbose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Specify UTF-8 as the default charset without providing any means to change it</em> — The compatibility impact of this change would be too high.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A difficult summer for the Starliner program continued this week, with Boeing reporting additional losses on the vehicle's development and NASA saying it's too early to discuss potential launch dates for the crewed spacecraft.</p>
<p>Throughout this spring, NASA and Boeing had been working toward a July launch date of the spacecraft, which will carry two astronauts for the first time. However, just weeks before this launch was due to occur, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/06/boeing-stands-down-from-starliner-launch-to-address-recently-found-problems/">Boeing announced</a> on June 1 that there were two serious issues with Starliner. One of these involved the "soft links" in the lines that connect the Starliner capsule to its parachutes, and the second problem came with hundreds of feet of P-213 glass cloth tape inside the spacecraft found to be flammable.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, as a part of its quarterly earnings update, <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2023-07-26-Boeing-Reports-Second-Quarter-Results">Boeing announced</a> that the Starliner program had taken a loss of $257 million "primarily due to the impacts of the previously announced launch delay." This brings the company's total write-down of losses on the Starliner program to more than $1.1 billion. Partly because of this, Boeing's Defense, Space, &amp; Security division reported a loss of $527 million during the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Because Starliner was funded by NASA through a fixed-price contract, as part of the Commercial Crew program, Boeing is responsible for any cost overruns and financial losses due to delays.</p>
<h2>Work progressing</h2>
<p>During a teleconference this week, NASA officials also provided the first substantial update on Starliner since the June 1 announcement. The agency's program manager for Commercial Crew, Steve Stich, said work is ongoing, but more remains to be done.</p>
<p>The identification of two serious problems so close to the spaceflight prompted NASA to take a broader look at Starliner and determine whether there might be other problems lurking in the spacecraft. "On the NASA side, we really stepped back and looked at all aspects of flight preparation," Stich said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>NASA, Boeing, and the parachute supplier, Airborne, have been working through the soft-link issue, he said. Engineering teams have identified a new type of joint that can meet NASA's safety requirements. However, Stich did not say the extent to which these new soft links have been field tested, nor how much of a test campaign is necessary to certify them for flight.</p>
<p>Technicians have also removed panels from inside the Starliner spacecraft to access the flammable tape. This glass cloth tape was wrapped around wiring inside the spacecraft to protect it from chafing and rubbing in flight. Stich said about three pounds of tape have been removed from Starliner so far.</p>
<p>"We've been able to remove a lot of that tape, and that work is progressing really well," Stich said. NASA and Boeing have identified a non-flammable replacement, he said.</p>
<h2>Schedule matters</h2>
<p>Asked whether Starliner might be able to launch this year, Stich did not offer a concrete timetable. "We're not really ready to talk about a launch opportunity yet," he said. "We're going to work the technical issues first, and then we'll sit down with the Boeing team when the time is right and pick a launch target."</p>
<p>Such an answer suggests that Starliner's launch on an Atlas V rocket, carrying NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore on a test flight to the International Space Station, may very well slip into 2024.</p>
<p>Stich made his comments Tuesday during a media teleconference to discuss the forthcoming Crew-7 mission on SpaceX's Crew Dragon vehicle. Nine years ago, when NASA down-selected to Boeing and SpaceX to provide crew transportation services to the space station, Boeing was considered the prohibitive favorite to deliver first for NASA. However, SpaceX will launch its seventh operational mission and eighth overall crew mission for NASA next month.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/tag/spacex-crew-8/">has already announced</a> that SpaceX will fly its Crew-8 mission for NASA in February or March of next year. Given the ongoing delays, it is now possible that Crew-9 flies next fall, before Boeing's first operational mission, Starliner-1. NASA has not named a full four-person crew for Starliner-1&nbsp;but has said that astronauts Scott Tingle and Mike Fincke will serve as commander and pilot.</p>

  <div data-hide-featured-media="0"><p><i><span>Initial dataset establishes a baseline for four important layers of open map data, including newly released open data for nearly 60 million places worldwide.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><b>SAN FRANCISCO, July </b><b>26</b><b>, 2023 </b><span>— The </span><a href="https://overturemaps.org/"><span>Overture Maps Foundation</span></a><span> (OMF),</span><span> a collaborative effort to enable current and next-generation interoperable open map products,</span><span> today announced the release of its first open map dataset.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The milestone Overture 2023-07-26-alpha.0</span> <span>release includes four unique data layers: Places of Interest (POIs), Buildings, Transportation Network, and Administrative Boundaries. These layers, which combine various sources of open map data, have been validated and conflated through a series of quality checks, and are released in the </span><a href="https://overturemaps.org/overture-maps-previews-data-schema-and-reference-system/"><span>Overture Maps data schema</span></a><span> which was released publicly in June 2023. The Places dataset includes data on over 59 million places worldwide and will be a foundational element of navigation, local search, and many other location-based applications. The datasets are available for download at </span><a href="https://overturemaps.org/download/"><span>https://overturemaps.org/download/</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Founded in December 2022 by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Meta, Microsoft, and TomTom, Overture today includes more than a dozen mapping, geospatial, and technology companies, including new members ESRI, Cyient, InfraMappa, Nomoko, Precisely, PTV Group, SafeGraph, Sanborn, and Sparkgeo. The collaboration is based on the premise that map data needs to be a shared asset to support future applications. As the requirements for accuracy, recency, and attribution in maps have grown to meet user needs, the costs and complexities of collecting and maintaining global map data have grown beyond the capability of any single organization.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The </span><span>Overture 2023-07-26-alpha.0</span> <span>release is a significant step in establishing a comprehensive, market-grade open map dataset for our constantly changing world. </span><span>The Places dataset, in particular, represents a major, previously unavailable open dataset, with the potential to map everything from new businesses big and small to pop-up street markets located anywhere in the world,”</span><span> said Marc Prioleau, executive director of Overture Maps Foundation. “Anyone who works in mapping knows that the initial data is just the beginning; the ongoing challenge lies in maintaining the data amidst constant changes to meet user expectations. Overture plans to build a broad collaboration that can build and maintain an up-to-date, comprehensive database of POIs.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the new dataset, there are four unique data layers.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Places of Interest</b><span>: OMF’s Places data layer includes over 59 million POI records that have not previously been released as open data. This dataset, derived from data contributed to OMF by founding members Meta and Microsoft, provides a significant baseline of worldwide places data. The Overture community will combine the best data from all available resources, including open government data, crowdsourced local mapping data, AI/ML techniques and more to improve, update and extend the data on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; The Places dataset is licensed under </span><a href="https://cdla.dev/permissive-2-0/"><span>CDLA Permissive v2.0</span></a><span>, a permissive open data license, and can be freely used by any map builders or location service providers.</span></li>
<li><b>Buildings</b><span>: The OMF’s Buildings layer includes over 780M unique buildings footprints worldwide. This layer has been developed by combining various open data projects including OpenStreetMap, Microsoft AI-Generated building footprints, and Esri.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Transportation</b><span>: The OMF’s Transportation layer represents a worldwide road network derived from data in the OpenStreetMap project. This community-built data has been recast into the Overture data format which provides consistent segmentation of the data and a linear reference system to support additions of data such as speed limits or real-time traffic.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Administrative Boundaries</b><span>: A global open dataset of national and regional administrative boundaries, this boundary data includes regional names which have been translated into over 40 different languages to support international use.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All data layers have been formatted in the OMF’s recently launched data schema, which is designed to allow map services developers to ingest and use map data in a standard, documented way and will be interoperable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>OMF is releasing the data publicly to solicit feedback from the public.&nbsp; Feedback can be submitted on </span><a href="https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data#data-release-feedback"><span>GitHub</span></a><span> or by email at </span><a href="mailto:data@ovewrturemaps.org"><span>data@overturemaps.org</span></a><span>. Future releases will integrate new sources of open data, further transformation of these data layers into the OMF schema, and implementation of the Global Entity Reference System, a system of stable IDs that allows data to be consistently added to features on the map.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sony-wins-pirate-site-blocking-order-against-dns-resolver-quad9-210621/">The injunction</a>, issued by the District Court of Hamburg, required the Swiss DNS resolver to block its users from accessing the site to prevent the distribution of pirated copies of Evanescence’s album “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bitter_Truth">The Bitter Truth</a>“.</p>
<h2>Quad9 Appeals Site Blocking Injunction</h2>
<p>The Quad9 Foundation <a href="https://www.quad9.net/news/blog/quad9-files-official-objection-opposing-sony-music-s-german-court-ruling/">fiercely opposed</a> the injunction. The not-for-profit foundation submitted an appeal hoping to overturn the blocking order, arguing that the decision set a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>The DNS resolver stressed that it doesn’t condone piracy but believes that enforcing blocking measures through third-party intermediaries, that don’t host any content, is a step too far.</p>
<p>This initial objection failed; the Regional Court in Hamburg <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/dns-resolver-quad9-loses-first-pirate-site-blocking-appeal-in-germany-211206/">upheld</a> the blocking injunction. However, this was only a preliminary proceeding and Quad9 promised to continue the legal battle, warning of a broad impact on the Internet ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Sony Starts Main Proceeding</h2>
<p>After Sony’s preliminary victory, the music company initiated a main proceeding at the Leipzig court. This was the next step in the legal process and allowed both sides to provide more evidence and expert opinions.</p>
<p>Sony, for example, referenced earlier jurisprudence where Germany’s Federal Court ruled that services such as YouTube <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/youtube-and-uploaded-could-be-liable-for-pirating-users-court-rules-220602/">can be held liable</a> for copyright infringement if they fail to properly respond to copyright holder complaints.</p>
<p>Quad9’s expert, Prof. Dr. Ruth Janal, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sony-vs-quad9-court-hears-landmark-dns-piracy-blocking-case-230209/">contested this line of reasoning</a>, noting that, under EU law, DNS resolvers shouldn’t be treated in the same fashion as platforms that actually host content.</p>
<h2>Court Confirms Blockade</h2>
<p>After hearing arguments from both sides, earlier this year the Regional Court of Leipzig handed a win to Sony. This means that Quad9 is required to block the music piracy site canna.to. If not, those responsible face a hefty fine, or even a prison sentence.</p>
<p>“The defendant is liable as a perpetrator because it makes its DNS resolver available to Internet users and, through this, it refers to the canna.to service with the infringing download offers relating to the music album in dispute,” the Court wrote.</p>
<p>Judge Werner argues that Quad9 should have taken action when the copyright holder alerted it to a pirated copy of the Evanescence album. Its intentional failure to act makes the DNS resolver liable.</p>
<h2>Quad9 Appeals</h2>
<p>Quad9 characterized the decision of the Leipzig Regional Court as absurd. In essence, it ruled that a DNS resolver can be held liable for the infringements of third-party websites. This is contrary to EU and German law, according to the foundation.</p>
<p>The DNS resolver sees itself as a neutral intermediary but the court’s judgment classified it as an actual wrongdoer. This is an “absurdly extreme” decision according to Quad9, which filed an appeal at the Dresden Higher Regional Court last month. </p>
<p>Under EU and German law, DNS providers should be classified as Internet access providers, not hosting platforms. As such, they shouldn’t be held directly liable for third-party infringements.</p>
<p>“[H]osting providers or platforms through which content is made available for retrieval via the Internet are fundamentally different in terms of their technical functionality and also the provider’s ability to influence content posted by customers to operate a DNS resolver,” the appeal filing reads.</p>
<h2>German Ruling, Global Blockade</h2>
<p>Quad9 was already heavily disappointed by the original court ruling but then a few weeks ago, the situation took another turn for the worse. </p>
<p>Sony wasn’t happy with the geo-blocking measures taken by the DNS provider to comply with the ruling. The music company applied for an administrative fine at the Regional Court in Hamburg, arguing that the measures were ineffective. </p>
<p>According to Sony, the blocked Canna.to (and the new canna-power.to domain) site could still be reached by Germans through a VPN. In addition, users of an unnamed mobile network were also able to access the site, presumably because their traffic was routed outside of Germany. </p>
<p>Facing a €10,000 administrative fine, Quad9 felt that it had no other option than to block the pirate site globally, across its entire service. </p>
<p>“The fact that the court issued a fine meant that we had to impose the blocking at the global level,” Quad9 <a href="https://www.quad9.net/news/blog/quad9-and-sony-music-german-injunction-update-for-july-2023">explains</a>. </p>
<p>The DNS provider doesn’t agree with the fine as it has zero control over how third parties may circumvent blocking measures. However, its hands are tied and a global blockade is the only solution now.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Quad9 hopes that the lower court’s blocking order will be overturned on appeal. It will continue to fight the case, even if that takes several years.</p>
<p>“Quad9 is prepared to continue the battle for freedom of access to information and Internet sovereignty. Cases like this are typically drawn out over the course of months and years. </p>
<p>“We hope that we will ultimately prevail as we consider it to be inappropriate and disproportionate to be required to roll out blocking based on a court decision in one country to result in a global block,” Quad9 concludes.</p>

Their dishes and corn masa, which they sell to other New York restaurants, are made with heirloom Mexican corn from small farms.</p><p>Wangeman, 31, believes tortillas made from that corn have gained a foothold because for many they evoke a “country flavor ... that taste of toasted corn” that is uniquely Mexican.</p><p>“When you use hybrid corn, genetically modified corn or whatever other option there is, it doesn’t give you that nostalgic flavor,” said Wangeman, who was born in the southern state of Oaxaca.</p><p>He was drawn to the corn by a chef friend who returned from a food fair raving about it. Wangeman got in touch with Tamoa, a company that since 2016 has promoted the heirloom corn grown by about 100 families in central and southern Mexico to foreign markets.</p><p>Across Mexico, about 60,000 tons of heirloom corn is produced annually. It’s a tiny fraction of the 23 million tons of white corn grown on an industrial scale to meet domestic demand for human consumption and the 16.5 million tons of yellow corn that Mexico imported last year — mostly from the U.S. — for industrial and animal feed use.</p><figure><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-07/230726-mexico-corn-mn-0942-e6171a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-07/230726-mexico-corn-mn-0942-e6171a.jpg 1x"><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/rockcms/2023-07/230726-mexico-corn-mn-0942-e6171a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-07/230726-mexico-corn-mn-0942-e6171a.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-07/230726-mexico-corn-mn-0942-e6171a.jpg" alt="Heirloom corn" height="1798" width="2500"></picture><figcaption><span>Heirloom corn accounts for 20 of the 50 acres on Jesus Vargas' farm in the central state of Tlaxcala.

But Rafael Mier, director of the Mexican Corn Tortilla foundation, said it’s clear exports of heirloom corn are growing based on the increasing number of tortillerías and restaurants buying it, especially in the U.S.</p><p>In Las Vegas, chef Mariana Alvarado said she began getting native corn through Tamoa and Los Angeles-based Masienda for tortillas, tostadas, tamales and the masa she sells in markets and online about four years ago.</p><p>At the time, she said, maybe 20 chefs in the U.S. used native corn — she estimates that’s now doubled.</p><p>Little by little, Alvarado said, she built a client list of Latinos and fans of Mexican cuisine looking for “organic, clean, healthy food.” She doesn’t believe this is a passing fad — in fact, she expects the distinction between Mexican food that uses modified corn and more authentic fare made with heirloom strains to grow.</p><p>“Smelling them, trying them — they realized that the taste is totally different from the tortillas they were used to here in a supermarket,” Alvarado said of U.S. customers.</p><p>This year, Alvarado pointed out,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eatyoli.com/" target="_blank">a Kansas City, Mo., tortilleria</a>&nbsp;that uses native Mexican corn won the Outstanding Bakery prize at the&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/hub/james-beard" target="_blank">James Beard</a>&nbsp;awards — the Oscars of the food world.</p><p>“We’re making noise as tortilla-makers here in the United States, bringing native corn,” Alvarado said.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

      Multiple reefs around the Florida Keys are now completely bleached or dead in a grim escalation that took place in as little as two weeks, coral experts told CNN.

      Extreme heat and a lack of rain and wind pushed water temperatures around Florida to some of the highest levels ever observed anywhere. A buoy in the Florida Bay hit 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit at a depth of 5 feet Monday,<strong> </strong>in an area where coral is scant. Many other stations in the area topped 96 degrees, including one that hit 99 degrees, according to the National Data Buoy Center.

      Coral is extremely sensitive to temperature changes. Temperatures that are too hot for too long cause coral to bleach and turn white as they expel their algal food source and slowly starve to death. The water is typically in mid-80s in the region, experts said.

      Temperatures at a reef managed by the Florida Aquarium were 91 degrees on July 6. The coral was completely healthy then, but when aquarium teams returned on July 19, all of the coral was bleached and an estimated 80% of it was dead. Another report from the Coral Restoration Foundation found <a href="https://www.coralrestoration.org/post/historic-heatwave-triggering-coral-die-off-in-florida" target="_blank">“100% coral mortality”</a> at Sombrero Reef off the coast of Marathon in the Florida Keys.

This is the underwater version of the trees in the rainforest disappearing. Corals serve that same fundamental role.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>Mold 2.0.0 is a new major release of our high-speed linker. With this release, we've transitioned our license from AGPL to MIT, aiming to expand the user base of our linker. This was not an easy decision, as those who have been following our progress know that we've been attempting to monetize our product through an AGPL/commercial license dual-licensing scheme. Unfortunately, this approach didn't meet our expectations. The license change represents our acceptance of this reality. We don't want to persist with a strategy that didn't work well.</p>
<p>As always, we welcome new GitHub sponsors. If you are happy with the license change, please consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/rui314">becoming a sponsor</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the license change, here is a list of updates we have made in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, mold could not produce an object file with more than 65520 sections using the <code>--relocatable</code> option. Now the bug has been fixed.

<li>mold now interprets <code>-undefined</code> as a synonym for <code>--undefined</code> instead of <code>-u ndefined</code>. This seems inconsistent, as <code>-ufoo</code> is generally treated as <code>-u foo</code> (which is an alias for <code>--undefined foo</code>), but this is the behavior of the GNU linkers and LLVM lld, so we prioritize compatibility over consistency.</li>
<li><code>-nopie</code> is now handled as a synonym for <code>--no-pie</code>.</li>
<li>[RISC-V] <code>R_RISCV_SET_ULEB128</code> and <code>R_RISCV_SUB_ULEB128</code> relocation types are now supported (<a data-hovercard-type="commit" data-hovercard-url="https://github.com/rui314/mold/commit/4bffe26bc0167f26c2bad0778f0f95e6be4809f2/hovercard" href="https://github.com/rui314/mold/commit/4bffe26bc0167f26c2bad0778f0f95e6be4809f2"><tt>4bffe26</tt></a>, <a data-hovercard-type="commit" data-hovercard-url="https://github.com/rui314/mold/commit/1ac5fe7c1e9678dca3c7e0bb0f96e1d20be969e5/hovercard" href="https://github.com/rui314/mold/commit/1ac5fe7c1e9678dca3c7e0bb0f96e1d20be969e5"><tt>1ac5fe7</tt></a>)</li>

            <p>
              I have a super power. I want to share it in this blog post so that
              you, my dear reader, also have it!
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the super power: I know that LLVM IR is text. Let me
              explain.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we hack on something, <em>usually</em> it is enough to study
              the source code. Whether we are implementing a new feature,
              hunting down a bug, or optimizing performance, usually the mapping
              between the source code and the resulting machine code is
              transparent enough that we can work on the level of our language,
              like Rust or Zig.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes though, you need to look deeper. For example, if you are
              optimizing binary size, the relation between the amount of source
              code and the length of the resulting ELF file is much less clear.
              The natural first answer when looking into these sorts of problems
              is to study the resulting binary. Tools like <code>nm</code>,
              <code>objdump</code> or even
              <a href="https://godbolt.org/">compiler explorer</a> come to mind.
              But in practice, working with raw disassembly is not efficient—it
              is too remote from the original source code, too target specific,
              too AT&amp;T syntax by default.
            </p>
            <p>
              What if… the next time you think to yourself “oh
              dear, I have to look at the assembly to solve this problem”,
              you think “wow, I can look at the LLVM IR to tackle
              this!”?
            </p>
            <p>
              LLVM IR is pretty low-level, so there’s a rather direct
              correspondence between IR instructions and generated assembly
              instructions. At the same time, LLVM IR is actually also
              high-level! It is somewhat target independent, it has better
              connection with the source code, and it is more human
              oriented—instruction names are usually obvious words, rather than
              cryptic mnemonics, variables are symbolic, rather than mapped to a
              finite number of registers, etc. And, the killer feature, LLVM IR
              has a standard, good, readable textual representation. You can
              read LLVM IR <em>without</em> studying the spec, and you can grep
              it. Recently, we’ve used a “grep llvm-ir” trick
              to make a dent in two different problems at TigerBeetle.

            <p>
              One performance bug that we have hit a few times in TigerBeetle is
              the problem of implicit memcopies. This is a problem that Rust and
              Zig both share—naive compilation of idiomatic code can introduce a
              bunch of local variable copies. Removing these copies requires
              some compiler smartness, and the work is underway in both
              <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2765">Zig</a> and
              <a href="https://arewestackefficientyet.com/">Rust</a> to implement
              relevant optimizations. While the smartness isn’t fully
              there yet, it’s on the programmer to write the code so that
              the compiled result is optimal with respect to copies.
            </p>
            <p>
              How do we use our new super power to solve the problem? Solving
              real problems is hard, so let’s invent a fake, simple
              problem first. Once we’ve solved that, we can move onto the
              real thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              One particular issue we fixed a couple of times in TigerBeetle is
              replacing by-value with by-pointer loops:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span><span>for</span> (<span>items</span>) <span>|</span><span>item</span><span>|</span> {
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>// -&gt; //
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span><span>for</span> (<span>items</span>) <span>|*</span><span>item</span><span>|</span> {
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              When compiling with optimizations, even older Zig versions such as
              0.9.1 often can eliminate the copy here, but this doesn’t
              always happen. We want to find cases where it doesn’t.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s try to weaponize this example. To do that, we need to
              create a surrounding context for the <code>for</code> loop which
              is as small as possible, but still shows the problem (ideally, in
              an obvious form).
            </p>
            <p>
              So let’s start with defining a gigantic struct with a small
              field:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span><span>const</span> <span>Big</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>ballast</span><span>:</span> [<span>4096</span>]<span>u8</span>,
</span></span><span><span>    <span>small</span><span>:</span> <span>Small</span>,
</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>const</span> <span>Small</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span>,
</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              We can now plug it into a <code>for</code> loop, which only uses a
              small part of the struct:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span><span>const</span> <span>xs</span><span>:</span> []<span>Big</span> <span>=</span> <span>todo</span>;
</span></span><span><span><span>for</span> (<span>xs</span>) <span>|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>use_small</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>x</span>.<span>small</span>);
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>use_small</span>(<span>small</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>Small</span>) <span>void</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>small</span>;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Note how I abstract a detail, the body of the
              <code>for</code> loop, into a function. To complete our example,
              we need to get the <code>xs</code> slice. We
              <em>could</em> manually initialize an array of some
              <code>Big</code> structs, but that’s cumbersome. When
              crafting minimal examples, we can use a standard trick to conjure
              anything out of thin air by defining a function that gets whatever
              is needed through parameters:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span><span>const</span> <span>Big</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span> {

</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>const</span> <span>Small</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span>,
</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>use_big</span>(<span>xs</span><span>:</span> []<span>Big</span>) <span>void</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>for</span> (<span>xs</span>) <span>|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span> {
</span></span><span><span>        <span>use_small</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>x</span>.<span>small</span>);
</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>

</span></span><span><span>    <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>small</span>;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              We are getting somewhere! Now we need to compile this to an actual
              artifact to get our LLVM IR. Because we are only interested in our
              <code>use_big</code> function, we better compile a
              <em>library</em>. But to also force Zig to compile anything, we
              need to mark our function as part of the library API, which means
              it must also follow the C ABI. So the complete minimal example can
              look like this:

              Hey, it’s still gibberish, but we were able to find our
              <code>use_big</code> function. And we even see
              <code>memcpy</code>! And that’s the thing I like about LLVM
              IR—I know very little about the x86_64 instruction set, and even
              less about LLVM IR, but I am able to muddle through
              <code>.ll</code> just because it is text.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking at the
              <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#llvm-memcpy-intrinsic">docs</a>
              for this LLVM intrinsic, we see that the third argument is the
              length. And, indeed, <code>i64 4100</code> looks like a big
              number, corresponding to <code>@sizeOf(Big)</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              So here’s the plan for our copy-finding tool—read the
              <code>.ll</code> file line-by-line, notice the current
              <code>define</code>, look for lines with <code>memcpy</code>, do
              some comma counting to find the third argument, and check it
              against a threshold.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point you might be wondering—why parse
              <code>.ll</code> line-by-line? Can we just, like, take an ll-file
              parser, parse that into a data structure, build a call-graph, and
              otherwise act like grown-up compiler engineers? I also wondered
              about it! I tried one <code>.ll</code> parsing library, but it
              required linking against LLVM and crashed on my
              <code>.ll</code> file, so I figured some text processing would be
              more robust for my purpose here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyway, the relatively self-contained tool can be found here:
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/ae3ed332815c95cde149fd0559976f16facdd8cc/src/copyhound.zig">copyhound.zig</a>. Feel free to use it yourself, like
              <a href="https://github.com/pkmn/engine/blob/389843619449bfdd23510a77a4545371c8d0a51b/src/tools/copies.zig">scheibo is already doing</a>!

            <p>
              So, was this useful? A bit! We haven’t fully productionized
              and put this into our CI, but some ad-hoc investigations uncovered
              a couple of curiosities. For example, a bunch of copies were
              traced back to the <code>std.meta.eql</code> function. This is an
              extremely cute Zig version of Rust’s
              <code>PartialEq</code> which compares two types by comparing every
              field, roughly like this:
            </p>

</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>true</span>;

            </div>
            <p>
              This is great for comparing “objects” with complex
              structure. But in TigerBeetle, very few things are such objects.
              <em>Most</em> of the things we work with are cache-line aligned
              bags-of-bytes without pointers or padding. And when we compare
              things, very often it is for assertions where we expect things to
              be equal most of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thinking about this use-case suggests a more elegant comparison
              algorithm—just compare the underlying bytes directly.
              Additionally, given that we carefully align all our data, the
              comparison routine can take advantage of that, and compare chunks
              of memory at the same time. And Zig is just <em>perfect</em> for
              implementing this kind of optimized comparison routine, because we
              can use comptime capabilities to <em>directly</em> express this
              optimally:

            <p>
              For fun, I also tried running copyhound on the Zig compiler
              itself, and it found
              <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/16438">a curious issue</a>!
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>AstGen.numberLiteral</code>, a function which parses numeric
              tokens into numeric values (that is,
              <code>"92"</code> to <code>92</code>) uses ten kilobytes
              of stack.
            </p>
            <p>
              The root cause was a slow path for parsing floating point numbers.
              Parsing floats is a surprisingly gnarly problem, because they are
              specified as base-10 in the source code, but the actual IEEE-754
              float value is base-2. So, while most simple values can be dealt
              with efficiently, sometimes a slow path is needed which in Zig
              requires a lot of stack space. And LLVM was happily inlining this
              slow path! Although the <em>code</em> for slow path was rarely
              executed, the function’s frame size would have to account
              for memory there every time. The fix was to mark the function in
              question as
              <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#setCold"><code>@setCold(true)</code></a>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="tracking-binary-size">Tracking Binary Size</h2>
            <p>
              After writing <code>copyhound</code>, I realized that it solves
              one other kind of copy problem as well!
            </p>
            <p>
              At TigerBeetle, we also care about binary size. Well, we are not
              <em>actively</em> trying to shrink the binary just yet, but we are
              keeping an eye on size. And Zig, like Rust and C++, has a
              potential gotcha here — it’s very easy to write source
              code that, while small in size on its own, uses comptime
              parameters that cause combinatorial explosion of the binary size,
              when the same function gets repeatedly monomorphized with
              different compile time parameters. A function like:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>f</span>(<span>comptime</span> <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span>, <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span>) <span>void</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              is duplicated in the machine code for every value of
              <code>T</code> it is actually used with.
            </p>
            <p>For the following example:</p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>f</span>(<span>comptime</span> <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span>, <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span>) <span>void</span> {
</span></span><span><span><span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span>;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>export</span> <span>fn</span> <span>g</span>() <span>callconv</span>(.<span>C</span>) <span>void</span> {
</span></span><span><span><span>f</span>(<span>i32</span>, <span>92</span>);
</span></span><span><span><span>f</span>(<span>f32</span>, <span>9.2</span>);
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>We get the following IR:</p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="llvm"><span><span><span>; Function Attrs: nobuiltin nounwind

</span></span><span><span><span>…</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              As you can see, the <code>f</code> is repeated twice. But because
              the repetition already exists at the LLVM IR level, we can look at
              this IR to find functions which contribute most to combinatorial
              explosion. To do this, we need to adjust our line-by-line
              processing of <code>.ll</code> files as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When we parse the <code>define</code> line, extract the
                polymorphic name of a function. This mostly amounts to removing
                generic arguments between <code>()</code> from the function
                name.
              </li>
              <li>
                Instead of looking for memcpy calls, just count the total number
                of lines comprising the body of each function.
              </li>
              <li>Group by extracted name, summing up the total size.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is the same idea that
              <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-llvm-lines">cargo-llvm-lines</a>
              uses for Rust. That’s a theme—any trick you do with LLVM IR
              would work for any LLVM-based language.
            </p>
            <p>
              Did this find any curiosities? You bet! Turns out, one of the most
              bloated functions in TigerBeetle was the code responsible for:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>$ tigerbeetle version --verbose
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              In verbose mode, this outputs compile-time configuration for
              TigerBeetle, using the following function:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>print_value</span>(
</span></span><span><span>    <span>writer</span><span>:</span> <span>anytype</span>,
</span></span><span><span>    <span>comptime</span> <span>field</span><span>:</span> []<span>const</span> <span>u8</span>,
</span></span><span><span>    <span>comptime</span> <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>anytype</span>,
</span></span><span><span>) <span>!</span><span>void</span> {
</span></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              As you see, it is monomorphized for each field name and value. But
              there’s no need for that! The following works and shaves off
              300 bytes from the release binary:
            </p>
            <div>
              <pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>print_value</span>(

            </div>
            <p>Let’s recap the tricks from the post:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                LLVM IR in many cases can be a convenient substitute for
                assembly.
              </li>
              <li>
                When debugging something related to compilers, it’s
                important to first come up with a minimal program to experiment
                with.
              </li>
              <li>
                You don’t need to write a whole program with
                <code>main</code>, you can write a single function which accepts
                everything needed as an argument.
              </li>
              <li>
                To compile just a single function, you can compile a library
                (but don’t forget to make the function public).
              </li>
              <li>
                Any compiler which uses LLVM should have a way to produce a
                textual file with LLVM IR; look for a
                <code>--emit-llvm</code> argument.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can open the resulting <code>.ll</code> file in a text
                editor and <code>Ctrl+F</code> functions names you are

      [wei] Ensure Origin Trial enables full feature
    </p>

    <div><pre>This CL moves the base::Feature from content_features.h to
a generated feature from runtime_enabled_features.json5.

This means that the base::Feature can be default-enabled
while the web API is controlled by the RuntimeFeature, which will
still be default-disabled.

An origin trial can enable the RuntimeFeature, which will
allow full access to the API, provided the base::Feature is also
enabled (see change to origin_trial_context.cc).

Meanwhile, the base::Feature can be disabled through Finch as a
kill-switch for the whole feature, and prevent origin trials
from turning the feature on.

Tests have been added to WebView test, as it allowed for easy
spoofing of responses on a known origin.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p><img width="980" height="551" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/Toxic_google-980x551.jpg" alt="Why Vivaldi browser thinks that google's new Web-Environment-Integrity specification is highly dangerous." decoding="async" itemprop="image"></p><p>​Google seems to love creating specifications that are terrible for the open web and it feels like they find a way to create a new one every few months. This time, we have come across some controversy caused by a new Web Environment Integrity spec that Google seems to be working on.</p>



<p>​At this time, I could not find any official message from Google about this spec, so it is possible that it is just the work of some misguided engineer at the company that has no backing from higher up, but it seems to be work that has gone on for more than a year, and the resulting spec is so toxic to the open Web that at this point, Google needs to at least give some explanation as to how it could go so far.</p>



<h2>What is Web Environment Integrity? It is simply dangerous.</h2>



<p>​The spec in question, which is described at <a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md">https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md</a>, is called Web Environment Integrity. The idea of it is as simple as it is dangerous. It would provide websites with an API telling them whether the browser and the platform it is running on that is currently in use is trusted by an authoritative third party (called an attester). The details are nebulous, but the goal seems to be to prevent “fake” interactions with websites of all kinds. While this seems like a noble motivation, and the use cases listed seem very reasonable, the solution proposed is absolutely terrible and has already been equated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a> for websites, with all that it implies.</p>



<p>​It is also interesting to note that the first use case listed is about ensuring that interactions with ads are genuine. While this is not problematic on the surface, it certainly hints at the idea that Google is willing to use any means of bolstering its advertising platform, regardless of the potential harm to the users of the web.</p>



<p>​Despite the text mentioning the incredible risk of excluding vendors (read, other browsers), it only makes a lukewarm attempt at addressing the issue and ends up without any real solution.</p>



<h2>So, what is the issue?</h2>



<p>Simply, if an entity has the power of deciding which browsers are trusted and which are not, there is no guarantee that they will trust any given browser. Any new browser would by default not be trusted until they have somehow demonstrated that they are trustworthy, to the discretion of the attesters. Also, anyone stuck running on legacy software where this spec is not supported would eventually be excluded from the web.</p>



<p>​To make matters worse, the primary example given of an attester is Google Play on Android. This means Google decides which browser is trustworthy on its own platform. I do not see how they can be expected to be impartial. </p>



<p>On Windows, they would probably defer to Microsoft via the Windows Store, and on Mac, they would defer to Apple. So, we can expect that at least Edge and Safari are going to be trusted. Any other browser will be left to the good graces of those three companies.</p>



<p>​Of course, you can note one glaring omission in the previous paragraph. What of Linux? Well, that is the big question. Will Linux be completely excluded from browsing the web? Or will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_(company)">Canonical</a> become the decider by virtue of controlling the snaps package repositories? Who knows. But it’s not looking good for Linux.</p>



<p>​This alone would be bad enough, but it gets worse. The spec hints heavily that one aim is to ensure that real people are interacting with the website. It does not clarify in any way how it aims to do that, so we are left with some big questions about how it will achieve this.</p>



<p>Will behavioral data be used to see if the user behaves in a human-like fashion? Will this data be presented to the attesters? Will accessibility tools that rely on automating input to the browser cause it to become untrusted? Will it affect extensions? The spec does currently specify a carveout for browser modifications and extensions, but those can make automating interactions with a website trivial. So, either the spec is useless or restrictions will eventually be applied there too. It would otherwise be trivial for an attacker to bypass the whole thing.</p>



<h2>Can we just refuse to implement it? </h2>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s not that simple this time. Any browser choosing not to implement this would not be trusted and any website choosing to use this API could therefore reject users from those browsers. Google also has ways to drive adoptions by websites themselves. </p>



<p>First, they can easily make all their properties depend on using these features, and not being able to use Google websites is a death sentence for most browsers already. </p>



<p>Furthermore, they could try to mandate that sites that use Google Ads use this API as well, which makes sense since the first goal is to prevent fake ad clicks. That would quickly ensure that any browser not supporting the API would be doomed.</p>



<h2>There is hope.</h2>



<p>There is an overwhelming likelihood that <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en">EU</a> law will not allow a few companies to have a huge amount of power in deciding which browsers are allowed and which are not. There is no doubt that attesters would be under a huge amount of pressure to be as fair as possible. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, legislative and judicial machineries tend to be slow and there is no saying how much damage will be done while governments and judges are examining this. If this is allowed to move forward, it will be a hard time for the open web and might affect smaller vendors significantly.</p>



<p>It has been long known that Google’s dominance of the web browser market gives them the potential to become an existential threat to the web. With every bad idea they have brought to the table, like <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/no-google-vivaldi-users-will-not-get-floced/">FLOC</a>, <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/heads-up-googles-going-off-topics-again/">TOPIC</a>, and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/articles/user-agent-client-hints/">Client Hints</a>, they have come closer to realizing that potential. </p>



<p>Web Environment Integrity is more of the same but also a step above the rest in the threat it represents, especially since it could be used to encourage Microsoft and Apple to cooperate with Google to restrict competition both in the browser space and the operating system space. It is imperative that they be called out on this and prevented from moving forward.</p>



<p>​While our vigilance allows us to notice and push back against all these attempts to undermine the web, the only long-term solution is to get Google to be on an even playing field. Legislation helps there, but so does reducing their market share. </p>



<p>Similarly, our voice grows in strength for every Vivaldi user, allowing us to be more effective in these discussions. We hope that users of the web realize this and choose their browsers consequently.</p>



<p>​The fight for the web to remain open is going to be a long one and there is much at stake. Let us fight together.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Smartphones should be banned from schools to tackle classroom disruption, improve learning and help protect children from cyberbullying, a UN report has recommended.</p><p>Unesco, the UN’s education, science and culture agency, said there was evidence that excessive mobile phone use was linked to reduced educational performance and that high levels of screen time had a negative effect on children’s emotional stability.</p><p>It said its call for a smartphone ban sent a clear message that digital technology as a whole, including artificial intelligence, should always be subservient to a “human-centred vision” of education, and never supplant face-to-face interaction with teachers.</p><p>Unesco warned policymakers against an unthinking embrace of digital technology, arguing that its positive impact on learning outcomes and economic efficiency could be overstated, and new was not always better. “Not all change constitutes progress. Just because something can be done does not mean it should be done,” it concluded.</p><p>With more learning moving online, especially in universities, it urged policymakers not to neglect the “social dimension” of education where students receive face-to-face teaching. “Those urging increasing individualisation may be missing the point of what education is about,” it said.</p><p>“The digital revolution holds immeasurable potential but, just as warnings have been voiced for how it should be regulated in society, similar attention must be paid to the way it is used in education,” said Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay.</p><p>She added: <em>“</em>Its use must be for enhanced learning experiences and for the wellbeing of students and teachers, not to their detriment. Keep the needs of the learner first and support teachers. Online connections are no substitute for human interaction.”</p><p>Unesco said in the <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000385723" data-link-name="in body link">report</a> that countries needed to ensure they had clear objectives and principles in place to ensure digital technology in education was beneficial and avoided harm, both to individual students’ health, and more widely to democracy and human rights, for instance through invasion of privacy and stoking of online hatred.</p><p>Excessive or inappropriate student use of technology in the classroom and at home, whether smartphones, tablets or laptops, could be distracting, disruptive and result in a detrimental impact on learning, it said. It cited large-scale international assessment data that indicated a “negative link” between excessive use of digital technology and student performance.</p><p>Although technology could potentially open up opportunities for learning for millions, the benefits were unequally spread, with many poorer people from around the world effectively excluded, it said. A digital educational infrastructure was expensive, and its environmental costs often underestimated.</p><p>There was little robust research to demonstrate digital technology inherently added value to education, Unesco said in its 2023 Global Education Monitor report. Much of the evidence was funded by private education companies trying to sell digital learning products. Their growing influence on education policy around the world was “a cause for concern”, it added.</p><p>Countries were “waking up to the importance of putting learners first” when it came to digital technology, said Unesco. It cited China, which it said has set boundaries for the use of digital devices as teaching tools, limiting them to 30% of all teaching time, with students expected to take regular screen breaks.</p><p>It accepted that online learning “stopped education melting down” when schools and universities closed during Covid-19 lockdowns. It estimated that more than a billion students globally moved to online learning during the pandemic – but added that millions of poorer students without internet access were left out.</p><p>Based on its analysis of 200 education systems around the world, Unesco estimated one in four countries had banned smartphones in school, either through law or guidance. These included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/11/france-to-ban-mobile-phones-in-schools-from-september" data-link-name="in body link">France</a>, which introduced its policy in 2018, and the Netherlands, which will bring in restrictions from 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/04/mobile-phones-other-devices-to-be-banned-from-dutch-classrooms" data-link-name="in body link">Announcing the ban</a> this month, the Dutch education minister, Robbert Dijkgraaf, said: “Students need to be able to concentrate and need to be given the opportunity to study well. Mobile phones are a disturbance, scientific research shows. We need to protect students against this.”</p><p>In the UK, the former education secretary Gavin Williamson called for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jun/29/education-secretary-wants-ban-on-mobile-phones-in-english-schools#:~:text=The%20education%20secretary%2C%20Gavin%20Williamson,the%20impact%20of%20the%20pandemic." data-link-name="in body link">mobile phone ban in schools </a>in 2021 as part of a crackdown on poor student discipline but this was dismissed as a “distraction” by education unions who said schools had had smartphone use policies in place for years.</p><p>UK secondary schools’ smartphone policies vary as they are a decision for individual headteachers. They typically ensure phones are switched off and not visible while on the school site, and can be used in the classroom only with the permission of the teacher. Misuse of phones or other digital devices on school premises can lead to confiscation and sanctions such as detention.</p><p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The majority of schools will already have robust policies about mobile phones in place. In most cases pupils will either be prohibited entirely from using them during the school day or restricted to only using them in certain circumstances.</p><p>“Banning mobile phones entirely from school premises would raise some practical concerns, for example for parents wanting to contact their children while travelling between school and home. Some pupils will also use phones as payment methods on public transport.”</p><p>He added: “We completely understand the legitimate concerns around the use of mobile phones, including cyberbullying, the impact of extended screen time on mental health, and the lack of regulation of big technology companies. The fact is though that the widespread use of smartphones is a societal issue and problems that result from this are more likely to arise outside of the school gates.”</p><p>The Department for Education was approached for comment.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <link>https://www.pagetable.com/?p=39</link>
            <guid>36875816</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:19:07 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.pagetable.com/?p=39">https://www.pagetable.com/?p=39</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36875816">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			<p>The original NMOS version of the MOS 6502, used in computers like the Commodore 64, the Apple II and the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), is well-known for its illegal opcodes: Out of 256 possible opcodes, 151 are defined by the architecture, but many of the remaining 105 undefined opcodes do useful things.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.viceteam.org/plain/64doc.txt">Many</a> <a href="http://www.ffd2.com/fridge/docs/6502-NMOS.extra.opcodes">articles</a> <a href="http://members.chello.nl/taf.offenga/illopc31.txt">have</a> <a href="http://www.oxyron.de/html/opcodes02.html">been</a> <a href="http://bbc.nvg.org/doc/6502OpList.txt">written</a> to test and document these, but I am not aware of any article that tries to explain where exactly they come from. I’ll do this here.</p>
<h3>The Block Diagram</h3>
<p>Every 6502 data sheet comes with a block diagram, but these are of no use, because they are oversimplified, partially incorrect, and don’t explain how instruction decoding works. The following more detailed diagram is a lot more useful:</p>

<h3>The Decode ROM (PLA)</h3>
<p>There is no need to understand the whole diagram. The important part is on the left: The instruction register, which holds the opcode, and the current clock cycle within the instruction (T0 to T6) get fed into a 130×21 bit decode ROM, i.e. a ROM with 130 lines of 21 bits each. On the die shot, this is the green area on the bottom.</p>

<p>While other CPUs from the same era used microcode to interpret the instruction, the 6502 had this 130×21 bit PLA. All lines of the PLA compare the instruction and the current clock cycle, and if they match, the line fires. A little simplified, every line looks like this:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="8"><b>ON bits</b></td>
<td colspan="8"><b>OFF bits</b></td>
<td colspan="6"><b>timing</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>7</i></td>
<td><i>6</i></td>
<td><i>5</i></td>
<td><i>4</i></td>
<td><i>3</i></td>
<td><i>2</i></td>
<td><i>1</i></td>
<td><i>0</i></td>
<td><i>7</i></td>
<td><i>6</i></td>
<td><i>5</i></td>
<td><i>4</i></td>
<td><i>3</i></td>
<td><i>2</i></td>
<td><i>1</i></td>
<td><i>0</i></td>
<td><i>T6</i></td>
<td><i>T5</i></td>
<td><i>T4</i></td>
<td><i>T3</i></td>
<td><i>T2</i></td>
<td><i>T1</i></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>(See the diagrams at <a href="http://impulzus.sch.bme.hu/6502/letolt.php3">http://impulzus.sch.bme.hu/6502/</a> for details; partial English translation of the website <a href="http://www.downloads.reactivemicro.com/Public/Electronics/Reverse%20Engineering/">here</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>“ON bits”</b> specifies, which bits need to be <b>set</b> for this line to fire.</li>
<li><b>“OFF bits”</b> specifies, which bits need to be <b>clear</b> for this line to fire.</li>
</ul>
<p>The opcode table of the 6502 is laid out in a way that you can find easy rules to generalize the effects of similar opcodes. For example, the branch opcodes are encoded like this:</p>
<pre>%aab10000</pre>
<p>where “aa” is the condition (00=N, 01=V, 10=C, 11=Z) and “b” decides whether the branch is taken on a set or a clear flag.</p>
<p>So the following line would fire on the first cycle of any branch:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="8"><b>ON bits</b></td>
<td colspan="8"><b>OFF bits</b></td>
<td colspan="6"><b>timing</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>7</i></td>
<td><i>6</i></td>
<td><i>5</i></td>
<td><i>4</i></td>
<td><i>3</i></td>
<td><i>2</i></td>
<td><i>1</i></td>
<td><i>0</i></td>
<td><i>7</i></td>
<td><i>6</i></td>
<td><i>5</i></td>
<td><i>4</i></td>
<td><i>3</i></td>
<td><i>2</i></td>
<td><i>1</i></td>
<td><i>0</i></td>
<td><i>T6</i></td>
<td><i>T5</i></td>
<td><i>T4</i></td>
<td><i>T3</i></td>
<td><i>T2</i></td>
<td><i>T1</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>From now on, let’s write it differently, so that it’s more readable:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><b>mask</b></td>
<td><b>cycle</b></td>
<td><b>description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>XXX10000</td>
<td>T1</td>
<td>T1 of Bcc: fetch branch offset</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>If a line fires, it outputs a “1”. The “Random Control Logic” that can seen in the diagram then AND/OR-combines some lines and feeds the result into various components of the CPU: In the case of a branch, this would result in fetching the branch offset, for example.</p>
<p>One line can fire for several opcodes that are similar in their encoding and thus their behavior: For example, “LDA abs”, “ORA abs” and “AND abs” all do the same thing (fetch the low byte of the address) in T1, so there can be a line that matches all these opcodes and causes a memory fetch and a PC increment. Also, multiple lines can fire at the same time for any given cycle within an instruction, which will have the combined effect of the single lines.</p>
<h3>LDA and LDX becomes LAX</h3>
<p>Now there are many undefined opcodes. The designers of the 6502 have not created any specific PLA lines for them, but since their opcodes are similar to well-defined opcodes, there might be lines that fire nevertheless.</p>
<p>Let’s take opcode $AF for example, which is “LAX absolute”. It loads a value from an absolute address in memory and stores it in A and X at the same time. This is somewhat the combination of opcodes $AD (LDA abs) and $AE (LDX abs).</p>
<p>The instructions “LDA/LDX/LDY abs” ($AC/$AD/$AE) consist of four cycles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first cycle fetches the low byte of the address.</li>
<li>The second cycle fetches the hgh byte of the address.</li>
<li>The third cycle fetches the address from memory and stores it in A/X/Y.</li>
<li>The fourth cycle fetches the next instruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cycles T1, T2 and T4 are identical for all three of them, and they are encoded smilarly, so the following three PLA lines can be used to detect these instructions and signal the rest of the CPU to carry out the specific tasks:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><b>mask</b></td>
<td><b>cycle</b></td>
<td><b>description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101011XX</td>
<td>T1</td>
<td>T1 of $AC/$AD/$AE: fetch addr/lo</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101011XX</td>
<td>T2</td>
<td>T2 of $AC/$AD/$AE: fetch addr/lo</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101011XX</td>
<td>T4</td>
<td>T4 of $AC/$AD/$AE: fetch next opcode</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The mask %101011XX doesn’t only fire for $AC/$AD/$AE, but also for the undefined opcode $AF: So $AF (LAX) behaves the same as LDA/LDX/LDY in T1/T2/T4, i.e. it fetches a 16 bit address and in the end fetches the next opcode.</p>
<p>T3 differs in all three cases, so it has to be handled by one separate line per case:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><b>mask</b></td>
<td><b>cycle</b></td>
<td><b>description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10101100</td>
<td>T3</td>
<td>T3 of $AC: read into Y</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101011X1</td>
<td>T3</td>
<td>T3 of $AD: read into A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1010111X</td>
<td>T3</td>
<td>T3 of $AE: read into X</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>(Actually, the lines in the actual PLA might be less specific, i.e. contain more X bits, since there are similar instructions like “ORA absolute” that might share this line.)</p>
<p>The line for $AC is only true for the exact value of $AC, but the $AD and $AE lines have one “don’t care” bit each. The bitfield of $AF, which is %10101111, is true for both masks, so in T3 of $AF, both the $AD and the $AE lines fire.</p>
<p>In T3, LDA/LDX/LDY have in common that they all read from memory and put the result onto the internal “SB” bus. “LDA” also sets the “SB-&gt;AC” control line to “1”, which will make the accumulator read its value from SB. Likewise, LDX causes “SB-&gt;X” to be “1” and makes X to read from the SB bus, and LDY reads SB into the Y register.</p>
<p>Since both the LDA and the LDX lines fire, both the accumulator and the X register will be sent the command to load their values from the SB bus, so $AF is effectively an LAX: Load Accumulator and X.</p>
<h3>The KIL Opcodes</h3>
<p>There are many “KIL” opcodes, i.e. opcodes that stop the CPU, so that it can only recover using a RESET, and not even an IRQ or an NMI.</p>
<p>In order to understand this, let’s look at the different states an instruction can be in. After the instruction fetch, the CPU is in cycle T1. It will feed the opcode and the cycle number into the PLA and cause the rest of the CPU to carry out whatever has to be done in this cycle, according to the PLA. Then it will shift the T bitfield left by one, so the T2 line will be “1”, then line T3 and so on. There are seven T lines total, T1 to T7. At the end of each instruction, the PLA causes the T bitfield to reset, so that the next instruction starts with T1=1 again.</p>
<p>But what happens if T does not get reset? This can happen if in all seven states of T, no line fires that actually belongs to an instruction that ends at this cycle. T gets shifted left until state T7, in which another shift left will just shift the 1 bit out of T – all bits of T will be zero then, so no PLA line can fire any more.</p>
<p>All interrupt and NMI requests are always delayed until the current instruction is finished, i.e. until T gets reset. But since T never gets reset, all interrupts and NMIs are effectively disabled.</p>
<h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>There are many illegal opcodes, some with very weird behavior, and some that have been documented as unstable. Studying all these can reveal many interesting details about the internal design of the 6502.</p>

<p>Software development has to be funded somehow.
Unfortunately, it is hard to sell software like physical products because it does not have the built-in copy protection that physical products have.
Any artificial copy protections added to software are ineffective if users should have full control of their own computers.
Therefore funding has to be done in a different way.</p>

<p>The existing methods of funding software have their problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay to download or for other services: Not worth it; users can find the software somewhere else and they don't need your other services.</li>
<li>Accepting donations: Why would you pay if you don't get anything for your money?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1Sub.dev</strong> tries to solve this by letting developers cooperate to give users more for their money.
The user subscribes to a developer of their choice and in return, all developers (and everyone else who wants to) can give that user some kind of benefit, like giving them access to downloads or other resources.
Simply, from the effort of subscribing to one, you get the benefit of subscribing to all.</p>

<p><a href="https://1sub.dev/about/how-it-works">Read more about how it works.</a></p>

<h2>Why this is better than the alternatives</h2>

<ul>
<li>You don't have to make separate payments for each program you use. Just subscribe to one developer and you get access to everything.</li>
<li>Do you need to use some software but you don't want to or can't give that developer money? Don't worry, you choose who you want to subscribe to. Nobody can see who you are subscribing to.</li>
<li>You are anonymous and this system doesn't handle any money, just the information about who is subscribing to who. Users are identified by an account number.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Are you a developer?</h2>

<p>We are looking for developers (companies or individuals) of Free and Open Source software who want to join this cooperation.
Are you one of them?
Do you believe in this solution?
You can contact me at 1sub@robalni.org and we can try to make it happen.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stackdiary.com/web-environment-integrity/">https://stackdiary.com/web-environment-integrity/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36875226">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
							
<p>In recent news, Google has put forth a proposal known as the "<a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web Environment Integrity Explainer</a>", authored by four of its engineers. </p>



<p>On the surface, it appears to be a comprehensive effort to enhance trust and security in the digital landscape. However, as with many sweeping technological proposals, it's not without controversy. </p>



<p>The tech community, <a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially on GitHub</a>, has raised several eyebrows and voiced significant criticism. </p>



<p>Mozilla has just come out to say that <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/852#issuecomment-1648820747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they oppose this proposal</a>, <em>"Detecting fraud and invalid traffic is a challenging problem that we're interested in helping address. However this proposal does not explain how it will make practical progress on the listed use cases, and there are clear downsides to adopting it."</em></p>



<h3>The Core Proposal: A Trust-Privacy Trade-off?</h3>



<p>Google's proposal pivots on a key premise: enhancing trust in the client environment. It introduces a new API that allows websites to request a token, providing evidence about the client code's environment. Google's engineers elaborate, <em>"Websites funded by ads require proof that their users are human and not bots...Social websites need to differentiate between real user engagement and fake engagement...Users playing online games want assurance that other players are adhering to the game's rules."</em> </p>



<p>However, the critics argue that the quest for trust may come at the expense of privacy. While Google ensures that the tokens will not include unique identifiers, critics fear that this system, if misused, could lead to unwarranted surveillance and control.</p>



<h3>Veiled DRM and the Threat to Open Web</h3>



<p>The proposed API, while framed as a tool for fostering trust, could potentially be used to control user behavior on the web. Some critics fear it could be a covert introduction of Digital Rights Management (DRM) into web pages, making ad-blocking near impossible. </p>



<p>This not only impacts user experience but also raises concerns about net neutrality and the open nature of the web. As one critic aptly questioned, "Could this be a veiled attempt at introducing DRMs for web pages, making ad-blocking near-impossible in the browser?"</p>



<h3>Monopolization Fears: Who Controls the Attesters?</h3>



<p>A significant concern stemming from the tech community is the potential for monopolistic control. By controlling the "attesters" that verify client environments, Google, or any other big tech company, could potentially manipulate the trust scores, thereby deciding which websites are deemed trustworthy. This opens up a can of worms regarding the democratic nature of the web. </p>



<p>As one GitHub user commented, "This raises a red flag for the open nature of the web, potentially paving the way for a digital hierarchy dominated by a few tech giants."</p>



<h3>What About Browser Modifications and Extensions?</h3>



<p>Google's proposal remains ambiguous about its impact on browser modifications and extensions. It attests to the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack without restricting the application’s functionality. </p>



<p>However, how this plays out with browsers that allow extensions or are modified remains a grey area. As the proposal vaguely mentions, "Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, it does not restrict the indicated application’s functionality."</p>



<h3>Unanswered Questions and The Path Forward</h3>



<p>The proposal leaves several questions unanswered and open for discussion. For instance, it doesn't clearly address how it will prevent the signal from being used to exclude vendors. Google's engineers write, <em>"Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser who wishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements."</em> </p>



<p>However, it's unclear how these baseline requirements will be set and who will enforce them.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while Google's proposal is a technically sophisticated attempt to enhance trust on the web, its potential implications for user privacy and the open nature of the web cannot be ignored. The tech community's concerns highlight the need for a balanced approach that doesn't compromise on either trust or privacy. </p>



<p>It's crucial that the tech community continues to engage in these debates to ensure that the future of the web is shaped by openness, privacy, and freedom rather than control and surveillance.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-trying-to-kill-the-open-web">Google is trying to kill the Open Web.</h2>
<p>Using the proposed “Web Environment Integrity” means websites can select on
which devices (browsers) they wish to be displayed, and can refuse service
to other devices. It binds client side software to a website, creating a
silo’d app.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md" title="Web Environment Integrity on GitHub" rel="external">Web Environment Integrity on GitHub</a>
<p>This penalizes platforms on which the preferred client side software is not
available.</p>
<p>This is an issue for accessibility and inclusion, in particular when the reason
the software is not available is tied to the needs of marginalized groups, such
as when poverty makes it impossible to own sufficiently modern devices, etc.</p>
<p>“Web Environment Integrity” is a deeply #antisocial proposal, and goes counter
to the design principles of the web.</p>
<p>In all honesty, this move by Google is hardly surprising. They’ve been trying to
capture the web as their own platform for a long time. This is just the latest
battle.</p>
<p>But it also marks a particularly perverse point, in how the proposal admits it
exists primarily to extract value from people. People mining at its worst.</p>
<p>Remember when their motto was “Don’t be Evil?”</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="analysis-of-the-proposal">Analysis of the Proposal</h2>
<p>Some details on the proposal may help here.</p>
<p>The proposal suggests that websites should be able to request an attestation
from the browser about its “integrity”. Such attestations are to be provided
by external agents, which – presumably – examine the browser and its plugins,
and issue an approval only if those checks pass.</p>
<p>The attestation is sent back to the website, which can now decide to deny
service if the agent did not give approval.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, this is to ensure <em>for the user</em> that the environment has not been
tampered with in any way. The described use cases, however, make fairly clear
that it is <em>for the business</em> that this feature exists.</p>
<p>In particular, the proposal suggests that “Google Play” could provide such
attestations, and also provides an example case which intends to ensure that
ads are served only to legitimate users, not to automated processes.</p>
<p>These two points are not raised together. But put them together, and you find
the following underlying problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Advertisers want to reduce costs.</li>
<li>Website owner wishes to display ads.</li>
<li>Google’s ad network charges per <em>impression</em>.</li>
<li>Bots create impressions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The proposal effectively provides a solution for Google’s advertising problem,
and tries to couch it in more user friendly terms. The above scenario is the
closest to a problem they describe outright.</p>
<p>The solution, expressed in the proposal, is to exclude bots via attestations,
such that ads generate impressions only with logged-in Google Play users.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>In general, bots are pretty easy to exclude. They usually advertise themselves
by a user agent string. Yes, that can be faked – but it seems highly unlikely
that bots using faked user agents create such a large number of impressions that
Google has to use this route against them. If I look at my own webserver logs,
it’s very clear which are bot requests <em>just from the log information</em>.</p>
<p>If bots are not the actual problem, then what is?</p>
<p>The agent providing the attestation is free to use whichever means to approve
or disapprove of a browser. That includes examining whether the browser runs
ad blockers.</p>
<p>Given how advertising networks track users, and user tracking is a practice
that comes under increasing criticism, ad blockers are also gaining in
popularity. Security experts regularly recommend the use of ad blockers as
a cyber security measure – as ads can be used to side-load malware into an
otherwise legitimate website.</p>
<p>What Google is really after is ad blockers.</p>
<h3 id="problems">Problems</h3>
<p>The downside of this approach is that it opens up a door for arbitrary abuse.
Websites can refuse service unless you install their proprietary data collection
agent. Websites can refuse service if you use the wrong browser – we’d enter
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" title="browser wars" rel="external">browser wars</a>
of the late 90s, with renewed effort.</p>
<p>The day this proposal gets accepted is the day the Open Web is set back by
decades.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300151244/the-future-of-the-internet-and-how-to-stop-it/" title="The Future of the Internet -- And How to Stop It" rel="external">The Future of the Internet -- And How to Stop It</a>,
Jonathan Zittrain lays out, starting with the telephone network, that there
exist “appliances” and “generative systems”.</p>
<p>An “appliance” works like any other household appliance, like a toaster. It
has one primary function, and all other functions it may offer are at best
mild variations of the primary one. It toasts.</p>
<p>Zittrain lists the PC and the internet as examples of generative systems.
Generative systems are not necessarily as complete in functionality as an
appliance – they provide some basic functionality, but with no specific
primary purpose. The purpose is left to the user. Another way of phrasing
this is to call these things tools, or crafting materials.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s worth pointing out the text of the above image at this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Open Web is a collection of user-developed, non-proprietary frameworks
for building services, emphasizing interoperability and the balance of data
access and ownership between providers and end-users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generative systems are significantly more impactful than appliances precisely
because they leverage the user’s imagination to address their own needs. They
crowdsource meaning at global scale. This is what makes the internet so
powerful.</p>
<p>Attestations from an agent doing arbitrary things effectively turns the web
into an appliance – or, to be more specific, it turns the browser into an
extension of an appliance website.</p>
<p>Of course website owners are free to build appliances. They already are doing
so. But this reduces the usefulness of “the web” step by step, until the
generative open web is lost. We’re already seeing the negative effects of this,
and technology like the proposed would only accelerate the trend.</p>
<p>Google does not need to mind. The inexorable logic of capitalism means that
businesses that managed to build upon a generative system to rise, now have
to turn that same system into an appliance for their own needs, or risk being
open to competition.</p>
<h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>
<p>The reactions to the post were diverse, and it’s worth addressing a few.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>This does not imply accessibility or inclusion issues!</strong> – Yes and no.
No, in principle this technology does not <em>cause</em> accessibility issues. But
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" title="pareto principle" rel="external">pareto principle</a> implies that effort
should be spent on 20% of the browser market because that captures 80% of the
users – and cost effectiveness then mandates that the remaining 20% of users
should be ignored, because they’ll cost too much to support.
<br>
That is exactly the worry here. Marginalized groups which need specialized
browser – for example with good screen reader capability, or capable of
running on cheaper/older devices – will effectively be excluded by rational
business logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Worry about access, not about technology!</strong> – The argument is that good
regulatory frameworks will legally mandate access, so that should be the
focus.
<br>
This is true, but not enough. The two problems with this line of thinking are
that first, good regulatory frameworks are rare. And part of the reason for
that is the second problem, namely that technology moves faster than the law.
<br>
Which means that worrying about access <em>instead</em> of technology will still
exclude marginalized groups in practice. What is required instead is to
worry about technology in the short term, and regulation in the long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It is legitimate for businesses to wish to protect their interests.</strong> –
That is a debatable point. Businesses “protecting their interests” to the
detriment of people is not legitimate. But within the bounds of that, sure,
why not.
<br>
Here’s the problem, though: the internet and open web are <em>generative
systems</em>, which means the reason they have a positive impact is because
people can decide how to use them. The moment this decision making power
is curtailed, the system shifts towards an <em>appliance</em>.
<br>
If businesses protect their interests by reducing a former generative
system to an appliance, by definition this is to the detriment of people,
and no longer legitimate.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>2023-07-21</strong>: After raising <a href="https://github.com/w3c/PWETF/issues/306">a code of conduct violation</a>
for the proposal with the W3C’s group responsible for said code, I was
rightly told that they are not responsible (TL;DR, see the link). I then
sent an email to the ombudspeople at W3C which I’ll reproduce here:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>From jens@OBFUSCATED Fri Jul 21 17:23:38 2023
Date: Fri, 21 Jul 2023 17:23:38 +0200
From: "Jens Finkhaeuser" &lt;jens@OBFUSCATED&gt;
To: ombuds@w3.org
Subject: Web Environment Integrity proposal

Dear Ombudspeople of the W3C,

I wish to raise concerns about the behaviour of the people working on
the Web Environment Integrity proposal, as well as the proposal
itself.

https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/

In particular, I would like to draw your attention to isuse #131 in
their working repository:

https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues/131

The group working on this claims to adhere to the W3C Code of Ethics
and Professional Conduct. However, as documented in this issue, they
violate said code.

As a bit of background, WEI is a deeply unethical proposal that
suggests to use cryptographic means to permit websites to deny
services to users based on arbitrary user metadata. Such metadata
is to be processed by agents running on the user's machine, which
provide attestations about the browser environment.

One such proposed service is Google Play, which has access to personal
identifiable information (PII). This turns the proposal into a
technological mechanism for discrimination.

The community has raised and is raising issues about the ethics of
such a proposal, which led me to find the W3C code of ethics.
Unfortunately, as was pointed out to me, the code of ethics does not
concern the content of proposals - merely the conduct of participants.

Unfortunately, some maintainers of the repository have taken to
closing issues raised by the community -- the fourth bullet point in
the "participant" explanation of the code ("Anyone from the Public
partaking in the W3C work environment (e.g. commenting on our specs,
(...)"). This violates several points in section 3.1 of the same
document, whereby use of reasonable means to process diverse views are
required.

It seems to be the case that this proposal has not yet made it to a
W3C group. However, its maintainers already violate the W3C code of
ethics in practice in the run-up to such an activity. In the meantime,
even though the code is not directly applicable to the proposal
contents, it nonetheless violates said code in spirit.

It seems appropriate that W3C does not permit this proposal to go ahead
in any formal fashion.

Kind regards,
  Jens Finkhaeuser

<li>
<p><strong>2023-07-22</strong>: Google has now closed the ability to contribute to the
repository, including by raising or commenting on issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2023-07-26 #1</strong>: Apple has already shipped a similar API for about a year.
As described on the Apple developer blog, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=huqjyh7k">Private Access Tokens</a>
implement pretty much the same mechanism as Google’s WEI.</p>
<p>There are a few notable differences in <em>tone</em>, however. The first is a direct
quote from the above blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: When you send token challenges, don’t block the main page load.
Make sure that any clients that don’t support tokens still can access
your website!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This note is not doing anything in itself, but it <em>does</em> stand in stark
contrast to the motivations documented in WEI. In particular, the proposal
suggests that private access tokens should be used instead of e.g. CAPTCHAs
or other, more disruptive authentication mechanisms.</p>
<p>The second important difference is in the actual details of the proposal.
It states that the token issuer is an external web service rather than some
opaque process running on the user’s machine. Suggested are some CDN
providers’ services. The clear message of intent here is that this is
supposed to be a mechanism by which CDNs authenticate a request to the
source.</p>
<p>The protocol by which this is to be done is defined by the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/privacypass/about/">IETF PrivacyPass Working Group</a>.
Reading through <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-privacypass-protocol-11.html">the protocol draft</a>,
it furthermore becomes clear that the data the client is supposed to send
to the issuer is… nothing but the challenge sent by the server, in an
obfuscated (hashed) manner.</p>
<p>This leads to two conclusions.</p>
<ol>
<li>No personal data is being leaked.</li>
<li>There is no checking of the “environment”, aka the browser and its plugins,
that can prevent some browsers from receiving an attestation.</li>
</ol>
<p>While Private Access Token attestations can <em>still</em> be used to undermine the
open web simply by forcing browsers to start adopting this or risk exclusion,
this attestation approach <em>could not be more different in its fundamental
function</em> from Google’s WEI if it tried.</p>
<p>Is it still a bad idea? Maybe. But if so, it’s an entirely different, far
friendlier ball game.</p>

<p><strong>2023-07-26 #2</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/852#issuecomment-1648820747">Mozilla has taken a stance against WEI</a>
writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mozilla opposes this proposal because it contradicts our principles and
vision for the Web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s something, at least.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2023-07-26 #3</strong>: As a honourable mention, the maintainer of the Google
repository has published a <a href="https://blog.yoav.ws/posts/web_platform_change_you_do_not_like/">personal blog post about their experience</a>,
which contains some fair and some unfair bits.</p>
<p>However, one of the points bears commenting on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t assume a hidden agenda</p>
<p>When thinking about a new proposal, it’s often safe to assume that Occam’s
razor is applicable and the reason it is being proposed is that the team
proposing it is trying to tackle the use cases the proposal handles. While
the full set of organizational motivations behind supporting certain use
cases may not always public (e.g. a new device type not yet announced,
legal obligations, etc), the use cases themselves should give a clear enough
picture of what is being solved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few comments to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given that Apple’s mechanism is undergoing IETF standardization, the only
reason for an opposing mechanism is that the existing approach does not
fulfil Google’s needs.</li>
<li>Google <em>clearly</em> states its needs in its use cases. There is no hidden
agenda that people complain about, but rather the agenda as it is stated
clearly in plain text.</li>
</ol>
<p>This comment actually <em>confirms</em> the community’s worst fears.</p>
</li>
