<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Last week US Steel announced it was </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/japans-nippon-steel-plans-acquire-us-steel-7-bln-nikkei-2023-12-18/" rel="">being acquired</a><span> by Japanese steel company Nippon Steel. The milestone gives an opportunity to look back at what once was the largest and most important company in the US (and arguably the world), and how it slowly declined. Prior to the acquisition announcement, US Steel had a market cap of around $8 billion, not even enough to put it in the Fortune 500 (it would come in at around #690, slightly below the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Roadhouse" rel="">Texas Roadhouse</a><span> restaurant chain).</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-140174766" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/no-inventions-no-innovations-a-history#footnote-1-140174766" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> Over its lifespan, the company slowly but steadily lost market share and importance. When it was formed in 1901, it was by far the largest company in the world, and produced nearly 2/3rds of American steel. Today, it makes just 12% of American steel, around a third of the steel that it made in 1955, and employs around the same number of people as online pet retailer </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)" rel="">Chewy</a><span>.</span></p><p>How did a once mighty industrial titan fall so far? Let’s take a look.</p><p>By the turn of the 20th century, the American steel industry had eclipsed Britain to be the largest and most efficient in the world. In 1896, an engineer for the Pennsylvania Steel Company wrote that “within the last decade America has made marvelous developments in her iron industry, until she now leads the world in the quantity of her products and bows to none in their quality”. Relentless competitors like Andrew Carnegie of Carnegie Steel had, in the course of expanding their steelmaking capacity and acquiring market share, steadily driven down the price of steel, which fell by more than 80% between 1870 and 1896.</p><p>But these successes had come at a cost. Steel production was subject to very large economies of scale - the larger your blast furnaces, and the more Bessemer converters and open hearth furnaces you operated, the cheaper making steel became. And because of the high fixed costs of these facilities, producers were incentivized to keep them full, cutting prices to just above the marginal cost of production in times of low demand. The result was chronic overcapacity and as steelmakers built ever-larger facilities and tried to underprice each other - at the end of the 19th century, nearly half of steelmaking capacity in the US went unused each year.</p><p><span>There was thus a growing desire for consolidation of the industry. If many competing firms were combined, production volumes of the new firm would rise and duplicate plant could be eliminated, enabling even greater economies of scale and lowered costs. The instigating event for such a merger was a&nbsp;banquet of bankers and industrialists in 1900, where Carnegie Steel president Charles Schwab spoke of the potential benefits of industry rationalization via merger. Less than 4 months later, it was done. Organized by JP Morgan, a new company was created by combining Carnegie Steel and Federal Steel, along with a hodgepodge of smaller companies including National Steel, American Sheet Steel, and American Hoop.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-140174766" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/no-inventions-no-innovations-a-history#footnote-2-140174766" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The new company, US Steel, was a monster. The first company to be worth more than $1 billion, the company had 168,000 employees and produced just under 9 million tons of steel annually, over 60% of all the steel in the US. And it quickly grew even larger. By 1917 US Steel (now up to 268,000 employees) was more than </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2017/09/19/americas-top-50-companies-1917-2017/?sh=378273e16295" rel="">3 times as large</a><span> as the next largest company, AT&amp;T, and had more than 7 times as many employees as Standard Oil when </span><a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,871865,00.html" rel="">it was broken up</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The decades prior to the formation of US Steel were characterized by cutthroat competition, but that ended with the formation of US Steel. The head of the new company, Judge Elbert Gary, was a fundamentally conservative businessman, and his desire was to bring stability to what was a cyclical and chaotic industry. Whereas previously companies like Carnegie Steel would constantly cut prices to achieve greater market share and drive their competitors out of business, Gary set (generally) higher prices, and kept them high even as demand for steel fluctuated. Though its size did give it production cost advantages, these savings were retained as higher profits rather than passed on to the consumer. Gary was, according to former managing director of Carnegie Steel James Gayley, “opposed to the old method of going out into the market and slashing prices in order to get business”. To maintain prices in the face of fluctuating demand, Gary would gather the industry’s leadership together in regular “</span><a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,728689,00.html" rel="">Gary Dinners</a><span>”, where price levels would be agreed upon and Gary would “exhort the chairmen, presidents, or other major owners of steel companies to maintain rank”. Those who refused to cooperate would be “disciplined” by the others. Many former Carnegie Steel executives, schooled in the intense competition of the Carnegie years, were allergic to this strategy, and departed for other steel companies.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png" width="606" height="451" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:451,&quot;width&quot;:606,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F007ea525-dd47-4ec3-afea-f04bcfa28ccc_606x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via Temin 1964 and USGS</figcaption></figure></div><p>Gary proved adept at navigating the company through a cultural climate that was increasingly hostile towards potential monopolies. Under his leadership, the company successfully fought off a Justice Department lawsuit to break up the company as an illegal monopoly. (Perversely, the court ruled that the Gary Dinners proved that US Steel did not have the power to set prices, and thus couldn’t be a monopoly). But other threats proved harder to cope with. US Steel was consistently behind on adopting the latest steelmaking technology, and was often forced to license technologies from more forward-looking companies (some of which were run by former Carnegie men). A 1936 magazine article described early US Steel company policy as “No inventions; no innovations”.</p><p>In 1902, for instance, a man named Henry Grey invented what was known as a “Universal Beam Mill”. At the time, beams were made in the shape of an uppercase I, with a tall vertical web capped with narrow flanges at the top and the bottom. If you wanted wider flanges capable of carrying heavier loads, you would need to weld or rivet steel plates to the beam, an expensive and time-consuming process. The Universal Mill made it possible to roll wide-flange beams in a single operation, eliminating the process of attaching extra steel plates. Grey first brought his mill design to US Steel, but it was rejected by the finance committee. Instead, the first Universal Mill in the US was built by Bethlehem Steel, run by former Carnegie president Charles Schwab. Faced with declining market share in the growing construction steel market (which made heavy use of wide-flange steel beams), US Steel was ultimately forced to license the Universal Mill from Bethlehem in 1926.</p><p>The same pattern repeated for other new technologies. In the 1920s, technology for making large-diameter pipe by electrical resistance welding was invented. Though it was (supposedly) first offered to US Steel, the company again passed, only to adopt it several years later to keep up with its competitors. Around the same time, technology for continuous rolling of wide sheets of steel was invented, which greatly reduced production costs. US Steel had investigated continuous sheet rolling as early as 1902, but had abandoned its efforts. Instead, it was once again forced to license the technology from others to remain competitive (though in fairness, it was one of the first manufacturers to license it).</p><p>More generally, US Steel’s enormous size made it unwieldy and difficult to manage. It took time for information to filter up through the many layers of management between the factory floor and company leadership, and to get all of the disparate operations of the company moving in the same direction. This, on top of the fundamental conservative culture created by Gary, and the lack of top management talent as former Carnegie executives abandoned the company, caused US Steel to steadily lose market share to its more agile rivals. The company continued to grow, but other companies grew faster. By 1941 US Steel’s output had risen to nearly 30 million tons of steel annually, triple what it made when it was founded, but its market share had fallen from over 60% to around 35%.</p><p><span>At the end of WWII, the American steel industry was an unchallenged juggernaut. During the war, American steel production had risen by more than a third, while the steel industries of most other countries had been nearly wiped out. By 1945, America was producing over 60% of the world’s steel. American steelmakers had the latest technology, unparalleled expertise, the largest economies of scale, and easy access to resources such as iron ore and coal. In 1945, the president of the US Steel Export Company George Wolf testified before congress that “the European steel industry is still far behind that of the United States, product, quality, and cost wise”, and that the gap was “an ever-widening one”. Japan, which would later emerge as a steel juggernaut, wasn’t even on the radar, producing just </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/27157/chapter-abstract/196566880?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="">0.56 million tons</a><span> in 1946 against America’s 66 million tons. US Steel continued to dominate the industry, producing more than twice as much steel as the next largest company (Bethlehem Steel), and averaging around 30% of American steel output in the mid-1950s.</span></p><p>With seemingly no rivals on the horizon, American steel companies, including US Steel, became complacent. The post-war years are sometimes described as the “dodo period” of the American steel industry, as it steadily raised prices (steel prices rose at 7% annually between 1947 and 1957) and enjoyed large profits while ignoring the progress that was taking place in other parts of the world.</p><p><span>As American steelmakers built new capacity to meet post-war demand (by 1962 American steel capacity reached 154 million tons annually, nearly twice the production at the end of WWII), they did so using existing steelmaking technology, primarily the open hearth furnace. In an open hearth furnace, a combination of liquid pig iron from a blast furnace and steel scrap is placed in a large crucible, which is then heated using burning gas blown through a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_heat_exchanger" rel="">regenerative heat exchanger</a><span>. In 1954, over 90% of steelmaking capacity in the US was open hearth furnaces, with the balance a mix of electric arc furnaces and Bessemer converters.</span></p><p>But in 1952, a new steelmaking technology appeared, the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF). The BOF was in a sense a refinement of the earlier Bessemer converter, the first technology for mass-producing steel. Whereas the Bessemer converter worked by blowing air through liquid pig iron from below, the BOF worked by blowing pure oxygen into pig iron from above. Oxygen furnaces had been conceived as early as the mid-19th century, but weren’t feasible to build until pure oxygen began to be made on an industrial scale in the 20th century.</p><p>The open hearth furnace replaced Bessemer converters because the latter was difficult to control, tended to result in nitrogen-embrittled steel, and was limited in the types of ore it could use. But open hearths came with drawbacks. They were more expensive to build, ran slower, and required much more fuel than Bessemer converters. Only cheap scrap metal, which could be remelted in an open hearth furnace along with liquid pig iron, made them economical to operate.</p><p>The BOF, by contrast, had many of the benefits of the Bessemer converter (rapid conversion of iron to steel, low fuel and labor costs, comparatively cheaper to build) while eliminating many of its drawbacks (nitrogen embrittlement, limitations on types of ore it could use).</p><p>The first commercial BOF was built in Austria in 1952, and diffused through the industry as other companies experimented with it. By the end of the 1950s, it was clear that the BOF could produce steel more cheaply than the open hearth furnace (and in fact, no new open hearth integrated steelworks were built in the US after 1958).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png" width="540" height="345" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:345,&quot;width&quot;:540,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa32d9817-2b08-471b-8016-6a13cd9b2c40_540x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>But US Steel was once again slow to adopt the technology. Reluctant to abandon expensive open hearths that had years of useful life left, as late as 1962 US Steel executives were arguing that open hearth steel would remain competitive.

By the time US Steel built its first BOF, the BOF was producing around 17% of steel in the US, compared to around 55% of steel in Japan.</p><p>And the BOF wasn’t the only steel technology where Japan was pushing ahead of America. In pursuit of ever-larger economies of scale, Japan went far beyond the US in the size of its blast furnaces. By the mid-1970s, average blast furnace size at Nippon Steel was 4 times the average at US Steel, and by 1977 more than half the blast furnaces in Japan had a volume of more than 2000 cubic meters, compared to just 2.6% of furnaces in the US. When US Steel had trouble with its own large blast furnace at its Gary Works, it was eventually forced to turn to the Japanese for help, who by then had much more experience than Americans operating very large furnaces.</p><p>A similar trajectory occurred with continuous casting technology, which produced continuous slabs of steel instead of individual ingots, and thus eliminated much of the rolling required for steel production. Though US firms pioneered much of this research, other countries adopted it more quickly. By 1975, only 9% of steel was continuously cast in the US, compared to 31% in Japan and 24% in West Germany. Here again, US Steel lagged, and didn’t widely adopt continuous casting until the early 1990s.</p><p>Thus, by the early 1960s cracks in America’s seemingly unassailable steel industry were beginning to show. Foreign producers like Japan had expanded their industries and adopted the newest steelmaking technology like the BOF and continuous casting. American steelmakers like US Steel, saddled with outdated technology and high labor costs, found themselves under threat from foreign producers for the first time. By 1958 some steelmakers in Germany and Japan were able to compete on price with US producers, and by the mid-1970s input costs for Japanese steel (ore, labor, coking coal, etc.) were nearly half those of US costs. Between 1955 and 1970 steel imports to the US increased by more than factor of 10, going from less than 2% of US production to more than 15%, and continued to rise.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png" width="733" height="463" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:463,&quot;width&quot;:733,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F785d8481-3ce4-4033-a877-cdca332604e9_733x463.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>In the face of foreign pressure, US Steel could no longer maintain the “price leadership” it had in the past, setting whatever price it wanted and encouraging the rest of the industry to follow suit.

Its annual output of steel was just over 27 million tons, less than it had produced in 1941, and its share of the US market had fallen to around 24%.</span></p><p>The American steel industry responded to the rise of foreign producers not by trying to improve their operations, but by demanding government protection from “unfair” foreign trade practices. In 1968, steel producers in Japan and Europe, at the behest of President Lyndon Johnson, agreed to artificially restrict their steel exports to the US. This was intended to give US producers “breathing room” to modernize their facilities and improve operations, though this didn’t occur (in fact, capital investment by American steelmakers declined after the agreements). And though pressure had been temporarily removed, things were about to get much worse for US Steel and the American steel industry.</p><p><span>Having temporarily fended off foreign threats, American steel production continued to climb. In 1973, right around when Hyman Roth was boasting that their mafia operations were “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmxluz27Q-4" rel="">bigger than US Steel</a><span>”, America produced 137 million tons of steel, more than any other country in the world. While not the unrivaled behemoth it once was, US Steel was still the </span><a href="https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/full/1973/" rel="">13th largest company in the US</a><span> by revenue, and the largest steelmaker in the US.</span></p><p>It was widely predicted that demand for steel would continue to rise, as it had for most of the 20th century. In 1972, chairman of US Steel Edwin Gott predicted that worldwide demand for steel would rise 25% by 1980. Countries around the world expanded their steelmaking capacity in anticipation.</p><p>Instead, demand for steel stagnated. Between 1973 and 1984 worldwide demand for steel was essentially flat, and in industrialized countries it declined by around 25%. Steelmakers around the world, faced with large amounts of excess capacity, were incentivized to sell steel for just above the variable costs of production, “dumping” it on foreign markets. It’s somewhat unclear if such dumping actually occurred, but steel imports to the US continued to rise through the 1970s even as overall demand dropped. And US Steel was hurt most of all - nearly all of the loss in market share to foreign steelmakers came at the expense of US Steel.</p><p><span>American producers once again demanded government protection from foreign competition. They filed dozens of “antidumping” cases under the Trade Act of 1974, and secured other protectionist measures such as a “</span><a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/1982/ec-19820517-the-steel-trigger-price-mechanism" rel="">trigger price mechanism</a><span>” in 1978 (which prevented foreign steelmakers from selling below their total costs of production) and a new round of voluntary export restrictions in 1984.</span></p><p>These measures helped stave off foreign competition - steel imports declined from 26 million tons in 1984 to 17 million tons in 1989. But they couldn’t stop a threat that was emerging from within the US: the minimill.</p><p>Historically, steel had been produced in large, integrated steelworks. Iron ore would be turned into pig iron in a blast furnace, which would then be turned into steel in an open hearth or basic oxygen furnace. From there, the steel would be cast into ingots or slabs and then rolled into various shapes - wire, rods, plate, beams, sheets, and so on.</p><p>But in the late 1960s, a new type of steelmaking facility began to appear, the minimill. The minimill made steel not by processing iron ore, but by remelting scrap steel in an electric arc furnace. By eliminating the blast furnaces which turned iron ore into pig iron, minimills were not only much cheaper to build than integrated steelworks (as little as 1/10th the cost per ton of steel they produced), but they could profitably be built much smaller. And the scrap steel they required was widely available thanks to the previous transition to the BOF, which used much less scrap than the open hearth it replaced.</p><p>Because scrap steel was often contaminated with other metals such as copper that couldn’t be easily separated, minimill steel was initially lower quality than BOF steel, and minimills were only competitive in products where such quality didn’t matter, like concrete reinforcing steel. But as minimill technology improved, they began to take more and more share from large, integrated steelmakers like US Steel. Between 1974 and 1994 steelmaking capacity of integrated producers fell by more than 50%, while the capacity of minimills increased by 360%, reaching 30% of American steelmaking capacity.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

It cut tens of thousands of jobs and closed dozens of plants, reducing employment from 171,000 in 1979 to less than 21,000 in 1995. It divested many of its auxiliary operations like mines, warehouses, and bridge construction. It abandoned market segments like rebar and heavy structural steel where it couldn’t compete with the minimills, and instead focused on things like sheet steel products (which minimills still had trouble with), concentrating operations in a small number of large plants. By 1985, US Steel had closed more than 150 facilities, and by 1998 its steelmaking capacity was down 71% from its peak in 1973.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png" width="780" height="298" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:298,&quot;width&quot;:780,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13528ee3-31f2-4990-896b-8b5e2712bb3b_780x298.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>(US Steel was far from the only integrated producer that needed to take such drastic steps.

As imports continued to rise (reaching 37% of US production in 1998), and minimills continued to take market share (electric arc furnaces reached 47% of US production by 2000), US Steel survived where many of its competitors didn’t. Kaiser Steel, the company that had beaten US Steel to the punch in installing BOFs, closed shop in 1983 after 18 quarters of losses.

US Steel didn’t adopt the minimill until 2020, when it acquired a minimill company and built its own minimill in Alabama. (Minimills now produce around 25% of US Steel’s domestic output.)

It was created as a fundamentally conservative reaction to the vicissitudes of the steel industry, and this guided its early years and shaped its culture. The economies of scale it achieved were never passed on to the consumer, and instead it used its size to bully other steelmakers and extract money from consumers. When this stopped working, it used its political influence to prevent consumers from buying low-cost foreign steel. Improving the efficiency of its operations was something it did as a last resort when left with no other options.</p><p>The company’s large size made it unwieldy to manage, and it was late to every major advance in steelmaking technology of the last 100 years, from continuous rolling to the basic oxygen furnace to the minimill. When the company did try its hand at technology innovation, it reliably made missteps. In some cases, like with continuous rolling, it gave up too early, while in other cases it spent many years unsuccessfully developing a technology. In the 1950s, for instance, it spent many years trying to develop an alternative to the BOF that blew oxygen in from the side, long after other producers had given up on the technology. And in the 1970s it tried to develop another alternative to the BOF called Q-BOP that likewise didn’t seem to pan out. As far as I can tell, no major steelmaking technology over the last century came out of US Steel.&nbsp;</p><p>The US Steel of today is a far cry from the industrial giant of the 20th century. But being transformed into a lean, competitive company doesn’t seem to have changed its fundamental culture, a company that's content to be a follower, rather than a leader in technological development and pushing the industry forward.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

I was excited for the opportunity. They have many in-house recruiting resources and a policy to <strong>not</strong> ghost candidates. Yet, I got ghosted. I’m not alone in this, and we’re going to investigate why this happens.</p><p id="1a8f"><strong>Ghosting</strong> is a term that refers to asynchronous communication that is abruptly cut off by one party. The term is typically used in dating, but works well for tech recruiting too. In order for it to be ghosting, the ghosted party has to expect the conversation will continue. This means that if you apply and never hear back from a job, that’s not ghosting, a conversation never started. It only becomes ghosting when there is an expected next step that never happens.</p><figure><figcaption>Once ghosted, do we become ghosts? Source: Dall-E</figcaption></figure><p id="956d">The effect of getting ghosted for me, and likely others, is impactful. The narrative in my head played out like this: “was I really so bad that they wouldn’t even tell me no?” It was also a chilling effect for my projects that involved generative AI. I didn’t want to work on them. Every time I logged into my Github, I was reminded of the company because I still had a fork of the take home assignment. It took about a month for my project work to feel normal again, but I shelved some of my LLM projects and moved on. The fire of disappointment had smoldered into an ember of resentment.</p><p id="2323">The resentment that, months later, inspired me to write a message to the team’s Product Manager (PM). I didn’t reach out on Linkedin. It was much more intimate, using my gamer tag. Discord is a social media platform where you can join communities that have chat rooms, forums, video and voice chat. I am a member of 50+ Discord communities, and many of them are dedicated to open source projects or technologies. The PM was in a Discord I was active in for an open source LLM toolset. Seeing that they were still in the server, and not wanting them to entice others to get ghosted. I private messaged them with the story of my experience. Thankfully, he was receptive.</p></div><div><p id="556c">I had finished a 3-hour take home test and went through hours of Zoom interviews. My loop was done. I didn’t feel great about my performance, but didn’t feel bad. I had done well, but not perfect. My experience was not well aligned with the role. They were looking for a senior level engineer they deemed an “AI hacker.” I had spent the previous decade in technical lead roles, spending as much time on technical direction as I have with coding. I was expecting a message in the next two weeks saying “no,” but would be pleasantly surprised if they said “yes.”</p><p id="88bd">Two weeks after my final interview, I hear nothing. I am tired of waiting for the no, so I send an email to the recruiter asking for more details. I thought that something probably happened in the process and I slipped through the cracks, and I want to give them the opportunity to do the right thing. The right thing being not ghosting me. The recruiter never responded.</p><blockquote><p id="35e4">Ugh. That’s tough to hear.</p></blockquote><p id="1b09">The PM says after I tell them about this part in the story.</p><blockquote><p id="7fd0">Let me go talk to our talent team and see what went on here. Really appreciate you sharing this with me.</p></blockquote><figure><figcaption>Ghost in an email shell. Source: Dall-E</figcaption></figure><p id="78fb">There is this sort of liminal space between interpreting behavior as a mistake or malicious, at least for the story I tell in my head. I remind myself of <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Hanlon’s razor</a>, “never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by [misunderstanding].” When the weeks passed by with no response from the recruiter, the story in my head solidified — it’s malice. However, after the PM’s attempted reconciliation and more context, it seems like it was probably misunderstanding, or in the actual quote from Wikipedia: “stupidity.” A week after the PM got back to me, I get this email:</p><figure><figcaption>Mixed feelings of 🙏and🖕. Source: Me</figcaption></figure><p id="019a">I didn’t bomb the interview and feedback was generally positive, though vague. Their policy is to not ghost candidates, and it seems I slipped through the cracks. This works for me as closure. I will not be responding to the recruiting manager. I thanked the PM for helping me out, solid person, really appreciate them.</p><h2 id="8aec">Ghost World</h2><p id="b392">I had not been ghosted by an interviewer before. I typically apply to positions where I know people, so that may be why. I reached out to some coding communities I am in to ask for their experiences. Here are the parts of the discussion that stuck out:</p><blockquote><p id="0e93">Almost all of the people i know have been ghosted multiple times by potential employers</p><p id="ebb6">I had an HR lady tell me ‘we’ll definitely reach out one way or another we’re not one of those places that will leave you hanging’ and then proceed to leave me hanging</p><p id="f303">recruiters have really been shit the past couple years with actually responding<br>in the tech world…. Literally every single company i interviewed at (including some really big well known ones) recently have ghosted me</p></blockquote><p id="7def">This is a small sample, and does not include all the people who weren’t ghosted. These people are smart and talented with varying levels of experience.</p><p id="d9bf">Knowing the skillsets of others who got ghosted and my personal experience, here are some of my assumptions about the recruitment ghosting trend:</p><ul><li id="2df6">It has nothing to do with how well you interviewed (you could be 2nd pick and still get ghosted).</li><li id="133b">The majority of people who participated in the interview are not aware of the ghosting. The people who performed the interview probably assume they have humane recruiting practices.</li><li id="85e3">There is no perceived incentive from recruiters to not ghost</li><li id="42d4">Verifying or measuring contact with rejected candidates is not a priority and not done. Even if there is a policy, there is nobody checking to see if it is followed.</li></ul><h2 id="7f40">Nonperformative policy</h2><blockquote><p id="819b">the message that they intended to send to you never made it to your inbox. You were meant to receive our decision with a link to book time for feedback.</p></blockquote><p id="78e2">In Sarah Ahmed’s <em>Complaint! </em>she talks about institutions and their policies, describing many as “nonperformative,” a term which “seemed to capture how saying something was not doing something.” Some policies exist simply to bolster the institutions image, like an anti-bullying policy or inclusion policy.</p><p id="75f5">Nonperformative policies are not necessarily malicious, they come about when there is no investment or measurement into the success of the policy. In my case, the policy to follow up with every candidate was not appropriately measured, therefore allowing me to “slip through the cracks.”</p><p id="4cce">I wonder how many other candidates have slipped through the cracks as well. From the recruiter’s perspective, there is very little incentive to do a final follow up with a rejected candidate. That person is no longer part of the pool of potential candidates, which is the group of people who will make them money. They will definitely prioritize profitable communications over closing the loop with a rejected candidate.</p><h2 id="e7ed"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p id="1410">From a game theory perspective if “winning” is having a job that fits all your wants and needs. Then the best way to win is to look and apply for jobs constantly, not just when you are discontent with your current job. That means a lot of opportunities for learning and improving interviewing skills. When recruiters ghost us, it becomes incredibly difficult to gauge our performance in those interviews and continue to improve.</p><p id="0a9b">The truth is that getting ghosted by recruiters (or anyone) feels bad. Spending 10 hours on an interview process to not even get the time of day for a “no” is an inhumane practice and should be stopped. It cannot just be stopped with a policy, there needs to be measurement of compliance to the policy. The whole thing could be automated rather simply.</p><p id="73d2">We all know that working with recruiters can be frustrating from both a candidate and interviewer perspective. Those of us who perform interviews regularly in our professional lives should be more aware and verify that loops are closed for candidates. I have so many great conversations with potential coworkers, but a lot of times it doesn’t work out. I want those people to be treated with dignity and respect, and the easiest way I can do that is to ping the recruiter I work with on Slack and verify. So, that’s what I’ll do. Thanks for reading.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>This December, if there’s one tech New Year’s resolution I’d encourage you to have, it’s switching to the only remaining ethical web browser, <a href="https://firefox.com/">Firefox</a>. According to recent posts on social media, Firefox’s market share is slipping. We should not let that happen. There are two main reasons why switching is important.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="2047" height="1356" src="https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k.jpg" alt="A red panda (firefox) resting on a tree branch." srcset="https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k.jpg 2047w, https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k-1440x954.jpg 1440w, https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k-768x509.jpg 768w, https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://roytanck.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/16071828377_9bdfbd9789_k-1070x709.jpg 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 2047px) 100vw, 2047px"><figcaption>“<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/91501748@N07/16071828377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Panda</a>” by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/91501748@N07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mathias Appel</a> is marked with <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/?ref=openverse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC0 1.0</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>1. Privacy</h2>



<p>Firefox is the only major browser not built by a company that makes money from advertising and/or selling your personal data. There’s been a lot of talk about websites tracking users using cookies, fingerprinting and other nefarious technologies that hurt your privacy. But owning the browser puts Google, Apple and Microsoft in a position where they don’t even need those tricks. We need to use browsers that are independent, and right now that means Firefox.</p>



<h2>2. Browser engine monopoly</h2>



<p>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_engines">lists four browser engines as being “active”</a>. Browser engines are the bits that take a web page’s code and display it on your screen. Ideally, they conform to the official <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> standards, and display all elements as it describes. If that’s the case, web developers can easily write sites that work on all browsers. No proprietary vendor lock-in nonsense, just glorious open standards at work.</p>



<h3>It’s happened before</h3>



<p>In the early 2000’s, Internet Explorer had a massive 95% market share. This meant that many sites were only developed for use with IE. They’d use experimental features that IE supported, in favor of things from the official HTML standard. This was a very bad situation, which hindered the development of the World Wide Web.</p>



<p>Currenty, Chrome, Safari and Edge all use variations of the closely related Webkit and Blink engines. If we want to avoid another browser engine monopoly, we need to support Firefox, and its “Gecko” engine.</p>



<h2>Firefox is actually really good</h2>



<p>If Firefox would be a bad browser, I would not recommend you to switch. It’s fast, has a nice user interface, and feels every bit as modern and elegant as its competition. I’ve been using it as my main browser for a couple of years now, on Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android. As a web developer, I usually have at least three browsers open, but when I go look something up on the web, I pick Firefox.</p>



<p>So please, help save the web by <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">using the best browser out there</a>. It’s an easy thing to do, and it makes a big difference.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-429217">


<h3>from the <i>third-party-doctrine-beats-HIPAA</i> dept</h3>

<p>The Fourth Amendment is rarely a match for the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=third+party+doctrine" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=third+party+doctrine">Third Party Doctrine</a>. In recent years, things have gotten a wee bit better thanks <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/06/22/supreme-court-says-warrants-are-needed-cell-site-location-info/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/06/22/supreme-court-says-warrants-are-needed-cell-site-location-info/">to a couple</a> of Supreme Court rulings. But the operative principle still overrides: whatever we share (voluntarily or not) with private companies can often be obtained without a warrant.</p>
<p>That’s why bills <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/08/18/ron-wyden-its-time-to-kill-third-party-doctrine-go-back-to-respecting-privacy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/08/18/ron-wyden-its-time-to-kill-third-party-doctrine-go-back-to-respecting-privacy/">have been introduced</a> to add Fourth Amendment protections to cell location data gathered by phone apps. That’s why there’s been a constant struggle in courts <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/21/wyden-bill-targeting-data-broker-sales-to-law-enforcement-passes-in-the-house/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/21/wyden-bill-targeting-data-broker-sales-to-law-enforcement-passes-in-the-house/">and in Congress</a> to reconcile the Third Party Doctrine with the Fourth Amendment, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/03/25/data-broker-looking-to-sell-real-time-vehicle-location-data-to-government-agencies-including-military/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/03/25/data-broker-looking-to-sell-real-time-vehicle-location-data-to-government-agencies-including-military/">given the vast amount</a> of information and data Americans now share with thousands of third parties.</p>
<p>Then there’s the players in the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/09/yet-another-data-broker-found-to-give-massive-amounts-of-location-info-to-law-enforcement/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/09/yet-another-data-broker-found-to-give-massive-amounts-of-location-info-to-law-enforcement/">Third Party Doctrine market</a>. There’s the government, which wants as much information as it can obtain without having to subject its actions and motives to judicial scrutiny. And there are the private companies, who figure it’s far more cost effective to just give the government what it wants, rather than challenge government requests for data in court. </p>
<p>The private entities involved here probably have more reason than most to not try to piss the government off. Not only are they <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/us-pharmacy-chain-rite-aid-agrees-bankruptcy-mediation-gets-loan-approval-2023-12-19/#:~:text=Rite%20Aid%2C%20which%20operates%20about,filling%20illegal%20or%20suspicious%20prescriptions." data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/us-pharmacy-chain-rite-aid-agrees-bankruptcy-mediation-gets-loan-approval-2023-12-19/#:~:text=Rite%20Aid%2C%20which%20operates%20about,filling%20illegal%20or%20suspicious%20prescriptions.">still struggling to recover from a widespread retail downturn</a> ignited by a worldwide pandemic, but they’re also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/13/1142416718/cvs-walgreens-opioid-crisis-settlement" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/13/1142416718/cvs-walgreens-opioid-crisis-settlement">paying off large settlements to the government</a> for playing things a bit too fast and loose when it came to handing out opioids to Americans.</p>
<p>As Beth Mole reports for Ars Technica (and following on the heels of the news pharmacy chain Rite Aid is facing a five-year facial recognition tech ban), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/cvs-rite-aid-walgreens-hand-out-medical-records-to-cops-without-warrants/" data-type="link" data-id="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/cvs-rite-aid-walgreens-hand-out-medical-records-to-cops-without-warrants/">every major player in the retail pharmacy business has been handing over sensitive medical data to the government</a> without ever demanding to see an actual warrant. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All of the big pharmacy chains in the US hand over sensitive medical records to law enforcement without a warrant—and some will do so without even running the requests by a legal professional, according to a congressional investigation.</em></p>
<p><em>[…]</em></p>
<p><em>They include the seven largest pharmacy chains in the country: CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Cigna, Optum Rx, Walmart Stores, Inc., The Kroger Company, and Rite Aid Corporation. The lawmakers also spoke with Amazon Pharmacy.</em></p>
<p><em>All eight of the pharmacies said they do not require law enforcement to have a warrant prior to sharing private and sensitive medical records, which can include the prescription drugs a person used or uses and their medical conditions. Instead, all the pharmacies hand over such information with nothing more than a subpoena, which can be issued by government agencies and does not require review or approval by a judge.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three chains (CVS, Kroger, and Rite Aid) all told Congress they don’t even do a legal review of the subpoenas handed to them by government agencies. Instead, they apparently assume that if the government’s name is on it, it must be a valid request. The good news, I suppose, is that the other chains are at least involving their lawyers when it comes to data requests. </p>
<p>HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) — the medical record privacy law frequently misunderstood (and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=594127581&amp;rlz=1CALAYK_enUS1026&amp;sxsrf=AM9HkKm9ONokuP9V-HtSsqmBSeM4VENMRA:1703730315377&amp;q=%22hippa%22+site:facebook.com&amp;nfpr=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgx_aBirGDAxVDEDQIHQzfDwgQvgUoAXoECAgQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=911&amp;dpr=1#ip=1" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=594127581&amp;rlz=1CALAYK_enUS1026&amp;sxsrf=AM9HkKm9ONokuP9V-HtSsqmBSeM4VENMRA:1703730315377&amp;q=%22hippa%22+site:facebook.com&amp;nfpr=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgx_aBirGDAxVDEDQIHQzfDwgQvgUoAXoECAgQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=911&amp;dpr=1#ip=1">mis-acronymed</a>) by laymen, lawyers, and legislators alike — is of no use here. HIPAA only prevents medical information from being released without permission to private parties not specifically authorized to obtain it. Pretty much any request originating from law enforcement agencies is considered to fall under the “if required by law” exception, even if the requests haven’t actually been vetted by pharmacy company lawyers and/or may not be legitimate demands for sensitive medical info.</p>
<p>The “required by law” phrase is important here. Law enforcement agencies have their own legal interpretations of the Third Party Doctrine, but none of that matters much in the case of HIPAA. All it would take to prevent pharmacy chains from handing out this data without a warrant would be the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) taking this out of the Third Party Doctrine’s hands and placing a presumption of privacy on it. </p>
<p>That’s the gist of the <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24243486/pharmacy-letter.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24243486/pharmacy-letter.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] recently sent to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra by Senator Ron Wyden, Rep. Pramila Jaypal, and Rep. Sara Jacobs. It cites a bit of courtroom and private company precedent to urge this situation along. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We urge HHS to consider further strengthening its HIPAA regulations to more closely align them with Americans’ reasonable expectations of privacy and Constitutional principles. Pharmacies can and should insist on a warrant, and invite law enforcement agencies that insist on demanding patient medical records with solely a subpoena to go to court to enforce that demand. The requirement for a warrant is exactly the approach taken by tech companies to protect customer privacy. In 2010, after just one Federal Court of Appeals held that Americans have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their emails and that the 1986 Congressionally enacted law permitting disclosures of email pursuant to a subpoena was unconstitutional, all of the major free email providers — Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft — started insisting on a warrant before disclosing such data</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks pretty simple. All that’s needed is a change of policy, even if there’s no change in law. The problem with this, though, is that the head of the HHS has had plenty of time to change this policy to erect a higher standard for demands for customers’ information. The letter notes the legislators first informed Becerra of this potential issue in July, following <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/05/how-the-dobbs-decision-will-lead-to-attacks-on-free-speech-or-why-democrats-need-to-stop-undermining-free-speech/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/05/how-the-dobbs-decision-will-lead-to-attacks-on-free-speech-or-why-democrats-need-to-stop-undermining-free-speech/">the <em>Dobbs</em> decision</a> in June, hoping the HHS would erect more protections to prevent people from being prosecuted for obtaining birth control products. </p>
<p>The following months delivered confirmation of the legislators’ concerns. Now, it’s up to the HHS to move forward. While we wait to see whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Becerra#California_Attorney_General_(2017%E2%80%932021)" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Becerra#California_Attorney_General_(2017%E2%80%932021)">a former </a><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/03/08/california-attorney-general-doubles-down-threatening-journalists-possessing-convicted-cops-list/" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Becerra#California_Attorney_General_(2017%E2%80%932021)">prosecutor</a> is willing to elevate the privacy of Americans above the warrantless desires of law enforcement, we can at least be somewhat comforted by the fact that some of these companies are going to be a bit more transparent about their cooperation with the government. CVS, Walgreens, and Kroger have all promised to publish periodic reports about government requests for data. Amazon has gone one step further by notifying customers about government demands for their data.</p>
<p>There’s no reason the government shouldn’t need to secure a warrant to obtain this data. It’s protected by federal law against everyone else patients haven’t specifically granted permission to obtain. The government shouldn’t presume the existence of the Third Party Doctrine means customers’ prescription records are an open book. But it does and that needs to change, either through voluntary action or legislative mandate if the government can’t be talked into respecting the privacy of records most Americans likely assume are already covered by federal privacy protections.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Josh <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/kroll/software-transparency-debian-openssl-bug/">wrote</a> recently about a serious security bug that appeared in Debian Linux back in 2006, and whether it was really a backdoor inserted by the NSA.   (He concluded that it probably was not.)</p>
<p>Today I want to write about another <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/57135/">incident</a>, in 2003, in which someone tried to backdoor the Linux kernel.   This one was definitely an attempt to insert a backdoor.  But we don’t know who it was that made the attempt—and we probably never will.<br>
<span id="more-8995"></span><br>
Back in 2003 Linux used a system called BitKeeper to store the master copy of the Linux source code.  If a developer wanted to propose a modification to the Linux code, they would submit their proposed change, and it would go through an organized approval process to decide whether the change would be accepted into the master code.   Every change to the master code would come with a short explanation, which always included a pointer to the record of its approval.</p>
<p>But some people didn’t like BitKeeper, so a second copy of the source code was kept so that developers could get the code via another code system called CVS.  The CVS copy of the code was a direct clone of the primary BitKeeper copy.</p>
<p>But on Nov. 5, 2003, Larry McVoy <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/57137/">noticed</a> that there was a code change in the CVS copy that did not have a pointer to a record of approval.  Investigation showed that the change had never been approved and, stranger yet, that this change did not appear in the primary BitKeeper repository at all.  Further investigation determined that someone had apparently broken in (electronically) to the CVS server and inserted this change.</p>
<p>What did the change do?   This is where it gets really interesting.  The change modified the code of a Linux function called wait4, which a program could use to wait for something to happen.  Specifically, it added these two lines of code:</p>
<pre>if ((options == (__WCLONE|__WALL)) &amp;&amp; (current-&gt;uid = 0))
        retval = -EINVAL;
</pre>
<p>[Exercise for readers who know the C programming language: What is unusual about this code?   Answer appears below.]</p>
<p>A casual reading by an expert would interpret this as innocuous error-checking code to make wait4 return an error code when wait4 was called in a certain way that was forbidden by the documentation.   But a really careful expert reader would notice that, near the end of the first line, it said “= 0” rather than “== 0”.   The normal thing to write in code like this is “== 0”, which tests whether the user ID of the currently running code (current-&gt;uid) is equal to zero, without modifying the user ID.  But what actually appears is “= 0”, which has the effect of setting the user ID to zero.</p>
<p>Setting the user ID to zero is a problem because user ID number zero is the “root” user, which is allowed to do absolutely anything it wants—to access all data, change the behavior of all code, and to compromise entirely the security of all parts of the system. So the effect of this code is to give root privileges to any piece of software that called wait4 in a particular way that is supposed to be invalid.  In other words … it’s a classic backdoor.</p>
<p>This is a very clever piece of work.  It looks like innocuous error checking, but it’s really a back door.  And it was slipped into the code outside the normal approval process, to avoid any possibility that the approval process would notice what was up.</p>
<p>But the attempt didn’t work, because the Linux team was careful enough to notice that that this code was in the CVS repository without having gone through the normal approval process.  Score one for Linux.</p>
<p>Could this have been an NSA attack? Maybe. But there were many others who had the skill and motivation to carry out this attack. Unless somebody confesses, or a smoking-gun document turns up, we’ll never know.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/btree.html">https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/btree.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38805383">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>
  Consider this 3-level b+tree. There are two levels of branch pages
  (the root is a branch page), and 5 leaf pages.  Data and keys are
  stored in the leaf pages.
</p>
<p>
  Leaf chaining, ie links between leaf pages for easy sequential
  access, is not supported as it would require the whole tree to
  be rewritten on each update.
</p>
<p>

    <img src="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/how-the-btree-works.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The pages are stored sequentially in the database file. Increasing
  page numbers means increasing file offsets. The meta page includes
  a pointer to the root page, a SHA1 hash, and statistics counters.
</p>
<p>
  When the file is opened it is scanned backwards page by page to
  find a valid meta page, and thus the root of the tree.
</p>

    <img src="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/sequential-page-view.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  When updating a value in leaf page 8, instead of changing the
  page in-place, a whole new page is appended to the file (here as
  page 12). Because the location of the page is changed, each parent
  page needs to be updated to point to the new locations.
</p>
<p>
  Leaf page 7 is not affected. A new root page is created
  as a copy of the previous root page, only the pointer to branch
  page 6 is updated to point to branch page 11.
</p>
<p>
  Any cursor still having a pointer to root page 9 can traverse the
  tree unaffected by the change. It will see a consistent snapshot
  of the database.  Dashed pages and pointers in the diagram are
  still there in the file, they are just not the last version.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/updated-btree.pdf" title="click for PDF version">
    <img src="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/updated-btree.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  In the file, pages are written sequentially by appending new pages
  to the file. Already written pages are never modified.
</p>
<p>
  After each new generation of the tree is written, there is a meta
  page pointing to the new root.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/flattened-btree-page-structure.pdf" title="click for PDF version">
    <img src="https://www.bzero.se/ldapd/flattened-btree-page-structure.png">
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Changing one page (leaf page 8) resulted in 4 new pages being
  appended to the file. This wastes disk space, but writing consecutive
  pages to disk is more efficient than writing random locations.
  And there is no need for a transaction log, because <em>the
  database file <strong>is</strong> the transaction log</em>.

This is one area where market economy works against common good, unfortunately. People who have the knowledge and want to capitalise on it are highly incentivised to preparing beginner level materials and maybe a tiny bit to prepare the something for people who already have a bit of knowledge. After that, the number of people who are your potential target drops off sharply and you would have to increase the price dramatically. And it happens that people will not buy a $200 book even if it had $100k worth knowledge in it.<p>There are some positions available though. For example, I recently found Let over Lambda by Doug Hoyte. Excellent book if you are <i>that</i> kind of programmer.</p><p>Another problem with advanced materials is that frequently people are even unable to recognise them as advanced or valuable. It is easy to look at and evaluate things you have experience with, it is much more difficult to impossible to do the same with stuff that is beyond your experience (also called The Blub Paradox: <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>).</p><p>Personally, I just read a lot. I try to keep an open mind and even if I don't agree fully with the contents of the book, I try to use the ideas as inspirations for my own thinking. You can read codebases written by other people and learn new ideas. Over time, you gather a library of solutions to problems and knowledge of when to and when not to apply them.</p><p>If you do enough of it, you will find useful knowledge in unusual places.

The Rafting Trip took us through implementing the Raft consensus algorithm from scratch. And the "Write a Compiler" course had us build a small language using LLVM.</p><p>Both courses (but especially the Rafting trip one) were definitely for experienced programmers. In the courses I took, people generally had at least 5 years of professional work. And even still, there were a few people that really struggled to stay on pace in the course.</p><p>But at the end, most people had a (kinda) working Raft library or compiler!</p><p>[1] <a href="https://dabeaz.com/" rel="nofollow">https://dabeaz.com/</a>

My approach has been more hands-on and puzzled together recently. I've been digging into harder problems on sites like leetcode to learn more math, and solidify some algorithm and data structure concepts. It has really helped me feel more confident and erase some of the lingering imposter syndrome around the algorithm-side of programming. A great guide that got me started on this was the tech interview handbook[1], which helped me dig into specific concepts instead of just randomly targeting. I've found my ability to review code has also improved through this, as I am picking up different libraries and concepts that I wouldn't have otherwise.<p>1. <a href="https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/" rel="nofollow">https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheat...</a>

The quality of these tends to vary a lot, so you need a bit of curation and due diligence. I myself found the videos from InfoQ very useful with 15 yoe (particularly in the software architecture track).</p><p>And if you want the really advanced stuff, you can also read papers. The barrier to entry is higher and sometimes is difficult to connect them to your everyday problems, but it doesn't get more cutting edge that than.

So, learning another language is, in itself a kind of "advance".  However, for depth, you'd usually want to pick a specific sub-discipline in programming and concentrate on that.  You will have better luck with choosing theoretical disciplines, because those usually are rooted in math, and so have longer history and more systematic approach.  The more "practical" aspects usually follow the arc of having an introductory course (at best) with the next learning stage being an "area of active research" (also, the intro course would typically be bad).</p><p>To give you an example: in college I became interested in regular languages.  So, I was looking to expand my knowledge on the subject.  Out of all things that I could dig up on regular languages two seemed most appealing: approximation of context-free grammars with regular languages and equivalence between generating functions and regular languages.  In a short while I realized that I don't have enough of mathematical background to go after the generative functions part, but the approximation part turn out to be fun and interesting.  I was able to dig up some papers and even try my hand in doing something with the concept.</p><p>You'd have similar success if you went after types in programming languages.  There are plenty of publications, and you will have multiple steps ahead of you before you run up the wall of "area of active research".  My journey down that path started with Benjamin C. Pierce's Types in Programming Languages.</p><p>Another direction you may consider is to try to generalize your knowledge.  For example, of programming languages.  In this regard, I find the book by Shriram Krishamurthy, Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation to be a good introduction to the theoretical side of crafting and evaluation of programming languages.</p><p>There are, also, unfortunately, some areas where a lot of programming work has been done, but very little learning material is available, and, especially nothing deep has been produced.  For example, if you want to go down the system programming route... there are books, that's true, but the level of generalization leaves a lot to be desired.  It's often boggled in all kinds of "practical advise" and very concrete examples based on Linux Kernel code long ago replaced by something else (or worse yet, but original Unix code etc.)</p><p>Or, even worse, if you consider fields like testing.  Or even GUI.  It's surprisingly common and yet surprisingly without much analysis or structure.

<p>In many ways, 2023 was a long-awaited return to normalcy for people who build their own gaming and/or workstation PCs. For the entire year, most mainstream components have been available at or a little under their official retail prices, making it possible to build all kinds of PCs at relatively reasonable prices without worrying about restocks or waiting for discounts. It was a welcome continuation of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/2022-in-gpus-the-shortage-ends-but-higher-prices-seem-here-to-stay/">some GPU trends</a> that started in 2022. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel could release a new GPU, and you could consistently buy that GPU for roughly what it was supposed to cost.</p>
<p>That's where we get into how frustrating 2023 was for GPU buyers, though. Cards like the GeForce RTX 4090 and Radeon RX 7900 series launched in late 2022 and boosted performance beyond what any last-generation cards could achieve. But 2023's midrange GPU launches were less ambitious. Not only did they offer the performance of a last-generation GPU, but most of them did it for around the same price as the last-gen GPUs whose performance they matched.</p>
<h2>The midrange runs in place</h2>
<p>Not every midrange GPU launch will get us a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/07/nvidia-gtx-1060-review/">GTX 1060</a>—a card roughly 50 percent faster than its immediate predecessor and beat the previous-generation GTX 980 despite costing just a bit over half as much money. But even if your expectations were low, this year's midrange GPU launches have been underwhelming.</p>
<p>The worst was probably the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, which sometimes struggled to beat the card it replaced at around the same price. The 16GB version of the card was particularly maligned since it was $100 more expensive but was only faster than the 8GB version in a handful of games.</p>
<p>The regular RTX 4060 was slightly better news, thanks partly to a $30 price drop from where the RTX 3060 started. The performance gains were small, and a drop from 12GB to 8GB of RAM isn't the direction we prefer to see things move, but it was still a slightly faster and more efficient card at around the same price. AMD's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-amds-269-rx-7600-is-a-good-1080p-card-but-the-rtx-4060-looms/">Radeon RX 7600</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amd-rx-7700-xt-and-7800-xt-review-closing-out-the-fine-i-guess-gpu-generation/">RX 7700 XT, and RX 7800 XT</a> all belong in this same broad category—some improvements, but generally similar performance to previous-generation parts at similar or slightly lower prices. Not an exciting leap for people with aging GPUs who waited out the GPU shortage to get an upgrade.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The best midrange card of the generation—and at $600, we're definitely stretching the definition of "midrange"—might be the GeForce RTX 4070, which can generally match or slightly beat the RTX 3080 while using much less power and costing $100 less than the RTX 3080's suggested retail price. That seems like a solid deal once you consider that the RTX 3080 was essentially unavailable at its suggested retail price for most of its life span. But $600 is still a $100 increase from the 2070 and a $220 increase from the 1070, making it tougher to swallow.</p>
<p>In all, 2023 wasn't the worst time to buy a $300 GPU; that dubious honor belongs to the depths of 2021, when you'd be lucky to snag a GTX 1650 for that price. But "consistently available, basically competent GPUs" are harder to be thankful for the further we get from the GPU shortage.</p>
<h2>Marketing gets more misleading</h2>

<p>If you just looked at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/nvidias-399-4060-ti-comes-with-no-price-hike-but-mild-performance-improvements/">Nvidia's early performance claims</a> for each of these GPUs, you might think that the RTX 40-series was an exciting jump forward.</p>
<p>But these numbers were only possible in games that supported these GPUs' newest software gimmick, DLSS Frame Generation (FG). The original DLSS and DLSS 2 improve performance by upsampling the images generated by your GPU, generating interpolated pixels that make lower-res image into higher-res ones without the blurriness and loss of image quality you'd get from simple upscaling. DLSS FG generates entire frames in between the ones being rendered by your GPU, theoretically providing big frame rate boosts without requiring a powerful GPU.</p>

<p>The technology is impressive when it works, and it's been successful enough to spawn hardware-agnostic imitators like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/amds-fps-doubling-fsr-3-is-coming-soon-and-not-just-to-radeon-graphics-cards/">the AMD-backed FSR 3</a> and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-details-game-boosting-frame-generation-tech-that-applies-a-different-technique-extrass-uses-extrapolation-instead-of-amd-and-nvidias-approach-that-uses-interpolation">an alternate implementation from Intel</a> that's still in early stages. But it has notable limitations—mainly, it needs a reasonably high base frame rate to have enough data to generate convincing extra frames, something that these midrange cards may struggle to do. Even when performance is good, it can introduce weird visual artifacts or lose fine detail. The technology isn't available in all games. And DLSS FG also adds a bit of latency, though this can be offset with latency-reducing technologies like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/reflex/">Nvidia Reflex</a>.</p>
<p>As another tool in the performance-enhancing toolbox, DLSS FG is nice to have. But to put it front-and-center in comparisons with previous-generation graphics cards is, at best, painting an overly rosy picture of what upgraders can actually expect.</p>

<p>You probably all know Gentoo Linux as your favourite source-based distribution.
Did you know that our package manager, Portage, already for years also has support for binary
packages, and that source- and binary-based package installations can be freely mixed?</p>

<p>To speed up working with slow hardware and for overall convenience, we’re now also offering
<strong>binary packages for download and direct installation</strong>! For most architectures, this is
limited to the core system and weekly updates - not so for <strong>amd64 and arm64</strong> however. There we’ve got a 
stunning <strong>&gt;20 GByte of packages</strong> on our mirrors, from LibreOffice to KDE Plasma and from Gnome to Docker.
Gentoo stable, updated daily. Enjoy! And <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/news/2023/12/29/Gentoo-binary.html">read 
on for more details!</a></p>

<h2 id="questions--answers">Questions &amp; Answers</h2>

<h3 id="how-can-i-set-up-my-existing-gentoo-installation-to-use-these-packages">How can I set up my existing Gentoo installation to use these packages?</h3>

<p><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_quickstart">Quick setup instructions</a> for
the most common cases can be found in our wiki. In short, you need to create a configuration 
file in <code>/etc/portage/binrepos.conf/</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, we have a rather neat <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide">binary package guide</a> on
our Wiki that goes into much more detail.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-have-to-do-with-a-new-stage--new-installation">What do I have to do with a new stage / new installation?</h3>

<p>New stages already contain the suitable <code>/etc/portage/binrepos.conf/gentoobinhost.conf</code>. You are
good to go from the start, although you may want to replace the <code>src-uri</code> 
setting in there with an URI pointing to the corresponding directory on a 
<a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/">local mirror</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>$ emerge -uDNavg @world</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-compile-settings-use-flags--do-the-normal-amd64-packages-use">What compile settings, use flags, … do the ‘‘normal’’ amd64 packages use?</h3>

<p>The binary packages under <code>amd64/binpackages/17.1/x86-64</code> are compiled using
<code>CFLAGS="-march=x86-64 -mtune=generic -O2 -pipe"</code> and will work with any amd64 / x86-64 machine.</p>

<p>The available useflag settings and versions correspond to the stable packages
of the <code>amd64/17.1/nomultilib</code> (i.e., openrc), <code>amd64/17.1/desktop/plasma/systemd</code>,
and <code>amd64/17.1/desktop/gnome/systemd</code> profiles. This should provide fairly large
coverage.</p>

<h3 id="what-compile-settings-use-flags--do-the-normal-arm64-packages-use">What compile settings, use flags, … do the ‘‘normal’’ arm64 packages use?</h3>

<p>The binary packages under <code>arm64/binpackages/17.0/arm64</code> are compiled using
<code>CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe"</code> and will work with any arm64 / AArch64 machine.</p>

<p>The available useflag settings and versions correspond to the stable packages
of the <code>arm64/17.0</code> (i.e., openrc), <code>arm64/17.0/desktop/plasma/systemd</code>,
and <code>arm64/17.0/desktop/gnome/systemd</code> profiles.</p>

<h3 id="but-hey-thats-not-optimized-for-my-cpu">But hey, that’s not optimized for my CPU!</h3>

<p>Tough luck. You can still compile packages yourself just as before!</p>

<h3 id="what-settings-do-the-packages-for-other-architectures-and-abis-use">What settings do the packages for other architectures and ABIs use?</h3>

<p>The binary package hosting is wired up with the stage builds. Which
means, for about every stage there is a binary package hosting which 
covers (only) the stage contents and settings. There are no further plans 
to expand coverage for now. But hey, this includes the compiler (gcc or
clang) and the whole build toolchain!</p>

<h3 id="are-the-packages-cryptographically-signed">Are the packages cryptographically signed?</h3>

<p>Yes, with the <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/signatures/">same key as the stages</a>.</p>

<h3 id="are-the-cryptographic-signatures-verified-before-installation">Are the cryptographic signatures verified before installation?</h3>

<p>Yes, with one limitation (in the default setting).</p>

<p>Portage knows two binary package formats, XPAK (old) and GPKG (new). Only GPKG supports
cryptographic signing. Until recently, XPAK was the default setting (and it may still
be the default on your installation since this is not changed during upgrade, but only
at new installation).</p>

<p>The new, official Gentoo binary packages are all in GPKG format.
GPKG packages have their signature verified, and if this fails, installation is refused.
To avoid breaking compatibility with old binary packages, by default XPAK
packages (which do not have signatures) can still be installed however.</p>

<p>If you want to require verified signatures (which is something we strongly recommend), 
set <code>FEATURES="binpkg-request-signature"</code> in <code>make.conf</code>. Then, obviously, you can also
only use GPKG packages.</p>

<h3 id="i-get-an-error-that-signatures-cannot-be-verified">I get an error that signatures cannot be verified.</h3>

<p>Try running the Gentoo Trust Tool <code>getuto</code> as root.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>$ getuto</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should set up the required key ring with the Gentoo Release Engineering keys for
Portage.</p>

<p>If you have <code>FEATURES="binpkg-request-signature"</code> enabled in <code>make.conf</code>, then <code>getuto</code>
is called automatically before every binary package download operation, to make sure
that key updates and revocations are imported.</p>

<h3 id="ive-made-binary-packages-myself-and-portage-refuses-to-use-them-now">I’ve made binary packages myself and portage refuses to use them now!</h3>

<p>Well, you found the side effect of <code>FEATURES="binpkg-request-signature"</code>.
For your self-made packages you will need to set up a signing key and have that key
trusted by the anchor in <code>/etc/portage/gnupg</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide">binary package guide</a> on
our Wiki will be helpful here.</p>

<h3 id="my-download-is-slow">My download is slow.</h3>

<p>Then pretty please use a <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/">local mirror</a>
instead of downloading from University of Oregon. You can just edit the URI 
in your <code>/etc/portage/binrepos.conf</code>. And yes, that’s safe, because of the 
cryptographic signature.</p>

<h3 id="my-portage-still-wants-to-compile-from-source">My Portage still wants to compile from source.</h3>

<p>If you use useflag combinations deviating from the profile default, then
you can’t and won’t use the packages. Portage will happily mix and match though
and combine binary packages with locally compiled ones. Gentoo still remains
a source-based distribution, and we are not aiming for a full binary-only 
installation without any compilation at all.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-use-the-packages-on-a-merged-usr-system">Can I use the packages on a merged-usr system?</h3>

<p>Yes. (If anything breaks, then this is a bug and <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/">should be reported</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="can-i-use-the-packages-with-other-older-or-newer-profile-versions">Can I use the packages with other (older or newer) profile versions?</h3>

<p><strong>No.</strong> That’s why the <code>src-uri</code> path contains, e.g.,  “17.1”.
<strong>When there’s a new profile version, we’ll also provide new, separate package directories.</strong></p>

<h3 id="any-plans-to-offer-binary-packages-of-amd64-">Any plans to offer binary packages of ~amd64 ?</h3>

<p>Not yet. This would mean a ton of rebuilds… If we offer it one day, it’ll 
be at a separate URI for technical reasons.</p>

<p>The advice for now is to stick to stable as much as possible, and locally
add in <code>package.accept_keywords</code> whatever packages from testing you want to use.
This means you can still use a large amount of binary packages, and just
compile the rest yourself.</p>

<h3 id="i-have-found-a-problem-with-portage-or-a-specific-package">I have found a problem, with portage or a specific package!</h3>

<p>Then please <strong>ask for advice</strong> (on IRC, the forums, or a mailing list) and/or 
<a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/"><strong>file a bug!</strong></a></p>

<p>Binary package support has been tested for some time, but with many more people using
it edge cases will certainly occur, and quality bug reports are always appreciated!</p>

<h3 id="any-pretty-pictures">Any pretty pictures?</h3>

<p>Of course! Here’s the amount of binary package data in GByte for each architecture…</p>

<p>The world’s largest traditional entertainment companies face a reckoning in 2024 after losing more than $5 billion in the past year from the streaming services they built to compete with Netflix.</p>
<p>Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Comcast and Paramount—US entertainment conglomerates that have been growing ever larger for decades—are facing pressure to shrink or sell legacy businesses, scale back production and slash costs following billions in losses from their digital platforms.</p>
<p>Shari Redstone, Paramount’s billionaire controlling shareholder, has effectively put the company on the block in recent weeks. She has held talks about selling the Hollywood studio to Skydance, the production company behind <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i>, people familiar with the matter say.</p>
<p>Paramount chief executive Bob Bakish also discussed a possible combination over lunch with Warner CEO David Zaslav in mid-December. In both cases the discussions were said to be at an early stage and people familiar with the talks cautioned that a deal might not materialize.</p>
<p>Beyond their streaming losses, the traditional media groups are facing a weak advertising market, declining television revenues and higher production costs following the Hollywood strikes.</p>
<p>Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners, said Paramount’s deal discussions were a reflection of the “complete and utter panic” in the industry.</p>
<p>“TV advertising is falling far short, cord-cutting is continuing to accelerate, sports costs are going up and the movie business is not performing,” he said. “Everything is going wrong that can go wrong. The only thing [the companies] know how to do to survive is try to merge and cut costs.”</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>But as the traditional media owners struggle, Netflix, the tech group that pioneered the streaming model over a decade ago, has emerged as the winner of the battle to reshape video distribution.</p>
<p>“For much of the past four years, the entertainment industry spent money like drunken sailors to fight the first salvos of the streaming wars,” analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in November. “Now, we are finally starting to feel the hangover and the weight of the unpaid bar bill.”</p>
<p>For companies that have been trying to compete with Netflix, Nathanson added, “the shakeout has begun.”</p>
<p>After a bumpy 2022, Netflix has set itself apart from rivals—most notably by being profitable. Earnings for its most recent quarter soared past Wall Street’s expectations as it added 9 million new subscribers—the strongest rise since early 2020, when Covid-19 lockdowns led to a jump.</p>
<p>“Netflix has pulled away,” says John Martin, co-founder of Pugilist Capital and former chief executive of Turner Broadcasting. For its rivals, he said, the question is “how do you create a viable streaming service with a viable business model? Because they’re not working.”</p>
<p>The leading streaming services aggressively raised prices in 2023. Now, analysts, investors and executives predict that consolidation could be ahead next year as some of the smaller services combine or bow out of the streaming wars.</p>
<p>Warner, home to HBO and the Warner Bros movie studio, has made a small profit at its US streaming services this year, in part by raising prices, aggressively culling some series and licensing others to Netflix. However, this has come at a price: Warner lost more than 2 million streaming subscribers in its two most recent quarters.</p>
<p>The company, which merged with rival Discovery last year, has long been rumored as a potential takeover candidate, with Comcast seen as the most likely buyer. But Zaslav in November hinted that his group wanted to be an acquirer instead of a target.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“There are a lot of . . . excess players in the market. So, this will give us a chance not only to fight to grow in the next year, but to have the kind of balance sheet and the kind of stability . . . that we could be really opportunistic over the next 12 to 24 months,” he said on an earnings call.</p>
<p>The terms of the Warner-Discovery merger barred the group from dealmaking for two years. That period expires on April 8.</p>
<p>Disney, the largest traditional media company, is in the midst of a gutting restructuring that has featured 7,000 job cuts and attacks from activist investors. It lost more than $1.6 billion from its streaming businesses in the first nine months of 2023, during which its Disney+ service gained 8 million subscribers. The company says it will turn a profit in streaming in late 2024.</p>
<p>Bob Iger, Disney chief executive, this year openly pondered whether some of its assets still fit within the company, prompting speculation that he was considering disposals. But no deals emerged, leading some investors to conclude there is little appetite among private equity or tech companies for acquiring legacy businesses.</p>
<p>Paramount’s shares have risen almost 40 percent since early November as sale speculation mounted. The stock rose sharply after the Skydance talks were reported, but both Paramount and Warner shares fell after news of their discussions came to light.</p>
<p>Analysts said the two companies’ high debt levels were an immediate concern for investors. “We suspect investors will focus on pro forma leverage above all else,” Citi analysts wrote in a note last week. They estimated that an all-stock combination of Warner and Paramount could yield at least $1 billion of synergies.</p>
<p>But Greenfield said merging two companies with lossmaking streaming services and large portfolios of declining television assets was not the answer to their problems.</p>
<p>“The right answer should be, let’s stop trying to be in the streaming business,” he said. “The answer is, let’s get smaller and focused and stop trying to be a huge company. Let’s dramatically shrink.”</p>

		<p>Running macOS virtual machines (VMs) on Apple silicon Macs may not seem popular, but it has long been one of Apple’s important goals. Yet, if you do use a virtualiser on an M-series Mac, you’ll know how different it is from those that virtualise macOS and other operating systems on Intel Macs. This article explains why virtualisation is so important, and how it has become so different.</p>
<p>Wind the clock back to WWDC in June 2020, when Craig Federighi announced details of what was coming in Apple silicon, and he identified three pillars to support a rich diversity of software on these new Macs: Universal apps that run on both architectures, Rosetta 2 to translate Intel code to Arm instructions, and virtualisation. At the time, before Apple had even released its Developer Transition Kit, Andreas Wendker went on to demonstrate a pre-release version of Parallels Desktop running Linux as a guest, but there was no mention at all of Windows.</p>
<p>Although the first version of macOS to run on Apple silicon, Big Sur, didn’t support the lightweight virtualisation that was to follow in Monterey, it brought what Apple termed its Virtualization Extensions, an implementation of Arm’s <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100942/0100/AArch64-virtualization?lang=en" target="_blank">AArch64 virtualization</a>.</p>
<p>In the early days of virtualisation, two distinct types were distinguished. Type 1 runs a hypervisor (the core of the virtualiser) direct on the computer’s hardware. Type 2, also known as <em>hosted,</em> runs a primary host operating system on the hardware, and hypervisors then run on top of, or in close conjunction with, that to deliver the same range of services to guest operating systems. A host operating system can run more than one hypervisor at a time, and each hypervisor in turn can run more than one guest, but ultimately all converge on the host operating system and its kernel. These are now much more common on desktop computers, and include popular products such as VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop and Oracle VirtualBox.</p>
<p>Running unmodified guest operating systems is made simpler when there’s hardware support for a hypervisor. Those adopting that approach can use Intel’s VT-x feature set, typically with Extended Page Tables (EPT) and Unrestricted Mode, or, in the case of Arm CPUs, AArch64 virtualization. This still leaves the problem of device support, which can either be left to the virtualiser to address, or can be provided for in a higher-level virtualisation framework. Over the years, and thanks to the effort of many engineers, virtualisers running on Intel hardware including Macs have grown extensive device support, and that’s what we rely on when virtualising macOS on Intel Macs.</p>
<p>Every single hardware device in an Apple silicon chip is different from its equivalent (if there is one) in Intel Macs. Even if Apple had wanted to document them fully for external use, the engineering effort to match device support in Intel Macs would have been too costly for any third party. Thus starting with a hypervisor and expecting others to build a complete virtualiser wasn’t feasible, nor was it likely to result in the high performance that Apple and users expected. What Apple did instead was to build device support into macOS, in the form of Virtio drivers.</p>
<p>Virtio is a standard originally developed by Rusty Russell that provides an abstraction layer over I/O devices. When the guest operating system calls to open a file, for example, that’s passed to a front-end Virtio storage device para-driver, and from there into a Virtio back-end driver that interacts with the storage device. Although this might seem less efficient than traditional virtualisation, in practice it can prove far more efficient. Its most obvious advantage is that creating a virtualiser app becomes a matter of configuring and opening the required Virtio devices, and letting the guest, Virtio and the host get on with it. And that’s essentially what an app using Apple’s Virtualisation framework does.</p>

<p>Apple’s choice of Virtio was undoubtedly swayed by the fact that Linux already has good Virtio support, but at the time macOS had none. In the couple of years preceding the release of Monterey, Apple’s engineers thus set about building Virtio support into macOS, which explains why macOS lightweight virtualisation is only available on Monterey and later hosts, and when running Monterey and later guests. As implemented in macOS (both as guest and host), there are also extensions to support keyboard and pointing devices, a shared clipboard (‘Spice’), and high-performance graphics with Metal and GPU support.</p>
<p>In the Virtio model, providing such support is the task of the operating system, not the virtualiser. For vendors like VMware and Parallels this reduces not only the cost of development, but also the commercial value of their products; there’s no scope for either of them to engineer better or faster graphics support, as that’s determined by features provided in both guest and host operating systems, via Virtio or an equivalent. That puts Apple in charge of what hardware and features are supported by virtualisation on Apple silicon, and the difficulties that have arisen over Apple ID access for VMs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it guarantees optimum performance in VMs. Not only is their CPU and GPU code run direct on the hardware, just as in the host, but Virtio devices deliver almost as good performance as on the host.</p>
<p>The reward for Apple is flexibility in the future of macOS. Running older versions of macOS in a VM enables users to run Intel-only apps long after Rosetta 2 support is dropped from the current macOS, and for newer Apple silicon Macs to run software that’s incompatible with their minimum version of macOS. Using either Linux or macOS, developers can distribute Docker-like lightweight VM packages, something already done by Cirrus Labs’ <a href="https://tart.run/" target="_blank">Tart</a>.</p>
<p>Virtualisation may seem to be a minority pursuit just now. That’s likely to change over the coming few years, thanks to lightweight virtualisation and Virtio.</p>

<p>Just before the holiday break, the US Energy Information Agency released data on the country's electrical generation. Because of delays in reporting, the monthly data runs through October, so it doesn't provide a complete picture of the changes we've seen in 2023. But some of the trends now seem locked in for the year: wind and solar are likely to be in a dead heat with coal, and all carbon-emissions-free sources combined will account for roughly 40 percent of US electricity production.</p>
<h2>Tracking trends</h2>
<p>Having data through October necessarily provides an incomplete picture of 2023. There are several factors that can cause the later months of the year to differ from the earlier ones. Some forms of generation are seasonal—notably solar, which has its highest production over the summer months. Weather can also play a role, as unusually high demand for heating in the winter months could potentially require that older fossil fuel plants be brought online. It also influences production from hydroelectric plants, creating lots of year-to-year variation.</p>
<p>Finally, everything's taking place against a backdrop of booming construction of solar and natural gas. So, it's entirely possible that we will have built enough new solar over the course of the year to offset the seasonal decline at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Let's look at the year-to-date data to get a sense of the trends and where things stand. We'll then check the monthly data for October to see if any of those trends show indications of reversing.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The most important takeaway is that energy use is largely flat. Overall electricity production year-to-date is down by just over one percent from 2022, though demand was higher this October compared to last year. This is in keeping with a general trend of flat-to-declining electricity use as greater efficiency is offsetting factors like population growth and expanding electrification.</p>
<p>That's important because it means that any newly added capacity will displace the use of existing facilities. And, at the moment, that displacement is happening to coal.</p>
<h2>Can’t hide the decline</h2>
<p>At this point last year, coal had produced nearly 20 percent of the electricity in the US. This year, it's down to 16.2 percent, and only accounts for 15.5 percent of October's production. Wind and solar combined are presently at 16 percent of year-to-date production, meaning they're likely to be in a dead heat with coal this year and easily surpass it next year.</p>
<p>Year-to-date, wind is largely unchanged since 2022, accounting for about 10 percent of total generation, and it's up to over 11 percent in the October data, so that's unlikely to change much by the end of the year. Solar has seen a significant change, going from five to six percent of the total electricity production (this figure includes both utility-scale generation and the EIA's estimate of residential production). And it's largely unchanged in October alone, suggesting that new construction is offsetting some of the seasonal decline.</p>

<p>Hydroelectric production has dropped by about six percent since last year, causing it to slip from 6.1 percent to 5.8 percent of the total production. Depending on the next couple of months, that may allow solar to pass hydro on the list of renewables.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Combined, the three major renewables account for about 22 percent of year-to-date electricity generation, up about 0.5 percent since last year. They're up by even more in the October data, placing them well ahead of both nuclear and coal.</p>
<p>Nuclear itself is largely unchanged, allowing it to pass coal thanks to the latter's decline. Its output has been boosted by a new, 1.1 Gigawatt reactor that come online this year (a second at the same site, Vogtle in Georgia, is set to start commercial production at any moment). But that's likely to be the end of new nuclear capacity for this decade; the challenge will be keeping existing plants open despite their age and high costs.</p>
<p>If we combine nuclear and renewables under the umbrella of carbon-free generation, then that's up by nearly 1 percent since 2022 and is likely to surpass 40 percent for the first time.</p>
<p>The only thing that's keeping carbon-free power from growing faster is natural gas, which is the fastest-growing source of generation at the moment, going from 40 percent of the year-to-date total in 2022 to 43.3 percent this year. (It's actually slightly below that level in the October data.) The explosive growth of natural gas in the US has been a big environmental win, since it creates the least particulate pollution of all the fossil fuels, as well as the lowest carbon emissions per unit of electricity. But its use is going to need to start dropping soon if the US is to meet its climate goals, so it will be critical to see whether its growth flat lines over the next few years.</p>
<p>Outside of natural gas, however, all the trends in US generation are good, especially considering that the rise of renewable production would have seemed like an impossibility a decade ago. Unfortunately, the pace is currently too slow for the US to have a net-zero electric grid by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>It all started with this toot from <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/web/accounts/1">Aurynn</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do I just need to put one screen in portrait mode?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the past I had experimented with using portrait displays for reading and programming. The ability to display large amount of text is certainly appealing.</p>
<h3 id="boring">Boring</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sprocketfox.io/xssfox/images/PXL_20211202_034116753.jpg" alt="Monitor in portrait mode">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But is this the most optimal display for software development? Lets evaluate</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rotation</th>
<th>Advantages</th>
<th>Disadvantages</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0°</td>
<td>Works with most applications. Video content is usually in wide format</td>
<td>Websites and documents usually end up with a lot of whitespace and padding around them</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>90°</td>
<td>Great for text documents - can read down like a book page</td>
<td>Movies don’t display well. Viewing angle problems</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here you might think we might done. But there are soooooo many more angles we can try. This is a little tricky on macOS and Windows but on Linux we have all the freedom we need.</p>
<h3 id="odd-but-ok">Odd but ok.</h3>
<p>We have a little tool called <code>xrandr</code> (x resize and rotate). We can use it to rotate the screen around to any angle we want. In practice I couldn’t get this to work on my MacBook. My desktop on the otherhand it had no problems. So lets try a few out.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sprocketfox.io/xssfox/images/PXL_20211202_034333303.jpg" alt="Monitor with a 1 degree rotation">
    <figcaption></figcaption>

<figure>
    <img src="https://sprocketfox.io/xssfox/images/PXL_20211202_034744788.jpg" alt="Monitor with a 45 degree rotation">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>45° - I run out of space</p>
</blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rotation</th>
<th>Advantages</th>
<th>Disadvantages</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1°</td>
<td>Handy if your desk is on a slight slope</td>
<td>fonts render a little weird</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>45°</td>
<td>Middle ground between vertical and horizontal</td>
<td>doesn’t fit well with non square aspect ratios</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>One neat thing about 45° is that it gives us pretty close to the diagonal. But not on my ultra wide. Due to maths, the amount we’d need to rotate is based on the angle of a triangle which match the aspect ration of the screen we are using. This ends up being about 22° for a 21:9 ratio.</p>
<h3 id="the-perfect-rotation">The perfect rotation</h3>

<p>So this here I think is the best monitor orientation for software development. It provides the longest line lengths and no longer need to worry about that pesky 80 column limit.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-this">How do I do this?</h3>
<p>First off, I could only get this to work in xorg - no wayland support yet. <code>xrandr --output HDMI-3 --transform lots of numbers here</code> takes a transformation matrix thats used to position the screen. We can use that to rotate the display.</p>
<p>The basic syntax that we need for rotating and shifting is this</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cos(x),-sin(x),shift_left,sin(x),cos(x),shift_up,0,0,1
</code></pre><p>Some examples</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span><span># these won't shift / center the display as I don't know the resolution</span>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/">https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38801221">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
<p>



<span data-pagefind-body="">
    
	<p>Reading the title you might be thinking "<em>Yeah no shit Robb of course the web<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> is fantastic it's literally the cornerstone of all commerce and communications in the modern world</em>". Or maybe you're not thinking that. But I'm not talking about the web as a whole, I'm talking about the open web. The <em>come-do-cool-things-with-our-api</em> web. The open standards web. The <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indie web</a>.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Services like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree</a> exist because Facebook, TikTok, et al decided that links are okay but only if it's to their stuff. You, the creator of the video/photo/whatever only get one link, better make it a good one. Even then, my wife sometimes sends me links of Facebook <em>don't-call-it-tiktoks</em> and unless I install the mobile app, those links just don't work.</p>
<p>The <em>real</em> web is built on links. Hyper ones, in fact. Links you can share on your website. Links you can send to your mates. Links to pages that can be indexed by search engines so you can find things again (in theory).</p>
<p>Look at this journey <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2023/11/app-defaults/">Chris went through to stumble upon the App Defaults project</a>:<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was adding a link to omg.lol, a blog and email hosting service that's cute AND easy AND (relatively) cheap, to my newsletter.</p>
<p>While browsing their help and info page, I saw that they offer a /now/ feature that lets you update the world on what you're working on, reading, watching, etc... now. Old school internet at it's best.</p>
<p>I clicked through to the omg.lol /now garden which has examples of how people are using /now to update the world.</p>
<p>I randomly picked Rebecca Owen's /now page.</p>
<p>Then I clicked back through to her omg.lol page to see how she was using it.</p>
<p>I saw she had a blog, so I checked that out.</p>
<p>The most recent post on Rebecca's blog was one called Default Apps 2023. That's clickbait-up-arrow.gif material for me.</p>
<p>She had included a link to an episode a podcast called Hemispheric Views, and this defaults page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is cool. That is how we should find interesting things. With links. The big social media sites have decided that actually no, we don't like links. Just sort of "find" things and if you don't find it well tough shit. Sharing interesting websites, blogs, and articles on your own site is the way to go. Make a <a href="https://blogroll.org/">blogroll</a>. Make a <a href="https://rknight.me/podcasts/roll/">podroll</a>. Share links on your Mastodon account.</p>
<h3>Blogs and RSS</h3>
<p>Check out <a href="https://aboutfeeds.com/">About Feeds</a> to see how RSS works and apps that work with it. I use <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>.</p>
<p>Blogs and RSS never died. Some of us just took a little break from it while we all shitposted on Twitter for likes, retweets, and validation. While we wrote long, unfindable threads instead of blog posts. I'm as guilty of this as anyone.</p>
<p>Get an RSS app or service and install an extension that auto detects RSS feeds. Keep an eye on it while you're browsing around and grab every feed you see. You can easily unsubscribe if it's not for you. Here's over <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">300 blogs to get you started</a>.</p>
<p>Chris McLeod said this about blogging in his post, <a href="https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/blogging-is-where-its-at-again/">"Blogging is where it's at, again"</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>stumbling into such a trove of&nbsp;<em>active</em>&nbsp;blogs has enthused me about blogging as a medium again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's right. Blogging <em>is</em> where it's at. Get a blog. Post some stuff.</p>
<p>If you have a website, don't forget to <a href="https://rknight.me/please-expose-your-rss/">expose your RSS</a>. Have a big prominent button. Make sure it's in your <code>head</code> for auto-detection. Maybe start an <a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">RSS club</a>. Post some wonderful things, or sad things, or <em>only-interesting-to-you</em> things.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Extras</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a <code>/now</code> page to your site. Check out a <a href="https://nownownow.com/">whole load of them here</a> and <a href="https://now.garden/">on the now garden</a>.</li>
<li>Add a <code>/uses</code> page to list what apps and hardware and whatever else you use. <a href="https://uses.tech/">uses.tech</a> has nearly 800 examples.</li>
<li>If you're really feeling adventurous you can <a href="https://rknight.me/adding-webmentions-to-your-site/">add webmentions</a> to your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's your website, you can add literally anything you want<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> and no one can stop you.</p>
<h3>Useful links to get started</h3>
<p>This is all well and good but if you don't already have a website it can be daunting to know where to go.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> - $5 a month, has cross-posting to a whole load of places</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> - Free</li>
<li><a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb">weblog.lol via omg.lol</a> - $20 a year also includes a Mastodon server, pastebin, profile page, now page, and some other cool things</li>
<li><a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear</a> - free</li>
<li><a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> - free</li>
<li><a href="https://pika.page/">Pika</a> - free</li>
<li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> if you want to dig into code and run your own thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reach out to me on Mastodon if you have questions and I'll do what I can to help get you started.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The real web, the small web, the indie web is amazing. Don't give Facebook and the rest of these clowns your content. Don't give them the time or your attention. Get a blog, a website, a Mastodon account, something <em>you control</em>, and share links to cool things you find. Make a list of your favourite blogs or websites or photos of cats. Write about a pizza you had that was delicious. Share a recipe. Go down a rabbit hole for hours on end adding weird stuff to your site. Just do it somewhere you control because the <em>real</em> web is fantastic.</p>

<span>=== begin of license ===</span>

<span>VIM LICENSE</span><span id="_vim-license"></span>

I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
    that they <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> include this <a href="#license">license</a> text.  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a>
    include this <a href="#license">license</a> text.  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Vim scripts.

II) It <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> allowed to distribute <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This <a href="#license">license</a> text <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> be included unmodified.
    2) The modified Vim <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#a%29">a)</a> If you make changes to Vim yourself, you <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> clearly describe in
	  the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#distribution">distribution</a> how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
	  (in any way) for <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
	  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> make your changes, including source code, available to the
	  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
	  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
	  maintainer will <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> with your changes and under what <a href="#license">license</a> they
	  will be distributed <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
	  then this license, or <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> later version, also applies to your changes.
	  The current maintainers are listed here: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/vim/people">https://github.com/orgs/vim/people</a>.
	  If this changes <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
	  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> completely
	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
	  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
       b) If you have received <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified Vim that was distributed <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a>
	  mentioned under <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#a%29">a)</a> you are allowed to further distribute <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a>
	  unmodified, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> mentioned <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> I).  If you make additional changes the
	  text under <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#a%29">a)</a> applies to those changes.
       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
	  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
	  context diff.  You can choose what <a href="#license">license</a> to use for new code you
	  add.  The changes and their <a href="#license">license</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> not restrict others from
	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
       d) When you have <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified Vim which includes changes <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> mentioned
	  under c), you can distribute <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> without the source code for the
	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
	  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#-">-</a> The <a href="#license">license</a> that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
	    version of Vim without fee or restriction.
	  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#-">-</a> You keep the changes for <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> least three years after last
	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
	    any way) for the changes within this period, you <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> make them
	    available to him.
	  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#-">-</a> You clearly describe in the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#distribution">distribution</a> how to contact you.  This
	    contact information <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> remain valid for <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> least three years
	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> long
	    <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> possible.
       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
	  any later version.
    3) <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#A">A</a> message <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> be added, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> least in the output of the "<a href="https://vimhelp.org/various.txt.html#%3Aversion">:version</a>"
       command and in the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#intro">intro</a> screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
       <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> able to see that <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> was modified.  When distributing <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> mentioned
       under 2)e) adding the message <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> only required for <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> far <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> this does
       not conflict with the <a href="#license">license</a> used for the changes.
    4) The contact information <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> required under 2)a) and 2)d) <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections.

III) If you distribute <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
     the Vim <a href="#license">license</a> for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> this <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a>
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> server and e-mailing the URL.
     If the number of changes <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> small (e.g., <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified Makefile) e-mailing <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
     context <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#diff">diff</a> will do.  The e-mail address to be used <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a>
     &lt;maintainer@vim.org&gt;

IV)  It <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> not allowed to remove this <a href="#license">license</a> from the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#distribution">distribution</a> of the Vim
     sources, parts of <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> or from <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified version.  You may use this
     <a href="#license">license</a> for previous Vim releases instead of the <a href="#license">license</a> that they came
     with, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> your option.

<a href="#Kibaale">Kibaale</a> Children's Centre (KCC) <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> located in Kibaale, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> small town in the
south of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa.  The area <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> known <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> Rakai
District.  The population <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> mostly farmers.  Although people are poor, there
usually <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> enough food.  But this district <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> suffering from AIDS more than
any other part of the world.  Some say that <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> started there.  Estimations are
that in the past 10 to 30% of the Ugandans are infected with HIV.  Because
parents die, there are many orphans.  In this district about 60,000 children
have lost one or both parents, out of <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> population of 350,000.  Although AIDS
<a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> now mostly under control, the problems are still continuing.

The children need <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> lot of help.  The KCC <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> working hard to provide the needy
with food, medical care and education.  Food and medical care to keep them
healthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the
future.  KCC works on <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> Christian base, but <a href="https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help">help</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> given to children of any
religion.

The key to solving the problems in this area <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> education.  This has been
neglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil
wars.  Now that the government <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> stable again, the children and parents have
to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections.  There <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a>
also <a href="https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help">help</a> for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> to
prevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food.

Most of the orphans are living in an extended family.  An uncle or older
sister <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> taking care of them.  Because these families are big and the income
(if any) <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> low, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> child <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> lucky if <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> gets healthy food.  Clothes, medical
care and schooling <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> beyond its reach.  To <a href="https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help">help</a> these needy children, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
sponsorship program was <a href="https://vimhelp.org/change.txt.html#put">put</a> into place.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#A">A</a> child can be financially adopted.
For <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> few dollars <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> month KCC sees to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> that the child gets indispensable
items, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that
needs to be done for the child and the family that supports it.

Besides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up
needs to be improved.  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods.
There <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> demonstration school <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> the centre and teacher trainings are given.
Health workers are being trained, hygiene education <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> carried out and
households are stimulated to build <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> proper latrine.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> helped setting up <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
production site for cement slabs.  These are used to build <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> good latrine.
They are sold below cost price.

There <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> clinic <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> the project, which provides children and their family
medical help.  Since 2020 <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> maternity ward was added and 24/7 service <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a>
available.  When needed, transport to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> hospital <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> offered.  Immunization
programs are carried out and <a href="https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help">help</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> provided when an epidemic <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> breaking out
(measles and cholera have been <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> problem).

Summer 1994 to summer 1995 <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> spent <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> whole year <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> the centre, working <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
volunteer.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water
and sanitation.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> learned that the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help">help</a> that the KCC provides really helps.
When <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> came back to Holland, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> wanted to continue supporting KCC.  To <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> this
I'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program.  Please consider one
of these possibilities:

1.  Sponsor <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> child in primary school: 17 <a href="https://vimhelp.org/digraph.txt.html#euro">euro</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> month (or more).
2.  Sponsor <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> child in secondary school: 25 <a href="https://vimhelp.org/digraph.txt.html#euro">euro</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> month (or more).
3.  Sponsor the clinic: Any amount <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> month or quarter
4.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#A">A</a> one-time donation

Compared with other organizations that <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> child sponsorship the amounts are
very low.  This <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> because the money goes directly to the centre.  Less than
5% <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> used for administration.  This <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> possible because this <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> small
organization that works with volunteers.  If you would like to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/sponsor.txt.html#sponsor">sponsor</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
child, you should have the intention to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> this for <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> least one year.

How <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> you know that the money will be spent right?  First of all you have my
personal guarantee <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#author">author</a> of Vim.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> trust the people that are working
<a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> the centre, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> know them personally.  Furthermore, the centre has been
co-sponsored and inspected by World Vision, Save the Children Fund and <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> now
under the supervision of Pacific Academy Outreach Society.  The centre <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a>
visited about once <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> year to check the progress (at our own cost).  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> have
visited the centre myself many times, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/starting.txt.html#starting">starting</a> in 1993.  The visit reports are
on the <a href="#ICCF">ICCF</a> web site.
