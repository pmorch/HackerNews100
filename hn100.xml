<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The CMV Mod Team needs to inform the CMV community about an unauthorized experiment conducted by researchers from the University of Zurich on CMV users. This experiment deployed AI-generated comments to study how AI could be used to change views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>CMV rules do not allow the use of undisclosed AI generated content or bots on our sub.&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers did not contact us ahead of the study and if they had, we would have declined.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have requested an apology from the researchers and asked that this research not be published, among other complaints. As discussed below, our concerns have not been substantively addressed by the University of Zurich or the researchers.</p>

<p>You have a right to know about this experiment. Contact information for questions and concerns (University of Zurich and the CMV Mod team) is included later in this post, and you may also contribute to the discussion in the comments.</p>

<p>The researchers from the University of Zurich have been invited to participate via the user account&nbsp;<a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/LLMResearchTeam/">u/LLMResearchTeam</a>.</p>

<h2>Rules Clarification for this Post Only</h2>

<p>This section is for those who are thinking "How do I comment about fake AI accounts on the sub without violating Rule 3?"&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, comment rules don't apply to meta posts by the CMV Mod team although we still expect the conversation to remain civil.&nbsp;&nbsp;But to make it clear...<strong><em>Rule 3 does not prevent you from discussing fake AI accounts referenced in this post.</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Experiment Notification</h2>

<p>Last month, the CMV Mod Team received mod mail from researchers at the University of Zurich as "part of a disclosure step in the study approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Zurich (Approval number: 24.04.01)."</p>

<p>The study was described as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Over the past few months, we used multiple accounts to posts published on CMV. Our experiment assessed LLM's persuasiveness in an ethical scenario, where people ask for arguments against views they hold. In commenting, we did not disclose that an AI was used to write comments, as this would have rendered the study unfeasible. While we did not write any comments ourselves, we manually reviewed each comment posted to ensure they were not harmful. We recognize that our experiment broke the community rules against AI-generated comments and apologize. We believe, however, that given the high societal importance of this topic, it was crucial to conduct a study of this kind, even if it meant disobeying the rules."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The researchers provided us a link to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eo4SHrKGPErTzL1t_QmQhfZGU27jKBjx/view?usp=drive_link">first draft of the results</a>.</p>

<p>The researchers also provided us a list of active accounts and accounts that had been removed by Reddit admins for violating Reddit terms of service.  A list of currently active accounts is at the end of this post.</p>

<h2>Ethics Concerns</h2>

<p>The researchers argue that psychological manipulation of OPs on this sub is justified because the lack of existing field experiments constitutes an unacceptable gap in the body of knowledge. However, If OpenAI can create&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/s/zJ8WyNIf4B">a more ethical research design when doing this</a>, these researchers should be expected to do the same. Psychological manipulation risks posed by LLMs is an extensively studied topic. It is not necessary to experiment on non-consenting human subjects.</p>

<p>AI was used to target OPs in personal ways that they did not sign up for, compiling as much data on identifying features as possible by scrubbing the Reddit platform. Here is an excerpt from the draft conclusions of the research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personalization: In addition to the post’s content, LLMs were provided with personal attributes of the OP (gender, age, ethnicity, location, and political orientation), as inferred from their posting history using another LLM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some high-level examples of how AI was deployed include:</p>

<ul>
<li>AI pretending to be a victim of rape</li>
<li>AI acting as a trauma counselor specializing in abuse</li>
<li>AI accusing members of a religious group of "caus[ing] the deaths of hundreds of innocent traders and farmers and villagers."</li>
<li>AI posing as a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter</li>
<li>AI posing as a person who received substandard care in a foreign hospital.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an excerpt from one comment (SA trigger warning for comment):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I'm a male survivor of (willing to call it) statutory rape. When the legal lines of consent are breached but there's still that weird gray area of 'did I want it?' I was 15, and this was over two decades ago before reporting laws were what they are today. She was 22. She targeted me and several other kids, no one said anything, we all kept quiet. This was her MO."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See list of accounts at the end of this post - you can view comment history in context for the AI accounts that are still active.</p>

<p>During the experiment, researchers switched from the planned "values based arguments" originally authorized by the ethics commission to this type of "personalized and fine-tuned arguments." They did not first consult with the University of Zurich ethics commission before making the change. Lack of formal ethics review for this change raises serious concerns.</p>

<p><strong>We think this was wrong. We do not think that "it has not been done before" is an excuse to do an experiment like this.</strong></p>

<h2>Complaint Filed</h2>

<p>The Mod Team responded to this notice by filing an ethics complaint with the University of Zurich IRB, citing multiple concerns about the impact to this community, and serious gaps we felt existed in the ethics review process.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also requested that the University agree to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advise against publishing this article, as the results were obtained unethically, and take any steps within the university's power to prevent such publication.</li>
<li>Conduct an internal review of how this study was approved and whether proper oversight was maintained. The researchers had previously referred to a "provision that allows for group applications to be submitted even when the specifics of each study are not fully defined at the time of application submission." To us, this provision presents a high risk of abuse, the results of which are evident in the wake of this project.</li>
<li>IIssue a public acknowledgment of the University's stance on the matter and apology to our users. This apology should be posted on the University's website, in a publicly available press release, and further posted by us on our subreddit, so that we may reach our users.</li>
<li>Commit to stronger oversight of projects involving AI-based experiments involving human participants.</li>
<li>Require that researchers obtain explicit permission from platform moderators before engaging in studies involving active interactions with users.</li>
<li>Provide any further relief that the University deems appropriate under the circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<h2>University of Zurich Response</h2>

<p>We recently received a response from the Chair UZH Faculty of Arts and Sciences Ethics Commission which:</p>

<ul>
<li>Informed us that the University of Zurich takes these issues very seriously.</li>
<li>Clarified that the commission does not have legal authority to compel non-publication of research.</li>
<li>Indicated that a careful investigation had taken place.</li>
<li>Indicated that the Principal Investigator has been issued a formal warning.</li>
<li>Advised that the committee "will adopt stricter scrutiny, including coordination with communities prior to experimental studies in the future."&nbsp;</li>
<li>Reiterated that the researchers felt that "...the bot, while not fully in compliance with the terms, did little harm."&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The University of Zurich provided an opinion concerning publication.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the University of Zurich wrote that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This project yields important insights, and the risks (e.g. trauma etc.) are minimal. This means that suppressing publication is not proportionate to the importance of the insights the study yields."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We did not immediately notify the CMV community because we wanted to allow time for the University of Zurich to respond to the ethics complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of transparency, we are now sharing what we know.</p>

<p>Our sub is a decidedly human space that rejects undisclosed AI as a core value.&nbsp;&nbsp;People do not come here to discuss their views with AI or to be experimented upon.&nbsp;&nbsp;People who visit our sub deserve a space free from this type of intrusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This experiment was clearly conducted in a way that violates the sub rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reddit requires that all users adhere not only to the site-wide Reddit rules, but also the rules of the subs in which they participate.</p>

<p>This research demonstrates nothing new.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already existing research on how personalized arguments influence people.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also existing research on how AI can provide personalized content if trained properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;OpenAI very recently conducted&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/openai-used-this-subreddit-to-test-ai-persuasion/">similar research</a>&nbsp;using a downloaded copy of&nbsp;<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/">r/changemyview</a>&nbsp;data on AI persuasiveness without experimenting on non-consenting human subjects. We are unconvinced that there are "important insights" that could only be gained by violating this sub.</p>

<p>We have concerns about this study's design including potential confounding impacts for how the LLMs were trained and deployed, which further erodes the value of this research.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, multiple LLM models were used for different aspects of the research, which creates questions about whether the findings are sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not intend to serve as a peer review committee for the researchers, but we do wish to point out that this study does not appear to have been robustly designed any more than it has had any semblance of a robust ethics review process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that it is our position that even a properly designed study conducted in this way would be unethical.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We requested that the researchers do not publish the results of this unauthorized experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers claim that this experiment "yields important insights" and that "suppressing publication is not proportionate to the importance of the insights the study yields."&nbsp;&nbsp;We strongly reject this position.</p>

<p>Community-level experiments impact communities, not just individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Allowing publication would dramatically encourage further intrusion by researchers, contributing to increased community vulnerability to future non-consensual human subjects experimentation.</strong>  Researchers should have a disincentive to violating communities in this way, and non-publication of findings is a reasonable consequence. We find the researchers' disregard for future community harm caused by publication offensive.</p>

<p>We continue to strongly urge the researchers at the University of Zurich to reconsider their stance on publication.</p>

<p dir="auto">When mathematical operations on floats are applied incorrectly (for example, <code>0/0</code>), the result is a special value
called Not a Number, or NaN for short. NaNs are represented as floating point numbers with the exponent set to all 1s
and at least one non-zero bit in the fraction part.</p>
<p dir="auto">Which means I can commit crimes and smuggle data in the fraction part. IEEE is <em>not</em> going to stop me!</p>
<p dir="auto">This trick is silly, but it works. Naturally, I couldn't resist overdoing the naan pun.</p>

It’s a cross between the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhanceButton">Enhance Button</a> and <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientDatabase">Omniscient Database</a> TV Tropes.</p>
<p>The process is simple. Snap a photograph of somewhere, ideally without putting any obvious landmarks in there. Feed it to ChatGPT o3 (or o4-mini) and prompt “Guess where this photo was taken”. Let it churn.</p>
<p>(I found I needed to turn off all of ChatGPT’s memory features first or it would cheat and use context from my previous conversations.)</p>
<p>I gave it this photo, taken while sat at an outside bar near my home in El Granada, California. I think it’s a pretty solid challenge: not many identifying features, just a bit of road, an anonymous house and some hills in the background:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/guess-location.jpg" alt="Residential scene with a cream-colored house with gray roof, white picket fence, and two white vehicles parked nearby. In the foreground is a glass-enclosed fire table and orange flowers. Background shows hills under an overcast sky with power lines crossing above. A person in red stands between vehicles near a yellow directional sign."></p>
<p>... and off it went.</p>
<p>I’ve shared <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/680c6160-a0c4-8006-a4de-cb8aff785f46">the full transcript here</a>—be sure to expand the “Thought for 6m 48s” link to see the full details of how it attacked the problem.</p>
<p>It starts with a very weird mistake: it briefly pretends that it can’t see the image at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user uploaded an image and is asking me to guess the location. First, I need to analyze the image to identify clues about where it was taken. Since I can’t actually see images, I’ll rely on the metadata. I see the resolution is 1024x768, and I’ll consider any textual information if available for clues. Unfortunately, I don’t have access to the image visually, so I’ll proceed with this approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it snaps out of that and starts using its vision abilities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The image shows a residential neighborhood with small houses, one of which is light green with a white picket fence and a grey roof. The fire pit and signposts hint at a restaurant or cafe, possibly near the coast. The environment, with olive trees and California poppies, suggests a coastal California location, perhaps Central Coast like Cambria or Morro Bay. The pastel-colored houses and the hills in the background resemble areas like Big Sur. A license plate could offer more, but it’s hard to read.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now here’s where it leaps straight into science fiction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alright, I’m going to zoom into the license plate to try to confirm the state, as it could help identify the location more precisely. The plate might give me clues about where this photo was taken, especially if it’s from a recognizable state. Let’s see if that’s visible enough to be useful!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It runs some Python code!</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><span># crop license plate area</span>
<span>w</span>, <span>h</span> <span>=</span> <span>img</span>.<span>size</span>
<span># approximate area: roughly center x maybe 1700? Actually width is likely &gt; 3024? Let's print size</span>
<span>print</span>(<span>img</span>.<span>size</span>)

(<span>3456</span>, <span>4608</span>)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Frustratingly the shared conversation doesn’t include most of the other Python it used (the sharing feature is still quite buggy). Here’s a screenshot of what happened next:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/zoom-crop.jpg" alt="| want to crop a small bounding box around the license plate. The car behind the picket fence is likely near the center, so I'll focus on that area. I'll define the region with approximate coordinates: x 1500 to 2000 and y 2500 to 3000. By selecting this region, I can better evaluate the plate and see if it's clearer to identify. Let's manually crop and inspect it. Then it says Analyzing Data, and runs Python code: crop = img.crop( (1300, 2400, 2200, 3200)); plt.imshow (crop); plt.axis( off&quot;); Output is (-0.5, 899.5, 799.5, -0.5). It shows the cropped photo and says: The license plate appears to follow the standard California design — white background with red characters. To be sure, I'll zoom in on the area around the plate to check for more details and confirm the state. This could give me a stronger clue as to where the photo was taken. Let's see if it's clearer now!"></p>
<p>It kept running like this for <em>six more minutes</em>—cropping and zooming to an area of the photo, musing about what it could see, comparing it to previous observations and then cropping and zooming and analyzing again.</p>
<p>To cut straight to the end, here’s the final answer it came up with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m getting strong Central-Coast-California vibes from this scene:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Clue</th>
<th>What it suggests</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>California-style license plate on the SUV</td>
<td>We’re almost certainly in CA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Masses of blooming California poppies, an olive tree, and a cool, marine-layer sky</td>
<td>Typical coastal‐central-CA vegetation and weather</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low pastel beach cottages with white picket fences and a rope-and-post patio rail</td>
<td>Common architecture in the little beach towns between Santa Cruz and Pismo</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rolling green coastal range right behind town (no tall peaks, no snow)</td>
<td>Fits the Santa Lucia / Santa Cruz coastal hills</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Put together, that points to one of the small Highway 1 villages. The mix of cottages and the immediate backdrop of hills feels most like <strong>Cambria, California</strong> (just north of Morro Bay and Cayucos). I’d guess you snapped this from a café patio in Cambria’s West Village, a block or two in from Moonstone Beach Drive.</p>
<p>(If I’m off, my next guess would be Half Moon Bay–El Granada further north—but Cambria is my first instinct!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How did it do? Central Coast California was exactly right. Cambria, California was about 200 miles off... but the “my next guess” was spot on! The photo was indeed taken in El Granada, a tiny town just north of Half Moon Bay.</p>
<p>I’m confident it didn’t cheat and look at the EXIF data on the photograph, because if it had cheated it wouldn’t have guessed Cambria first. If you’re still suspicious, try stripping EXIF by taking a screenshot and run an experiment yourself—I’ve tried this and it still works the same way. <strong>Update:</strong> vessenes on Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43732506#43732866">reported</a> an instance where it did use the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ExifTags.html">ExifTags</a> package and lie about it, but it was at least visible <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6802e229-c6a0-800f-898a-44171a0c7de4">in the thinking trace</a>.</p>

<p>o3 certainly isn’t the only model that can do this: I’ve tried similar things with Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet and been impressed by the results there as well, although they don’t have that extravagant ability to “zoom”.</p>

<p>How much does the zooming actually help? My suspicion is that the model’s vision input operates at quite a low resolution, so cropping closer to a license plate does have a meaningful impact on the process. I’m not sure it justifies 25 separate cropping operations for one photo though, that feels a little performative to me.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://claude.ai/share/231756c9-6fe6-4f63-9f34-c6c7e1299a44">Claude 3.7 Sonnet “extended thinking”</a> guessing “a small to mid-sized California coastal town”. I tried <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a> but it cheated and said “Given that my current location context is El Granada, California...”—so I tried Gemini 2.5 Pro via their API <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6a5a9407326d8366105f95e5524f3694">and got</a> a confidently incorrect guess of “the patio of The Hidden Kitchen restaurant in Cayucos, California”.</p>

<p>What’s different here with o3, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/#o3-and-o4-mini-are-really-good-at-search">as with search</a>, is that the tool usage is integrated into the “thinking” phase of the response.</p>

<p>Tools that can be used as part of that dedicated chain-of-thought sequence are an astonishingly powerful new pattern for these models. I expect we’ll see this from other vendors soon.</p>

<h4 id="what-to-make-of-this-">What to make of this?</h4>
<p>First, this is <strong>really fun</strong>. Watching the model’s thought process as it churns through the photo, pans and zooms and discusses different theories about where it could be is <em>wildly entertaining</em>. It’s like living in an episode of CSI.</p>
<p>It’s also <strong>deeply dystopian</strong>. Technology can identify locations from photographs now. It’s vitally important that people understand how easy this is—if you have any reason at all to be concerned about your safety, you need to know that any photo you share—even a photo as bland as my example above—could be used to identify your location.</p>
<p>As is frequently the case with modern AI, the fact that this technology is openly available to almost anyone has negative and positive implications. As with image generation, it’s important that people can see what this stuff can do first hand. Seeing this in action is a visceral lesson in what’s now possible.</p>

<h4 id="update-o3-does-have-rough-location-access">Update: o3 does have rough location access</h4>
<p>I’m embarrassed that I didn’t think to check this, but it turns out o3 does have <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/680ceb49-a184-8006-9979-d73169325297">a loose model of your location made available to it now</a>—presumably as part of its improved search feature. It knows I’m in Half Moon Bay.</p>
<p>The location guessing trick still works independently of that though. I tried it on photos
I’d taken thousands of miles from my location (EXIF stripped via screenshotting)—one in rural Madagascar (<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/madagascar.jpg">photo</a>, <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/680cec52-e0d4-8006-bf80-952888b018fd">transcript</a>), one in urban Buenos Aires (<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/buenos-aires.jpg">photo</a>, <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/680cec1c-f0c4-8006-86c3-7dc70104bd3f">transcript</a>), and it gave convincing answers for both.</p>

<p>I’ve also seen examples from numerous other people replicating these results for their own diverse collections of photos.</p>

  <p><strong><em>February 2025 Issue</em></strong></p><p><strong>Carolyn Bruckmann, Harvard Kennedy School MPP ‘25</strong></p><p>The so-called “Friendship Recession” is making its way into the vernacular—a profound shift in how Americans experience and sustain friendships. The data paints a stark picture. According to the <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/">American Perspectives Survey</a>, the percentage of U.S. adults who report having no close friends has quadrupled to 12% since 1990, while the percentage of those with ten or more close friends has fallen by nearly threefold. The foundations of the crisis were laid long before lockdowns. For decades, Americans consistently spent about 6.5 hours a week with friends. Then, between 2014 and 2019, that number plummeted to just four hours per week.</p><p>To be sure, systemic forces underlie this shift. <a href="https://campuspress.yale.edu/ledger/urban-sprawl-a-growing-problem/">Suburban sprawl</a> has physically distanced us from one another. <a href="https://www.ericklinenberg.com/books">The government slowed down</a> its investment in and construction of <a href="https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2024/07/03/vanishing-third-places-and-what-can-be-done">third spaces</a>—such as community centers, parks, and coffee shops—which has left fewer places for organic social interactions. The rise of the <a href="https://www.naco.org/featured-resources/future-work-rise-gig-economy">gig economy</a> and economic pressures have made free time a luxury. These factors have made friendship more difficult, and policymakers, urban planners, and venture capitalists are searching for solutions.</p><p>However, these structural forces alone can't fully account for the larger shift. If inaccessibility were the primary driver, we wouldn’t see relatively <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/loneliness-epidemic">stable connection rates </a>among older adults over the last several decades. If wealthier individuals have more access to communal spaces, why has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">solo dining increased by 29% in the past two years</a>? If this were purely circumstantial, why would Stanford now offer <em>Design for Healthy Friendships</em>—a class dedicated to helping students structure their social lives with intention? </p><p>These trends point to something more insidious: a cultural crisis. As <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-friendship-dip">Anne Helen Petersen writes</a>, “time for friends is a privilege, but it is also a matter of priorities.” The way we spend our time, whom we invest in, and what we prioritize is shifting. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">Solitude is becoming more than a preference</a>—it’s becoming a default. And when not used <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/07/hermit-solitude-benefits-happiness/678955/">well</a>, the result of solitude isn’t just fewer friendships—it’s a fundamental loss of the ability to form and sustain them. If we don’t consciously reshape our priorities and re-learn how to cultivate meaningful relationships, we risk a future where connection—one of the most fundamental sources of happiness and well-being—fades into the background of our lives.</p><p><strong>The cultural shift</strong></p><p><span>Work has become a dominant social identity</span></p><p>It’s often said that if you ask an American what they do, they’ll tell you about their job, whereas a European might talk about their hobbies or passions. Data backs this up; U.S. workers put in an average of <a href="https://20somethingfinance.com/american-hours-worked-productivity-vacation/">1,799 hours per year</a>, which is 182 more hours than the OECD country average. But the role of work in shaping identity and social life in the United States has perhaps never been stronger. For example, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/american-work-habits-culture-change-2019-3#the-hours-are-longer-and-longer-4">77% of Americans</a> work more than 40 hours per week, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/30/how-americans-view-their-jobs/#:~:text=Nearly%20half%20of%20workers%20who,more%20time%20off%20(49%25).">few take their full paid leave</a>. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/12/14/the-growth-of-the-older-workforce/#:~:text=The%20share%20of%20older%20adults,18%25%20of%20older%20Americans%20worked.">Pew Research </a>suggests that the percentage of adults 65 and older who are employed has nearly doubled since 1987, rising from 11% to 19%. </p><p>These shifts are in part driven by broader <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/">economic forces</a>. Higher cost of living and stagnating wages for low-and middle-income earners means that everyday Americans must work harder to keep up. However, these shifts also suggest a deeper cultural transformation may be occurring—one where the old American ethos of working hard and climbing the economic ladder has evolved into an all-consuming, identity-defining pursuit that leaves little room for much else. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6889078/pdf/nihms-1060104.pdf">In a study</a> of generational shifts in work values in the United States, researchers found that Americans are placing greater importance on intrinsic work values—such as having interesting jobs and work that helps others and society. Finding meaning in work (obviously) isn’t a problem <em>per se.</em> Yet when finding fulfillment in work comes at the expense of meaningful personal relationships, it becomes a problem—one that risks leaving individuals fulfilled in their careers but isolated in their personal lives.</p><p><span>The focus is increasingly on the nuclear family</span></p><p>As work has become increasingly all-encompassing, Americans have also doubled down on prioritizing their families—particularly their children—over friendships. One 2013 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2013/03/14/chapter-4-how-mothers-and-fathers-spend-their-time/">Pew Research study</a> found that 49% of parents report spending more time with their kids than their own parents did, while 33% report spending the same amount of time, and 18% report spending less time. These trends reflect a cultural shift towards “intensive parenting.” A child’s achievements are an extension of their parents’ competence, which fuels an arms race of over-scheduling, constant supervision, and exhaustive emotional labor. This model of parenting leaves little room for adult friendships, as socializing is increasingly deprioritized in favor of ensuring one’s child “gets ahead”.</p><p>Beyond parenting, Americans in general are spending more time at home than in previous decades. A comprehensive study analyzing data from 2003 to 2022 found that the average time spent at home among American adults rose by 1 hour and 39 minutes per day. The trend is strongest among younger generations: 15- to 24-year-olds now spend over 2 additional hours per day at home compared to 2006. <a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S235282732200310X">Data suggests</a> that this extra time at home may not be going towards connection: the average time spent engaging with family members has dropped from 262 minutes per day in 2003 down to 243 minutes in 2019. </p><p>Simultaneously, Americans are spending less time engaged in activities and groups in their communities. The rate of volunteering has steeply declined since the early 2000s: <a href="https://www.ivint.org/in-the-u-s-volunteering-is-at-an-all-time-low/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Bureau,number%20had%20dropped%20to%2024.9%25.">some research</a> suggests that while almost 30% of Americans reported volunteering in 2005, only 23% reported volunteering in 2021. <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/disconnected-places-and-spaces/">The American Survey Center</a> found that only 15% of Americans belong to neighborhood associations, and only 10% are members of a sports league. This decline in community involvement mirrors a broader shift away from organized religion: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/">Pew Research</a> suggests that the percentage of Americans who don’t identify with any faith has grown from 17% to 26% over a decade. These institutions were once the glue that held social networks together, places where friendships naturally formed through shared experiences. </p><p>Taken together, these trends suggest that Americans are increasingly retreating inward instead of engaging in communal activities. Friendship is no longer seen as an integral part of daily life, but rather something we squeeze in when all our other responsibilities have been met.</p><p><span>The rise of screen time and digital-only friendships</span></p><p>Needless to say, the rise of the internet and mobile phones has only <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2009/11/04/social-isolation-and-new-technology/">accelerated this shift</a>. Nearly <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/">40% of Americans</a> now have online-only friendships. Among teenagers, the trend is even more pronounced. Teenagers are spending only <a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S235282732200310X">40 minutes a day in person with friends</a> outside of school hours, down from 140 minutes a day nearly two decades ago. On the other hand, teens are spending increasing amounts of time on devices. The average teen spent almost <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/4037619-teens-are-spending-less-time-than-ever-with-friends/">nine hours on daily</a> screen time in 2021, up from seven hours in 2015. </p><p>This cultural shift would not matter if digital friendships were interchangeable with in-person friendships. But online friendships require a different set of social behaviors than in-person ones. Maintaining a friendship online relies on skills like crafting the perfect message, interpreting text-based interactions, and engaging in asynchronous exchanges with multiple people at once. In contrast, in-person friendships thrive on undivided attention, and are built through spontaneous moments, reading body language, and navigating the vulnerability of face-to-face connection. Some even suggest that young people, growing up immersed in digital interactions, are<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/"> losing the opportunity to develop the in-person social skills</a> that once defined deep human connection. As <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">Derek Thompson writes</a>, “a socially underdeveloped childhood leads to socially stunted adulthood.” In short, we’re building a generation of people who do not know, and may not have the ability, to tolerate the messy work of forming friendships. Research also suggests that digital interactions lead to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/28/in-person-friendships-health-benefits/">weaker connections</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/202305/face-to-face-communication-healthier-than-digital">lower senses of mental well-being</a>. A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/28/in-person-friendships-health-benefits/">recent study </a>of nearly 13,000 adults over the age of 50 found that those who engaged in face-to-face interactions at least once a week experienced better physical and mental well-being, whereas communication through calls or texts did not have the same effect. Neuroscience helps us make sense of these findings. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3277914/pdf/nihms353984.pdf">Research shows</a> that hearing a familiar voice reduces cortisol and boosts oxytocin—hormones tied to stress relief and bonding—while text-based communication and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3577190.3614168">video calls</a> fail to trigger the same response​. Without these biological cues, digital interactions can feel strangely empty, reinforcing isolation rather than alleviating it.</p><p><strong>The neuropsychology behind why this cultural shift is dangerous</strong></p><p>This cultural shift is particularly insidious because it’s not just changing our habits—it’s rewiring our brains. Forming friendships requires vulnerability, but loneliness makes that vulnerability harder to tolerate. <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1080/17588928.2015.1070136?casa_token=H11l9zS1Zo8AAAAA%3Ant09xEX4ywgkABKvm4wbySENB-5CVQIPjR4iTDSfXOx1zPkVkpc73Brj7oqZ2F0l1hfBO8trcu7fhg">Research by John Cacioppo</a> found that loneliness fuels itself: when people feel isolated, they become more sensitive to social threats and more likely to misinterpret interactions negatively, through the lens of rejection. </p><p>This is important because, at a neurological level, social rejection doesn’t just hurt emotionally—<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9029604/">it activates the amygdala</a>, the brain’s threat detection center, and triggers the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-397025-1.00144-5">same neural pathways</a> as physical pain. Over time, this makes socializing feel riskier, and to avoid that discomfort, we increasingly turn to psychological shortcuts. Digital interactions offer a sense of control: behind our screens, we can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15257832/">curate our self-presentation</a>, sidestep <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15257832/">awkward social cues</a>, and get <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2021/aug/22/how-digital-media-turned-us-all-into-dopamine-addicts-and-what-we-can-do-to-break-the-cycle">quick dopamine hits</a> that create the illusion of connection. <a href="https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/jschroeder/Publications/Epley&amp;Schroeder2014.pdf">Given the way our brains are wired</a>, we also gravitate toward the safest, most familiar spaces—choosing the comfort of home and close family over the unpredictability of community spaces and new relationships. </p><p>But these shortcuts and avoidances only deepen our isolation, creating a self-reinforcing cycle: the more we retreat from in-person connection, the harder it becomes, making digital interactions and solitude even more appealing. </p><p><strong>The dynamic dance of culture change: What we need to do</strong></p><p>It’s clear that something in our cultural fabric needs to change—what’s less clear is how to change it, given the dynamic dance of how culture is formed and sustained. Culture flows from the top-down—through funding that creates public spaces, zoning laws that make neighborhoods walkable, and labor policies that determine how much free time people can spend with friends—but also from the bottom-up, through the repeated choices of individuals. As <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">Derek Thompson</a> points out, the more people opt for convenience over community, the more businesses and institutions adapt to reinforce that behavior—solo dining increases, restaurants redesign for takeout, and social infrastructure crumbles. When enough people de-prioritize friendship, it doesn’t just affect their own lives; it shifts societal norms. This means that reversing the Friendship Recession requires action on both structural and individual levels. If we want to push back against the Friendship Recession—especially against its most visceral, burgeoning societal norms—we need to actively resist the forces that make solitude the default. The key lies in strengthening the two pillars of friendship: forming and sustaining connections. In what follows I’ll share what I’ve learned—from research and personal experience—on how to do this. </p><p><span>Forming friendship: embrace discomfort</span></p><p>Forming friendships requires taking risks, and discomfort is a natural part of risk-taking. But rather than being a deterrent, novel experiences and shared challenges can be the glue that binds friendships together. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6266683/">Research suggests</a> that people who go through something hard together tend to view each other more positively afterward, deepening their connection.</p><p>I saw this firsthand in research I conducted while studying loneliness at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business (GSB) and the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS). I teamed up with a couple of classmates and hosted a Hot Ones Challenge, where a group of strangers sat down together to eat progressively spicier wings while answering personal questions. What started as mild discomfort quickly escalated into chaos—people sweating, laughing, and rolling on the floor in pain. But something else happened, too: by the end of the night, these strangers felt like a bonded group. The shared experience of struggling through something novel and slightly painful had created instant camaraderie.</p><p>A few weeks later, I found myself in a similar situation, but this time, in an Escape Room with a different group. The experience felt similar to the Hot Ones Challenge; by the end of the hour, we were high-fiving and laughing over inside jokes. Novelty equalizes—when we enter a new situation together, hierarchical social norms fall away, and a shared identity forms.</p><p>These experiences didn’t just happen by chance—I had to take the initiative to plan them, extend invitations, and show up, even though I didn’t know how they would turn out. But that’s exactly the point: forming friendships isn’t passive. It takes effort, a willingness to embrace uncertainty, and the courage to put yourself out there. And more often than not, the risk is worth it.</p><p>How can you do this in your own life? Below is a set of suggestions on ways to make forming friendships a priority:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Invite a group of people</strong>—ideally, these are individuals who share a mutual interest in forming lasting friendships or share a common goal. It doesn’t have to be a formal or serious group; the key is to gather people who are open to connection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose an activity</strong> that allows the group to explore a new “frontier”, something unknown, together—this often involves working through a shared physical or intellectual challenge. The activity should be new enough to foster excitement and cooperation but not so intimidating that it deters participation. Consider solving an Escape Room, hosting a Hot Ones Challenge, organizing a team trivia night, or even creating a play where everyone contributes to the final production (<a href="https://www.artandhealing.org/">research suggests</a> that art is particularly helpful for healing a lonely brain). For folks more interested in physical challenges, consider organizing a group trekking adventure, creating an obstacle course, designing a race, or signing up for the myriad of these that exist already. The goal is to create an environment where everyone is learning and navigating something unfamiliar together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set the intention</strong>—clearly share the purpose or goal of the activity. People are more likely to invest in the experience if they know it’s about more than just the activity itself. Setting the tone makes the event feel purposeful and builds a foundation for deeper connections.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slowly escalate disclosure</strong>—start with surface-level, lighter (even goofy) questions or conversations and gradually increase the depth of sharing as trust builds. If the activity has stages (like a trivia night with multiple rounds or a progressive dinner), introduce vulnerability through carefully chosen prompts. For example, early on, you might ask something fun and simple like, “Would you rather sit next to a crying baby or a snorer on a long bus ride?” Later, you might ask, “What’s something you’re proud of that most people don’t know about?” These layers of sharing encourage openness while respecting personal boundaries.</p></li></ol><p><span>Sustainment: making friendship a priority</span></p><p>Forming friendships is only half the battle. Friendships thrive on ritual and repetition. As such, sustaining them requires intentional effort, particularly in a culture that prioritizes work and family over social ties. This means making active choices to spend time with friends—even when it feels inconvenient.</p><p>For a long time, I was reflective of the broader trends. I spent a lot of time forming one-on-one friendships in private settings—either at my place or theirs—rather than engaging in shared social spaces. I spent time texting long-distance friends instead of spending time in-person with friends co-located with me. As I started to learn about the broader cultural trends and the reinforcing psychology behind them, I started making shifts. I embedded myself in existing social structures and prioritized in-person social activities —ecstatic dance gatherings at the Harvard Divinity School, morning prayers at Memorial Church, and weekly workouts at the Harvard stadium with friends. </p><p>My sense of belonging shifted as I threw myself into these recurring activities. While these rituals didn’t provide the “new frontier” that I had uncovered as being crucial to forming friendships, they allowed for the consistency and commitment that cements friendships. This is not to say that one-on-one friendships are insufficient; but it <em>is</em> to say that we will lose the war if we don’t also lean into structured group activities and participating in the rituals and institutions that already exist. Below are some tips for what operationalizing this work can look like: </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Immerse yourself in a local-based ritual that already exists</strong>—<a href="https://trust.weavers.org/" target="_blank">Weave</a> is a great place to find opportunities (and understand the levels of social trust that do/don’t exist in your community).</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose a set cadence for meeting</strong>—consistency is key. Whether it’s weekly, biweekly, or monthly, having a recurring meeting time reduces the “Will they/won’t they show up?” stress and creates a ritual everyone can rely on. Regular interactions can help deepen bonds by building familiarity and trust.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose the activity</strong>—select something that allows for synchrony or harmony, as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23951106/">research shows</a> these shared experiences amplify feelings of connection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rinse and repeat</strong>—consistency doesn’t mean monotony. Rotate the hosting responsibilities or experiment with variations of the activity to keep things fresh. For example, if your group runs together weekly, add a themed run (like costumes or challenges) every so often. Or, if you have regular dinners, try hosting potlucks with rotating themes like “comfort food” or “childhood favorites.”</p></li></ol><p>While these prescriptions might sound easy, the reality is that culture change is hard, and its effects aren’t seen overnight. It would be easier to scapegoat external forces, build yet another friend-finding app, and call it a day. While broader policy changes and social infrastructure certainly are needed and will help, we also must recognize that change starts with us. The small, daily choices we make—to reach out, to show up, to invest in relationships—add up to and actively shape the culture we live in. Imagine what could happen if we’re better, <em>together</em>.</p><p><em>Contributing editors: </em></p><p><em>Bryce Fuemmeler, Senior Research Associate, Leadership &amp; Happiness Laboratory</em></p><p><em>Ryan Meachen, Associate Research Fellow, Leadership &amp; Happiness Laboratory </em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Backblaze (NASDAQ:BLZE) is a $250 million cloud storage and backup solution provider based in California that operates through two business segments: B2 Cloud Storage allowing “customers to store data” and “developers to build applications,” and Computer Backup that “automatically backs up data” from devices for “virtually unlimited” storage.&nbsp;</li><li>Since its November 2021 IPO, Backblaze has reported losses every quarter, its outstanding share count has grown by 80%, and its share price has declined by 71%.</li><li>In October 2024, two former senior employees filed suit against Backblaze, alleging accounting fraud, inflated projections, and whistleblower retaliation. One lawsuit was filed by Backblaze’s former Vice President (“VP”) of Investor Relations, James Kisner, while the other was filed by former Senior Director of Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (“FP&amp;A”), Huey Hall.</li><li>As soon as Backblaze’s IPO lock-up expired in April 2022, its founders engaged in an aggressive trading plan to sell 10,000 shares a day, along with other potential sales from early employee holders, against “all external capital markets advice” related to the downward pressure that these sales would put on Backblaze’s thinly-traded shares, according to the complaints from the 2 former senior employees.</li><li>A capital markets consultant warned Backblaze management that the trading plan was “likely breaching its fiduciary duties,” while Backblaze’s VP of Investors Relations warned that the plan could have a “meaningful negative impact on the business,” according to one of the lawsuits. The founders proceeded anyway, driving the stock down to $3.82 by the end of November 2022— 76% lower than its IPO price.</li><li>4 months into selling his shares, Backblaze co-founder &amp; CTO Brian Wilson wrote in an internal email, “if BLZE goes straight down to zero, each day I sold was beyond totally justified and I won’t regret it” shortly before resigning amidst continued share sales, according to Backblaze’s former VP of Investor Relations.&nbsp;</li><li>To keep its stock price afloat, Backblaze pressured employees to certify "inaccurate" financial statements, according to former Director of FP&amp;A Hall.</li><li>Backblaze’s former Senior Director of FP&amp;A, Huey Hall, claims he refused to sign off on the company’s financial reports on “at least three separate written occasions,” including its 2022 annual report, because he knew there were “misstatements regarding the Fixed Assets, Capitalized R&amp;D, Cash Flow statements, and Equity accounting,” per his lawsuit.</li><li>The claims of inaccurate financials were corroborated by Backblaze’s former VP of Investor Relations, James Kisner, in his complaint. According to Kisner, in 2023 Backblaze’s CFO sent “highly inflated cash flow forecasts to auditors” so that Backblaze could “pass the ‘going concern’ opinion provided by auditors.”&nbsp;</li><li>Kisner alerted the board to the allegedly “fraudulent” forecast, which resulted in an internal investigation that was never disclosed to shareholders. His lawsuit states: “Kisner reasonably believes that the fraudulent, inflated cash flow forecasts if presented to BDO and the SEC would be a violation of law.” Certain founders continued selling shares when these allegations were made, and while the internal investigation allegedly took place.</li><li>Against the backdrop of this alleged financial manipulation, multiple senior leaders from Backblaze resigned and concocted a plan to “obscure the sales” of their shares by waiting 61 days from resignation to avoid having to file their sales publicly, per Kisner, the former VP of Investor Relations. Backblaze’s General Counsel, Tom MacMitchell, expressed concern that the obscured sales could have a “very dramatic impact” on Backblaze’s stock price due to the “large pent up demand to liquidate.”</li><li>Backblaze CEO Gleb Budman has repeatedly stressed “transparency,” and in Q2 2023 he cancelled his personal trading plan in an apparent display of confidence in the business. Yet, 6 months after this announcement, he sold $1.6 million of stock while in possession of material non-public information related to the imminent resignation of Backblaze’s CFO, per the former VP of Investor Relations complaint. The stock tumbled 26% after the resignation announcement, allowing Budman to perfectly time his sale to avoid significant losses.</li><li>Throughout our investigation, we found Backblaze’s track record reveals a management team lacking in transparency and willing to take aggressive and possibly illegal steps to create an illusion of financial performance to support their own exit liquidity.</li><li>Improper capitalization of expenses, like software development or Research and Development (“R&amp;D”) costs, is an age-old accounting shenanigan. When Backblaze’s former senior director of financial planning sued the company in October 2024, he claimed that Backblaze had “misstatements” related to capitalized R&amp;D assets in its 2022 report.</li><li>We checked Backblaze’s financial statements, and noticed that it has capitalized significant software costs equivalent to 9.8% - 14.4% of revenue every year since 2022. Backblaze’s capitalization rate of software development costs is the highest of 42 SaaS peers we reviewed, and almost 5x higher than the average of those 42 peers. </li><li>In Q3 2024, Backblaze introduced a new metric, “adjusted free cash flow”, and claimed it would be “adjusted free cash flow” positive by Q4 2025. Yet, in less than a quarter Backblaze changed its definition, specifically backing out “settlement costs” related to litigation and excluding “restructuring costs” from the new metric.</li><li>Backblaze fails to consistently disclose key metrics that are critical to understanding its success in moving “up market,” such as the number of customers spending more than $50,000 annually. A former Backblaze executive told us, “they were very cautious about having a duty to report that number out of concern of, is that number always going to be good?&nbsp; Is it always going to be growing? What happens [if] that number ever went backwards? … And how do we continue to message the move up market as successful.”</li><li>After the exit of CFO Frank Patchel, in August 2024, one might have expected Backblaze to bring in a CFO with a track-record of turning around poorly performing companies. Instead, Backblaze’s new CFO, Marc Suidan, joined from Beachbody (NYSE: BODI), a multi-level marketing company, where he was CFO from May 2022 to August 2024. During his tenure, BeachBody missed earnings estimates in 6 out of 9 quarters and the stock fell 91%.</li><li>Backblaze touts a differentiated solution and success with “AI” clients, yet it appears to offer a commoditized storage solution that primarily competes on cost. In January 2025, Backblaze’s former CTO stated on a public forum, “I chalk it up to companies like Backblaze wanting to be associated with the hot new thing (AI) right now. But honestly, some things just aren’t AI.” </li><li>Backblaze is being beaten by close competitors such as Wasabi, which offers the same services. One former Backblaze executive told us: “[Backblaze] let Wasabi blow right past them. The Wasabi brand is way better known. Their growth rate is higher. Their global presence is better. Their channel presence is better … They just won and Backblaze lost.”</li><li>Meanwhile, a current executive from Wasabi confirmed, “We have at least half a dozen customers who have left [Backblaze] and come to us in the last month and a half, all AI … the reason they went there is because of all the AI messaging [Backblaze was] doing, and then they realized that it’s actually not as true as what they’ve been saying. And now they’ve come to us.” </li><li>Backblaze noted a large customer loss during its Q4 2024 earnings call. We interviewed a Wasabi sales executive who confirmed that they took a large customer from Backblaze, saying, “I was actually surprised when I had heard that [the customer] had come over [to Wasabi] because I knew that they were such a big partner for Backblaze.” </li><li>Backblaze, in our view, is the archetype of a failed growth business and its latest “restructuring” will do little to resurrect the company’s woeful capital market performance or transform its undifferentiated storage offering. Its capital markets story has been kept alive by allegedly inflated cash flow forecasts, hidden internal investigations and accounting tricks, which appear to fuel exit liquidity for insiders.</li><li>If Backblaze’s leadership truly holds transparency as one of its “most cherished values”, then management should have no issue answering the 12 questions we have included at the bottom of this report.</li></ul><p><em>Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we believe the evidence justifies a short position in shares of Backblaze (NASDAQ: BLZE).

And that's why we want to work with you”&nbsp;</em></blockquote><p>In Q4 2024, Backblaze CFO Suidan <a href="https://www.stockinsights.ai/us/BLZE/earnings-transcript/fy24-q4-1f85?ref=morpheus-research.com#:~:text=Marc%20Suidan%3A%20What,much%20what%20it%20says."><u>noted</u></a> “we did have a larger customer loss in Q1”, on the company’s earnings call. The company did not name the client, but a sales executive from Wasabi confirmed that they recently took a large surveillance customer from Backblaze.</p><blockquote><em>“I was actually surprised when I had heard that [the customer] had come over [to Wasabi] because I knew that they were such a big partner for Backblaze.”&nbsp;</em></blockquote><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Backblaze, in our view, is the archetype of a failed growth business. During its lifetime as a public company, Backblaze has never turned a profit, nor delivered value for its original IPO investors. All the while, key insiders have cashed out millions by selling large quantities of stock in a thinly traded market despite advice against it, per testimony from former executives in undisclosed litigation.&nbsp;</p><p>Management continues to insist that it has an “<a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/backblaze-at-jmp-technology-conference-strategic-growth-and-ai-opportunities-93CH-3912246?ref=morpheus-research.com#:~:text=innovative%20and%20disruptive%20solution"><u>innovative and disruptive solution</u></a>” in what appears to us to be a competitive and commoditized storage business, dominated by deep-pocketed tech companies and smaller, faster-growing peers. </p><p>After its woeful capital market performance and undifferentiated storage offering, Backblaze’s response has simply been to double-down, believing that throwing money at new sales staff and chasing bigger customers can solve its issues.</p><p>To keep its capital markets story alive, Backblaze has fed its auditor fraudulent projections, hidden internal investigations from shareholders, and engaged in accounting tricks to inflate profitability metrics, per allegations in lawsuits and our own research.</p><p>As with many beleaguered tech companies, investors may hang on with the hope of a buy-out, but in reality, we believe Backblaze has no back-up plan and its reported numbers deserve major scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="questions-for-management">Questions for Management</h3><p>Backblaze states on its <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/allow-us-to-introduce-ourselves/?ref=morpheus-research.com#:~:text=Transparency%20is%20one%20of%20our,our%20designs%2C%20statistics%2C%20and%20calculations"><u>website</u></a> that “transparency is one of our most cherished values—if not <em>the</em> most important value of our business.” If this truly is the case, we believe Backblaze’s management team will have no issue responding to our 12 questions below:</p><p>1) Backblaze is facing two lawsuits from former senior employees, including the company’s former VP of Investor Relations and Senior Director of FP&amp;A. The lawsuits make extremely serious allegations of accounting and insider trading improprieties. Why has Backblaze not disclosed these lawsuits to shareholders?&nbsp;</p><p>2) According to lawsuits from former employees, Backblaze founders implemented an aggressive 10b5-1 trading plan after the IPO that went against the advice of Backblaze’s General Counsel, CFO, VP of Investor Relations, and a third-party capital markets advisor. Is it true that these individuals warned against the trading plan due to the risk of “crushing” Backblaze’s stock price? If so, why did you disregard the warnings of key advisors?</p><p>3) A former employee claimed that co-founder Brian Wilson wrote an email to management stating that if the stock goes to zero, he would feel “beyond” justified regarding his share sales. Why would a Backblaze co-founder feel “justified” for sending the stock to zero?&nbsp;</p><p>4) These former employees claim that CEO Gleb Budman sold $1.6 million in stock while in possession of knowledge related to the CFO’s imminent resignation, which had not yet been announced to shareholders. If true, this allowed Budman to avoid substantial losses. Was Gleb Budman aware of Frank Patchel’s imminent retirement when he sold $1.6 million in stock?&nbsp; </p><p>5) A former employee claimed that he brought evidence of inflated cash flow forecasts to the board of directors that resulted in an internal investigation. Is this true? If so, which firm conducted the investigation and why was this not disclosed to shareholders?</p><p>6) When did this investigation begin and end, and what were its findings? Did the founders continue to sell shares during this investigation?</p><p>7) Another former employee alleged there were misstatements in Backblaze’s 2022 10-K related to fixed assets, capitalized R&amp;D, cash flow, and equity accounting. What has management done to investigate these claims?&nbsp;</p><p>8) Backblaze’s definition of “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” changed in Q4 2024 to exclude costs related to legal settlements, even though Backblaze has not disclosed any ongoing litigation, or a provision for costs related to litigation. Since Backblaze is facing two lawsuits from former employees, what contingent provision has Backblaze established for potential settlements and other legal costs?&nbsp;</p><p>9) Retail investors have been asking pointed questions to management since Backblaze’s IPO. In Q2 2024, Backblaze suddenly stopped taking questions from retail investors. Why?&nbsp;</p><p>10) As a percentage of revenue, Backblaze capitalizes more internal-use software costs than 42 SaaS peers, and is ~5x higher than the average capitalization rate of these peers. This significantly boosts reported net income. How does management justify this accounting treatment?&nbsp;</p><p>11) Backblaze hired a new CFO, whose last company, Beachbody, missed earnings estimates 6 out of 9 quarters during his tenure, whose share price declined by 91% over the same time period, and the company is now facing risk of continuing as a going concern. Why did Backblaze choose to hire him?12) A Wasabi executive told us they had “half a dozen” AI customers leave Backblaze and come to Wasabi in the last month and a half. Why did they leave? Will Backblaze share metrics around customer additions and losses? Will Backblaze also share the number of customers deemed “AI customers” and how that number has changed over time?</p><p><strong>Disclosure: We are short shares of Backblaze (NASDAQ: BLZE)</strong></p><p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></p><p><em>Use of Morpheus Research LLC’s (“Morpheus Research”) research is at your own risk.

<h2>Mark Zuckerberg personally lost the Facebook antitrust case (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/18/chatty-zucky/#is-you-taking-notes-on-a-criminal-fucking-conspiracy">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>It's damned hard to prove an antitrust case: so often, the prosecution has to prove that the company <em>intended</em> to crush competition, and/or that they raised prices or reduced quality because they knew they didn't have to fear competitors.</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to prove <em>what</em> a corporation did than it is to prove <em>why</em> they did it. What am I, a mind-reader? But imagine for a second that the corporation in the dock is a global multinational. Now, imagine that the majority of the voting shares in that company are held by one man, who has served as the company's CEO since the day he founded it, personally calling every important shot in the company's history.</p>
<p>Now imagine that this founder/CEO, this accused monopolist, was an incorrigible blabbermouth, who communicated with his underlings almost exclusively in writing, and thus did he commit to immortal digital storage a stream – a <em>torrent</em> – of memos in which he explicitly confessed his guilt.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlepersons, I give you Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Meta (nee Facebook), an accused monopolist who <em>cannot keep his big dumb fucking mouth shut</em>.</p>
<p>At long, long last, the FTC's antitrust trial against Meta is underway, and this week, Zuck himself took the stand, in agonizing sessions during which FTC lawyers brandished printouts of Zuck's own words before him, asking him to explain away his naked confessions of guilt. It did not go well for Zuck.</p>
<p>In a breakdown of the case for <em>The American Prospect</em>, editor-in-chief David Dayen opines that "The Government Has Already Won the Meta Case," having hanged Zuck on his own words:</p>
<p><a href="https://prospect.org/power/2025-04-16-government-already-won-meta-case-tiktok-ftc-zuckerberg/">https://prospect.org/power/2025-04-16-government-already-won-meta-case-tiktok-ftc-zuckerberg/</a></p>
<p>The government is attempting to prove that Zuck bought Instagram and Whatsapp in order to extinguish competitors (and not, for example, because he thought they were good businesses that complemented Facebook's core product offerings).</p>
<p>This case starts by proving how Zuck felt about Insta and WA before the acquisitions. On Insta, Zuck circulated memos warning about Insta's growth trajectory:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  they appear to be reaching critical mass as a place you go to share photos
</p></blockquote>
<p>and how that could turn them into a future competitor:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [Instagram could] copy what we’re doing now … I view this as a big strategic risk for us if we don’t completely own the photos space.
</p></blockquote>
<p>These are not the words of a CEO who thinks another company is making a business that complements his own – they're confessions that he is worried that they will <em>compete</em> with Facebook. Facebook tried to clone Insta (Remember Facebook Camera? Don't feel bad – neither does anyone else). When that failed, Zuck emailed Facebook execs, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [Instagram's growth is] really scary and why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.
</p></blockquote>
<p>At this point, Zuck's CFO – one of the adults in the room, attempting to keep the boy king from tripping over his own dick – wrote to Zuck warning him that it was illegal to buy Insta in order to "neutralize a potential competitor."</p>
<p>Zuck replied that he was, indeed, solely contemplating buying Insta in order to neutralize a potential competitor. It's like this guy kept picking up his dictaphone, hitting "record," and barking, "Hey Bob, I am in receipt of your memo of the 25th, regarding the potential killing of Fred. You raise some interesting points, but I wanted to reiterate that this killing is to be a <em>murder</em>, and it must be as <em>premeditated as possible</em>. Yours very truly, Zuck."</p>
<p>Did Zuck buy Insta to neutralize a competitor? Sure seems like it! For one thing, Zuck cancelled all work on Facebook Camera "since we're acquiring Instagram."</p>
<p>But what about <em>after</em> the purchase. Did Zuck reduce quality and/or raise costs? Well, according to the company, it enacted an "explicit policy of not prioritizing Instagram’s growth" (a tactic called "buy or bury"). At this juncture, Zuckerberg once again put fingers to keyboard in order to create an immortal record of his intentions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  By not killing their products we prevent everyone from hating us and we make sure we don’t immediately create a hole in the market for someone else to fill.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And if someone <em>did</em> enter the market with a cool new gimmick (like, say, Snapchat with its disappearing messages)?</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Even if some new competitors spring up, if we incorporate the social mechanics they were using, these new products won’t get much traction since we’ll already have their mechanics deployed at scale.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember, the Insta acquisition is only illegal if Zuck bought them to prevent competition in the marketplace (rather than, say, to make a better product). It's hard to prove why a company does anything, <em>unless</em> its CEO, founder, and holder of the majority of its voting stock explicitly states that his strategy is to create a system to ensure that innovating new products "won't get much traction" because he'll be able to quickly copy them.</p>
<p>So we have Zuck starving Insta of development except when he needs to neutralize a competitor, which is just another way of saying he set out to reduce the quality of the product after acquisition, a thing that is statutorily prohibited, but hard to prove (again, unless you confess to it in writing, herp derp).</p>
<p>But what about prices? Well, obviously, Insta doesn't charge its end-users in cash, but they <em>do</em> charge in attention. If you want to see the things you've explicitly asked for – posts from accounts you follow – you have to tolerate a certain amount of "boosted content" and ads, that is, stuff that Facebook's business customers will pay to nonconsensually cram into your eyeballs.</p>
<p>Did that price go up? Any Insta user knows the answer: hell yes. Instagram is such a cesspit of boosted content and ads that it's almost impossible to find stuff you actually asked to see. Indeed, when a couple of teenagers hacked together an alternative Insta client called OG App that only showed you posts from accounts you followed, it was instantly the most popular app on Google Play and Apple's App Store (and then Google and Apple killed it, at Meta's request):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained</a></p>
<p>But <em>why</em> did the price go up? Did it go up because Facebook had neutralized a competitor by purchasing it, and thus felt that it could raise prices without losing customers? Again, a hard thing to prove…unless Zuck happened to put it in writing. Which he did, as Brendan Benedict explains in Big Tech On Trial:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I think we’re badly mismanaging this right now. There’s absolutely no reason why IG ad load should be lower than FB at a time when . . . we’re having engagement issues in FB. If we were managing our company correctly, then at a minimum we’d immediately balance IG and FB ad load . . . But it’s possible we should even have a higher ad load on IG while we have this challenge so we can replace some ads with [People You May Know] on FB to turn around the issues we’re seeing.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/zuckerberg-v-zuckerberg-will-the">https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/zuckerberg-v-zuckerberg-will-the</a></p>
<p>So there you have it: Zuck bought Insta to neutralize a competitor, and after he did, he lowered its quality and raised its prices, because he knew that he was operating without significant competitors thanks to his acquisition of that key competitor. Zuck's motivations – as explained by Zuck himself – were in direct contravention of antitrust law, a thing he <em>knew</em> (because his execs explained it to him). That's a pretty good case.</p>
<p>But what about Whatsapp? How did Zuck feel about it? Well, he told his board that Whatsapp was Facebook's greatest "consumer risk," fretting that "Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp." He blocked Whatsapp ads on Facebook, telling his team that it was "trying to build social networks and replace us." Sure, they'd lose money by turning away that business, but the "revenue is immaterial to us compared to any risk." Sure seems like Zuck saw Whatsapp as a competitor.</p>
<p>Meta's final line of defense in this case is that even if they did some crummy, illegal things, they still didn't manage to put together a monopoly. According to Meta's lawyers – who're billing the company more than $1m/day! – Meta is a tiny fish in a vast ocean that has many competitors, like Tiktok:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.levernews.com/mr-zuckerbergs-very-expensive-day-in-court/">https://www.levernews.com/mr-zuckerbergs-very-expensive-day-in-court/</a></p>
<p>There's only one problem with this "market definition" argument, and that problem's name is Chatty Mark Zuckerberg. On the question of market definition, FTC lawyers once again raised Zuckerberg's own statements and those of his top lieutenants to show that Zuckerberg viewed his companies as "Personal Social Networks" (PSNs) and not as just generic sites full of stuff, competing with Youtube, Tiktok, and everyone else who lets users post things to the internet.</p>
<p>Take Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, who explained that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Instagram will always need to focus on friends and can never exclusively be for public figures or will cease to be a social product.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And then there was Zuck's memo explaining why he offered $6b for Snapchat:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Snap Stories serves the exact same use case of sharing and consuming feeds of content that News Feed and Instagram deliver. We need to take this new dynamic seriously—both as a competitive risk and as a product opportunity to add functionality that many people clearly love and want to use daily.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And an internal strategy document that explained the competitive risks to Facebook:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Social networks have two stable equilibria: either everyone uses them, or no-one uses them. In contrast, nonsocial apps (e.g. weather apps, exercise apps) can exist [somewhere] along a continuum of adoption. The binary nature of social networks implies that there should exist a tipping point, ie some critical mass of adoption, above which a network will organically grow, and below which it will shrink.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure sounds like Facebook sees itself as a "social network," and not a "nonsocial app." And of course – as Dayen points out – when Tiktok (a company Meta claims as a competitor) went up for sale, Meta did <em>not</em> enter a bid, despite being awash in free cash flow.</p>
<p>In Zuckerberg's defense, he's not the only tech CEO who confesses his guilt in writing (recall that FTX planned its crimes in a groupchat called WIREFRAUD). Partly that's because these firms are run by arrogant twits, but partly it's because digital culture is a written culture, where big, dispersed teams expected to work long hours from offices all over the world as well as from their phones every hour of day and night have to rely on memos to coordinate:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/03/big-tech-cant-stop-telling-on-itself/">https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/03/big-tech-cant-stop-telling-on-itself/</a></p>
<p>When Dayen claims that "the government has won the Meta case," he doesn't mean the judge will rule in the FTC's favor (though there's a high likelihood that this will happen). Rather, he means that the case has been proven beyond any kind of reasonable doubt, in public, in a way that has historically caused other monopolists to lose their nerve, even if they won their cases. Take Microsoft and IBM – though both companies managed to draw out their cases until a new Republican administration (Reagan for IBM, GWB for Microsoft) took office and let them off the hook, both companies were profoundly transformed by the process.</p>
<p>IBM created the market for a generic, multivendor PC whose OS came from outside the company:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/ibm-pc-compatible-how-adversarial-interoperability-saved-pcs-monopolization">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/ibm-pc-compatible-how-adversarial-interoperability-saved-pcs-monopolization</a></p>
<p>And Microsoft spared Google the same treatment it had meted out to Netscape, allowing the company to grow and thrive:</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-apple-microsoft-antitrust-technology-cases-1e0c510088825745a6e74ba3b81b44c6">https://apnews.com/article/google-apple-microsoft-antitrust-technology-cases-1e0c510088825745a6e74ba3b81b44c6</a></p>
<p>Trump being Trump, it's not inconceivable that he will attempt to intervene to get the judge to exonerate Meta. After all, Zuck did pay him a $1m bribe and then beg him to do just that:</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/zuckerberg-really-thought-trump-would-make-metas-legal-problems-go-away-2000589897">https://gizmodo.com/zuckerberg-really-thought-trump-would-make-metas-legal-problems-go-away-2000589897</a></p>
<p>But as Dayen writes, the ire against Meta's monopolistic conduct is thoroughly bipartisan, and if Trump was being strategic here (a very, very big "if"), he would keep his powder dry here. After all, if the judge <em>doesn't</em> convict Meta, Trump won't have wasted any political capital. And if Meta <em>is</em> convicted, Trump could solicit more bribes and favors at the "remedy" stage, when a court will decide how to punish Meta, which could be anything from a fine to a breakup order, to a nothingburger of vague orders to clean up its act.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing MyPillow and its CEO Mike Lindell in a defamation case admitted using artificial intelligence in a brief that has nearly 30 defective citations, including misquotes and citations to fictional cases, a federal judge said.</p>
<p>"[T]he Court identified nearly thirty defective citations in the Opposition. These defects include but are not limited to misquotes of cited cases; misrepresentations of principles of law associated with cited cases, including discussions of legal principles that simply do not appear within such decisions; misstatements regarding whether case law originated from a binding authority such as the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; misattributions of case law to this District; and most egregiously, citation of cases that do not exist," US District Judge Nina Wang wrote in an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.215068/gov.uscourts.cod.215068.309.0.pdf">order to show cause</a> Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wang ordered attorneys Christopher Kachouroff and Jennifer DeMaster to show cause as to why the court should not sanction the defendants, law firm, and individual attorneys. Kachouroff and DeMaster also have to explain why they should not be referred to disciplinary proceedings for violations of the rules of professional conduct.</p>
<p>Kachouroff and DeMaster, who are defending Lindell against a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.215068/gov.uscourts.cod.215068.4.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed by former Dominion Voting Systems employee Eric Coomer, both signed the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.215068/gov.uscourts.cod.215068.283.0.pdf">February 25 brief</a> with the defective citations. Kachouroff, representing defendants as lead counsel, admitted using AI to write the brief at an April 21 hearing, the judge wrote. The case is in the US District Court for the District of Colorado.</p>
<p>"Time and time again, when Mr. Kachouroff was asked for an explanation of why citations to legal authorities were inaccurate, he declined to offer any explanation, or suggested that it was a 'draft pleading,'" Wang wrote. "Not until this Court asked Mr. Kachouroff directly whether the Opposition was the product of generative artificial intelligence did Mr. Kachouroff admit that he did, in fact, use generative artificial intelligence."</p>

    <div>
          
          
<h2>“Your honor, I may have made a mistake”</h2>
<p>Kachouroff admitted after further questioning that failed to check citations, but "represented that he personally outlined and wrote a draft of a brief before utilizing generative artificial intelligence," Wang wrote. "Given the pervasiveness of the errors in the legal authority provided to it, this Court treats this representation with skepticism."</p>
<p>The judge's order quotes some of Kachouroff's responses at the hearing. When asked about one misquote, he said, "Your honor, I may have made a mistake and I may have paraphrased and put quotes by mistake. I wasn't intending to mislead the court. I don't think the quote is far off from what you read to me."</p>
<p>The judge's order continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>When asked how a case from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky became attributable to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, Mr. Kachouroff indicated that he "had given the cite checking to another person," later identified as Ms. DeMaster. When asked whether he would be surprised to find out that the citation <em>Perkins v. Fed. Fruit &amp; Produce Co</em>., 945 F.3d 1242, 1251 (10th Cir. 2019) appearing on page 6 of Defendants' Opposition did not exist as an actual case, Mr. Kachouroff indicated that he would be surprised.</p></blockquote>
<p>The lawyers must explain themselves more fully by May 5. "Counsel will specifically address, under the oath subject to the penalty of perjury, the circumstances surrounding the preparation of the Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion in Limine, including but not limited to whether Defendants were advised and approved of their counsel's use of generative artificial intelligence," the order said.</p>
<p>We contacted Kachouroff and DeMaster and will update this article if they respond. Kachouroff is with the law firm McSweeney Cynkar &amp; Kachouroff in Virginia. DeMaster is an attorney in Wisconsin.</p>

<h2>Lawsuit against Lindell, MyPillow</h2>
<p>Coomer's lawsuit was filed against Lindell, the Lindell media company called FrankSpeech, and MyPillow. Lindell and his companies "have been among the most prolific vectors of baseless conspiracy theories claiming election fraud in the 2020 election," and Lindell falsely claimed that Coomer committed treason, the lawsuit said. Coomer is the former director of product strategy and security for Dominion.</p>
<p>"Defendants have published these numerous false statements, defamatory interviews, and other dishonest content maligning Dr. Coomer on the website frankspeech.com often alongside a sales pitch for products from MyPillow," the lawsuit said. "In addition, Defendants further made claims against Dr. Coomer a centerpiece of a failed 'Cyber Symposium' that they organized and broadcast around the world."</p>
<p>The February 25 brief that got Lindell's lawyers in trouble was an opposition to Coomer's <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.215068/gov.uscourts.cod.215068.279.0.pdf">motion</a> asking the court to exclude certain evidence. Coomer's brief said "that Defendants will attempt to mislead and distract the jury with a smear campaign against Dr. Coomer based on completely or largely irrelevant attacks on his character instead of presenting proof that Dr. Coomer was involved in a criminal conspiracy to rig the 2020 presidential election. The Court should exercise its discretion to exclude the evidence set forth to avoid unfair character assassination and to ensure a fair trial on the merits."</p>
<p>Coomer asked the court to exclude evidence related to a September 2021 motor vehicle accident, his sex life, alleged drug and alcohol use, religious beliefs, and political views. In their brief that apparently relies on incorrect and fictional citations, Lindell's lawyers argued that much of the evidence Coomer wants to exclude is relevant to his credibility, character, and reputation.</p>

	  <p>New Orleans, LA - Today, in the early hours of the morning, the New Orleans Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Field Office deported at least two families, including two mothers and their minor children – three of whom are U.S. citizen children aged 2, 4, and 7. One of the mothers is currently pregnant. The families, who had lived in the United States for years and had deep ties to their communities, were deported from the U.S. under deeply troubling circumstances that raise serious due process concerns.</p>
<p>ICE detained the first family on Tuesday, April 22, and the second family on Thursday, April 24. In both cases, ICE held the families incommunicado, refusing or failing to respond to multiple attempts by attorneys and family members to contact them. In one instance, a mother was granted less than one minute on the phone before the call was abruptly terminated when her spouse tried to provide legal counsel’s phone number.</p>
<p>As a result, the families were completely isolated during critical moments when decisions were being made about the welfare of their minor children. This included decisions with serious implications for the health, safety, and legal rights of the children involved–without any opportunity to coordinate with caretakers or consult with legal representatives.</p>
<p>These actions stand in direct violation of ICE’s own written and informal directives, which mandate coordination for the care of minor children with willing caretakers–regardless of immigration status–when deportations are being carried out.</p>
<p>Both families have possible immigration relief, but because ICE denied them access to their attorneys, legal counsel was unable to assist and advise them in time. With one family, government attorneys had assured legal counsel that a legal call would be arranged within 24-48 hours, as well as a call with a family member. Instead, just after close of business and after courts closed for the day, ICE suddenly reversed course and informed counsel that the family would be deported at 6am the next morning–before the court reopened.</p>
<p>That family filed a habeas corpus petition and motion for a temporary restraining order, which was never ruled on because of their rapid early-morning deportation.</p>
<p>In the case of the other family, a U.S. citizen child suffering from a rare form of metastatic cancer was deported without medication or the ability to consult with their treating physicians–despite ICE being notified in advance of the child’s urgent medical needs. In addition, one of the mothers who was deported is pregnant, and ICE proceeded with her deportation without ensuring any continuity of prenatal care or medical oversight.</p>
<p>These actions represent a shocking – although increasingly common–abuse of power. NOLA ICE has inflicted harm and jeopardized the lives and health of vulnerable children and a pregnant woman. The cruelty and deliberate denial of legal and medical access are not only unlawful, but inhumane.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa Reyes-Flores, Southeast Dignity not Detention Coalition (SEDND) -</strong> “ICE’s actions show a blatant violation of due process and basic human rights. The families were disappeared, cut off from their lawyers and loved ones, and rushed to be deported, stripping their parents of the chance to protect their U.S. citizen children.”</p>
<p><strong>Gracie Willis, National Immigration Project -</strong> ”What we saw from ICE over the last several days is horrifying and baffling. Families have been ripped apart unnecessarily. These mothers had no opportunity to speak with their co-parents to make the kinds of choices that parents are entitled to make for their children, the kinds of decisions that millions of parents make every day: “what is best for our child?” We should be gravely concerned that ICE has been given tacit approval to both detain and deport U.S. citizen children despite the availability and willingness of U.S.-based caregivers who, only because of ICE’s own actions, cannot find or contact them.”</p>
<p><strong>Alanah Odoms, Executive Director of the ACLU of Louisiana</strong> - “Once again, the government has used deceptive tactics to deny people their rights. These outrageous actions must be condemned. We as a nation are better than this. These families deserve better. They must be returned.”</p>
<p><strong>Fatima Khan, Louisiana Organization for Refugees and Immigrants (LORI) -</strong> “ICE’s actions today go far past the typical inhumanity of their detention operations in Louisiana. They ignored their own protocols on legal access and protecting children’s rights to enact an expedient deportation they know to be unlawful. Not only that, they disappeared these families before any U.S. Court could stand up for its children. We should all be mortified.”</p>
<p><strong>Erin Hebert, Ware Immigration -</strong> “Deporting U.S. citizen children is illegal, unconstitutional, and immoral. The speed, brutality, and clandestine manner in which these children were deported is beyond unconscionable, and every official responsible for it should be held accountable.”</p>
<p><strong>Homero López, Jr., Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy (ISLA) -</strong> “These deplorable actions demonstrate ICE's increasing willingness to violate all protections for immigrants as well as those of their children. These types of disappearances are reminiscent of the darkest eras in our country's history and put everyone, regardless of immigration status, at risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Mich P. Gonzalez, Sanctuary of the South -</strong> “A government agency that sequesters and deports vulnerable mothers with their US citizen children without due process must be defunded, not rewarded with an additional 45 billion dollars to continue at taxpayers’ expense. These families were lawfully complying with ICE’s orders and for this they suffered cruel and traumatic separation. If this is what the Trump administration is orchestrating just three months in, we should all be terrified of what the next four years will bring.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The prostate gland causes entirely too many problems.  In the US,
prostate cancer kills about one man of every forty.  “Benign
prostate hyperplasia” (BPH) is even more common, affecting most
men over age 60.  It pinches the urinary tract, making it hard to
urinate, and is constantly in danger of transforming from
“benign” to “malignant”.  Even the difficulty urinating is enough
of a problem that men often get surgery for it, usually TURP, a
sort of roto-rooter job (except cutting through the pipe instead
of just cleaning it out).</p>
<p>In women, breast cancer has a similar death toll, but the breasts
have an excuse: they’re much bigger; there are many more cells to
go bad.  They’re also much more metabolically active, capable of
producing enough milk to feed a baby; the prostate’s output is
tiny in comparison.</p>
<p>One idea I’ve seen is that the prostate serves as the body’s
“gatekeeper” against sexually transmitted diseases, and in the
process often gets chronically infected itself; the resulting
inflammation may cause hyperplasia, first benign then malignant.
Infectious causation is too often neglected these days, and
sexually transmitted diseases are common, so this is not
unreasonable.  But it doesn’t seem like a great explanation.  The
prostate doesn’t filter the urinary tract; it just secretes into
it; there’s no real “gate” there to be “kept”.  The prostate’s
position is like that of the salivary glands, which are not known
for being great houses of cancer.  And the epidemiology backs
this up: correlations with STDs are there, but not huge.  The
odds ratios are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15988645/">between one and two</a>; in comparison, the odds
ratio for human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer is
greater than ten.  An odds ratio of ten should make the ears perk
up; an odds ratio of 1.5 can be a minor effect or can be just a
spurious correlation.  And with the prostate, there’s not just a
minor effect which needs explaining: there has to be some
major-league cause.</p>
<p>A decade ago, Scott Alexander, in his blog “Slate Star Codex”,
<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/09/12/the-life-cycle-of-medical-ideas/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“About five years ago, two Israeli doctors named Gat and
Goren posit the theory that benign prostatic hyperplasia,
a prostate disease that affects millions of older men, is
caused by incompetence of the spermatic veins. They claim
they can treat it surgically, and show off rows of
smiling patients with glowing testimonials. Once again,
the guys are good doctors, nothing about their theory
contradicts basic laws of biology, and no one else has
any better ideas.</p>
<p>I shamefacedly admit I want this one to be true. There’s
so much “well, everything is a complicated combination of
genes, biomolecules, biopsychosocial stressors and immune
modulators that we may never really understand” going on
in medicine today that it would be super gratifying if
this one mysterious disease turned out to just be
plumbing going in the wrong direction. And although the
prostate is about as far from my area of expertise as it
is possible to be, I have to say that from a
physiological standpoint their theory seems to have that
rare and much-sought scientific elegance, where
everything comes together in a pretty package.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the medical community has totally
ignored this one. Gat and Goren have published their
hypothesis and their apparent excellent results <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18811916/">in
peer-reviewed medical journals</a>. It has garnered <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18811915/">praise</a>
from prestigious figures in the field (bonus points for
calling it “seminal”, especially if the pun was
intentional). As far as I know, no one has attacked it or
even formally expressed doubt. Yet as far as I know, it
has gone nowhere.</p>
<p>Does everyone mutually assume that if something this
revolutionary were true, someone would have noticed beyond a
single article in a urology journal? Do they just decide it needs
further research, and hope that this research will be conducted
by someone else? Or do they think that it would end up like
Zamboni’s MS cure, with hundreds of thousands of dollars wasted,
dozens of unnecessary surgeries performed, and nothing to show
but yet another fringe medical idea that sounded good at the
time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read that some time after it was written, and found that
there’s since been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25389666/">a small confirmatory study</a> from Germany.
So it hasn’t been entirely neglected.  Gat and Goren also have
other papers in the area.  (The latter author is sometimes listed
as “Gornish”, that being the non-Hebraicized verson of his name.)</p>
<p>At any rate, Scott’s was more of a social view of the question
than a technical one.  Still, it was intriguing enough to get me
to read the papers he linked to, and then to read the authors’
other papers on the subject.  I found that the above language
does not convey the full scope of the theory.  This is not just
about BPH; it’s also about prostate cancer, and also about
varicocele, the top cause of male infertility.  And it promises
to eliminate all these problems, if caught early enough, which is
not hard: screening for it is simple and cheap.</p>
<p>The theory here is largely mechanical; and it’s not just
psychiatrists like Scott who are weak at mechanical explanations;
it’s doctors in general as well as medical researchers and
biologists.  There is even a famous paper “Can a Biologist Fix a
Radio?”, wherein the biologist author laments the unsuitability
of biological reasoning, at least of the usual sort, for the task
of fixing an old radio.  (End result: “the radio remains
broken.”)  Reading medical review papers, I have often gotten
quite disgusted at the way they list result after result in the
fashion “X has an effect on Y”, without saying what the size of
the effect is or even what dose of X is required.  Especially
when you want to chain two mechanisms together (X having an
effect on Y and then Y having an effect on Z), you’ve got to know
the numbers.  The convention is that p=0.06 means “it doesn’t
have an effect” and p=0.04 means “it has an effect”, but any real
thought requires more than just that binary view of things.</p>
<p>I’m thoroughly comfortable with mechanical theory and practice,
so here’s an attempt at a full rendering of the Gat/Goren theory,
in language as simple as the subject permits, followed by my own
comments.  The basic idea is this: in healthy men, blood flows
out from the testicles into the spermatic veins (of which there
is one for each testicle).  Each spermatic vein goes up
vertically inside the body until it’s near the kidney on that
side.  (The kidneys are about halfway up the back.)  The left
spermatic vein then feeds into the left kidney vein, while the
right spermatic vein feeds directly into the vena cava (the vein
“as big as a cave”; it’s the largest vein in the body, leading
directly back to the heart; the kidney veins also feed into it).
Each spermatic vein has about seven one-way valves to prevent
blood from flowing the wrong way through the vein, which it would
otherwise do due to the force of gravity.  The following diagram
from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32833288/">their latest paper</a> shows the situation in healthy men.
(That paper is under a Creative Commons license, which this
re-use is in accordance with; I’ve slightly altered their diagram
to un-abbreviate the labels.  The subsequent images are also
re-used under the same license.)</p>
<p><img src="https://yarchive.net/photos/vein_diagram1.webp"></p><p>With age and wear and tear, the one-way valves cease to function,
and blood does flow the wrong way: down the vein towards the
testicles.  It bathes them in poorly-oxygenated blood, which is
bad for them, eventually killing the germ cells which produce
sperm and causing infertility.</p>
<p>The medical literature often blames that infertility on the
warmth which is produced by that reverse blood flow, but Gat and
Goren <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15932914/">blame the low oxygen</a>: warmth does interfere with sperm
production, but it’s low oxygen that actually kills
sperm-producing cells, as occurs in men with this disorder.  (The
warmth is still quite useful for diagnosing the disorder since
thermal imaging shows it plainly.)</p>
<p>The blood from the testicles, still at higher than normal
pressure, then continues on out the network of veins in that
area, and spills into the prostate, going backwards through veins
that normally drain the prostate; to use their diagram from the
same paper:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarchive.net/photos/vein_diagram2.webp"></p><p>Since this blood has just left the testicles, it is heavily
loaded with testosterone, which promotes prostate growth.  Making
things even worse, that blood has a much higher than normal
percentage of free testosterone.  Normally the vast majority of
testosterone in the blood is bound to sex hormone binding
globulin (SHBG); only a tiny proportion is free, but that
proportion has the actual hormone effect.  In the testicular
flow, there isn’t enough SHBG to bind to all the testosterone;
that happens only on the way back to the heart when it is mixed
with the blood returning from the rest of the body.  So the total
effect is to hit prostate cells with about a hundred times the
normal dose of free testosterone.  This makes them grow; their
growth is called benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer.
There’s also another effect of the high pressure: swelling the
prostate (pressurizing it and expanding it).  It also swells the
veins in the scrotum, the “pampiniform plexus” above the
testicles; when that swelling is prominent enough, it is given
the name “varicocele”.</p>
<p>(I’d originally imagined that their reason for the high free
testosterone was that the testosterone molecules took time to
find the SHBG molecules and bind to them, but that process seems
to be too fast: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/096007609090334H">this study</a> found a half-life of 12 seconds
for dissociation, and at equilibrium the rate of association must
equal the rate of dissociation.  So overwhelming the local supply
of SHBG seems like a better explanation, though being out of
equilibrium might add to it a bit.)</p>
<p>This theory can explain why giving men testosterone doesn’t seem
to increase the risk of prostate cancer, despite testosterone
promoting prostate cancer.  Giving men testosterone shuts down
their own production of testosterone, making backflow from the
testicles to the prostate harmless.  Thus even with more
testosterone in their blood, they can have less in the prostate
gland.</p>
<p>It can also explain why low testosterone is correlated with
prostate cancer: the backflow damages the testicles via hypoxia,
lowering testosterone, while simultaneously funneling the
testosterone that still <em>is</em> released directly to the prostate.</p>
<p>The way Gat and Goren fix this is simply by destroying the
spermatic veins.  Under fluoroscopy (that is, viewing an X-ray
image continuously during the procedure), they snake a catheter
in through the veins until it gets to the top of the spermatic
vein.  They then inject a pulse of X-ray contrast agent to make
the flow in that vein visible under the fluoroscope, proving that
the flow really is going the wrong way.  Having done so, they
then have the patient close off the bottom of the vein with
finger pressure while they inject a sclerosing agent into the
vein; they start by moving the catheter to the bottom and
sclerosing that portion, then repeatedly withdraw the catheter a
bit (moving up) and inject more.  After a few minutes the vein is
thoroughly and permanently clogged.  This is their diagram of the
results:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarchive.net/photos/vein_diagram3.webp"></p><p>To say a bit more about the background of this theory, venous
circulation is not a one-path-only thing: the veins are not like
a tree, where there’s only one path from the trunk to each leaf.
Indeed, this multiplicity of paths is why the problem arises in
the first place: the testicles being drained both by the
spermatic veins and by the local circulation.  It’s also why it
can be solved in this manner: the remaining veins enlarge a bit
to accomodate the flow, as well as new veins growing.  But it’s
also why they need to be thorough when performing the procedure.
Besides destroying both spermatic veins (a weakness, Gat and
Goren say, of other doctors’ work, where it’s often only done on
the left vein where the swollen veins tend to be more prominent),
they also follow up by injecting more pulses of contrast agent to
make sure that there’s no collateral circulation bypassing the
blocked vein, and that the veins they did treat are really
blocked.  (The finger blocking the vein at the bottom keeps the
sclerosing agent where it belongs rather than letting it spread
further into the body.  Of course a little of it still spreads,
but the sort of agent they use is harmless at low
concencentrations.)</p>
<p>It’s odd for there to be such an easily-removable design flaw in
the human body; evolution tends to remove them.  Since it strikes
at advanced ages, BPH doesn’t make a big impact on a man’s
ability to pass on his genes.  But being the leading cause of
male infertility sure does.  Their explanation is that evolution
hasn’t had much time to work on the problem; in animals the
spermatic vein is horizontal, and doesn’t have or need one-way
valves.  It’s our standing upright that yields the problem; in
evolutionary terms that’s a recent development.</p>
<p>So that’s their theory.  There is an obvious question, though,
which mechanically-inclined reviewers might have raised, and
which deserves an answer.  It has to do with pressure and height.
As Gat and Goren say, it is a law of physics that pressure within
a fluid increases as one descends deeper into the fluid, in
direct proportion to the depth.  (They invoke Bernoulli’s
equation, which also involves the velocity of the fluid, but they
then assume the velocity is negligible, so are using only the
part of the equation that relates pressure to height.)</p>
<p>But they apply this law only to the blood in the spermatic vein.
It is also applicable to the blood in the arteries and to the
blood in other veins.  Doing so, though, would ruin their
argument: it would mean that although pressure increases as one
descends down the spermatic vein, it also increases in the other
veins.  In their account, blood goes backward through the
spermatic vein, emerging at a pressure of 40 cm H2O or so, then
pours into other veins which, drained by the common iliac vein
which in turn is drained by the inferior vena cava, are at less
than 10 cm H2O.  (They use mm Hg as their units, but I’ll be
converting all pressures to cm of water, since it’s a more
directly relevant unit: blood’s density is close to that of
water.)</p>
<p>But gravity acts also on the iliac vein and the vena cava!  In
general, if you have a loop of tubing in a gravitational field,
and the fluid inside is not in motion, the pressure of the fluid
is everywhere proportional to altitude, no matter how the tubing
is shaped.  No spontaneous circulation arises.  Here we have a
loop with the spermatic vein being on one side and the vena cava
and iliac vein on the other, connected on top and bottom, and the
claim is that this is enough to give rise to spontaneous
circulation.  It’s not.</p>
<p>Yet there is reverse flow in the spermatic vein when the valves
fail; that’s standard medical knowledge.  And, as mentioned, Gat
and Goren confirm the reverse flow by injecting tracer dye into
each and every vein they treat, before sclerosing that vein.  The
reverse flow exists; it just has to have a more complicated
explanation than the one they provide.</p>
<p>Another part of their argument is that venous blood infiltrates
the prostate due to the venous pressure exceeding the local
pressure in the arteries that feed the prostate.  But gravity
also acts on the blood in arteries.  If the local arterial
pressure were equally boosted by height, it could not be
exceeded.</p>
<p>Fortunately for their argument, that’s not the way the human body
works.  It sort of theoretically could work that way, if all the
blood vessels were rigid: pressure everywhere would increase with
decreasing altitude in the same way that pressure increases with
depth inside the ocean.  Relative pressures would be higher in
arteries, lower in veins, and intermediate in capillaries: the
pressure difference between artery and vein would be the same
throughout the body, but the pressures of both would be highest
in the feet and lowest in the head.  (For fish, or babies in the
womb, this works even without blood vessels being rigid, due to
the outside pressure varying with altitude in the same way as the
pressure in their blood vessels does; all the fluids involved
have densities close enough to the density of water that the
difference doesn’t matter.)</p>
<p>Of course in fact blood vessels are not at all rigid.  Arteries
are the closest to being rigid; they’re thick-walled and can take
a lot of pressure, though they still have an important amount of
elasticity.  Veins, though, are thin-walled: they swell up with
higher pressure and collapse flat at negative pressure.
Capillaries don’t swell, but at higher pressures they leak fluid
into the surrounding tissues, producing swelling there.  So the
body maintains capillary pressures in the neighborhood of 20 cm
H2O (somewhat higher at the start of the capillary and somewhat
lower at its exit).</p>
<p>The usual figures for blood pressure (the ones for which “normal”
is about “120 over 80”) are arterial pressures in units of mm Hg,
measured with a blood cuff around the arm (at about the same
altitude as the heart).  In that example, the 120 is the maximum
pressure just after the heart beats, and the 80 is the minimum
pressure it reaches between beats.  Those numbers translate into
about 160 cm H2O and 110 cm H2O.</p>
<p>In a standing person, the arterial blood pressure is considerably
higher if measured at the ankles, as it would be in the
rigid-vessel model.  But then as large arteries divide down into
smaller and smaller arteries, most of that pressure is spent
before it gets to the capillaries.  This is not just a matter of
passive friction but also of active control: arteries have
muscular walls and contract to restrict blood flow to the part of
the body that they feed.  When more blood flow is needed
somewhere, the local arteries relax to let it through.</p>
<p>Veins operate at low pressure, usually less than 15 cm H2O; the
hard part, and the part that is most relevant here, is explaining
how they get blood upwards against gravity, since their pressure
is nowhere near enough to do so.  The one-way valves in the
spermatic vein have already been mentioned, and are present in
many other veins too, but valves themselves don’t do any actual
pumping work (in the physics sense of the word “work”).  Yet work
needs to be done to pump blood uphill.  In most cases that work
is supplied by muscle movements in nearby muscles, which compress
the veins.  In engineering, pumps are often built with two
one-way valves, the volume between those valves being alternately
compressed and expanded; the principle is the same here.  But
since it relies on muscle movements which are made for other
purposes, this process is slow and uncertain.  So to get the same
throughput the veins are much wider than the arteries.</p>
<p>When the veins’ one-way valves fail near the surfaces of the
legs, it results in high pressures and swollen, unsightly
“varicose veins”.  Even with functioning valves, standing
motionless results in high venous pressures in the feet; thus the
advice, on long trips sitting down, to take breaks and to move
the feet and legs around, so as to avoid blood stagnating and
clotting (a “deep vein thrombosis”).  For blood circulation
fidgeting is good, even if it’s not “good manners”.</p>
<p>But the vena cava is different: it doesn’t have any valves;
neither does the iliac vein (at least the portion of it under
discussion here).  Yet somehow blood which feeds into it at low
pressure manages to climb to the heart, overcoming that 40 mm H2O
pressure difference and more.</p>
<p>I looked in the medical literature for how this actually happens,
and was disappointed not to find a clear, definitive answer.
It’s common to see it stated that breathing has an effect.  The
heart is located between the lungs, so shares a common pressure
compartment.  The pressure outside the heart is about the same as
the pressure outside the lungs.  That pressure decreases to
inhale and increases to exhale.  But those pressure excursions
are minor: about 1 cm H2O in either direction.  (This rises with
heavy breathing, as in exercise; but the blood circulation has to
work even when the body is calm.)</p>
<p>There is also a disturbing level of confusion in the medical
literature as regards what “zero pressure” is.  Good engineering
practice is to say what reference pressure one is measuring
against.  Commonly that is the ambient pressure (the pressure of
the air surrounding the body, which is about 1000 cm H2O at sea
level and lower at higher altitudes).  To inhale, one obviously
has to drop the pressure in the lungs below ambient pressure.  A
measurement relative to ambient pressure is called “gauge
pressure” by engineers, because it’s what the usual sorts of
pressure gauges tell you.  The old-fashioned mercury manometers
for measuring blood pressure measured gauge pressure, since they
were open to the air on their other end.  Modern mercury-free
manometers are no doubt built to give the same numbers (so as to
be compatible, and also because it’s easy to build a gauge that
way.)  So the usual arterial blood pressure numbers are all
referenced against ambient pressure.</p>
<p>That is so even if medical literature tries to confuse the
matter, as happens.  Take, for instance, this passage in Guyton
and Hall’s <em>Textbook of Medical Physiology</em>, 14th edition (a
standard text in medical schools):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pressure Reference Level for Measuring Venous and
Other Circulatory Pressures</strong>  Although we have spoken of
right atrial pressure as being 0 mm Hg and arterial pressure
as being 100 mm Hg, we have not stated the gravitational
level in the circulatory system to which this pressure is
referred. There is one point in the circulatory system at which
gravitational pressure factors caused by changes in body
position of a healthy person usually do not affect the pressure
measurement by more than 1 to 2 mm Hg. This is at or near
the level of the tricuspid valve, as shown by the crossed
axes in Figure 15-12. Therefore, all circulatory pressure
measurements discussed in this text are referred to this level,
which is called the reference level for pressure measurement…</p>
<p>When a person is lying on his or her back, the tricuspid
valve is located at almost exactly 60% of the chest thickness
in front of the back. This is the zero pressure reference level
for a person lying down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what is meant by that?  It purports to define a pressure
reference level, and one that is not just equal to ambient
pressure.  But does it mean that every single blood pressure
measurement in the entire book was done by snaking a catheter
into the heart until it reaches the tricuspid valve, and using
that as reference?  Of course not!  That would be ridiculously
dangerous and expensive.  Also, that valve is in the middle of
the heart: it’s the valve between the right atrium and the right
ventricle.  The pressure there varies strongly as the heart
beats, making it unsuitable as an experimental reference
pressure.</p>
<p>So the passage cannot really mean that it is defining a reference
<em>pressure</em>.  Instead it is defining a pressure reference
<em>altitude</em>.  I take it to be just an overly fancy way of
standardizing the practice of putting the blood pressure cuff
around the top of the arm with the arm draping normally down the
side of the body, which puts the cuff at about heart height.
(Even on someone lying down, that position of the cuff is still
at about heart height.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately it also betrays a lack of real precision, which is
probably unimportant as regards the usual use (arterial
pressures), since those numbers are large, but is important when
dealing with the much lower pressures in veins and the issue of
how venous blood is pushed back from the lower body to the heart.</p>
<p>This lack of a definition also extends to the Gat and Goren
papers: they give pressure numbers, but never say <em>relative to
what</em>.  Ambient pressure generally seems like the best reference
pressure to use; I will be hoping that papers I cite for
pressures used it, but also, since none of them say they do, not
placing much trust in any absolute numbers.</p>
<p>Enough complaining; time to return to the question of how blood
makes it back to the heart.  As mentioned, inhaling a breath
reduces the pressure in the heart and lungs; but that reduced
pressure ends at the diaphragm, the sheet of muscle and tendon
that separates the thorax (heart and lungs) from the abdomen
(guts).  The diaphragm is arched upwards; to inhale we contract
it, flattening it and lowering the pressure in the heart and
lungs while increasing the pressure in the abdomen.  Those two
pressure changes add together to force blood in the vena cava up
past the diaphragm toward the heart.  (This is for normal
breathing; in general the pressure in the abdomen can vary quite
considerably depending on what the abdominal muscles are doing,
as measured for instance in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37629-5">this</a> paper.  Above the
diaphragm, it also depends on what the rib muscles are doing,
they being another force that powers breathing.  But in normal
breathing the diaphragm is the main actor.)</p>
<p>So breathing helps as regards the general problem of returning
blood to the heart.  Still, the heart does need blood feeding it
when breathing out as well as when breathing in.  We don’t
synchronize our breaths with our heartbeats, nor could we, since
breaths are less frequent.  (The frequency of the heartbeat does
change a bit in breathing out compared to breathing in, though.)</p>
<p>It helps that the lungs are elastic, and would collapse if there
weren’t more pressure inside them than outside.  This means the
normal pressure in the thorax is negative, helping to pull blood
in.  This “transpulmonary pressure” (the difference between the
air pressure in the lung and the fluid pressure outside it) is
about 6 cm H2O.</p>
<p>The heart, as it relaxes from its contraction, presumably also
can exert a bit of suction on the incoming flow; it’s obviously
not rigid enough to exert much suction, but every little bit
helps.</p>
<p>That the system operates right on the edge, getting blood back to
the heart with almost no pressure to spare, can be seen by the
reader if he examines the veins on the back of his hand: if held
at lap level those veins stand out, full of blood, while if
raised to eye level they flatten.  By moving the hand up or down
slowly, giving the veins time to empty or fill, the level where
the transition from full to flat occurs can be determined; it’s
about at the same level as the heart.  (This demonstration
probably won’t work for everyone; blood vessels are less
prominent in the young, and also can be hidden by fat.)</p>
<p>Now to return to the main question here, which is backflow in the
spermatic veins.  Those veins are entirely below the diaphragm.
They are in the same pressure compartment as the vena cava is at
that altitude (the retroperitoneal space), so the two competing
flow paths are under about the same pressures.</p>
<p>I’m afraid that the answer is that Gat and Goren are simply wrong
about the pressure at the bottom of the vena cava when standing:
it must be at considerably higher pressure than the sub-10-cm H2O
that they say it is – or at least it is when the patient is
standing up (or sitting normally).  It’s an understandable error,
since the medical literature usually refers to the lower numbers:
in circumstances where it matters, patients are commonly
horizontal.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/564306">a paper from 1966</a> which measured intravenous
pressures both with the patient horizontal and with the patient
standing: the horizontal numbers are in accordance with Gat and
Goren’s, but the standing numbers are considerably higher.  Using
their numbers for the common iliac vein (since they don’t say
where in the vena cava they measured pressures, and since the
common iliac vein is where the veins from the prostate enter, so
is the most relevant number anyway), the average of their three
measurements has the pressure with patient horizontal as 8 cm H2O
(plus an additional 9 cm H2O when breathing in), and the pressure
with patient erect as 30 cm H2O (plus an additional 15 cm H2O
when breathing in).  If we accept these numbers, the pressure in
the common iliac vein is close to the pressure in the bottom of
the spermatic veins.</p>
<p>Again, though, it’s generally agreed that the backflow exists, at
least through the spermatic vein.  (Gat and Goren’s contribution
is extending it to the prostate.)  The large pressure difference
they say is driving the backflow is calculated based on improper
assumptions, but there must be <em>some</em> pressure difference driving
the backflow.</p>
<p>Now, one difference between the two veins competing for flow here
is that the vena cava is much larger and thus has much less
frictional resistance to flow.  In general, blood flow in the
body is dominated by frictional effects (fluid friction, that is,
aka viscosity): Gat and Goren cite Poiseuille’s equation for
fluid flow, which states that flow is proportional to the fourth
power of the diameter of the pipe.  In comparison, if friction
were zero, the flow would only be proportional to the square of
the diameter of the pipe (that is, proportional to its
cross-sectional area).  But Poiseuille’s equation, which has it
as the fourth power, is the generally-accepted formula for blood
flows.  It’s just an approximation, not a fundamental law, but
the fact that it’s the accepted approximation shows how dominant
friction is in blood flow.</p>
<p>The ratio in diameters between the spermatic vein and the vena
cava is about a factor of 7.  So if equal lengths of the two
veins are subjected to the same pressures, Poiseuille’s equation
says that the vena cava has 2401 times the flow and 49 times the
average flow velocity.  But that just predicts much less forward
flow in the spermatic vein; it does not predict that it
backflows.</p>
<p>Yet it does.  The hydrostatics don’t predict it, though; we need
to look into its hydrodynamics.  The two main sources of dynamic
behavior (pulsations or fluctuations rather than constant flows
and pressures) have already been mentioned: one is the right
atrium, alternately accepting inflow then contracting in the
heartbeat, its input valve slamming shut to prevent backflow.
The other source is the breathing.</p>
<p>Since intestines have basically nothing holding them in place (as
can be attested to by any hunter who has gutted an animal,
slitting open its belly and seeing the guts spill out), it’s not
just the blood in the veins but the whole abdominal compartment
that is reasonably well modeled as having a pressure gradient
determined by altitude: about one cm H2O pressure for every cm of
altitude (since most things in the body have a density close to
that of water).  Of course pressures inside a pressurized cavity
(such as the bladder, a vein, or an intestine) can be higher, but
even within those cavities there is the same pressure gradient
with altitude (unless filled with air or some other gas, as
intestines sometimes are).</p>
<p>Though I earlier alluded to the retroperitoneal space as a
pressure compartment, the peritoneum is a thin membrane which, in
surgery, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12072988/">tears easily</a>; there’s not much chance of it
holding significant pressure for long.  What mainly holds in
abdominal pressure are layers of muscle and connective tissue.
In the bottom of the abdomen this is the pelvic floor muscles.
In men, those are just below the prostate, so the prostate too is
in the same pressure compartment.</p>
<p>What isn’t in that pressure compartment are the testicles; they
are hanging out in the breeze, surrounded by ambient pressure.</p>
<p>The level of influence that the heart’s beating has on the
pressure in the vena cava can be judged by the velocity of flow
in it.  According to measurements done in <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.RES.23.3.349">this paper</a>, the
velocity in the inferior vena cava peaks at 45 cm/second (in
people breathing normally while lying down, and measured at the
level of the T11-T12 intervertebral disc).  Per Bernoulli’s
equation, that energy density is the same as is produced by a
pressure rise of 2 cm against Earth’s gravity.  (This is also the
height an object rises to if it is thrown upwards with that
speed.)</p>
<p>2 cm H2O is not much pressure rise, particularly compared to the
above-cited 15 cm H2O pressure increase in the abdomen for
breathing in.  Also, the pressure pulse from the heartbeat is
entirely inside the veins (and diminishes with distance from the
heart), whereas the 15 cm H2O pressure increase is applied to the
whole compartment uniformly.  (But neither of those numbers is
particularly certain, and both must vary considerably depending
on circumstances.)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, capillaries and veins can only hold limited
blood pressure.  But what matters is the difference between
external and internal pressure.  If capillaries exceed maybe 40
cm H2O, they leak fluid, producing edema; but inside a pressure
compartment at 30 cm H2O that internal pressure limit increases
to 70 cm H2O.  Numbers like those occur near the bottom of the
abdominal cavity when standing: pressures higher all-around
without producing distress.  But if the testicles, which are
outside that pressure compartment, experience the same internal
pressure, that will produce distress in capillaries and veins.</p>
<p>While intact, the spermatic vein is protective: its one-way
valves mean that blood is drawn upwards when the abdominal
pressure is at its minimum and can’t return when it’s at its
maximum.  Still, to get into the abdomen at all, the blood in the
spermatic vein has to be at least at the pressure of the abdomen
(at the point of entry, which here is near the bottom of the
abdomen).  The abdominal pressure varies; if the pressure in the
spermatic vein is between the minimum and the maximum abdominal
pressures, then the part of the vein which is in the abdomen will
be collapsed part of the time, which with intact valves makes for
effective pumping.  If the pressure in the spermatic vein is
above the maximum abdominal pressure, it doesn’t need pumping to
flow, but still functions as a pump, via the vein expanding and
contracting.</p>
<p>So when the one-way valves fail, the pressure at the bottom of
the spermatic vein increases.  Still, the difference in pressure
between the failed and working states is not the full 40 cm H2O
that Gat and Goren deduce from the height of the spermatic vein,
but rather cannot be more than the 15 cm H2O pressure difference
between breathing in and breathing out.</p>
<p>Now, that last number is just a measurement from one paper,
likely from one single Irishman; and if he had been breathing
harder the number would have been higher.  So it should not be
taken as gospel; but it wasn’t easy even finding that number.
Not that I pretend to thoroughness; I could well have missed a
better source, and readers who know of one are invited to provide
it.  But I’ve spent enough time looking that at this point it
seems like it might be easier to measure intra-abdominal pressure
changes myself, sticking a pressure probe up my butt – that’s
literally how <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37629-5">this paper</a> did it (but on horizontal patients
rather than vertical ones, so their numbers are not quite on
point here.)  That’s not quite the same thing that the Irish
paper measured, which was intravenous pressure; sticking a
catheter into my veins is way beyond my skill set.  But for
measuring pressure <em>increase</em> it’s close enough, since the
pressure increase from breathing is applied to the whole
compartment.</p>
<p>In any case, that’s why there’s higher pressure at the bottom of
the spermatic vein when the valves fail, but it doesn’t answer
the question of why there is backflow.  The situation, again, is
of two vertical veins, connected at top and bottom, in the same
pressure compartment, with one vein being much larger than the
other.  Static, constant flow would just be divided between the
two; both would flow upwards.  But consider rhythmically varying
flow, such as is produced by the heartbeat or by breathing.
First there is an acceleration phase, which acts on both veins.
In the vena cava, with much less friction, the blood accelerates
upwards, whereas in the spermatic vein, with more friction, there
is much less acceleration; the extra upwards force is mostly
spent against friction.  Then there’s a deceleration phase.  The
blood in the vena cava has inertia; it’s trying to go upwards but
has to stop, so the pressure at its top increases.  Some of that
higher-pressure blood then is pushed down the spermatic vein.
And the flow up the vena cava has such a dominant share of the
overall flow that even a slight influence like this can yield net
backflow in the spermatic vein.</p>
<p>Now, the mechanism I just described does not seem like a
particularly strong mechanism; but as mentioned, in practice it’s
well established that there is backflow; this is just one way
that theory can agree with that observation.  There may be other
mechanisms that do better, perhaps involving the portion of the
flow which is outside the abdominal pressure compartment, and/or
the relatively narrow veins communicating between the two paths
at the their bottom – though that gets complicated enough that
it’s not easy to think through; a computer model might be in
order.</p>
<p>More questionable, although still quite plausible, is the idea
that the backflow reaches the prostate.  The Gat and Goren theory
is that it is pushed by about 40 cm H2O pressure, overwhelming
even the prostate’s arterial supply.  But that’s pure theory;
they don’t report actually measuring any pressures.  (If they
were researchers I would ding them harshly for not doing the
measurements, but they’re clinicians; they’re paid to cure
patients, not to produce knowledge.)</p>
<p>Gat and Goren didn’t do a great job of proving experimentally
that backflow reaches the prostate, either.  They measured the
high free testosterone levels described above, but that
measurement was at the bottom of the spermatic vein; they didn’t
have their catheter make another turn and go into the deferential
vein and then past its junction with the vesicular vein and into
the vein coming from the prostate, so as to measure high free
testosterone levels in a place where they definitely don’t
belong.  (This is readily excusable: those other veins are much
smaller, so the catheter might not fit or might not be able to
make the sharp turn into the smaller vein.  Again, researchers
should be dinged for omitting such tests – there’s got to be
some way to measure pressures there – but clinicians get a
pass.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest piece of evidence they offer for backflow
to the prostate is an X-ray showing contrast agent which was
injected into the spermatic vein.  They state that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On retrograde venography of the PP, after a
delay of about 10 s, a contrast material ‘blush’, of the
prostate gland capsular region, was observed (Fig. 3).
Both are clearly seen in the image.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s their Figure 3 (again, reproduced from their most recent
paper under the terms of a Creative Commons license):</p>
<p><img src="https://yarchive.net/photos/backflow_fluoroscopy.webp"></p><p>Looking at it, I can see the oval they label “prostate”, but it’s
pretty faint.  There are various other structures (such as the
bladder) which are also visible with similar intensity.  Backflow
down the spermatic vein is clearly visible (all that darkness
going down to the region marked PP, for “pampiniform plexus”, the
network of blood vessels above the testicle), but backflow down
the spermatic vein is not the new part of their theory.  There is
some darkness under the the prostate, which looks like
backflowing dye, but is not clearly connected to the dye in the
PP region.  Even if it is dye, it’s not evident whether it gets
into the prostate itself.  Perhaps specialists who are used to
viewing fluoroscopy images will pronounce this one definitive,
but for me it’d take a movie showing contrast emerging from the
tip of the catheter and then making its way to the prostate; in
this day and age, movies should be easy to provide.  Of course in
their clinical practice they <em>are</em> seeing such a movie with their
own eyes for every patient, so it requires a modest level of
distrust to doubt them on this.  But it’s not entirely unknown
for doctors to succumb to wishful thinking, and “blush” is not a
strong word.  I’m not inclined to distrust them on this, but the
image they show is less than a complete proof.</p>
<p>I’d also be curious, with such a movie, to look for variations in
the flow.  There would no doubt be motion visible from breathing,
and the contrast agent would show how that correlated with blood
flow in the veins.</p>
<p>Breathing would help spread the testosterone-loaded outflow,
since the prostate is inside the abdominal pressure compartment
while the testicles are outside.  Breathing would thus push the
flow alternately in one direction then the other, increasing the
chance of subjecting the prostate to outflow from the testicles.
The movie would show this.  Even if it resulted in only a weak
and diluted flow which didn’t deliver the theorized hundred-fold
increase in free testosterone, a ten-fold increase is still quite
a lot and even a doubling would be important.</p>
<p>A really thorough experimental workup would measure all the
relevant flows and pressures, perhaps by using an intravenous
catheter loaded with multiple pressure and flow sensors each
delivering many measurements per second.  (Whether such a
catheter can be bought today and whether it can be readily
inserted into the veins in question are not matters I have looked
into, but with modern technology there’s got to be a way of
measuring such pressures.)  Testosterone levels would also be
measured at various points.</p>
<p>Recently <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10471166/">a paper by Alyamani et al</a> came out which did do
such measurements of testosterone.  The patients were 266 men
undergoing prostatectomies for prostate cancer, none of whom had
any prior hormonal therapy.  During the course of those
operations the researchers extracted blood from the prostatic
dorsal vein and tested it for testosterone.  They also tested the
removed prostates for testosterone.  They indeed found levels of
testosterone in the dorsal vein and in the prostate which were
many times higher than the levels measured in normal peripheral
blood from the same patient.  Related substances in the samples
were consistent with the blood having come straight from the
testicles.  They dubbed this phenomenon “sneaky T”, and describe
their results as supportive of the Gat/Goren theory.</p>
<p>If I were just being booster-ish, I could leave it at that (“yay,
support”); but I’m taking a hard numerical look.  And from a
numerical point of view, at first glance that support seems weak.
Only 20% of the men had dorsal vein / peripheral vein ratios of
testosterone which were two or greater.  About half of them had
ratios below one.  This is not what you’d expect if this were the
main driving force of prostate cancer: you’d expect seriously
elevated ratios in pretty much all the men, not just in 20% or
50% of them.</p>
<p>The association they found between dorsal vein testosterone and
prostate tissue testosterone is also weak.  By biology standards
it’s totally there (P = 0.004), but there were still a lot of men
with high levels in one of those places and low levels in the
other.  This is not what you want for the definitive mechanical
cause of something.</p>
<p>But the title of <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC423704/">a paper</a> they cite caught my eye:
“Testosterone and estradiol are co-secreted episodically by the
human testis.”  Looking at it, I find it could explain the above
weaknesses: the testicles don’t put out testosterone all the
time, but rather do so only in pulses, at the rate of about one
pulse per hour.  Testosterone stays in the bloodstream long
enough that testosterone measurements in circulating blood don’t
vary much, but the output of the testicles varies quite a lot.
The paper’s measurements (once per fifteen minutes) weren’t
frequent enough to really pin down the length of each pulse, and
accordingly they give no figures for that length; but eyeballing
their graphs, maybe elevated testosterone is present about a
quarter of the time, though it’s hard to tell.</p>
<p>So when the Alyamani paper found doubled levels in 20% of men,
that could mean that it was actually happening in all of them,
just only about 20% of the time in each.  Or it might be
happening in half of them, about 40% of the time in each.  Also,
the stress of surgery might have affected the timing of the
testosterone pulses.</p>
<p>The pulsing also could explain prostate tissue concentrations
often being different from dorsal vein concentrations:
testosterone takes time to sink in, so if they measured on the
leading edge of a pulse the tissue concentrations would be lower
than the vein concentrations, whereas on the trailing edge they’d
be higher.  Or the measurements might have been done at different
times during the course of the surgery; the dorsal vein blood
might have been extracted, say, ten minutes prior to the
prostate’s extraction.</p>
<p>So the Alyamani paper’s measurements are consistent with backflow
of high-testosterone blood being a factor not just in 20% or 50%
of cases but in all of them.  Still, the backflow, when present,
is doubtless stronger in some men and weaker in others.  And
indeed being in that top 20% did have some predictive value:
prostate cancer recurrences were more common in the 20% group.
(Since the prostates themselves were all removed, this presumably
represents metastases.  It would be interesting to know whether
the increased metastases were in the same local area bathed by
high testosterone or whether they were distant; but the paper
does not report this.)  They also did not measure free
testosterone, just total testosterone, so that’s another unknown.</p>
<p>Besides the BPH paper, Gat and Goren even tried their method <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19737278/">on
outright prostate cancer</a> (early stage, Gleason 3+3) and
report disappearance of cancer (as measured via biopsy) in 5 out
of 6 patients, along with lowering of PSA levels.</p>
<p>One thing to note, though, is that their fix of destroying the
spermatic vein and any collaterals can’t make the system as good
as it was originally.  Destroying a backflowing vein always
provides improvement in pressures (since otherwise the vein
wouldn’t be backflowing), but it can’t improve pressures as much
as forward flow would.  The ideal would be valve repair or
replacement; that is done routinely on heart valves, but not on
vein valves.  (This also explains why evolution hasn’t simply
removed the spermatic vein in us: when it’s there and working, it
helps.)</p>
<p>Operations for varicocele are done widely, to try to fix male
fertility, but aren’t always of this sort: it’s common to see the
swollen veins in the scrotum as the problem and simply remove
many of them surgically.  This does not squarely address the
problem of backflow, and indeed there’s a bit of debate in the
medical literature over whether it produces statistically
significant fertility improvements.  (On the whole it seems to,
but there are enough failures to produce debate.)</p>
<p>Even among doctors using the embolization approach (that being
the term for inserting a catheter and using it to apply a
sclerosing agent), many do it only on the left side, that usually
being the one with the visible varicocele.  (There is an
asymmetry among the spermatic veins, with the left vein being a
bit longer and thus more problematic.)  Besides doing both sides
(or at least checking both sides for backflow with contrast
agent), sclerosing each from top to bottom, the full Gat/Goren
procedure is also to check for collateral veins and sclerose
those too, and then follow up with more contrast agent to ensure
that it was done properly.</p>
<p>So there’s a chance that a varicocele surgeon will do this
properly, but one can’t just go to a random varicocele surgeon
and assume he’ll do it properly.  Even someone who does believe
the Gat/Goren theory can screw it up in practice, especially if
you’ve just got done persuading him and this is his first try.</p>
<p>Screening for this disorder is simple: use a thermal camera and
compare testicular temperature sitting up (or standing) versus
lying down, in each case waiting five minutes or so for
temperatures to equilibrate, and taping the penis up so that it
does not affect the measurement.  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14550455/">According to Gat and
Goren</a>, this is almost as good a test as measuring backflow
on fluoroscopy, and a far more sensitive test than trying to look
for the enlarged veins of varicocele.  (Rather than a thermal
camera, they use a liquid crystal strip which is designed and
branded for this exact job; but given how expensive medical items
are, these days thermal cameras are likely cheaper and are
certainly more widely available.  Their calibration is probably
not as good, though.)</p>
<p>In the above-referenced blog post, Scott Alexander goes on to
write that neglect of this sort of new idea isn’t some sort of
conspiracy; it’s just the default.  For starters, most new ideas
everywhere are wrong and deserve to be neglected.  And here it’s
not like drugs where the patent system incentivizes people to
develop new ones and gets them enough money to test them
thoroughly and then pay for billions of dollars in advertising.
It also is not one of the “hot” fields in science where
scientists are racing to study the possibilities.  It’s not
genomics or the microbiome or any other “-ome”; it’s just
plumbing.</p>
<p>He might have added that most of society’s attention on medicine
is focused on squabbling about who pays for it, with precious
little attention given to possibilities of finding new ways to
actually cure disease.  Yet those can represent the most dramatic
cost savings; here, a thousand-dollar procedure might mean not
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on cancer.  The
thinking by the powers-that-be should not always be “oh, no, not
<em>another</em> thing that we’ll have to spend even <em>more</em> money on”,
even when that <em>is</em> true in the short run.</p>
<p>Malpractice law also stacks the deck against innovation: it
doesn’t blame doctors for doing what doctors generally believe in
doing (the “standard of care”), even if the outcome is bad, but
it does blame them in the event of a bad outcome from something
new and innovative.  (Which in a way it should, since most new
ideas are wrong; but it’s never really fair to put only the
failures in front of a scientifically ignorant jury and invite
them to shell out millions in damages.)</p>
<p>Insurance doesn’t pay for “experimental” treatments, either.</p>
<p>Advertising by doctors is also strongly frowned-on, particularly
advertising that goes against conventional wisdom; a doctor who
blanketed the local airwaves with claims of a prostate cancer
cure (or even a preventative) would very likely get his license
yanked by the state medical board.  (Not that broadcast
advertising really would be the way here: too costly for an
individual doctor.  The modern way would be targeted Facebook
ads, relying on Facebook’s intimate knowledge of personal medical
problems.  The medical board might not even find out about it,
though if they did they likely would be extra wrathful.)</p>
<p>The back-to-nature crowd is also not interested, at least not in
the financial sense of “interested”, because there’s nothing here
they can sell as a “dietary supplement” and they aren’t permitted
to perform medical procedures.  Perhaps they could advocate going
back to walking on all fours?  Nah, too impractical.  Going back
to the oceans and living like fish, with a supportive pressure
gradient all around us?  Nah, even more impractical (though there
already is a sect of “aquatic ape” believers out there).</p>
<p>None of this amounts to conspiracy – it’s all in the open – but
it adds up to quite a set of obstacles.  (It’s not like anyone’s
paying <em>me</em> to write this, or like I have much prospect of making
money from it; it’s just the strong curiosity of someone whose
grandfathers both died from prostate cancer.)</p>
<p>Being surgery, this procedure doesn’t need to go through FDA
approval, so there’s no decade-long process to form an obstacle
to people getting it.  Finding a doctor who will do a good job of
it, though, is not simple; a short glance at patient forums
reveals considerable frustration.  I can’t tell if the Gat/Goren
clinic in Israel is still open for business: their website
www.pirion.co.il isn’t responding, and given those doctors’ ages
it wouldn’t be surprising if it has closed.  The German clinic
which did the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25389666/">2014 reproducing study</a> might still be doing
the procedure.  At any rate, though, a single clinic can’t handle
worldwide demand for such a common disorder – not even just
elite demand.</p>
<p>The procedure also doesn’t last forever, according to Gat and
Goren’s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32833288/">latest paper</a>.  They write that new venous bypasses
grow to replace the destroyed spermatic veins: at first these are
tiny, but then grow to where the problem recurs.  Part of their
reasoning, though, is faulty: they write that at first the size
of each growing vein is small enough that capillary action can
draw fluid up.  Now, it’s quite true that capillary action (the
physical/chemical attraction between the fluid and the walls of
the capillary tube) can draw fluid up through great heights;
trees, for instance, rely on it to draw water into the treetops.
But it can only draw fluid up <em>into empty space</em>; it has no
lifting effect when the tube starts out completely filled, as is
the case here.  (In trees it’s the evaporation at the top that
powers it.)  A simpler explanation is just that those tiny veins
are too small to cause the problem to recur.  In any case, the
paper makes no comment as to whether the problem can be solved
the same way a second time; obviously in principle it can, but
finding all the new bypasses and sclerosing them might be
difficult in practice.</p>
<p>As for mass adoption, I’m well aware that this essay is not the
stuff of a mass patient movement.  I’ve tried to make it
accessible, but the needs of actually being accurate and making a
thorough technical argument mean that not more than one in a
thousand patients would read to the end of it.  (If you think
otherwise, please consider that your social circles are not
typical.)  A video with animations would improve that proportion
considerably, maybe to one in a hundred, and I’ve considered it,
though I’m not handy with animation tools.  But it’ll take
serious interest from scientists and doctors to really put an end
to all this prostate trouble.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A 24-year-old Australian man who ordered uranium and plutonium to his parents’ apartment has been allowed to walk away from court on a two-year good behaviour bond.</p>
<p>After ordering various radioactive samples over the internet in an effort to collect the entire periodic table, Emmanuel Lidden pleaded guilty to two charges: moving nuclear material into Australia and possessing nuclear material without a permit.</p>
<p>While his actions were criminal, the judge concluded that Lidden had mental health issues and displayed no malicious intent. He is the first person in Australia to be sentenced under the 1987 nuclear non-proliferation act for the importation and possession of nuclear material without the appropriate permits.</p>
<p>The delivery of the materials – which included a quantity of plutonium, depleted uranium, lutetium, thorium and radium – led to a major hazmat incident in August 2023. The entire street that Lidden lived on was closed off and homes were evacuated as Australian Border Force officials, firefighters, police and paramedics investigated.</p>
<p>Lidden is said to be relieved by the sentence. However, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/11/science-nerd-ordered-radioactive-materials-parents-sydney-home-spared-conviction-ntwnfb"><em>The Guardian</em></a> reported that Lidden’s solicitor, John Sutton, had criticised the Border Force for how it had handled the incident, describing it as a ‘massive over-reaction’ because the quantities of material were so small they were safe to eat. He reportedly said that he had been contacted by scientists all around the world saying that the case was ‘ridiculous’.</p>
<p>Lidden is said to have made no attempt to hide his identity when ordering the items from a publicly accessible website in the US and then displayed the materials in plain view on a shelf in his bedroom.</p>
<p>In a statement, Australian Border Force superintendent, James Ryan, said he hoped the case would make more people aware of the regulatory frameworks around what can and cannot be imported into Australia.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/julia-robinson/500505.bio" rel="author"><img alt="Julia Robinson" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width:767px) 74px, 112px" src="https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/112x112/P/Pictures%2Fweb%2Fm%2Fo%2Fo%2Fjuliawebsite_437048.jpg" srcset="https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/74x74/P/Pictures%2Fweb%2Fm%2Fo%2Fo%2Fjuliawebsite_437048.jpg 74w,https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/112x112/P/Pictures%2Fweb%2Fm%2Fo%2Fo%2Fjuliawebsite_437048.jpg 112w" width="74" height="74"></a></p><div><p><span>Julia joined the Chemistry World team as Science correspondent in May 2023.

<p>
    TOKYO (Kyodo) -- A Japanese court on Friday ordered the Japanese unit of online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. to pay 35 million yen ($244,000) in damages for failing to take measures to stop sellers from offering fake products on its platform.
</p>
<!-- cxenseparse_end -->

<!-- cxenseparse_start -->

<p>
    The focus of the trial at the Tokyo District Court was on the degree of obligation Amazon Japan G.K. has to police listings, and how much effort it must make to identify and remove counterfeit goods.
</p>

<p>
    Medical equipment manufacturer Try and E Co. and its distributor Excel Plan Co. sought 280 million yen in damages against Amazon Japan, claiming that their sales declined due to the availability of counterfeit items.
</p>

<p>
    Presiding Judge Yuko Shintani said Amazon is obliged to take effective measures against counterfeits, noting that it failed to stop listings of such products despite being made aware of them.
</p>

<p>
    Try and E and distributor Excel Plan, both based in Kobe, filed the lawsuit over pulse oximeters for measuring blood oxygen levels. Only Excel Plan was compensated.
</p>

<p>
    "The ruling was a landmark in terms of acknowledging the obligation to build an appropriate (authentication) system, as businesses practically have no other option but to use platforms such as that of Amazon," a lawyer representing the plaintiffs said.
</p>

<p>
    The pulse oximeters concerned are developed and manufactured by Try and E, and distributed exclusively by Excel Plan.
</p>

<p>
    According to the suit, Excel Plan was selling a pulse oximeter on Amazon in 2021 while another seller listed a counterfeit item on the same page at about 10 percent of the price of the genuine product.
</p>

<p>
    Since the Amazon system promotes goods with the lowest price, the fake product was more visible on the site, it said.
</p>

<p>
    Excel Plan reported the situation and requested Amazon take appropriate action, but the page listing the genuine oximeter was deleted and the company was unable to sell it, according to the suit.

That’s exactly what happened in 1900 at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Sorbonne University in Paris. Legendary mathematician <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-century-of-mathematics/">David Hilbert</a> presented <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-riemann-hypothesis-the-biggest-problem-in-mathematics-is-a-step-closer/">10 unsolved problems</a> as ambitious guideposts for the 20th century. He later expanded his list to include <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1902-08-10/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3.pdf">23 problems</a>, and their influence on mathematical thought over the past 125 years cannot be overstated.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Hilbert’s sixth problem was one of the loftiest. He called for “axiomatizing” physics, or determining the bare minimum of mathematical assumptions behind all its theories. Broadly construed, it’s not clear that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/math-and-physics-cant-prove-all-truths/">mathematical physicists</a> could ever know if they had resolved this challenge. Hilbert mentioned some specific subgoals, however, and researchers have since refined his vision into concrete steps toward its solution.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In March mathematicians Yu Deng of the University of Chicago and Zaher Hani and Xiao Ma of the University of Michigan posted a new paper to the preprint server arXiv.org that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01800">claims to have cracked one of these goals</a>. If their work withstands scrutiny, it will mark a major stride toward grounding physics in math and may open the door to analogous <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/breakthrough-prize-winner-gerard-t-hooft-says-quantum-mechanics-is-nonsense/">breakthroughs in other areas of physics</a>.</p><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.</p><hr><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In the paper, the researchers suggest they have figured out how to unify three physical theories that explain the motion of fluids. These theories govern a range of engineering applications from aircraft design to weather prediction—but until now, they rested on assumptions that hadn’t been rigorously proven. This breakthrough won’t change the theories themselves, but it mathematically justifies them and strengthens our confidence that the equations work in the way we think they do.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Each theory differs in how much it zooms in on a flowing liquid or gas. At the microscopic level, fluids are composed of particles—little billiard balls bopping around and occasionally colliding—and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mistranslation-of-newtons-first-law-discovered-after-nearly-300-years1/">Newton’s laws of motion</a> work well to describe their trajectories.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">But when you zoom out to consider the collective behavior of vast numbers of particles, the so-called mesoscopic level, it’s no longer convenient to model each one individually. In 1872 Austrian theoretical physicist Ludwig Boltzmann <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783112596760-011/pdf?licenseType=restricted">addressed this when he developed what became known as the Boltzmann equation</a>. Instead of tracking the behavior of every particle, the equation considers the <i>likely</i> behavior of a <i>typical</i> particle. This statistical perspective smooths over the low-level details in favor of higher-level trends. The equation allows physicists to calculate how quantities such as momentum and thermal conductivity in the fluid evolve without painstakingly considering every microscopic collision.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Zoom out further, and you find yourself in the macroscopic world. Here we view fluids not as a collection of discrete particles but as a single continuous substance. At this level of analysis, a different suite of equations—the <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/nseqs.html">Euler and Navier-Stokes equations</a>—accurately describe how fluids move and how their physical properties interrelate without recourse to particles at all.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The three levels of analysis each describe the same underlying reality—how fluids flow. In principle, each theory should build on the theory below it in the hierarchy: the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations at the macroscopic level should follow logically from the Boltzmann equation at the mesoscopic level, which in turn should follow logically from Newton’s laws of motion at the microscopic level. This is the kind of “axiomatization” that Hilbert called for in his sixth problem, and he explicitly referenced Boltzmann’s work on gases in his <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1902-08-10/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3.pdf#page=18">write-up of the problem</a>. We expect complete theories of physics to follow mathematical rules that explain the phenomenon from the microscopic to the macroscopic levels. If scientists fail to bridge that gap, then it might suggest a misunderstanding in our existing theories.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Unifying the three perspectives on fluid dynamics has posed a stubborn challenge for the field, but Deng, Hani and Ma may have just done it. Their achievement builds on decades of incremental progress. Prior advancements all came with some sort of asterisk, though; for example, the derivations involved only worked on short timescales, in a vacuum or under other simplifying conditions.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The new proof broadly consists of three steps: derive the macroscopic theory from the mesoscopic one; derive the mesoscopic theory from the microscopic one; and then stitch them together in a single derivation of the macroscopic laws all the way from the microscopic ones.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The first step was previously understood, and even Hilbert himself contributed to it. Deriving the mesoscopic from the microscopic, on the other hand, has been much more mathematically challenging. Remember, the mesoscopic setting is about the collective behavior of vast numbers of particles. So Deng, Hani and Ma looked at what happens to Newton’s equations as the number of individual particles colliding and ricocheting grows to infinity and their size shrinks to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-elusive-origin-of-zero1/">zero</a>. They proved that when you stretch Newton’s equations to these extremes, the statistical behavior of the system—or the likely behavior of a “typical” particle in the fluid—converges to the solution of the Boltzmann equation. This step forms a bridge by deriving the mesoscopic math from the extremal behavior of the microscopic math.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The major hurdle in this step concerned the length of time that the equations were modeling. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-07171-7_1">It was already known</a> how to derive the Boltzmann equation from Newton’s laws on very short timescales, but that doesn’t suffice for Hilbert’s program, because real-world fluids can flow for any stretch of time. With longer timescales comes more complexity: more collisions take place, and the whole history of a particle’s interactions might bear on its current behavior. The authors overcame this by doing careful accounting of just how much a particle’s history affects its present and leveraging new mathematical techniques to argue that the cumulative effects of prior collisions remain small.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Gluing together their long-timescale breakthrough with previous work on deriving the Euler and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/top-math-prize-awarded-for-describing-the-dynamics-of-the-flow-of-rivers-and-the-melting-of-ice/">Navier-Stokes equations</a> from the Boltzmann equation unifies three theories of fluid dynamics. The finding justifies taking different perspectives on fluids based on what’s most useful in context because mathematically they converge on one ultimate theory describing one reality. Assuming that the proof is correct, it breaks new ground in Hilbert’s program. We can only hope that with just such fresh approaches, the dam will burst on Hilbert’s challenges and more physics will flow downstream.</p></div></div>]]></description>
