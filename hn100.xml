  <p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/la-fda-aprueba-el-primer-medicamento-que-ayuda-reducir-las-reacciones-alergicas-varios-alimentos"><span>Español</span></a></p>

<p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2024/103976s5245lbl.pdf">Xolair</a> (omalizumab) injection for immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergy in certain adults and children 1 year or older for the reduction of allergic reactions (Type I), including reducing the risk of anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to one or more foods. Patients who take Xolair must continue to avoid foods they are allergic to. Xolair is intended for repeated use to reduce the risk of allergic reactions and is not approved for the immediate emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xolair was originally approved in 2003 for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma in certain patients. Xolair is also approved to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in certain patients.</p>

<p><strong>“This newly approved use for Xolair will provide a treatment option to reduce the risk of harmful allergic reactions among certain patients with IgE-mediated food allergies,” said Kelly Stone, M.D., Ph.D., associate director of the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy, and Critical Care in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “While it will not eliminate food allergies or allow patients to consume food allergens freely, its repeated use will help reduce the health impact if accidental exposure occurs.” &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost 6% of people in the United States in 2021 had a food allergy and exposure to the particular food(s) to which they are allergic can lead to potentially life-threatening allergic reactions (i.e., anaphylaxis). There is currently no cure for food allergy. Current treatment requires strict avoidance of the food(s) the patient is allergic to, and prompt administration of epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis should accidental exposures occur. Palforzia (peanut allergen powder) is an oral immunotherapy product approved in patients 4-17 years of age for the mitigation of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to peanut, but its benefits are restricted to peanut allergy. Xolair is the first FDA-approved medication to reduce allergic reactions to more than one type of food after accidental exposure.</p>

<p>Xolair is a drug (in the class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies) that binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE), the antibody type that triggers allergic reactions, and blocks IgE from binding to its receptors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xolair’s safety and efficacy in reducing allergic reactions in subjects with food allergies was established in one multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03881696">study</a> of 168 pediatric and adult subjects (at least 1 year of age or older) who were allergic to peanut and at least two other foods, including milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut or walnut. Researchers randomly gave subjects either Xolair or placebo treatment for 16 to 20 weeks. The primary measure of Xolair’s efficacy was the percentage of subjects who were able to eat a single dose (600 milligrams or greater) of peanut protein (equivalent to 2.5 peanuts) without moderate to severe allergic symptoms, such as moderate to severe skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, at the end of the 16-to-20-week treatment course. Of those who received Xolair, 68% (75 of 110 subjects) were able to eat the single dose of peanut protein without moderate to severe allergic symptoms (e.g., whole body hives, persistent coughing, vomiting), compared to 6% (3 of 55 subjects) who received placebo; these results are statistically significant and clinically meaningful for subjects with food allergy. Of note, however, 17% of subjects receiving Xolair had no significant change in the amount of peanut protein tolerated (could not tolerate 100 mg or more of peanut protein). As a result, continuation of strict allergen avoidance is still necessary, despite treatment with Xolair.</p>

<p>The key secondary measures of efficacy were the percentage of subjects who were able to consume a single dose (1,000 milligrams or greater) of cashew, milk or egg protein without moderate to severe allergic symptoms at the end of the 16-to-20-week treatment course. For cashew, 42% (27 of 64 subjects) who received Xolair achieved this endpoint compared to 3% (1 of 30 subjects) who received placebo. For milk, 66% (25 of 38 subjects) who received Xolair achieved this endpoint, compared to 11% (2 of 19) who received placebo. For egg, 67% (31 of 46 subjects) who received Xolair achieved this endpoint, compared to 0% of the 19 who received placebo. As a result, Xolair treatment is approved for certain patients with one or more IgE-mediated food allergies.</p>

<p>The most common side effects of Xolair observed included injection site reactions and fever. Xolair comes with certain warnings and precautions, such as anaphylaxis, malignancy, fever, joint pain, rash, parasitic (worm) infection and abnormal laboratory tests.</p>

<p>In addition, Xolair comes with a boxed warning for anaphylaxis, which can be life threatening, based on pre-marketing and post-marketing reports of anaphylaxis that occurred after Xolair administration. Anaphylaxis has occurred after the first dose of Xolair, but also has occurred beyond one year after beginning treatment. Xolair should only be started in a healthcare setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis. For selected patients who tolerate initial Xolair treatments in a healthcare setting without anaphylaxis, self-administration (or administration by a caregiver) may be appropriate and should be discussed with a healthcare provider. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Patients should not receive Xolair if they have a history of known severe hypersensitivity to Xolair or any of its components.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xolair is not approved for the immediate emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xolair received <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="473790c8-9758-497f-838f-5940f6b613a8" href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/priority-review" title="Priority Review">Priority Review</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="81e20fd6-29c4-4bdf-861e-f08b5177c4a0" href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/breakthrough-therapy" title="Breakthrough Therapy">Breakthrough Therapy</a> designations for this indication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FDA granted the approval of Xolair to Genentech.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Profiteering Hampers U.S. Grid Expansion" data-elid="2667334015" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/transmission-expansion" data-authors="Ari Peskoe" data-page-title="Profiteering Hampers U.S. Grid Expansion - IEEE Spectrum"><p>
	The United States is not building enough transmission lines to connect regional power networks. The deficit is driving up electricity prices, reducing grid reliability, and hobbling renewable-energy deployment.
</p><p>
	At the heart of the problem are utility companies that refuse to pursue interregional transmission projects, and sometimes even impede them, because new projects threaten their profits and disrupt their industry alliances. Utilities can stall transmission expansion because out-of-date laws sanction these companies’ sweeping control over transmission development.
</p><p>
	As we increasingly electrify our homes, transportation, and factories, utility companies’ choices about transmission will have huge consequences for the nation’s economy and well-being. About 40 corporations, valued at a trillion dollars, own the vast majority of transmission lines in the United States. Their grip over the backbone of U.S. grids demands public scrutiny and accountability.
</p><h2>Many Lines, Stable Power </h2><p>
	High-voltage transmission lines move large amounts of energy over long distances, linking power generation to consumption. A transmission network contains webs of connections, which create a reliable, redundant power-supply system of massive scale.
</p><p>
	At any given time, thousands of power plants supply just enough energy to transmission networks to meet demand. The rules that orchestrate the movement of electricity through this network determine who generates power, and how much. The goal is to keep the lights on at a low cost by utilizing an efficient mix of power plants.</p><p>
	Building more transmission increases the capacity and connectivity of the system, allowing new power plants to connect and more power to flow between transmission networks. This is 
	<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32091" target="_blank">why utility companies are not embracing transmission</a> expansion. They don’t want their power plants to face competition or their regional alliances to lose control over their networks.
</p><p>
	Expansion can open opportunities for new power-plant and transmission developers to undercut utility companies’ profits and take control over the rules that shape the industry’s future. Utility companies are prioritizing their shareholders over the public’s need for cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable energy.
</p><h2>Old Alliances, Old Technology  </h2><p>
	Transmission networks in the United States, which move alternating current, were built over the last century largely by for-profit utility companies, and to a lesser extent by nonprofit utilities operated by governments and local communities. The lines tend to be concentrated around fossil-fuel reserves and population centers but are also shaped by historic utility alliances.
</p><p>
	Where utilities agreed to trade energy, they built sufficient transmission to move power between their local service territories. As utility alliances expanded, transmission networks grew to include new members, but connections to nonallied utilities tended to be weaker.
</p><p>
	The result of these generations-old alliances is a U.S. system fragmented into 
	<a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/ferc-is-coalescing-around-the-idea-of-minimum-transfer-capacity-but-needs-data-and-definitions/" target="_blank">about a dozen regions</a> with limited connectivity between them. The regions are distributed across three separate and largely isolated networks, called “<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-does-the-us-have-three-electrical-grids" target="_self">interconnections</a>”–Eastern, Western, and most of Texas.
</p><p>
	An October 2023 
	<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/National%20Transmission%20Needs%20Study%20-%20Final_2023.12.1.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the U.S. Department of Energy reveals the severity of the problem. Based on studies conducted by national labs and academic researchers, the DoE calculated that interregional transmission in the United States must expand as much as <em>fivefold</em> to maintain reliability and improve resilience to extreme weather and provide access to low-cost clean energy.
</p><p>
	The value of linking regional networks 
	<a href="https://cleanenergygrid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Macro-Grids-in-the-Mainstream-1.pdf" target="_blank">is widely</a> accepted globally. The European Commission in 2018 <a href="https://perma.cc/JUF9-XR2X" target="_blank">set a target</a> for each member country to transmit across its borders at least 15 percent of the electricity produced in its territories. By the end of 2022, <a href="https://perma.cc/DHY7-BZVK" target="_blank">23 gigawatts</a> of cross-border connections in Europe were under construction or in advanced stages of permitting, with <a href="https://tyndp.entsoe.eu/" target="_blank">much more on the way</a>.
</p><h2>Big Benefits   </h2><p>
	One of the main values of connecting regional networks is that it enables—and is in fact 
	<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/100-percent-clean-electricity-by-2035-study.html" target="_blank">critical</a> for—incorporating renewable energy. For instance, four <a href="https://cdn.misoenergy.org/JTIQ%20Report623262.pdf" target="_blank">proposed high-voltage lines</a> totaling 600 kilometers along the seam of regional networks in the upper Midwest could connect at least 28 gigawatts of wind and solar. These lines have been on the drawing board for years, but utilities in the neighboring regions have not moved them forward. The cost of the project, estimated at <a href="https://www.rtoinsider.com/miso-spp-jtiq-portfolio-cost-estimate-doubles/" target="_blank">US $1.9 billion</a>, may seem like a major investment, but it is a fraction of what U.S. utilities spend each year rebuilding aging transmission infrastructure.
</p><p>
	Plus, adding interregional transmission for renewables can 
	<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9770742" target="_blank">significantly reduce costs</a> for consumers. Such connections allow excess wind and solar power to flow to neighboring regions when weather conditions are favorable and allow the import of energy from elsewhere when renewables are less productive.

Interregional transmission also <span>enhances </span><span>reliability,</span><span>particularly during extreme weather.</span><br></p><p>
	In December 2022, Winter Storm Elliott 
	<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/winter-storm-elliott-report-inquiry-bulk-power-system-operations-during-december-2022" target="_blank">disabled power plants and pipelines </a>from North Dakota to Georgia, leading to power outages in the South and billions of dollars in excess energy charges across the Eastern United States. Limited interregional connections <a href="https://acore.org/resources/the-value-of-transmission-during-winter-storm-elliott/" target="_blank">staved off disaster</a>. These links moved electricity to where it was most needed, helping to avoid the sort of catastrophe that befell Texas’s isolated electric grid the year before, when a deep freeze left millions without power for days.
</p><h2>Power, Profit, and Control  </h2><p>
	But from the perspective of utility companies, interregional transmission presents several drawbacks. First, building such connections 
	<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32091" target="_blank">opens the door for competitors</a> who may sell lower-priced power into their region. Second, utilities make far more money constructing power plants than <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dan.slanger/viz/shared/ZDXJGTHJN" target="_blank">building transmission lines</a>, so they are reluctant to build connections that might permanently reduce their opportunities for future generation investments.
</p><p><img id="1ea95" data-rm-shortcode-id="6ce0d3ee56e6ed4ddab7516df20d9ea5" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/graph-comparing-existing-transmission-with-anticipated-need-by-2035-for-18-regions-in-the-u-s.png?id=51524814&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/graph-comparing-existing-transmission-with-anticipated-need-by-2035-for-18-regions-in-the-u-s.png?id=51524814&amp;width=980" width="2844" height="1867" alt="Graph comparing existing transmission with anticipated need by 2035 for 18 regions in the U.S."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">This comparison of current interregional transfer capacity and anticipated need shows that regions will need to increase transmission significantly, assuming moderate load and high clean-energy growth.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">“National Transmission Needs Study,” U.S. Department of Energy</small></p><p>
	Third, major interregional transmission projects are less financially attractive to utility companies in comparison with smaller ones. For larger projects, utilities may have to compete against other developers for the opportunity to profit from construction. The utility industry sponsors 
	<a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20230323-5161&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank">third-party oversight</a> of such projects, while smaller projects are less scrutinized by the industry. Smaller projects <a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20230323-5189&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank">are easier to pull off</a> and <a href="https://perma.cc/SY72-QY45" target="_blank">more profitable</a> than the larger ones, because they need fewer construction permits, face less review by regulators and industry, and are built by utilities without competition from other developers.
</p><p>
	Fourth, interregional lines threaten utility companies’ dominance over the nation’s power supply. In the power industry, 
	<a href="https://www.eba-net.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/8-Peskoe547-618.pdf" target="_blank">asset ownership provides control</a> over rules that govern energy markets and transmission service and expansion. When upstart entities build power plants and transmission lines, they may be able to dilute utility companies’ control over power-industry rules and prevent utilities from dictating decisions about transmission expansion.
</p><h2>Help on the Hill  </h2><p>
	Addressing the transmission shortage is on the agenda in Washington, but utility companies are lobbying against reforms. In September, Senator John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Representative Scott Peters (D-Calif.) introduced the 
	<a href="https://www.hickenlooper.senate.gov/press_releases/hickenlooper-peters-introduce-big-wires-act-to-reform-permitting-lower-energy-costs/" target="_blank">BIG WIRES Act</a> to force utilities or competing developers to build more interregional links. In 2022, Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) <a href="https://energy.senate.gov/2022/12/manchin-releases-permitting-text-and-urges-colleagues-to-support-mvp-and-permitting-amendment-to-ndaa" target="_blank">proposed an approach</a> in which transmission developers recommend projects to the DoE. If the agency deems a project to be in the national interest, federal regulators could permit the project’s construction and force utilities to pay for it.
</p><p>
	Meanwhile, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is currently reevaluating how utilities develop and operate transmission networks and 
	<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ferc-proposed-transmission-planning-rule-phillips-clements/700423/" target="_blank">may issue new rules</a> in the coming months. In response, utilities are preparing litigation that could strip FERC of authority to impose any transmission rules at all. Their goal is to protect their profits and control, even if it comes at the consumer’s expense.
</p><p>
	The U.S. Department of Energy is pitching in too. On 6 February, the department announced it would award $1.2 billion to support new high-voltage transmission lines, on top of the $1.3 billion it provided last fall to three interstate projects. Later this year, it plans to unveil its long-awaited 
	<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/01/19/2022-00883/building-a-better-grid-initiative-to-upgrade-and-expand-the-nations-electric-transmission-grid-to" target="_blank">national plan</a> for a large-scale transmission build-out. But without industry support or tens of billions in additional funding from Congress to build these projects, the agency’s vision will not be realized.
</p><h2>Leading With Technology  </h2><p>
	New business models and technologies offer hope. Investors and entrepreneurs are developing long-distance 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/multiterminal-hvdc-networks" target="_self">direct-current lines</a>, which are <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/multiterminal-hvdc-networks" target="_self">more efficient at moving</a> large amounts of energy over long distances, compared with AC. These DC projects sidestep the utility-dominated transmission-expansion planning processes.
</p><p>
	Many high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines are already in operation, especially in 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chinas-ambitious-plan-to-build-the-worlds-biggest-supergrid" target="_self">China</a> and Europe. In fact, DC lines are now the <a href="https://tyndp.entsoe.eu/explore/about-the-tyndp-project-portfolio" target="_blank">preferred choice in Europe’s plans</a> to unite the continent.
</p><p>
	The United States lacks a coordinated national planning effort to connect regional networks, but developers can make progress project by project. For example, future DC lines will connect generators in 
	<a href="https://grainbeltexpress.com/" target="_blank">Kansas to a neighboring network in Illinois,</a> stretch from <a href="https://www.transwestexpress.net/" target="_blank">Wyoming to California</a>, and <a href="https://patternenergy.com/projects/sunzia/" target="_blank">move wind and solar energy</a><a href="https://patternenergy.com/projects/sunzia/" target="_blank"> across the Southwest</a>. Each of these projects will move renewable energy from where it can be generated cheaply to larger markets where power prices are higher, and in doing so they will help bolster the country’s regional transmission networks.
</p><p>
	These pioneering projects show that utility companies in the United States don’t have to build interregional lines, but they do need to get out of the way. Transmission rules written by utilities and their industry allies can 
	<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/E-19-061820.pdf" target="_blank">obstruct</a>, <a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filedownload?fileid=6DB63A1D-ACDF-C2A8-87D9-8CF539B00000" target="_blank">delay</a>, and <a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filedownload?fileid=15816262" target="_blank">add costs</a> to these new projects. Streamlining federal and state permitting processes can encourage more investment, but cutting government red tape will not neutralize utility companies’ objections to interregional transmission.
</p><p>
	U.S. regulators and Congress must press forward. Promising proposals that promote new business models and limit utility control are on the table. Our energy future is on the line.

It had been a successful year: a new plant had opened, and the company had doubled the amount of squid that it exported to the United States. The party, according to videos posted on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, featured singers, instrumentalists, dancers, fireworks, and strobe lights. One aspect of the company’s success seems to have been its use of North Korean workers, who are sent by their government to work in Chinese factories, in conditions of captivity, to earn money for the state. A seafood trader who does business with Jinhui recently estimated that it employed between fifty and seventy North Koreans. Videos posted by a company representative show machines labelled in Korean, and workers with North Korean accents explaining how to clean squid. At the party, the company played songs that are popular in Pyongyang, including “People Bring Glory to Our Party” (written by North Korea’s 1989 poet laureate) and “We Will Go to Mt. Paektu” (a reference to the widely mythologized birthplace of Kim Jong Il). Performers wore North Korean colors, and the country’s flag billowed behind them; in the audience, dozens of workers held miniature flags.</p><div><figure><figcaption><p><span>A party held by Donggang Jinhui Foodstuff, a seafood-processing company in Dandong, China, last year, included what appeared to be North Korean workers.</span><span>Source: Douyin</span></p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Drone footage played at the event showed off Jinhui’s twenty-one-acre, fenced-in compound, which has processing and cold-storage facilities and what appears to be a seven-floor dormitory for workers. The company touted a wide array of Western certifications from organizations that claim to check workplaces for labor violations, including the use of North Korean workers. When videos of the party were posted online, a commenter—presumably befuddled, because using these workers violates U.N. sanctions—asked, “Aren’t you prohibited from filming this?”</p><p>Like Jinhui, many companies in China rely on a vast program of forced labor from North Korea. (Jinhui did not respond to requests for comment.) The program is run by various entities in the North Korean government, including a secretive agency called Room 39, which oversees activities such as money laundering and cyberattacks, and which funds the country’s nuclear- and ballistic-missile programs. (The agency is so named, according to some defectors, because it is based in the ninth room on the third floor of the Korean Workers’ Party headquarters.) Such labor transfers are not new. In 2012, North Korea sent some forty thousand workers to China. A portion of their salaries was taken by the state, providing a vital source of foreign currency for Party officials: at the time, a Seoul-based think tank estimated that the country made as much as $2.3 billion a year through the program. Since then, North Koreans have been sent to Russia, Poland, Qatar, Uruguay, and Mali.</p><p>In 2017, after North Korea tested a series of nuclear and ballistic weapons, the United Nations imposed sanctions that prohibit foreign companies from using North Korean workers. The U.S. passed a law that established a “rebuttable presumption” categorizing work by North Koreans as forced labor unless proven otherwise, and levying fines on companies that import goods tied to these workers. China is supposed to enforce the sanctions in a similar manner. Nevertheless, according to State Department estimates, there are currently as many as a hundred thousand North Koreans working in the country. Many work at construction companies, textile factories, and software firms. Some also process seafood. In 2022, according to Chinese officials running pandemic quarantines, there were some eighty thousand North Koreans just in Dandong, a hub of the seafood industry.</p><p>Last year, I set out with a team of researchers to document this phenomenon. We reviewed leaked government documents, promotional materials, satellite imagery, online forums, and local news reports. We watched hundreds of cell-phone videos published on social-media sites. In some, the presence of North Koreans was explicit. Others were examined by experts to detect North Korean accents, language usage, and other cultural markers. Reporting in China is tightly restricted for Western reporters. But we hired Chinese investigators to visit factories and record footage of production lines. I also secretly sent interview questions, through another group of investigators and their contacts, to two dozen North Koreans—twenty workers and four managers—who had recently spent time in Chinese factories. Their anonymous responses were transcribed and sent back to me.</p></div></div><div><p>The workers, all of whom are women, described conditions of confinement and violence at the plants. Workers are held in compounds, sometimes behind barbed wire, under the watch of security agents. Many work gruelling shifts and get at most one day off a month. Several described being beaten by the managers sent by North Korea to watch them. “It was like prison for me,” one woman said. “At first, I almost vomited at how bad it was, and, just when I got used to it, the supervisors would tell us to shut up, and curse if we talked.” Many described enduring sexual assault at the hands of their managers. “They would say I’m fuckable and then suddenly grab my body and grope my breasts and put their dirty mouth on mine and be disgusting,” a woman who did product transport at a plant in the city of Dalian said. Another, who worked at Jinhui, said, “The worst and saddest moment was when I was forced to have sexual relations when we were brought to a party with alcohol.” The workers described being kept at the factories against their will, and being threatened with severe punishment if they tried to escape. A woman who was at a factory called Dalian Haiqing Food for more than four years said, “It’s often emphasized that, if you are caught running away, you will be killed without a trace.”</p><p>In all, I identified fifteen seafood-processing plants that together seem to have used more than a thousand North Korean workers since 2017. China officially denies that North Korean laborers are in the country. But their presence is an open secret. “They are easy to distinguish,” a Dandong native wrote in a comment on Bilibili, a video-sharing site. “They all wear uniform clothes, have a leader, and follow orders.” Often, footage of the workers ends up online. In a video from a plant called Dandong Yuanyi Refined Seafoods, a dozen women perform a synchronized dance in front of a mural commemorating Youth Day, a North Korean holiday. The video features a North Korean flag emoji and the caption “Beautiful little women from North Korea in Donggang’s cold-storage facility.” (The company did not respond to requests for comment.) Remco Breuker, a North Korea specialist at Leiden University, in the Netherlands, told me, “Hundreds of thousands of North Korean workers have for decades slaved away in China and elsewhere, enriching their leader and his party while facing unconscionable abuse.”</p></div><div><div><figure><div><picture><img loading="lazy" src="https://downloads.newyorker.com/projects/2024/240226-north-korea-urbina/photos/office_manager_north_korea.jpg" alt="A photo of an office that had a wooden desk with two miniature flags, one Chinese and one North Korean.

Portions of this image have been blurred to protect sources.</span><span>Photograph from The Outlaw Ocean Project</span></p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>In late 2023, an investigator hired by my team visited a Chinese plant called Donggang Xinxin Foodstuff. He found hundreds of North Korean women working under a red banner that read, in Korean, “Let’s carry out the resolution of the 8th Congress of the Workers’ Party.” (The company did not respond to requests for comment.) Soon afterward, the investigator visited a nearby plant called Donggang Haimeng Foodstuff, and found a North Korean manager sitting at a wooden desk with two miniature flags, one Chinese and one North Korean. The walls around the desk were mostly bare except for two portraits of the past North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. The manager took our investigator to the workers’ cafeteria to eat a North Korean cold-noodle dish called <em>naengmyeon</em>, and then gave him a tour of the processing floor. Several hundred North Korean women dressed in red uniforms, plastic aprons, and white rubber boots stood shoulder to shoulder at long metal tables under harsh lights, hunched over plastic baskets of seafood, slicing and sorting products by hand. “They work hard,” the manager said. The factory has exported thousands of tons of fish to companies that supply major U.S. retailers, including Walmart and ShopRite. (A spokesperson for Donggang Haimeng said that it does not hire North Korean workers.)</p><p>At times, China aggressively conceals the existence of the program. Alexander Dukalskis, a political-science professor at University College Dublin, said that workers have a hard time making their conditions known. “They’re in a country where they may not speak the language, are under surveillance, usually living collectively, and have no experience in contacting journalists,” he said. In late November, after my team’s investigators visited several plants, authorities distributed pamphlets on the country’s anti-espionage laws. Local officials announced that people who try “to contact North Korean workers, or to approach the workplaces of North Korean workers, will be treated as engaging in espionage activities that endanger national security, and will be punished severely.” They also warned that people who were found to be working in connection with foreign media outlets would face consequences under the Anti-Espionage Act.</p></div></div><div><div><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://downloads.newyorker.com/projects/2024/240226-north-korea-urbina/map/north_korea_china_border_desktop_02.jpg" media="(min-width: 1024px)"><img loading="lazy" src="https://downloads.newyorker.com/projects/2024/240226-north-korea-urbina/map/north_korea_china_border_mobile_02.jpg"></picture></div><figcaption><p><span>The border between China and North Korea.</span></p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><em>Dandong, a city of more than two million people</em>, sits on the Yalu River, just over the border from North Korea. The Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge links Dandong to the North Korean city of Sinuiju. A second bridge, bombed during the Korean War, still extends partway across the river, and serves as a platform from which Chinese residents can view the North Koreans living six hundred yards away. The Friendship Bridge is one of the Hermit Kingdom’s few gateways to the world. Some trade with North Korea is allowed under U.N. sanctions, and nearly seventy per cent of the goods exchanged between that country and China travel across this bridge. At least one department store in Dandong keeps a list of products preferred by North Korean customers. Shops sell North Korean ginseng, beer, and “7.27” cigarettes, named for the date on which the armistice ending the Korean War was signed. The city is home to a museum about the conflict, officially called the Memorial Hall of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. On boat tours, Chinese tourists purchase bags of biscuits to toss to children on the North Korean side of the river.</p><p>Government officials carefully select workers to send to China, screening them for their political loyalties to reduce the risk of defections. To qualify, a person must generally have a job at a North Korean company and a positive evaluation from a local Party official. “These checks start at the neighborhood,” Breuker said. Candidates who have family in China, or a relative who has already defected, can be disqualified. For some positions, applicants under twenty-seven years of age who are unmarried must have living parents, who can be punished if they try to defect, according to a report from the South Korean government; applicants over twenty-seven must be married. North Korean authorities even select for height: the country’s population is chronically malnourished, and the state prefers candidates who are taller than five feet one, to avoid the official embarrassment of being represented abroad by short people. Once selected, applicants go through pre-departure training, which can last a year and often includes government-run classes covering everything from Chinese customs and etiquette to “enemy operations” and the activities of other countries’ intelligence agencies. (The North Korean government did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>The governments of both countries coördinate to place workers, most of whom are women, with seafood companies. The logistics are often handled by local Chinese recruitment agencies, and advertisements can be found online. A video posted on Douyin this past September announced the availability of twenty-five hundred North Koreans, and a commenter asked if they could be sent to seafood factories. A post on a forum advertised five thousand workers; a commenter asked if any spoke Mandarin, and the poster replied, “There is a team leader, management, and an interpreter.” A company called Jinuo Human Resources posted, “I am a human-resources company coöperating with the embassy, and currently have a large number of regular North Korean workers.” Several people expressed interest. (The company did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>Jobs in China are coveted in North Korea, because they often come with contracts promising salaries of around two hundred and seventy dollars a month. (Similar work in North Korea pays just three dollars a month.) But the jobs come with hidden costs. Workers usually sign two- or three-year contracts. When they arrive in China, managers confiscate their passports. Inside the factories, North Korean workers wear different uniforms than Chinese workers. “Without this, we couldn’t tell if one disappeared,” a manager said. Shifts run as long as sixteen hours. If workers attempt to escape, or complain to people outside the plants, their families at home can face reprisals. One seafood worker described how managers cursed at her and flicked cigarette butts. “I felt bad, and I wanted to fight them, but I had to endure,” she said. “That was when I was sad.”</p><div><h6>The Daily

</p></div><p>Workers get few, if any, holidays or sick days. At seafood plants, the women sleep in bunk beds in locked dormitories, sometimes thirty to a room. One worker, who spent four years processing clams in Dandong, estimated that more than sixty per cent of her co-workers suffered from depression. “We regretted coming to China but couldn’t go back empty-handed,” she said. Workers are forbidden to tune in to local TV or radio. They are sometimes allowed to leave factory grounds—say, to go shopping—but generally in groups of no more than three, and accompanied by a minder. Mail is scrutinized by North Korean security agents who also “surveil the daily life and report back with official reports,” one manager said. Sometimes the women are allowed to socialize. In a video titled “North Korean beauties working in China play volleyball,” posted in 2022, women in blue-and-white uniforms exercise on the grounds of the Dandong Omeca Food seafood plant. (The company that owns the plant did not respond to requests for comment.) A commenter wrote, “The joy of poverty. That’s just how it is.”</p><p>Factories typically give the women’s money to their managers, who take cuts for themselves and the government, and hold on to the rest until the workers’ terms in China end. Kim Jieun, a North Korean defector who now works for Radio Free Asia, said that companies tell workers their money is safer this way, because it could be stolen in the dormitories. But, in the end, workers often see less than ten per cent of their promised salary. One contract that I reviewed stipulated that around forty dollars would be deducted each month by the state to pay for food. More is sometimes deducted for electricity, housing, heat, water, insurance, and “loyalty” payments to the state. Managers also hold on to wages to discourage defections. The women have been warned, Kim added, that if they try to defect “they will be immediately caught by Chinese CCTV cameras installed everywhere.” This past October, Chinese authorities repatriated around six hundred North Korean defectors. “China does not recognize North Korean defectors as refugees,” Edward Howell, who teaches politics at Oxford University, told me. “If they are caught by Chinese authorities, they will be forcibly returned to the D.P.R.K., where they face harsh punishment in labor camps.”</p></div></div><div><p>Chinese companies have significant incentives to use North Korean workers. They’re typically paid only a quarter of what local employees earn. And they are generally excluded from mandatory social-welfare programs (regarding retirement, medical treatment, work-related injury, and maternity), which further reduces costs. In 2017, Dandong’s Commerce Bureau announced a plan to create a cluster of garment factories that would use North Korean labor. The bureau’s Web site noted that all such workers undergo political screenings to make sure they are “rooted, red, and upright.” “The discipline among the workers is extremely strong,” it added. “There are no instances of absenteeism or insubordination toward leadership, and there are no occurrences of feigning illness or delaying work.” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to questions for this piece, but last year the Chinese Ambassador to the U.N. wrote that China has abided by sanctions even though it has sustained “great losses” as a result. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently said that China and North Korea have “enjoyed long-standing friendly ties,” adding, “The United States needs to draw lessons, correct course, step up to its responsibility, stop heightening the pressure and sanctions, stop military deterrence, and take effective steps to resume meaningful dialogue.”</p><p>North Koreans face difficult circumstances across industries. In January of this year, more than two thousand workers rioted in Jilin Province, breaking sewing machines and kitchen utensils, when they learned that their wages would be withheld. Many North Koreans—perhaps thousands—work in Russian logging, in brutal winter weather without proper clothing. Hundreds have been found working in the Russian construction industry; some lived in shipping containers or in the basements of buildings under construction, because better accommodations were not provided. One recounted working shifts that lasted from 7:30 <small>A</small>.<small>M</small>. to 3 <small>A</small>.<small>M</small>. In preparation for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, held in Russia and Qatar, thousands of North Koreans were sent to build stadiums and luxury apartments. A subcontractor who worked alongside the North Koreans in Russia told the <em>Guardian</em> that they lived in cramped spaces, with as many as eight people packed into a trailer, in an atmosphere of fear and abuse like “prisoners of war.”</p></div><div><div><figure><figcaption><p><span>At Donggang Haimeng, last year, several hundred workers, many of whom were North Korean, stood shoulder to shoulder at long metal tables under harsh lights.

Some eighty per cent of seafood consumed in America, for example, is imported, and much of it comes from China through opaque supply chains. To trace the importation of seafood from factories that appear to be using North Korean labor, my team reviewed trade data, shipping contracts, and the codes that are stamped on seafood packages to monitor food safety. We found that, since 2017, ten of these plants have together shipped more than a hundred and twenty thousand tons of seafood to more than seventy American importers, which supplied grocery stores including Walmart, Giant, ShopRite, and the online grocer Weee! The seafood from these importers also ended up at major restaurant chains, like McDonald’s, and with Sysco, the largest food distributor in the world, which supplies almost half a million restaurants, as well as the cafeterias on American military bases, in public schools, and for the U.S. Congress. (Walmart, Weee!, and McDonald’s did not respond to requests for comment. Giant’s parent company, Ahold Delhaize, and ShopRite’s parent company, Wakefern, said their suppliers claimed that they currently do not source from the Chinese plant in question, and added that audit reports showed no evidence of forced labor.)</p><p>Two of the plants that investigators from my team visited—Dandong Galicia Seafood and Dalian Haiqing Food—had an estimated fifty to seventy North Korean workers apiece. One worker who has been employed at Galicia said that the managers are “so stingy with money that they don’t allow us to get proper medical treatment even when we are sick.” Galicia and Haiqing have shipped roughly a hundred thousand tons of seafood to American importers since 2017, and Haiqing also shipped to an importer that supplies the cafeterias of the European Parliament. (Dalian Haiqing Food said that it “does not employ overseas North Korean workers.” Dandong Galicia Seafood did not respond to requests for comment. One of the U.S. importers tied to Haiqing, Trident Seafoods, said that audits “found no evidence or even suspicion” of North Korean labor at the plant. Several companies, including Trident, High Liner, and Sysco, said that they would sever ties with the plant while they conducted their own investigations. A spokesperson for the European Parliament said that its food contractor did not supply seafood from the plant.) Breuker, from Leiden University, told me that American customers quietly benefit from this arrangement. “This labor-transfer system is for North Korea and China as economically successful as it is morally reprehensible,” he said. “It’s also a boon for the West because of the cheap goods we get as a result.”</p><p>North Korea doesn’t just export seafood workers; it also exports fish—another means by which the government secures foreign currency. Importing North Korean seafood is forbidden by U.N. sanctions, but it also tends to be inexpensive, which encourages companies to skirt the rules. Sometimes Chinese fishing companies pay the North Korean government for illegal licenses to fish in North Korea’s waters. Sometimes they buy fish from other boats at sea: a letter from a North Korean, leaked in 2022, proposed selling ten thousand tons of squid to a Chinese company in return for more than eighteen million dollars and five hundred tons of diesel fuel. Sometimes the seafood is trucked over the border. This trade is poorly hidden. In October, a Chinese man who said his last name was Cui posted a video on Douyin advertising crabs from North Korea. When someone commented, “The goods can’t be shipped,” Cui responded with laughing emojis. In other videos, he explained that he operated a processing plant in North Korea, and gave information on the timing of shipments that he planned to send across the border. When I contacted Cui, he said that he had stopped importing North Korean seafood in 2016 (though the videos were actually from last year), and added, “It’s none of your business, and I don’t care who you are.” My team found that seafood from North Korea was imported by several American distributors, including HF Foods, which supplies more than fifteen thousand Asian restaurants in the U.S. (HF Foods did not respond to requests for comment.)</p></div></div><div><p>Chinese companies often claim that they are in compliance with labor laws because they have passed “social audits,” which are conducted by firms that inspect worksites for abuses. But half the Chinese plants that we found using North Korean workers have certifications from the Marine Stewardship Council, which is based in the U.K. and sets standards for granting sustainability certifications, but only to companies that have also passed social audits or other labor assessments. (Jackie Marks, an M.S.C. spokesperson, told me that these social audits are conducted by a third party, and that “We make no claims about setting standards on labor.”) Last year, one of my team’s investigators visited a seafood-processing plant in northeastern China called Dandong Taifeng Foodstuff. The company has been designated a “national brand,” a status reserved for the country’s most successful companies, and supplies thousands of tons of seafood to grocery stores in the U.S. and elsewhere. At the plant, our investigator was given a tour by a North Korean manager. On the factory floor, which was lit by bright fluorescent bulbs, more than a hundred and fifty North Korean women, most of them under thirty-five years old, wore head-to-toe white protective clothing, plastic aprons, white rubber boots, and red gloves that went up to their elbows. They stood with their heads down, moving red, yellow, and blue plastic bins of seafood. Water puddled at their feet. “Quick, quick,” one woman said to the other members of her small group. (Taifeng did not respond to requests for comment.) Just weeks after that visit, the plant was recertified by the Marine Stewardship Council.</p><p>Marcus Noland, who works at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said, of social audits within the seafood industry, “The basic stance appears to be ‘See no evil.’&nbsp;” Skepticism of such audits is growing. In 2021, the U.S. State Department said that social audits in China are generally inadequate for identifying forced labor, in part because auditors rely on government translators and rarely speak directly to workers. Auditors can be reluctant to anger the companies that have hired them, and workers face reprisals for reporting abuses. This past November, U.S. Customs and Border Protection advised American companies that a credible assessment would require an “unannounced independent, third-party audit” and “interviews completed in native language.” Liana Foxvog, who works at a nonprofit called the Worker Rights Consortium, argues that assessments should involve other checks too, including off-site worker interviews. But she noted that most audits in China fall short even of C.B.P.’s standards.</p><p>Joshua Stanton, an attorney based in Washington, D.C., who helped draft the American law that banned goods produced with North Korean labor, argues that the government is not doing enough to enforce it. “The U.S. government will need to put more pressure on American companies, and those companies need to be more diligent about their suppliers and their supply chains, or face stricter sanctions,” he said. Chris Smith, a Republican congressman from New Jersey and a specialist on China, noted that social audits “create a Potemkin village.” He added, “The consequence is that millions of dollars, even federal dollars, are going to Chinese plants using North Korean workers, and that money then goes right into the hands of Kim Jong Un’s regime, which uses the money to arm our adversaries and repress its own people.”</p></div><div><div><p><em>Late last year</em>, when I set out to contact North Koreans who had been sent to China, I ran into significant obstacles. Western journalists are barred from entering North Korea, and citizens of the country are strictly prohibited from talking freely to reporters. I hired a team of investigators in South Korea who employ contacts in North Korea to get information out of the country for local and Western news outlets—for example, about food shortages, power outages, or the rise of anti-government graffiti. The investigators compiled a list of two dozen North Koreans who had been dispatched to a half-dozen different Chinese factories, most of whom had since returned home. The investigators’ contacts then met with these workers in secret, one-on-one, so that the workers wouldn’t know one another’s identity. The meetings usually occurred in open fields, or on the street, where it’s harder for security agents to conduct surveillance.</p><p>The workers were told that their responses would be shared publicly by an American journalism outlet. They faced considerable risk speaking out; experts told me that, if they were caught, they could be executed, and their families put in prison camps. But they agreed to talk because they believe that it is important for the rest of the world to know what happens to workers who are sent to China. The North Korean contacts transcribed their answers by hand, and then took photos of the completed questionnaires and sent them, using encrypted phones, to the investigators, who sent them to me. North Koreans who are still in China were interviewed in a similar fashion. Because of these layers of protection, it is, of course, impossible to fully verify the content of the interviews. But the responses were reviewed by experts to make sure that they are consistent with what is broadly known about the work-transfer program, and in line with interviews given by North Korean defectors. (Recently, the investigators checked in on the interviewers and interviewees, and everyone was safe.)</p></div><div><p>Transcribed interviews with North Korean workers.

”</p></blockquote></div></div></div><div><p>In their answers, the workers described crushing loneliness. The work was arduous, the factories smelled, and violence was common. “They kicked us and treated us as subhuman,” the worker who processed clams in Dandong said. Asked if they could recount any happy moments, most said that there had been none. A few said that they felt relieved when they returned home and got some of their pay. “I was happy when the money wasn’t all taken out,” the woman who did product transport in Dalian said. One woman said that her experience at a Chinese plant made her feel like she “wanted to die.” Another said that she often felt tired and upset while she was working, but kept those thoughts to herself to avoid reprisals. “It was lonely,” she said. “I hated the military-like communal life.”</p><p>The most striking pattern was the women’s description of sexual abuse. Of twenty workers, seventeen said that they had been sexually assaulted by their North Korean managers. They described a range of tactics used to coerce them into having sex. Some managers pretended to wipe something from their uniforms, only to grope them. Some called them into their offices as if there were an emergency, then demanded sex. Others asked them to serve alcohol at a weekend party, then assaulted them there. “When they drank, they touched my body everywhere like playing with toys,” a woman said. The woman who did product transport in Dalian said, “When they suddenly put their mouths to mine, I wanted to throw up.” If the women didn’t comply, the managers could become violent. The worker who was at Haiqing for more than four years said, of her manager, “When he doesn’t get his way sexually, he gets angry and kicks me. . . . He calls me a ‘fucking bitch.’ ” Three of the women said that their managers had forced workers into prostitution. “Whenever they can, they flirt with us to the point of nausea and force us to have sex for money, and it’s even worse if you’re pretty,” another worker at Haiqing said. The worker from Jinhui noted, “Even when there was no work during the pandemic, the state demanded foreign-currency funds out of loyalty, so managers forced workers to sell their bodies.” The worker who spent more than four years at Haiqing said, of the managers, “They forced virgin workers into prostitution, claiming that they had to meet state-set quotas.”</p><p>The pandemic made life more difficult for many of the women. When China closed its borders, some found themselves trapped far from home. Often, their workplaces shut down, and they lost their incomes. North Korean workers sometimes pay bribes to government officials to secure posts in China, and, during the pandemic, many borrowed these funds from loan sharks. The loans, typically between two and three thousand dollars, came with high interest rates. Because of work stoppages in China, North Korean workers were unable to pay back their loans, and loan sharks sent thugs to their relatives’ homes to intimidate them. Some of their families had to sell their houses to settle the debts. In 2023, according to Radio Free Asia, two North Korean women at textile plants killed themselves. The worker who told me that she wanted to die said that such deaths are often kept hidden. “If someone dies from suicide, then the manager is responsible, so they keep it under wraps to keep it from being leaked to other workers or Chinese people,” she said.</p></div></div><div><p>This past year, pandemic restrictions were lifted, and the border between China and North Korea reopened. In August, some three hundred North Korean workers boarded ten buses in Dandong to go back home. Police officers lined up around the buses to prevent defections. In photos and a video of the event, some of the women can be seen hurriedly preparing to load large suitcases onto a neon-green bus, then riding away across the Friendship Bridge. In September, another three hundred boarded a passenger train to Sinuiju, and two hundred were repatriated by plane. Workers who return face intense questioning by officials. “They asked about every single thing that happened every day from morning to evening in China, about other workers, supervisors, and agents,” the worker who processed clams in Dandong explained. As 2023 ended, the North Korean government began planning to dispatch its next wave of workers. In the past couple of years, according to reporting by Hyemin Son, a North Korean defector who works for Radio Free Asia, labor brokers have requested that Chinese companies pay a large advance; they were being asked to pay ahead of time, one broker told her, because “Chinese companies cannot operate without North Korean manpower.”</p><p>Some North Korean workers have yet to go home. One woman said that she has spent the past several years gutting fish at a processing plant in Dalian. She described working late into the night and getting sores in her mouth from stress and exhaustion. In the questionnaire, I had asked about the worst part of her job, and she said, “When I am forced to have sex.” She also described a sense of imprisonment that felt suffocating. “If you show even the slightest attitude, they will treat you like an insect,” she said. “Living a life where we can’t see the outside world as we please is so difficult that it’s killing us.” ♦</p><p><em>This piece was produced with contributions from Joe Galvin, Maya Martin, Susan Ryan, Jake Conley, Austin Brush, and Daniel Murphy.</em></p><div><h3>More on China’s Seafood Industry

            <p>What will be the end of Windows? Microsoft.</p>
<p>I’ve been a lifelong Windows user since the 90s and even MS-DOS back in the 80s, but things are changing. I’ve been using other operating systems more and more. MacOS and Linux are getting mixed into my workflow more and Windows less. Why? Microsoft is actively angering it power users by removing features. By trying to simplify Windows they are actively making administering it worse.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Microsoft is in a panic from the continued loss of it’s user base. They are making some improvements like the GUI and cleaning up other elements that give a more cohesive look. No more mixing Metro UI and Legacy panels like Windows 10. While this is good on the surface, they aren’t fixing anything. In fact, things are about to get much worse with the removal of these panels. On Tuesday, I had a printer issue at a client site and I was going to pull up the “Devices and Printers” panel to manage the drives and printing default settings. In the most recent 22H2 Windows 11 update, they hid it!</p>
<p>Using old Control Panel (Start-&gt;Run-&gt;<code>control</code>)</p>
<p>Clicking on this will redirect you to the new settings printer that gives NO options to do any advanced troubleshooting and removes the ability to FIX the issue!</p>
<p>What about the old <code>control printers</code> shortcut? remapped to the new crap.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>With any Windows problem, Microsoft never really removes ANYTHING! Remember, this company is still using legacy code from the 90s in spots and just slapping in new coat of paint on top of it every 5 years when they need to extract more money from its users.</p>
<p>To Access the old devices and printer use the run prompt and type the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Alternatively, you can create a new shortcut and assign the key combination to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new shortcut on your desktop</li>
<li>Set the location to: explorer.exe shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A}</li>
<li>Set the name to Devices and Printers</li>
<li>Choose the shortcut icon</li>
<li>Add the key combination shortcut (CTRL + ALT + D is default for this window)</li>
</ul>
<p>This provides you an easy to access link as well as overwriting the keyboard shortcut to open the old version.</p>
<p>Success for now…</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>MacOS and Linux will keep gaining market share. Microsoft needs to stop actively sabotaging it’s users. MacOS is bland and hasn’t changed in years, while Linux has a technical barrier of entry with little support. Yet, both of these options are better than modern Windows unless you need Gaming. However, Steam with it’s steamdeck might be changing the game…</p>

<p>
Pleasures
<br>
<i>by Aldous Huxley</i>
</p>


<p>We have heard a great deal, since 1914,
about the things which are a menace
to civilization. First it was Prussian militarism;
then the Germans at large; then the
prolongation of the war; then the shortening
of the same; then, after a time, the Treaty of
Versailles; then French militarism - with, all
the while, a running accompaniment of such
minor menaces as Prohibition, Lord Northcliffe,
Mr. Bryan, Comstockery....</p>

<p>Civilization, however, has resisted the
combined attacks of these enemies wonderfully
well. For still, in 1923, it stands not
so very far from where it stood in that "giant
age before the flood" of nine years since.
Where, in relation to Neanderthal on the
one hand and Athens on the other, where
precisely it stood <i>then</i> is a question which
each may answer according to his taste. The
important fact is that these menaces to our
civilization, such as it is - menaces including
the largest war and the stupidest peace known
to history - have confined themselves in most
places and up till now to mere threats, barking
more furiously than they bite.</p>

<p>No, the dangers which confront our civilization
are not so much the external dangers - wild
men, wars and the bankruptcy that
wars bring after them. The most alarming
dangers are those which menace it from
within, that threaten the mind rather
than the body and estate of contemporary
man.</p>

<p>Of all the various poisons which modern
civilization, by a process of auto-intoxication,
brews quietly up within its own bowels,
few, it seems to me, are more deadly (while
none appears more harmless) than that curious
and appalling thing that is technically
known as "pleasure." "Pleasure" (I place
the word between inverted commas to show
that I mean, not real pleasure, but the organized
activities officially known by the same
name) "pleasure" - what nightmare visions
the word evokes! Like every man of sense
and good feeling, I abominate work. But I
would rather put in eight hours a day at a
Government office than be condemned to lead
a life of "pleasure"; I would even, I believe,
prefer to write a million words of journalism
a year.</p>

<p>The horrors of modern "pleasure" arise
from the fact that every kind of organized
distraction tends to become progressively
more and more imbecile. There was a time
when people indulged themselves with distractions
requiring the expense of a certain
intellectual effort. In the seventeenth century,
for example, royal personages and their
courtiers took a real delight in listening to
erudite sermons (Dr. Donne's, for example)
and academical disputes on points of theology
or metaphysics. Part of the entertainment
offered to the Prince Palatine, on the
occasion of his marriage with James 1.'s
daughter, was a syllogistic argumentation, on
I forget what philosophical theme, between
the amiable Lord Keeper Williams and a
troop of minor Cambridge logicians. Imagine
the feelings of a contemporary prince,
if a loyal University were to offer him a
similar entertainment!</p>

<p>Royal personages were not the only people
who enjoyed intelligent pleasures. In Elizabethan
times every lady and gentleman of
ordinary culture could be relied upon, at demand,
to take his or her part in a madrigal
or a motet. Those who know the enormous
complexity and subtlety of sixteenth-century
music will realize what this means. To indulge
in their favourite pastime our ancestors
had to exert their minds to an uncommon
degree. Even the uneducated vulgar delighted
in pleasures requiring the exercise of
a certain intelligence, individuality and personal
initiative. They listened, for example,
to <i>Othello</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, and <i>Hamlet</i> - apparently
with enjoyment and comprehension.
They sang and made much music. And far
away, in the remote country, the peasants,
year by year, went through the traditional
rites - the dances of spring and summer, the
winter mummings, the ceremonies of harvest
home - appropriate to each successive season.
Their pleasures were intelligent and alive,
and it was they who, by their own efforts,
entertained themselves.</p>

<p>We have changed all that. In place of
the old pleasures demanding intelligence and
personal initiative, we have vast organizations
that provide us with ready-made distractions - distractions
which demand from
pleasure-seekers no personal participation
and no intellectual effort of any sort. To
the interminable democracies of the world a
million cinemas bring the same stale balderdash.
There have always been fourth-rate
writers and dramatists; but their works, in
the past, quickly died without getting beyond
the boundaries of the city or the country in
which they appeared. To-day, the inventions
of the scenario-writer go out from Los
Angeles across the whole world. Countless
audiences soak passively in the tepid bath of
nonsense. No mental effort is demanded of
them, no participation; they need only sit
and keep their eyes open.</p>

<p>Do the democracies want music? In the
old days they would have made it themselves.
Now, they merely turn on the gramophone.
Or if they are a little more up-to-date they
adjust their wireless telephone to the right
wave-length and listen-in to the fruity contralto
at Marconi House, singing "The
Gleaner's Slumber Song."</p>

<p>And if they want literature, there is the
Press. Nominally, it is true, the Press exists
to impart information. But its real function
is to provide, like the cinema, a distraction
which shall occupy the mind without demanding
of it the slightest effort or the fatigue
of a single thought. This function, it
must be admitted, it fulfils with an extraordinary
success. It is possible to go on
for years and years, reading two papers every
working day and one on Sundays without
ever once being called upon to think or to
make any other effort than to move the eyes,
not very attentively, down the printed
column.</p>

<p>Certain sections of the community still
practise athletic sports in which individual
participation is demanded. Great numbers
of the middle and upper classes play golf
and tennis in person and, if they are sufficiently
rich, shoot birds and pursue the fox
and go ski-ing in the Alps. But the vast mass
of the community has now come even to
sport vicariously, preferring the watching of
football to the fatigues and dangers of the
actual game. All classes, it is true, still
dance; but dance, all the world over, the
same steps to the same tunes. The dance has
been scrupulously sterilized of any local or
personal individuality.</p>

<p>These effortless pleasures, these ready-made
distractions that are the same for every
one over the face of the whole Western world,
are surely a worse menace to our civilization
than ever the Germans were. The working
hours of the day are already, for the great
majority of human beings, occupied in the
performance of purely mechanical tasks in
which no mental effort, no individuality, no
initiative are required. And now, in the
hours of leisure, we turn to distractions as
mechanically stereotyped and demanding as
little intelligence and initiative as does our
work. Add such leisure to such work and
the sum is a perfect day which it is a blessed
relief to come to the end of.</p>

<p>Self-poisoned in this fashion, civilization
looks as though it might easily decline into
a kind of premature senility. With a mind
almost atrophied by lack of use, unable to
entertain itself and grown so wearily uninterested
in the ready-made distractions offered
from without that nothing but the
grossest stimulants of an ever-increasing violence
and crudity can move it, the democracy
of the future will sicken of a chronic
and mortal boredom. It will go, perhaps,
the way the Romans went: the Romans who
came at last to lose, precisely as we are doing
now, the capacity to distract themselves;
the Romans who, like us, lived on ready-made
entertainments in which they had no
participation. Their deadly ennui demanded
ever more gladiators, more tightrope-walking
elephants, more rare and far-fetched
animals to be slaughtered. Ours would demand
no less; but owing to the existence of
a few idealists, doesn't get all it asks for.
The most violent forms of entertainment can
only be obtained illicitly. Let us not
despair, however; we may still live to see
blood flowing across the stage of the Hippodrome.
The force of a boredom clamouring
to be alleviated may yet prove too much
for the idealists.</p>

SVG content itself can’t have 3D transforms applied to it, but HTML inside of a <code>foreignObject</code> in the SVG can! Note that inside of the console the built-in depth sorting doesn’t seem to work in Chrome so I had to apply <code>z-index</code> to the appropriate sides to make this cube visualization work (another alternative would be to only use borders so you can’t tell the depth sorting is off):</p><p>So, what are some things that we can make given these capabilities and limitations?

To do so, you can paste the part inside of the ticks (<code>`</code>) into <a href="https://codepen.io/ZachSaucier/pen/KKJOJWR">this CodePen</a>, optionally copying the result back into the CSS section and having CodePen format the result for you.</p><p>Here’s my first attempt at adding animation to the console that I created for <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/">my personal blog</a>:</p><p>What would a post exploring a new animation technique be without a horse-running animation?

</div><p>Here’s an example to show that you can use JavaScript to switch out the text of the SVG (using <code>.textContent</code>, not <code>.innerText</code> since it’s an SVG element). With that being said, you can’t do something like a scramble text effect due to the limitation around using <code>setInterval</code> and <code>requestAnimationFrame</code><sup data-fn="621356bc-ae4e-4d36-8dba-c6293f976027"><a href="#621356bc-ae4e-4d36-8dba-c6293f976027" id="621356bc-ae4e-4d36-8dba-c6293f976027-link">6</a></sup>.</p><p>However, we <em>can</em> swap out the text (or any elements) after the start if we use an SVG along with CSS animations! To do so you have to include the content in the original SVG and use CSS keyframes.</p><p>The above technique can be used to create a stop motion effect or make words and/or elements appear “randomly” around the console (you might want to <a href="https://codepen.io/ZachSaucier/pen/zYegbPB??editors=1000">use JavaScript</a> or a pre-processor to help you generate this sort of thing). For example, here’s a some random circles that disappear and appear:</p><p>It’s impossible to add click events or links inside of the SVG that’s used as a background image. However, if you’re fine showing the full URL, you can fake it by using carefully chosen padding values to place the URL from the console message where you want it to be relative to the background image. It might also be worth changing the&nbsp;<code>font-family</code>&nbsp;being used to more closely match the SVG that you&nbsp;use.</p><p>Keep in mind that the URL itself will affect the width of the element, so you may need to adjust your SVG. Also, make sure to test thoroughly between browsers because there are more cross-browser inconsistencies with this technique.</p><p>In Safari, it only shows the link and not the background&nbsp;image.</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a way to make the message span 100% of the width of the console. I believe that this is because we can’t change the display of elements in the console, so things like width: 100% don’t work here. The element must have an explicit width and height in pixels (or other non-relative unit), or else its size will be based on the text.</p><p>I did notice that <code>console.table(['foo'])</code> spans the whole width, but we’re unable to use CSS styling on console tables as far as I know.</p><p>In the future, I hope browsers will add a responsive width element in the console.</p><p>Reveal animations (like the first half of the line-drawing animation above) are one way of animating using this technique. However, these animations may finish before someone actually opens up the console. As such, I wanted to see if we can detect when the console is open so that we can wait to fire the animation until then.</p><p>To my knowledge, there’s no way to detect if the console itself is open (if you know of a way, please let me know!). However, there are some ways to detect if the DevTools in general are open, though the method <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/7798748/2065702">seems to change every so often</a>.</p><p>I got the lightweight package <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/devtools-detect">devtools-detect</a> working in a project using <a href="https://gist.github.com/ZachSaucier/ea8ebf65079febbde4f2f9190ae6644a">this sort of setup</a>. However, the package has many known issues, which the author notes in the README. But for the purpose of something superfluous like this it is probably okay. If you’re really wanting to do this, I might recommend <a href="https://github.com/david-fong/detect-devtools-via-debugger-heartstop">detect-devtools-via-debugger-heartstop</a> instead because it seems more reliable but I didn’t test it myself.</p><p>With that being said, you may want to use a looping or ambient (constantly running) animation so you make sure that your user sees the hard work you’ve invested.</p><p>I tried getting a sense of the performance impact by running the most intense animation that I provided as an example, the horse animation from the example section above, and looking at my Activity Monitor.</p><p>When the console was open and the animation was running, the “Google Chrome Helper (GPU)” went up to around 80% on my 2018 Macbook Pro. With any other devtools tab open instead or with the dev tools closed, I could not see any measurable impact on any process.</p><p>This indicates that this sort of effect should not have much of an impact on your page unless someone has their devtools console open.</p><p>With that being said, always do your own testing, including on a wider range of devices, to make sure it’s not a detriment to any user’s experience.</p><p>Note: Using consoles in this way is very experimental and these results are likely to be inaccurate at some point in the future. As far as I can tell, styles in the console using <code>%c</code> like this <a href="https://console.spec.whatwg.org/#logger">is mentioned</a> in a spec but not fleshed out.</p><p>Firefox fails to set the proper height of the background image and cuts off the SVG a bit:</p><p>It seems like for Firefox you have to basically double the height: use the height for the <code>line-height</code> then use half the height for the <code>padding-block</code>. The downside of doing this is that it adds a bit of extra white space at the bottom of the SVGs in Chrome and Edge. In order to have this effect look significantly better in Firefox, I think this is worth the tradeoff but I also hope that Firefox can address this issue. If you have figured out a way to get around this issue, please let me know!</p><p>Additionally, Firefox has a significantly shorter character limit for console messages, so ones like the horse animation above don’t render anything in Firefox.</p><p>So long as you’re not trying to align other text with an SVG, you can drop the <code>vertical-align: middle</code> which makes the Chrome &amp; Edge version a bit better.</p><p>Safari is the only major browser that doesn’t support this sort of thing (per usual). It just prints the raw text and ignores the CSS:</p><p>It <em>does</em> have some limited CSS support for console messages though, just not enough for the more complex CSS and background images. Hopefully this article can encourage them to improve their support!</p><p>All in all, since this technique acts like progressive enhancement and is basically an easter egg, I would be happy to ship something like this in production code at any company. I think you should too!</p><p><a href="https://css-doodle.com/#function-@shape">css-doodle</a> is a library similar to <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> and the like. It specializes in HTML + CSS + SVG creations (though recently it’s gotten support for GLSL shaders). This makes it a perfect for creating effects for the console! It’s created by <a href="https://yuanchuan.dev/">Chuan</a> (<a href="https://vis.social/@yuanchuan">@yuanchuan</a>). Note that it’s still fairly early on in its development and not everything about it is documented!</p><p>I could write several articles on <code>css-doodle</code>, but for the purpose of this article I will keep it short:</p><p>You can create some nice-looking console messages without using SVGs or anything like that. For example, you can apply multiple <code>text-shadows</code> to apply a 3D text effect:</p><p>A similar effect that has been explored more is ASCII art in the console. For example, the fairly well-known Reddit <code>console.log</code> art / ad:</p><p>Note the usage of <code>font-family: monospace</code> to make sure the characters have a consistent width.</p><p>Emojis work well in the console. Sometimes, that may be all you&nbsp;need!</p><p>I’m hoping that this article inspires developers and companies to implement delightful console surprises. I think it should become a normal addition to a website!</p></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability">https://github.com/mozilla/readability</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39503522">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Readability.js</h2>
<p dir="auto">A standalone version of the readability library used for <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages" rel="nofollow">Firefox Reader View</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Readability is available on npm:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm install @mozilla/readability"><pre>npm install @mozilla/readability</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can then <code>require()</code> it, or for web-based projects, load the <code>Readability.js</code> script from your webpage.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">To parse a document, you must create a new <code>Readability</code> object from a DOM document object, and then call the <a href="#parse"><code>parse()</code></a> method. Here's an example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="var article = new Readability(document).parse();"><pre><span>var</span> <span>article</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Readability</span><span>(</span><span>document</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you use Readability in a web browser, you will likely be able to use a <code>document</code> reference from elsewhere (e.g. fetched via XMLHttpRequest, in a same-origin <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> you have access to, etc.). In Node.js, you can <a href="#nodejs-usage">use an external DOM library</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">API Reference</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>new Readability(document, options)</code></h3>
<p dir="auto">The <code>options</code> object accepts a number of properties, all optional:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>debug</code> (boolean, default <code>false</code>): whether to enable logging.</li>
<li><code>maxElemsToParse</code> (number, default <code>0</code> i.e. no limit): the maximum number of elements to parse.</li>
<li><code>nbTopCandidates</code> (number, default <code>5</code>): the number of top candidates to consider when analysing how tight the competition is among candidates.</li>
<li><code>charThreshold</code> (number, default <code>500</code>): the number of characters an article must have in order to return a result.</li>
<li><code>classesToPreserve</code> (array): a set of classes to preserve on HTML elements when the <code>keepClasses</code> options is set to <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>keepClasses</code> (boolean, default <code>false</code>): whether to preserve all classes on HTML elements. When set to <code>false</code> only classes specified in the <code>classesToPreserve</code> array are kept.</li>
<li><code>disableJSONLD</code> (boolean, default <code>false</code>): when extracting page metadata, Readability gives precedence to Schema.org fields specified in the JSON-LD format. Set this option to <code>true</code> to skip JSON-LD parsing.</li>
<li><code>serializer</code> (function, default <code>el =&gt; el.innerHTML</code>) controls how the <code>content</code> property returned by the <code>parse()</code> method is produced from the root DOM element. It may be useful to specify the <code>serializer</code> as the identity function (<code>el =&gt; el</code>) to obtain a DOM element instead of a string for <code>content</code> if you plan to process it further.</li>
<li><code>allowedVideoRegex</code> (RegExp, default <code>undefined</code> ): a regular expression that matches video URLs that should be allowed to be included in the article content. If <code>undefined</code>, the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/8e8ec27cd2013940bc6f3cc609de10e35a1d9d86/Readability.js#L133">default regex</a> is applied.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>parse()</code></h3>
<p dir="auto">Returns an object containing the following properties:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>title</code>: article title;</li>
<li><code>content</code>: HTML string of processed article content;</li>
<li><code>textContent</code>: text content of the article, with all the HTML tags removed;</li>
<li><code>length</code>: length of an article, in characters;</li>
<li><code>excerpt</code>: article description, or short excerpt from the content;</li>
<li><code>byline</code>: author metadata;</li>
<li><code>dir</code>: content direction;</li>
<li><code>siteName</code>: name of the site;</li>
<li><code>lang</code>: content language;</li>
<li><code>publishedTime</code>: published time;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The <code>parse()</code> method works by modifying the DOM. This removes some elements in the web page, which may be undesirable. You can avoid this by passing the clone of the <code>document</code> object to the <code>Readability</code> constructor:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="var documentClone = document.cloneNode(true);
var article = new Readability(documentClone).parse();"><pre><span>var</span> <span>documentClone</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>cloneNode</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>article</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Readability</span><span>(</span><span>documentClone</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>isProbablyReaderable(document, options)</code></h3>
<p dir="auto">A quick-and-dirty way of figuring out if it's plausible that the contents of a given document are suitable for processing with Readability. It is likely to produce both false positives and false negatives. The reason it exists is to avoid bogging down a time-sensitive process (like loading and showing the user a webpage) with the complex logic in the core of Readability. Improvements to its logic (while not deteriorating its performance) are very welcome.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>options</code> object accepts a number of properties, all optional:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>minContentLength</code> (number, default <code>140</code>): the minimum node content length used to decide if the document is readerable;</li>
<li><code>minScore</code> (number, default <code>20</code>): the minimum cumulated 'score' used to determine if the document is readerable;</li>
<li><code>visibilityChecker</code> (function, default <code>isNodeVisible</code>): the function used to determine if a node is visible;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The function returns a boolean corresponding to whether or not we suspect <code>Readability.parse()</code> will succeed at returning an article object. Here's an example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="/*
    Only instantiate Readability  if we suspect
    the `parse()` method will produce a meaningful result.
*/
if (isProbablyReaderable(document)) {
    let article = new Readability(document).parse();
}"><pre><span>/*</span>
<span>    Only instantiate Readability  if we suspect</span>
<span>    the `parse()` method will produce a meaningful result.</span>
<span>*/</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>isProbablyReaderable</span><span>(</span><span>document</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>article</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Readability</span><span>(</span><span>document</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Node.js usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">Since Node.js does not come with its own DOM implementation, we rely on external libraries like <a href="https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom">jsdom</a>. Here's an example using <code>jsdom</code> to obtain a DOM document object:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="var { Readability } = require('@mozilla/readability');
var { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');
var doc = new JSDOM(&quot;<body>Look at this cat: <img src='./cat.jpg'></body>&quot;, {
  url: &quot;https://www.example.com/the-page-i-got-the-source-from&quot;
});
let reader = new Readability(doc.window.document);
let article = reader.parse();"><pre><span>var</span> <span>{</span> Readability <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'@mozilla/readability'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>{</span> <span>JSDOM</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'jsdom'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>doc</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>JSDOM</span><span>(</span><span>"&lt;body&gt;Look at this cat: &lt;img src='./cat.jpg'&gt;&lt;/body&gt;"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>url</span>: <span>"https://www.example.com/the-page-i-got-the-source-from"</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>reader</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Readability</span><span>(</span><span>doc</span><span>.</span><span>window</span><span>.</span><span>document</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>article</span> <span>=</span> <span>reader</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Remember to pass the page's URI as the <code>url</code> option in the <code>JSDOM</code> constructor (as shown in the example above), so that Readability can convert relative URLs for images, hyperlinks, etc. to their absolute counterparts.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>jsdom</code> has the ability to run the scripts included in the HTML and fetch remote resources. For security reasons these are <a href="https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom#executing-scripts">disabled by default</a>, and we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend you keep them that way.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Security</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you're going to use Readability with untrusted input (whether in HTML or DOM form), we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend you use a sanitizer library like <a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify">DOMPurify</a> to avoid script injection when you use
the output of Readability. We would also recommend using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP" rel="nofollow">CSP</a> to add further defense-in-depth
restrictions to what you allow the resulting content to do. The Firefox integration of
reader mode uses both of these techniques itself. Sanitizing unsafe content out of the input is explicitly not something we aim to do as part of Readability itself - there are other good sanitizer libraries out there, use them!</p>

<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>
Structuring a large program is always a difficult job. One of the
particular problems that often comes up is this: if you have a piece
of code producing data, and another piece of code consuming it,
which should be the caller and which should be the callee?

</p><p>
Here is a very simple piece of run-length decompression code, and an
equally simple piece of parser code:

</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre><code>    /* Decompression code */
    while (1) {
        c = getchar();
        if (c == EOF)
            break;
        if (c == 0xFF) {
            len = getchar();
            c = getchar();
            while (len--)
                emit(c);
        } else
            emit(c);
    }
    emit(EOF);</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code>    /* Parser code */
    while (1) {
        c = getchar();
        if (c == EOF)
            break;
        if (isalpha(c)) {
            do {
                add_to_token(c);
                c = getchar();
            } while (isalpha(c));
            got_token(WORD);
        }
        add_to_token(c);
        got_token(PUNCT);
    }</code></pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
Each of these code fragments is very simple, and easy to read and
understand. One produces a character at a time by calling
<code>emit()</code>; the other consumes a character at a time by
calling <code>getchar()</code>. If only the calls to
<code>emit()</code> and the calls to <code>getchar()</code> could be
made to feed data to each other, it would be simple to connect the
two fragments together so that the output from the decompressor went
straight to the parser.

</p><p>
In many modern operating systems, you could do this using pipes
between two processes or two threads. <code>emit()</code> in the
decompressor writes to a pipe, and <code>getchar()</code> in the
parser reads from the other end of the same pipe. Simple and robust,
but also heavyweight and not portable. Typically you don't want to
have to divide your program into threads for a task this simple.

</p><p>
In this article I offer a creative solution to this sort of
structure problem.
</p>

<a name="rewrite"><h2>Rewriting</h2></a>

<p>
The conventional answer is to rewrite one of the ends of the
communication channel so that it's a function that can be called.
Here's an example of what that might mean for each of the example
fragments.

</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre><code>int decompressor(void) {
    static int repchar;
    static int replen;
    if (replen &gt; 0) {
        replen--;
        return repchar;
    }
    c = getchar();
    if (c == EOF)
        return EOF;
    if (c == 0xFF) {
        replen = getchar();
        repchar = getchar();
        replen--;
        return repchar;
    } else
        return c;
}</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code>void parser(int c) {
    static enum {
        START, IN_WORD
    } state;
    switch (state) {
        case IN_WORD:
        if (isalpha(c)) {
            add_to_token(c);
            return;
        }
        got_token(WORD);
        state = START;
        /* fall through */

        case START:
        add_to_token(c);
        if (isalpha(c))
            state = IN_WORD;
        else
            got_token(PUNCT);
        break;
    }
}</code></pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
Of course you don't have to rewrite both of them; just one will do.
If you rewrite the decompressor in the form shown, so that it
returns one character every time it's called, then the original
parser code can replace calls to <code>getchar()</code> with calls
to <code>decompressor()</code>, and the program will be happy.
Conversely, if you rewrite the parser in the form shown, so that it
is called once for every input character, then the original
decompression code can call <code>parser()</code> instead of
<code>emit()</code> with no problems. You would only want to rewrite
<em>both</em> functions as callees if you were a glutton for
punishment.

</p><p>
And that's the point, really. Both these rewritten functions are
thoroughly ugly compared to their originals. Both of the processes
taking place here are easier to read when written as a caller, not
as a callee. Try to deduce the grammar recognised by the parser, or
the compressed data format understood by the decompressor, just by
reading the code, and you will find that both the originals are
clear and both the rewritten forms are less clear. It would be much
nicer if we didn't have to turn either piece of code inside out.

<a name="knuth"></a></p><h2><a name="knuth">Knuth's coroutines</a></h2>

<p>
In <cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite>, Donald Knuth
presents a solution to this sort of problem. His answer is to throw
away the stack concept completely. Stop thinking of one process as
the caller and the other as the callee, and start thinking of them
as cooperating equals.

</p><p>
In practical terms: replace the traditional "call" primitive with a
slightly different one. The new "call" will save the return value
somewhere other than on the stack, and will then jump to a location
specified in another saved return value. So each time the
decompressor emits another character, it saves its program counter
and jumps to the last known location within the parser - and each
time the parser <em>needs</em> another character, it saves its own
program counter and jumps to the location saved by the decompressor.
Control shuttles back and forth between the two routines exactly as
often as necessary.

</p><p>
This is very nice in theory, but in practice you can only do it in
assembly language, because no commonly used high level language
supports the coroutine call primitive. Languages like C depend
utterly on their stack-based structure, so whenever control passes
from any function to any other, one must be the caller and the other
must be the callee. So if you want to write portable code, this
technique is at least as impractical as the Unix pipe solution.

<a name="knuth"></a></p><h2><a name="knuth">Stack-based coroutines</a></h2>

<p>
So what we would <em>really</em> like is the ability to mimic
Knuth's coroutine call primitive in C. We must accept that in
reality, at the C level, one function will be caller and the other
will be callee. In the caller, we have no problem; we code the
original algorithm, pretty much exactly as written, and whenever it
has (or needs) a character it calls the other function.

</p><p>
The callee has all the problems. For our callee, we want a function
which has a "return and continue" operation: return from the
function, and next time it is called, resume control from just after
the <em>return</em> statement. For example, we would like to be able
to write a function that says

</p><pre><code>int function(void) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        return i;   /* won't work, but wouldn't it be nice */
}</code></pre>

<p>
and have ten successive calls to the function return the numbers 0
through 9.

</p><p>
How can we implement this? Well, we can transfer control to an
arbitrary point in the function using a <code>goto</code> statement.
So if we use a state variable, we could do this:

</p><pre><code>int function(void) {
    static int i, state = 0;
    switch (state) {
        case 0: goto LABEL0;
        case 1: goto LABEL1;
    }
    LABEL0: /* start of function */
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
        state = 1; /* so we will come back to LABEL1 */
        return i;
        LABEL1:; /* resume control straight after the return */
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
This method works. We have a set of labels at the points where we
might need to resume control: one at the start, and one just after
each <code>return</code> statement. We have a state variable,
preserved between calls to the function, which tells us which label
we need to resume control at next. Before any return, we update the
state variable to point at the right label; after any call, we do a
<code>switch</code> on the value of the variable to find out where
to jump to.

</p><p>
It's still ugly, though. The worst part of it is that the set of
labels must be maintained manually, and must be consistent between
the function body and the initial <code>switch</code> statement.
Every time we add a new return statement, we must invent a new label
name and add it to the list in the <code>switch</code>; every time
we remove a return statement, we must remove its corresponding
label. We've just increased our maintenance workload by a factor of
two.

<a name="duff"></a></p><h2><a name="duff">Duff's device</a></h2>

<p>
The famous "Duff's device" in C makes use of the fact that a
<code>case</code> statement is still legal within a sub-block of its
matching <code>switch</code> statement. Tom Duff used this for an
optimised output loop:

</p><pre><code>    switch (count % 8) {
        case 0:        do {  *to = *from++;
        case 7:              *to = *from++;
        case 6:              *to = *from++;
        case 5:              *to = *from++;
        case 4:              *to = *from++;
        case 3:              *to = *from++;
        case 2:              *to = *from++;
        case 1:              *to = *from++;
                       } while ((count -= 8) &gt; 0);
    }</code></pre>

<p>
We can put it to a slightly different use in the coroutine trick.
Instead of using a <code>switch</code> statement to decide which
<code>goto</code> statement to execute, we can use the
<code>switch</code> statement to perform the jump itself:

</p><pre><code>int function(void) {
    static int i, state = 0;
    switch (state) {
        case 0: /* start of function */
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
            state = 1; /* so we will come back to "case 1" */
            return i;
            case 1:; /* resume control straight after the return */
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
Now this is looking promising. All we have to do now is construct a
few well chosen macros, and we can hide the gory details in
something plausible-looking:

</p><pre><code>#define crBegin static int state=0; switch(state) { case 0:
#define crReturn(i,x) do { state=i; return x; case i:; } while (0)
#define crFinish }
int function(void) {
    static int i;
    crBegin;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        crReturn(1, i);
    crFinish;
}</code></pre>

<p>
(note the use of <code>do ... while(0)</code> to ensure that
<code>crReturn</code> does not need braces around it when it comes
directly between <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>)

</p><p>
This is almost exactly what we wanted. We can use
<code>crReturn</code> to return from the function in such a way that
control at the next call resumes just after the return. Of course we
must obey some ground rules (surround the function body with
<code>crBegin</code> and <code>crFinish</code>; declare all local
variables <code>static</code> if they need to be preserved across a
<code>crReturn</code>; <em>never</em> put a <code>crReturn</code>
within an explicit <code>switch</code> statement); but those do not
limit us very much.

</p><p>
The only snag remaining is the first parameter to
<code>crReturn</code>. Just as when we invented a new label in the
previous section we had to avoid it colliding with existing label
names, now we must ensure all our state parameters to
<code>crReturn</code> are different. The consequences will be fairly
benign - the compiler will catch it and not let it do horrible
things at run time - but we still need to avoid doing it.

</p><p>
Even this can be solved. ANSI C provides the special macro name
<code>__LINE__</code>, which expands to the current source line
number. So we can rewrite <code>crReturn</code> as

</p><pre><code>#define crReturn(x) do { state=__LINE__; return x; \
                         case __LINE__:; } while (0)</code></pre>

<p>
and then we no longer have to worry about those state parameters at
all, provided we obey a fourth ground rule (never put two
<code>crReturn</code> statements on the same line).

<a name="evaluation"></a></p><h2><a name="evaluation">Evaluation</a></h2>

<p>
So now we have this monstrosity, let's rewrite our original code
fragments using it.

</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre><code>int decompressor(void) {
    static int c, len;
    crBegin;
    while (1) {
        c = getchar();
        if (c == EOF)
            break;
        if (c == 0xFF) {
            len = getchar();
            c = getchar();
            while (len--)
	        crReturn(c);
        } else
	    crReturn(c);
    }
    crReturn(EOF);
    crFinish;
}</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code>void parser(int c) {
    crBegin;
    while (1) {
        /* first char already in c */
        if (c == EOF)
            break;
        if (isalpha(c)) {
            do {
                add_to_token(c);
		crReturn( );
            } while (isalpha(c));
            got_token(WORD);
        }
        add_to_token(c);
        got_token(PUNCT);
	crReturn( );
    }
    crFinish;
}</code></pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
We have rewritten both decompressor and parser as callees, with no
need at all for the massive restructuring we had to do last time we
did this. The structure of each function exactly mirrors the
structure of its original form. A reader can deduce the grammar
recognised by the parser, or the compressed data format used by the
decompressor, far more easily than by reading the obscure
state-machine code. The control flow is intuitive once you have
wrapped your mind around the new format: when the decompressor has a
character, it passes it back to the caller with
<code>crReturn</code> and waits to be called again when another
character is required. When the parser needs another character, it
returns using <code>crReturn</code>, and waits to be called again
with the new character in the parameter <code>c</code>.

</p><p>
There has been one small structural alteration to the code:
<code>parser()</code> now has its <code>getchar()</code> (well, the
corresponding <code>crReturn</code>) at the end of the loop instead
of the start, because the first character is already in
<code>c</code> when the function is entered. We could accept this
small change in structure, or if we really felt strongly about it we
could specify that <code>parser()</code> required an
"initialisation" call before you could start feeding it characters.

</p><p>
As before, of course, we don't have to rewrite both routines using
the coroutine macros. One will suffice; the other can be its caller.

</p><p>
We have achieved what we set out to achieve: a portable ANSI C means
of passing data between a producer and a consumer without the need
to rewrite one as an explicit state machine. We have done this by
combining the C preprocessor with a little-used feature of the
<code>switch</code> statement to create an <em>implicit</em> state
machine.

<a name="standards"></a></p><h2><a name="standards">Coding Standards</a></h2>

<p>
Of course, this trick violates every coding standard in the book.
Try doing this in your company's code and you will probably be
subject to a stern telling off if not disciplinary action! You have
embedded unmatched braces in macros, used <code>case</code> within
sub-blocks, and as for the <code>crReturn</code> macro with its
terrifyingly disruptive contents .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It's a wonder you
haven't been fired on the spot for such irresponsible coding
practice. You should be ashamed of yourself.

</p><p>
I would claim that the coding standards are at fault here. The
examples I've shown in this article are not very long, not very
complicated, and still just about comprehensible when rewritten as
state machines. But as the functions get longer, the degree of
rewriting required becomes greater and the loss of clarity becomes
much, much worse.

</p><p>
Consider. A function built of small blocks of the form

</p><pre><code>    case STATE1:
    /* perform some activity */
    if (condition) state = STATE2; else state = STATE3;</code></pre>

<p>
is not very different, to a reader, from a function built of small
blocks of the form

</p><pre><code>    LABEL1:
    /* perform some activity */
    if (condition) goto LABEL2; else goto LABEL3;</code></pre>

<p>
One is caller and the other is callee, true, but the visual
structure of the functions are the same, and the insights they
provide into their underlying algorithms are exactly as small as
each other. The same people who would fire you for using my
coroutine macros would fire you just as loudly for building a
function out of small blocks connected by <code>goto</code>
statements! And this time they would be right, because laying out a
function like that obscures the structure of the algorithm horribly.

</p><p>
Coding standards aim for clarity. By hiding vital things like
<code>switch</code>, <code>return</code> and <code>case</code>
statements inside "obfuscating" macros, the coding standards would
claim you have obscured the syntactic structure of the program, and
violated the requirement for clarity. But you have done so in the
cause of revealing the <em>algorithmic</em> structure of the
program, which is far more likely to be what the reader wants to
know!

</p><p>
Any coding standard which insists on syntactic clarity at the
expense of algorithmic clarity should be rewritten. If your employer
fires you for using this trick, tell them that repeatedly as the
security staff drag you out of the building.

<a name="code"></a></p><h2><a name="code">Refinements and Code</a></h2>

<p>
In a serious application, this toy coroutine implementation is
unlikely to be useful, because it relies on <code>static</code>
variables and so it fails to be re-entrant or multi-threadable.
Ideally, in a real application, you would want to be able to call
the same function in several different contexts, and at each call in
a given context, have control resume just after the last return in
the same context.

</p><p>
This is easily enough done. We arrange an extra function parameter,
which is a pointer to a context structure; we declare all our local
state, and our coroutine state variable, as elements of that
structure.

</p><p>
It's a little bit ugly, because suddenly you have to use
<code>ctx-&gt;i</code> as a loop counter where you would previously
just have used <code>i</code>; virtually all your serious variables
become elements of the coroutine context structure. But it removes
the problems with re-entrancy, and still hasn't impacted the
<em>structure</em> of the routine.

</p><p>
(Of course, if C only had Pascal's <code>with</code> statement, we
could arrange for the macros to make this layer of indirection truly
transparent as well. A pity. Still, at least C++ users can manage
this by having their coroutine be a class member, and keeping all
its local variables in the class so that the scoping is implicit.)

</p><p>
Included here is a C header file that implements this coroutine
trick as a set of pre-defined macros. There are two sets of macros
defined in the file, prefixed <code>scr</code> and <code>ccr</code>.
The <code>scr</code> macros are the simple form of the technique,
for when you can get away with using <code>static</code> variables;
the <code>ccr</code> macros provide the advanced re-entrant form.
Full documentation is given in a comment in the header file itself.

</p><p>
Note that Visual C++ version 6 doesn't like this coroutine trick,
because its default debug state (Program Database for Edit and
Continue) does something strange to the <code>__LINE__</code> macro.
To compile a coroutine-using program with VC++ 6, you must turn off
Edit and Continue. (In the project settings, go to the "C/C++" tab,
category "General", setting "Debug info". Select any option
<em>other</em> than "Program Database for Edit and Continue".)

</p><p>
(The header file is MIT-licensed, so you can use it in anything you
like without restriction. If you do find something the MIT licence
doesn't permit you to do,
<a href="mailto:anakin@pobox.com">mail me</a>,
and I'll probably give you explicit permission to do it anyway.)

<p>Right now, AI is eating the world.</p>

<p>And by AI, I mean Transformers. Practically all the big breakthroughs in AI over
the last few years are due to Transformers.</p>

<p><strong>Mamba</strong>, however, is one of an alternative class of models called <strong>State
Space Models</strong> (<strong>SSMs</strong>). Importantly, for the first time, Mamba promises
similar performance (and crucially similar
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15556.pdf"><em>scaling laws</em></a>) as the Transformer
whilst being feasible at long sequence lengths (say 1 million tokens). We
achieve this long context by removing the “quadratic bottleneck” in the
Attention Mechanism. Mamba also runs <em>fast</em> - like “up to 5x faster than
Transformer fast”<sup id="fnref:figure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:figure" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<div>

    <figcaption>Mamba performs similarly (or slightly better than) other Language Models on The Pile</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Gu and Dao, the Mamba authors write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mamba enjoys fast inference and linear scaling in sequence length, and its
performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general
sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across
several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language
modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and
matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream
evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here we’ll discuss:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The advantages (and disadvantages) of Mamba (🐍) vs Transformers (🤖),</li>
  <li>Analogies and intuitions for thinking about Mamba, and</li>
  <li>What Mamba means for Interpretability, AI Safety and Applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problems-with-transformers---maybe-attention-isnt-all-you-need">Problems with Transformers - Maybe Attention <em>Isn’t</em> All You Need</h2>

<p>We’re very much in the Transformer-era of history. ML used to be about detecting
cats and dogs. Now, with Transformers, we’re
<a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">generating human-like poetry</a>,
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/AlphaCode2/AlphaCode2_Tech_Report.pdf">coding better than the median competitive programmer</a>,
and
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">solving the protein folding problem</a>.</p>

<p>But Transformers have one core problem. In a transformer, every token can look
back at every previous token when making predictions. For this lookback, we
cache detailed information about each token in the so-called KV cache.</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.kolaayonrinde.com/blog/images/mamba/attention.png" width="800" alt="attention">
    <figcaption>When using the Attention Mechanism, information from all previous tokens can be passed to the current token</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>This pairwise communication means a forward pass is O(n²) time complexity in
training (the dreaded <code>quadratic bottleneck</code>) and each new token generated
autoregressively takes O(n) time. That is to say, as the context gets larger,
the model gets <em>slower</em>.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, storing this KV cache requires O(n) space. The fateful
<code>CUDA OOM</code> error looms large as the memory footprint balloons. If space were the
only issue, we might just add more GPUs but with latency growing
quadratically… perhaps not.</p>

<p>On the margin, we can mitigate the quadratic bottleneck with techniques like
<a href="https://paperswithcode.com/method/sliding-window-attention">Sliding Window Attention</a>
or clever CUDA optimisations like
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf">FlashAttention</a>. But ultimately, for
super long context windows (like a chatbot which remembers every conversation
you’ve shared), we need a different approach.</p>

<h3 id="foundation-model-backbones">Foundation Model Backbones</h3>

<p>Fundamentally, all good ML architecture backbones have components for two
important operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Communication</strong> <em>between</em> tokens</li>
  <li><strong>Computation</strong> <em>within</em> a token</li>
</ol>

    <figcaption>The Transformer Block</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>In transformers, this is <strong>Attention</strong> (<code>communication</code>) and <strong>MLPs</strong>
(<code>computation</code>). We improve transformers by optimising these two
operations<sup id="fnref:scale" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:scale" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We would like to replace the Attention component <sup id="fnref:attention" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:attention" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> with some other
method for communicating between tokens. <strong>Mamba</strong> uses the Control Theory
inspired <strong>SSM</strong> for <code>Communication</code> and keeps MLP-style projections for
<code>Computation</code>.</p>

  </figure>
</div>


<p>Like a Transformer made up of stacked transformer blocks, Mamba is made up of
stacked Mamba blocks as above.</p>

<p>We would like to understand and motivate the choice of the SSM for sequence
transformations.</p>

<h2 id="motivating-mamba---a-throwback-to-temple-run">Motivating Mamba - A Throwback to Temple Run</h2>

<p>Imagine we’re building a Temple Run agent <sup id="fnref:temple-run" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:temple-run" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. It chooses if the
runner should move left or right at any time.</p>

<div>

    <img src="https://www.kolaayonrinde.com/blog/images/mamba/temple_run.png" width="400" alt="Temple Run">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>To successfully pick the correct direction, we need information about our
surroundings. Let’s call the collection of relevant information the <code>state</code>.
Here the state likely includes your current position and velocity, the position
of the nearest obstacle, weather conditions, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claim 1: if you know the current state of the world and how the world is
evolving, then you can use this to determine the direction to move.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that you don’t need to look at the whole screen all the time. You can
figure out what will happen to most of the screen by noting that as you run, the
obstacles move down the screen. You only need to look at the top of the screen
to understand the new information and then simulate the rest.</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.kolaayonrinde.com/blog/images/mamba/temple_run_annotated.png" width="800" alt="Temple Run">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>This lends itself to a natural formulation. Let h be the hidden state, relevant
knowledge about the world. Also let x be the input, the observation that you get
each time. h’ then represents the derivative of the hidden state, i.e. how the
state is evolving. We’re trying to predict y, the optimal next move (right or
left).</p>

<p>Now, Claim 1 states that
<code>from the hidden state h, h’, and the new observation x, you can figure out y</code>.</p>

<p>More concretely, h, the state, can be represented as a differential equation (Eq
1a):</p><p>

\[h’(t) = \mathbf{A}h(t) + \mathbf{B}x(t)\]

</p><p>Knowing h allows you to determine your next move y (Eq 1b):</p><p>

\[y(t) = \mathbf{C}h(t) + \mathbf{D}x(t)\]

</p><p>The system evolves as a function of the current state and new observations. A
small new observation is enough because we can determine most of the state by
applying known state dynamics to the previous state. That is, most of the screen
isn’t new, it’s just the natural downward movement of the previous state. Fully
knowing the state would allow us to pick the best next move, y.</p>

<p>You can learn a lot about the system dynamics by observing the top of the
screen - if it’s moving faster, we can infer the whole screen is and the game is
speeding up<sup id="fnref:smooth" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:smooth" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. In this way, even if we start off knowing nothing about
the game except our limited observation, pretty soon we could understand the
whole screen.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-state">What’s the State?</h3>

<p>Here, <strong>state</strong> refers to the variables that, when combined with the input
variables, fully determine the future system behaviour. In theory, once we have
the state, there’s nothing else we need to know about the past to predict the
future. With this choice of state, the system is converted to a <strong>Markov
Decision Process</strong>. Ideally, the state is a fairly small amount of information
which captures the essential properties of the system. That is, <strong>the state is a
compression of the past</strong> <sup id="fnref:diagonal" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diagonal" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="discretisation---how-to-deal-with-living-in-a-quantised-world">Discretisation - How To Deal With Living in a Quantised World</h2>

<p>Okay, great! So, given some state and input observation, we have an
autoregressive-style system to determine the next action. Amazing!</p>

<p>In practice though, there’s a little snag here. We’re modelling time as
continuous. But in real life, we get new inputs and take new actions at discrete
time steps <sup id="fnref:discrete" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:discrete" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<div>

    <figcaption></figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>We would like to convert this <em>continuous-time differential equation</em> into a
<em>discrete-time difference equation</em>. This conversion process is known as
<code>discretisation</code>. Discretisation is a well-studied problem in the literature.
Mamba uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-order_hold">Zero-Order Hold</a>
(ZOH) discretisation<sup id="fnref:zoh" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:zoh" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>. To give an idea of what’s happening morally,
consider a naive first-order approximation<sup id="fnref:Euler" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Euler" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>From Equation 1a, we have</p><p>

\[h’(t) = \mathbf{A}h(t) + \mathbf{B}x(t)\]

</p><p>And for small ∆,</p><p>

\[h’(t) \approx \frac{h(t+\Delta) - h(t)}{\Delta}\]

</p><p>by the definition of the derivative.</p>

<p>We let:</p><p>

\[h_t = h(t)\]

</p><p>and</p><p>

\[h_{t+1} = h(t + \Delta)\]

</p><p>and substitute into Equation 1a giving:</p><p>

\[h_{t+1} - h_t \approx \Delta (\mathbf{A}h_t + \mathbf{B}x_t)\]

\[\Rightarrow h_{t+1} \approx (I + \Delta \mathbf{A})h_t + (\Delta
\mathbf{B})x_t\]

</p><p>Hence, after renaming the coefficients and relabelling indices, we have the
discrete representations:</p>

<p>If you’ve ever looked at an RNN before <sup id="fnref:rnn" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rnn" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> and this feels familiar - <em>trust
your instincts</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have some input x, which is combined with the previous hidden state by some
transform to give the new hidden state. Then we use the hidden state to
calculate the output at each time step.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="understanding-the-ssm-matrices">Understanding the SSM Matrices</h2>

<p>Now, we can interpret the A, B, C, D matrices more intuitively:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A is the transition state matrix. It shows how you transition the current
state into the next state. It asks “How should I forget the less relevant
parts of the state over time?”</li>
  <li>B is mapping the new input into the state, asking “What part of my new input
should I remember?”. <sup id="fnref:B" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:B" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></li>
  <li>C is mapping the state to the output of the SSM. It asks, “How can I use the
state to make a good next prediction?”. <sup id="fnref:C" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:C" rel="footnote">12</a></sup></li>
  <li>D is how the new input passes through to the output. It’s a kind of modified
skip connection that asks “How can I use the new input in my prediction?”</li>
</ul>

  </figure>
</div>


<p>Additionally, ∆ has a nice interpretation - it’s the step size, or what we might
call the <code>linger time</code> or the <code>dwell time</code>. For large ∆, you focus more on that
token; for small ∆, you skip past the token immediately and don’t include it
much in the next state.</p>

<p>And that’s it! That’s the SSM, our ~drop-in replacement for Attention
(<code>Communication</code>) in the Mamba block. The <code>Computation</code> in the Mamba
architecture comes from regular linear projections, non-linearities, and local
convolutions - the regular ML building blocks we know and love!</p>

<p>Okay great, that’s the theory - but does this work? Well…</p>

<h2 id="effectiveness-vs-efficiency-attention-is-focus-selectivity-is-prioritisation">Effectiveness vs Efficiency: Attention is Focus, Selectivity is Prioritisation</h2>

<p>At WWDC ‘97, Steve Jobs famously noted that
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8eP99neOVs&amp;t=98s">focusing is about saying no</a>”.
Focus is ruthless prioritisation. It’s common to think about Attention
<em>positively</em> as choosing what to <em>notice</em>. In the Steve Jobs sense, we might
instead frame Attention <em>negatively</em> as choosing what to <em>discard</em>.</p>

<p>There’s a classic intuition pump in Machine Learning known as the
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8555495">Cocktail Party Problem</a>

<hr>



<p>Transformers use Dot-Product Attention to focus in on the most relevant tokens.
A big reason Attention is so great is that you have the potential to look back
at everything that ever happened in its context. This is like photographic
memory when done right. <sup id="fnref:photo" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:photo" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

<p>Transformers (🤖) are extremely <strong>effective</strong>. But they aren’t very
<strong>efficient</strong>. They store everything from the past so that they can look back at
tokens with theoretically perfect recall.</p>

<p>Traditional RNNs (🔁) are the opposite - they forget a lot, only recalling a
small amount in their hidden state and discarding the rest. They are very
<strong>efficient</strong> - their state is small. Yet they are less <strong>effective</strong> as
discarded information cannot be recovered.</p>

<p>We’d like something closer to the Pareto frontier of the
effectiveness/efficiency tradeoff. Something that’s more effective than
traditional RNNs and more efficient than transformers.</p>

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.kolaayonrinde.com/blog/images/mamba/pareto_frontier.png" width="800" alt="Pareto Frontier">
    <figcaption>The Mamba Architecture seems to offer a solution which pushes out the Pareto frontier of effectiveness/efficiency.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>SSMs are as <strong>efficient</strong> as RNNs, but we might wonder how <strong>effective</strong> they
are. After all, it seems like they would have a hard time discarding only
<em>unnecessary</em> information and keeping everything relevant. If each token is
being processed the same way, applying the same A and B matrices as if in a
factory assembly line for tokens, there is no context-dependence. We would like
the forgetting and remembering matrices (A and B respectively) to vary and
dynamically adapt to inputs.</p>

<h3 id="the-selection-mechanism">The Selection Mechanism</h3>

<p><strong>Selectivity</strong> allows each token to be transformed into the state in a way that
is unique to its own needs. Selectivity is what takes us from vanilla SSM models
(applying the same A (forgetting) and B (remembering) matrices to every input)
to Mamba, the <strong><em>Selective</em></strong> <em>State Space Model</em>.</p>

<p>In regular SSMs, A, B, C and D are learned matrices - that is</p>

<p>\(\mathbf{A} =
\mathbf{A}_{\theta}\) etc. (where θ represents the learned
parameters)</p>

<p>With the Selection Mechanism in Mamba, A, B, C and D are also functions of x.
That is \(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}_{\theta(x)}\) etc; the matrices are context
dependent rather than static.</p>

    <figcaption>Mamba (right) differs from traditional SSMs by allowing A,B,C matrices to be <b> selective </b> i.e. context dependent </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Making A and B functions of x allows us to get the best of both worlds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We’re selective about what we include in the state, which improves
<strong>effectiveness</strong> vs traditional SSMs.</li>
  <li>Yet, since the state size is bounded, we improve on <strong>efficiency</strong> relative to
the Transformer. We have O(1), not O(n) space and O(n) not O(n²) time
requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mamba paper authors write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized
by how well they compress their state: efficient models must have a small
state, while effective models must have a state that contains all necessary
information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle
for building sequence models is selectivity: or the context-aware ability to
focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In particular, a
selection mechanism controls how information propagates or interacts along the
sequence dimension.</p>
</blockquote>



<hr>



<p>Humans (mostly) don’t have photographic memory for everything they experience
within a lifetime - or even within a day! There’s just way too much information
to retain it all. Subconsciously, we select what to remember by choosing to
forget, throwing away most information as we encounter it. Transformers (🤖)
decide what to focus on at <strong>recall time</strong>. Humans (🧑) also decide what to
throw away at <strong>memory-making time</strong>. Humans filter out information early and
often.</p>

<p>If we had infinite capacity for memorisation, it’s clear the transformer
approach is better than the human approach - it truly is more effective. But
it’s less efficient - transformers have to store so much information about the
past that might not be relevant. Transformers (🤖) only decide what’s relevant
at <strong>recall time</strong>. The innovation of Mamba (🐍) is allowing the model better
ways of forgetting earlier - it’s focusing by choosing what to <em>discard</em> using
<strong>Selectivity</strong>, throwing away less relevant information at <strong>memory-making
time</strong><sup id="fnref:seq_len" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:seq_len" rel="footnote">16</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="the-problems-of-selectivity">The Problems of Selectivity</h3>

<p>Applying the Selection Mechanism does have its gotchas though. Non-selective
SSMs (i.e. A,B not dependent on x) are fast to compute in training. This is
because the component of \(y_t\) which depends on \(x_i\) can be expressed
as a linear map, i.e. a single matrix that can be precomputed!</p>

<p>For example (ignoring the D component, the skip connection):</p><p>

\[y_2 = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{B}x_2 + \mathbf{C}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}x_1 +
\mathbf{C}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}x_0\]

</p><p>If we’re paying attention, we might spot something even better here - this
expression can be written as a convolution. Hence we can apply the Fast Fourier
Transform and the Convolution Theorem to compute this <em>very</em> efficiently on
hardware as in Equation 3 below.</p>

    <figcaption>We can calculate Equation 2, the SSM equations, efficiently in the Convolutional Form, Equation 3. </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Unfortunately, with the Selection Mechanism, we lose the convolutional form.
Much attention is given to making Mamba efficient on modern GPU hardware using
similar hardware optimisation tricks to Tri Dao’s Flash Attention <sup id="fnref:cuda" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cuda" rel="footnote">17</a></sup>. With
the hardware optimisations, Mamba is able to run faster than comparably sized
Transformers.</p>

<h3 id="machine-learning-for-political-economists---how-large-should-the-state-be">Machine Learning for Political Economists - How Large Should The State Be?</h3>

<p>The Mamba authors write, “the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence
models is characterised by how well they compress their state”. In other words,
like in political economy<sup id="fnref:oop" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:oop" rel="footnote">18</a></sup>, the fundamental problem is how to manage the
state.</p>

<p>🔁 <strong>Traditional RNNs are anarchic</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They have a small, minimal state. The size of the state is bounded. The
compression of state is poor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>🤖 <strong>Transformers are communist</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They have a maximally large state. The “state” is just a cache of the entire
history with no compression. Every context token is treated equally until
recall time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>🐍<strong>Mamba has a compressed state</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…but it’s selective about what goes in. Mamba says we can get away with a
small state if the state is well focused and effective <sup id="fnref:politik" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:politik" rel="footnote">19</a></sup>.</p>

</div>


<p>The upshot is <strong>state representation is critical</strong>. A smaller state is more
efficient; a larger state is more effective. The key is to <strong>selectively</strong> and
<strong>dynamically</strong> compress data into the state. Mamba’s Selection Mechanism allows
for context-dependent reasoning, focusing and ignoring. For both performance and
interpretability, understanding the state seems to be very useful.</p>

<h2 id="information-flow-in-transformer-vs-mamba">Information Flow in Transformer vs Mamba</h2>

<p>How do Transformers know anything? At initialisation, a transformer isn’t very
smart. It learns in two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Training data (Pretraining, SFT, RLHF etc)</li>
  <li>In context-data</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="training-data">Training Data</h4>

<p>Models learn from their training data. This is a kind of lossy compression of
input data into the weights. We can think of the effect of pretraining data on
the transformer kinda like the effect of your ancestor’s experiences on your
genetics - you can’t recall their experiences, you just have vague instincts
about them <sup id="fnref:analogy" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:analogy" rel="footnote">20</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="in-context-data">In Context-Data</h4>

<p>Transformers use their context as short-term memory, which they can recall with
~perfect fidelity. So we get
<a href="https://thegradient.pub/in-context-learning-in-context/">In-Context Learning</a>,
e.g. using induction heads to solve the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00593.pdf">Indirect Object Identification</a> task, or
<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/c529dba08a146ea8d6cf715ae8930cbe-Paper-Conference.pdf">computing Linear Regression</a>.</p>

<h4 id="retrieval">Retrieval</h4>

<p>Note that Transformers don’t filter their context at all until recall time. So
if we have a bunch of information we think <em>might</em> be useful to the Transformer,
we filter it <em>outside</em> the Transformer (using Information Retrieval strategies)
and then stuff the results into the prompt. This process is known as Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG determines relevant information for the context
window of a transformer. A human with the internet is kinda like a RAG system -
you still have to know what to search but whatever you retrieve is as salient as
short-term memory to you.</p>

<h4 id="information-flow-for-mamba">Information Flow for Mamba</h4>

<p>Training Data acts similarly for Mamba. However, the lines are slightly blurred
for in-context data and retrieval. In-context data for Mamba <em>is</em>
compressed/filtered similar to retrieval data for transformers. This in-context
data is also accessible for look-up like for transformers (although with
somewhat lower fidelity).</p>

<p>Transformer context is to Mamba states what short-term is to long-term memory.
Mamba doesn’t just have “RAM”, it has a hard drive<sup id="fnref:hard-drive" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hard-drive" rel="footnote">21</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:ssd" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ssd" rel="footnote">22</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="swapping-states-as-a-new-prompting-paradigm">Swapping States as a New Prompting Paradigm</h3>

<p>Currently, we often use RAG to give a transformer contextual information.</p>

<p>With Mamba-like models, you could instead imagine having a library of states
created by running the model over specialised data. States could be shared kinda
like
<a href="https://paperswithcode.com/paper/lora-low-rank-adaptation-of-large-language">LoRAs</a>
for image models.</p>

<p>For example, I could do inference on 20 physics textbooks and, say, 100 physics
questions and answers. Then I have a state which I can give to you. Now you
don’t need to add any few-shot examples; you just simply ask your question.
<strong>The in-context learning is in the state</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, you can drag and drop downloaded states into your model, like
literal plug-in cartridges. And note that “training” a state doesn’t require any
backprop. It’s more like a highly specialised one-pass fixed-size compression
algorithm. This is unlimited in-context learning applied at inference time for
zero-compute or latency. <sup id="fnref:steering" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:steering" rel="footnote">23</a></sup></p>

<p>The structure of an effective LLM call goes from…</p>

<ol>
  <li>System Prompt</li>
  <li>Preamble</li>
  <li>Few shot-examples</li>
  <li>Question</li>
</ol>

<p>…for Transformers, to simply…</p>

<ol>
  <li>Inputted state (with problem context, initial instructions, textbooks, and
few-shot examples)</li>
  <li>Short question</li>
</ol>

<p>…for Mamba.</p>

<p>This is cheaper and faster than few-shot prompting (as the state is infinitely
reusable without inference cost). It’s also MUCH cheaper than finetuning and
doesn’t require any gradient updates. We could imagine retrieving states in
addition to context.</p>

<h2 id="mamba--mechanistic-interpretability">Mamba &amp; Mechanistic Interpretability</h2>

<p>Transformer interpretability typically involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>understanding token relationships via attention,</li>
  <li>understanding circuits, and</li>
  <li>using
<a href="https://www.kolaayonrinde.com/blog/2023/11/03/dictionary-learning.html">Dictionary Learning</a>
for unfolding MLPs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the ablations that we would like to do for Mamba are still valid, but
understanding token communication (1) is now more nuanced. All information moves
between tokens via hidden states instead of the Attention Mechanism which can
“teleport” information from one sequence position to another.</p>

<p>For understanding in-context learning (ICL) tasks with Mamba, we will look to
intervene on the SSM state. A classic task in-context learning task is
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00593.pdf">Indirect Object Identification</a> in which
a model has to finish a paragraph like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Then, Shelby and Emma had a lot of fun at the school. [Shelby/Emma] gave an
apple to [BLANK]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The model is expected to fill in the blank with the name that is not repeated in
the paragraph. In the chart below we can see that information is passed from the
<code>[Shelby/Emma]</code> position to the final position via the hidden state (see the two
blue lines in the top chart).</p>

</div>


<p>Since it’s hypothesised that much of In-Context Learning in Transformers is
downstream of more primitive sequence position operations (like
<a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html">Induction Heads</a>),
Mamba being able to complete this task suggests a more general In-Context
Learning ability.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next-for-mamba--ssms">What’s Next for Mamba &amp; SSMs?</h2>

<p>Mamba-like models are likely to excel in scenarios requiring extremely long
context and long-term memory. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Processing DNA</li>
  <li>Generating (or reasoning over) video</li>
  <li>Writing novels</li>
</ul>

<p>An illustrative example is agents with long-term goals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you have an agent interacting with the world. Eventually, its
experiences become too much for the context window of a transformer. The agent
then has to compress or summarise its experiences into some more compact
representation.</p>

  <p>But how do you decide what information is the most useful as a summary? If the
task is language, LLMs are actually fairly good at summaries - okay, yeah,
you’ll lose some information, but the most important stuff can be retained.</p>

  <p>However, for other disciplines, it might not be clear how to summarise. For
example, what’s the best way to summarise a 2 hour movie? <sup id="fnref:movie" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:movie" rel="footnote">24</a></sup>. Could the
model itself learn to do this naturally rather than a hacky workaround like
trying to describe the aesthetics of the movie in text?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what Mamba allows. Actual long-term memory. A real state where the model
learns to keep what’s important.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10668.pdf">Prediction is compression</a> - learning
what’s useful to predict what’s coming next inevitably leads to building a
useful compression of the previous tokens.</p>

<h3 id="agents--ai-safety">Agents &amp; AI Safety</h3>

<p>One reason for positive updates in existential risk from AGI is Language Models.
Previously, Deep-RL agents trained via self-play looked set to be the first
AGIs. Language models are inherently much safer since they aren’t trained with
long-term goals. <sup id="fnref:safe" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:safe" rel="footnote">25</a></sup></p>

<p>The potential for long-term sequence reasoning here brings back the importance
of agent-based AI safety. Few agent worries are relevant to Transformers with an
8k context window. Many are relevant to systems with impressive long-term
memories and possible instrumental goals.</p>

<h3 id="the-best-collab-since-taco-bell--kfc--x-">The Best Collab Since Taco Bell &amp; KFC: 🤖 x 🐍</h3>

<p>The Mamba authors show that there’s value in combining Mamba’s long context with
the Transformer’s high fidelity over short sequences. For example, if you’re
making long videos, you likely can’t fit a whole movie into a Transformer’s
context for attention <sup id="fnref:image" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:image" rel="footnote">26</a></sup>. You could imagine having Attention look at the
most recent frames for short-term fluidity and an SSM for long-term narrative
consistency <sup id="fnref:optimisation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:optimisation" rel="footnote">27</a></sup>.</p>



<hr>



<p>This isn’t the end for Transformers. Their high effectiveness is exactly what’s
needed for many tasks. But now Transformers aren’t the only option. Other
architectures are genuinely feasible.</p>

<p>So we’re not in the post-<code>Transformer</code> era. But for the first time, we’re living
in the post-<code>only-Transformers</code> era <sup id="fnref:other-models" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:other-models" rel="footnote">28</a></sup>. And this blows the
possibilities wide open for sequence modelling with extreme context lengths and
native long-term memory.</p>

<p>Two ML researchers, Sasha Rush (HuggingFace, Annotated Transformer, Cornell
Professor) and Jonathan Frankle (Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, MosaicML, Harvard
Professor), currently have a bet <a href="http://www.isattentionallyouneed.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Currently Transformers are far and away in the lead. With 3 years left, there’s
now a research direction with a fighting chance.</p>

<p>It’s a signature trait of design system teams to believe they’re moving too slow and must move faster. In <a href="https://bigmedium.com/hire/">Big Medium’s work</a> guiding and building <a href="https://bigmedium.com/projects/">dozens of enterprise design systems</a>, we see it over and over again:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a design system team isn’t delivering new features, components, or patterns as fast as product teams need them, the team believes it’s a bottleneck.</li>
<li>When a UI component in the system doesn’t provide for every product-level variation or use case, the team convinces itself the component isn’t production-ready—and taking too long to get to “done.”</li>
<li>If system patterns don’t include fresh ideas or experiments, the team worries that they’re promoting stagnation by not moving at the speed of innovation.</li>
</ul>

<p>For design system teams, this feels like an existential problem. After all, a design system is supposed to improve the efficiency (and quality and consistency) of user interfaces by delivering a library of solved problems. And so of course it feels like a fundamental failure if this supposedly efficient system is instead a bottleneck. And worse: if product teams believe that, too, then they’ll resist adopting the system.</p>

<p>Successful design systems do indeed help product teams move more quickly, but here’s the twist: <strong>Successful design systems move more slowly than the products they support. That’s a feature, not a bug. The slower pace doesn’t mean that design systems have to be a bottleneck to shipping product.</strong></p>

<p>Product and design system can and should run at their own independent speeds, and we’ve developed strategy and process to help the two do their thing without tripping over each other. Read on to learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>why design systems should move more slowly than product</li>
<li>what to do when product has a need that the design system can’t support in time</li>
<li>how to coordinate the design system roadmap with product roadmaps</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="designsystemsshouldprioritizequalityoverspeed">Design systems should prioritize quality over speed</h3>

<p><strong>The design system is critical front-end infrastructure.</strong> When it’s successful, its components and patterns drive the UI, UX, and front-end code of the entire organization. You inject the design system into the very bloodstream of the whole product portfolio—as a general rule, it’s a bad idea to inject crap into the bloodstream. </p>

<p>That’s why “quality over speed” is one of the core principles of our design system practice. Critical infrastructure is not a place for rushed solutions and quick hacks. Infrastructure should be stable, durable, and well engineered. A design system establishes this reliability in its approach to experience, in the craft of its design and development, in the standards it always observes, and even in the practice and rituals followed by the team that builds it.</p>

<blockquote>
Successful design systems move more slowly than the products they support. That’s a feature, not a bug.
</blockquote>
<p>Quality can’t be rushed. This infrastructure layer should move more deliberately than the faster product layer, where products often have to emphasize speed over quality. Shipping a product feature on time, even if just a rough MVP, often has enormous business implications. And so short-term hacks, design debt, and technical debt are often necessary to meet business goals. Sometimes you just have to take shortcuts to get the thing out the door. That’s a fact of life for the product world.</p>

<p>While that’s true for product, it’s not true for the design system or other infrastructure projects, where design and technical debt are far more expensive. Understanding the design system as critical infrastructure—not mere production support—provides the logic and permission to move deliberately in pervasive, high-stakes aspects of your product development (infrastructure) while still moving very quickly in others (product).</p>

<p>But how can a slower-moving design system support a faster-moving product? How do those varied speeds and efforts coexist? That’s the whole idea behind pace layers.</p>

<h3 id="pacelayers:therightspeedfortherightjob">Pace layers: the right speed for the right job</h3>

<p>If you’re not familiar with pace layers, here’s the gist. Say you have an object in orbit,
like a planet around the sun. It moves at a steady pace, returning with every rotation to the same spot in the same fixed amount of time.</p>

<div>

  </video>
</div>

<p>Now say that you have another planet in an outer orbit, and that it circles the sun in the very same amount of time as the inner object. That outer element necessarily moves much faster, covering more ground in the same interval—same time period, different speeds.</p>

<p>Back in 1999, Stewart Brand applied this to how civilization works in his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clock-Long-Now-Responsibility-Computer/dp/0465007805/">The Clock of the Long Now</a>. Instead of orbits, think of geological layers that move at different speeds but are all part of one whole. Brand called these <em>pace layers.</em></p>

<p>Nature, for example, moves slowly but influences culture, which moves faster and influences governance, which influences infrastructure and so on. And out at the outer edge, fashion is moving at a frenetic and sometimes chaotic pace, bouncing around like crazy. Brand wrote that each of these pace layers have an important role to play, and that the speed (or slowness) of each one is crucial to its role:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast learns, slow remembers.&nbsp;Fast proposes, slow disposes.&nbsp;Fast is discontinuous, slow is continuous.&nbsp;Fast and small instructs slow and big by accrued innovation and by occasional revolution.&nbsp;Slow and big controls small and fast by constraint and constancy.&nbsp;Fast gets all our attention, slow has all the power.</p>

<p>—Stewart Brand<br>
<a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand/release/2">Pace Layering: How Complex Systems Learn and Keep Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the point. All of these pace layers are part of the whole, coexisting in the same ecosystem and moving productively at their own speed. <strong>The fast and slow serve each other:</strong> Fast layers innovate, and slow layers stabilize. Out at the edge is where experimentation and discovery and innovation happens. At the center is where institutional memory and stability happens.</p>

<p>Fast learns, slow remembers. Fast instructs slow, slow controls fast.</p>

    <figcaption>
        In the pace layers of digital products, product zips along at the outer layer while design systems and other supporting infrastructure move more slowly at the inner layer.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the pace layers of digital product process, products occupy the fast outer layer. Products ship constantly and iterate quickly, keeping up with the fast tide of changing customer needs, competitive trends, and market demands.</p>

<p>Product research meanwhile keeps tabs on what’s happening, and how well a product is answering those product needs, but research inquiry typically trails product, delivering its insights slower than product timelines.</p>

<p>That’s in the context of visual brand, which moves more slowly but often has epochal shifts like a rebrand, or maybe has new brands come and go with white-labeling, for example.<a href="#fn:96127" id="fnref:96127" title="see footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p>And then at the base is the design system—along with other slow-moving standards and infrastructure that govern the foundations of the product build.</p>

<p>When that design system layer is missing or poorly developed, the product layer doesn’t enjoy consistency, reuse, efficiency and other benefits of a design system’s institutional knowledge. When that design system is built with care and quality, however, it speeds the work of product because teams can use it with confidence: drop it in, and it just works.</p>

<h3 id="tensionandfrustrationbetweenpacelayers">Tension and frustration between pace layers</h3>

<p>Sparks sometimes fly among the layers. That happens when one layer is impatient with the speed of the others. </p>

<p>Customers want product to move faster, or at least to be flexible enough to bend and get out of customers’ way when they need to do something the product can’t yet accomplish. Product teams meanwhile are frustrated by the deliberate pace of research-informed decisions (so they skip research entirely) or by infrastructure pacing (so they build their own). </p>

<p>For design system teams, the fear surrounding this tension is that the design system could be seen as a bottleneck, or a distraction, or an expense—something that slows down production, that becomes a drag on the business. This comes to a head when a product team wants something that is outside the design system’s scope or timeline. </p>

<p><strong>What do you do when a product team needs a UI component, pattern, or feature that the design system team cannot provide in time, or is not part of their scope?</strong></p>

<p>The answer is not to add a rushed or ill-considered solution to the design system library to meet the product team’s urgent need. But it also doesn’t mean that the product team should slow down and wait. The pace layers should move at their pace and in their own lane, without hurrying or slowing the others. Here’s what that means in practice.</p>

<h3 id="productteamsshouldcooktheirownrecipes">Product teams should cook their own recipes</h3>

<p>Product can’t be expected to pause for the design system to catch up. If they need a feature that the design system does not yet (or may never) provide, the product team should move ahead and build the solution themselves.</p>

<p>We call these solutions <em>recipes.</em> Recipes are UI patterns that are cooked up in whole or in part from design system ingredients (components, design tokens, icons and/or styles). <a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/design-system-ecosystem.html#recipelayeroptional">Recipes are their own layer of the design system ecosystem.</a> These recipes are not part of the core system itself, but are examples of how the system can be used—or even first-draft proposals for new features for the system. Product teams often have entire cookbooks of pattern recipes built out of design system goodies. These cookbooks are often represented by their own Figma libraries, code repos, and style guides. While Google’s Material design system provides lots of building-block components, for example, Google products like Calendar, YouTube, or GMail all have their own product-specific pattern recipes that they maintain themselves, to serve their specific domains.</p>

<p><strong>It is good and desirable for product teams to invent, prototype, ship, and maintain their own UI recipes.</strong> In fact, <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-design-system-governance-process/">as Big Medium’s Brad Frost describes</a>, this is a formal part of <a href="https://coggle.it/diagram/XTZ3TKMV3SdbE6Pq/t/product-team-comes-to-design-help-design-and-build-new-work/">the design system governance workflow we recommend</a>.</p>

<p>This is true even for components or patterns that the design system team eventually intends to include in the library but can’t commit to building in time while still meeting the design system’s standard of quality and satisfying all the contexts beyond the immediate product ask. In that case, the product team should build what they need—effectively building the first draft of the feature, component, or pattern—and the design system team should add that component to its backlog for review, improvement, and eventual inclusion in the library. Meanwhile, the product team owns and hosts the recipe.</p>

<p>When product teams follow this path, they should collaborate with the design system team on high-level approach and architecture, so that the coded component has properties that anticipate and align with how the eventual design system component will be developed and delivered. This allows teams to drop in the official design system component when it becomes available and with as little rework as possible.</p>

<p>Let it be said: this approach does accrue design and technical debt, but that’s also the cost of innovation and of doing something new. Debt is a trade-off, not an absolute evil, and it has to be wielded with intention and transparency. With proper communication with the design system team, the debt can be mitigated over the long term. Meanwhile, debt at the product layer is at least cheaper than debt at the infrastructure layer.</p>

<p>Maybe more fundamentally, this approach recognizes the role of product as the innovative outer pace layer. Product is where experiments and first efforts should happen. The design system should capture and share the successful experiments after they prove out. “Fast learns, slow remembers.”</p>

<p>In other words: The job of the design system team is not to innovate, but to curate. The system should provide answers only for settled solutions: the components and patterns that don’t require innovation because they’ve been solved and now standardized. Answers go into the design system when the questions are no longer interesting—proven out in product. <a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html">The most exciting design systems are boring.</a></p>

<blockquote>
The job of the design system team is not to innovate, but to curate.
</blockquote>
<p>The corollary to this is that product teams should prefer design system solutions when they’re available. When there’s already a settled solution for the problem at hand, then… settle for that solution. While the recipe approach gives permission to product teams to take a first stab at features and patterns, it’s not permission to willy-nilly build whatever they like, just because they don’t care for the existing solution or they have a whim for something new. Experiments should still be chosen with intention and with spiritual alignment with the design system and the standards it offers.</p>

<p>But! This still leaves room for innovation and growth when the product team believes they have an idea that could improve on an existing design system solution—and perhaps eventually replace the interaction or design pattern that the design system provides. This too should be treated with communication, transparency, and intention: the product team should propose the new approach to the design system team, suggest a scoped experiment, and then both teams can evaluate the result to see if it should be brought into the system as an addition or replacement. (And if it fails, then the product team should go back to the design system’s proven approach.)</p>

<h3 id="allofthistakesplanningandcooperation">All of this takes planning and cooperation</h3>

<p>This has to happen in good faith. This tends to fall apart when there’s not trust, clear communication, and healthy dialogue among the teams and layers. As usual, the biggest challenge is not the technical implementation but the coordination of humans.</p>

<p>The design system team should communicate that product teams will have the best results with the design system team if they share new-feature wants and needs in advance. When product teams do annual or quarterly feature roadmapping, they should keep the design system team up to date on anticipated needs for features and components. If it aligns with design system roadmaps and timing, then the design system team can prioritize that work accordingly. If the feature doesn’t fit the plans or capacity of the design system team, then the product team can plan for building it themselves. No surprises.</p>

<blockquote>
As usual, the biggest challenge is not the technical implementation but the coordination of humans.
</blockquote>
<p>Either way, both teams know that they’re working at exactly the right pace for their layer—and have confidence that they’re serving the organization in the best way by doing so.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, design system teams, you can put aside your existential dread. You’re an infrastructure team. Moving with steady deliberation is what infrastructure teams are supposed to do. Support the culture of speed by going slow.</p>

<p>Bribery—the offering or solicitation of items of value to influence the actions of a government official—is recognized as a pervasive problem in India, with the 2010 report by anti-corruption watchdog organization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_International" title="Transparency International">Transparency International</a> ranking India in 87th place on its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index" title="Corruption Perceptions Index">Corruption Perceptions Index</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> A 2005 study published by Transparency International India indicated that as many of 62% of Indian citizens had first-hand experience of having paid a bribe or used an illicit "contact" to get a government job done.<sup id="cite_ref-TI-01_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-TI-01-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>The 2005 Transparency International India study was the largest study of the Indian bribery problem ever undertaken, with 14,405 respondents from 20 states contributing.<sup id="cite_ref-TI-05_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-TI-05-3">[3]</a></sup> The survey focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_corruption" title="Petty corruption">petty corruption</a> experienced by common citizens in daily life, rather than upon the large-scale corruption of the rich and powerful.<sup id="cite_ref-TI-05_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-TI-05-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>The 2005 study exposed chronic graft problems, with substantial numbers of survey respondents reporting direct experience in being forced to pay bribes to the police (80%), land administration (48%), and judiciary (47%).<sup id="cite_ref-TI-08_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-TI-08-4">[4]</a></sup> Majorities of survey respondents characterized the police, judiciary, land administration, municipal government, electricity supply system, government hospital system, ration card system, water supply system, and system of assessing individual income taxes as corrupt.<sup id="cite_ref-TI-08_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-TI-08-4">[4]</a></sup> Fully 45% of survey respondents believed that there was corruption as well in the primary school system.<sup id="cite_ref-TI-08_4-2"><a href="#cite_note-TI-08-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p>In 2007 a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization" title="Non-profit organization">non-profit organization</a> known as 5th Pillar created the zero-rupee note as a means for Indians to register their refusal to participate in bribery. Closely patterned after the nation's fifty-rupee notes, these documents instead included anti-corruption slogans "Eliminate corruption at all levels" and "I promise to neither accept nor give bribe."<sup id="cite_ref-AO_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-AO-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>These zero-rupee notes were designed for use by Indian citizens who have been requested to pay bribes in order to obtain services that are legally free or who are hit with illicit surcharges on such routine government transactions as obtaining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver%27s_license" title="Driver's license">driver's license</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NG_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-NG-6">[6]</a></sup> Such currency devices enable the citizen to register their opposition to the illegal request in a tangible form, "paying" the official with these valueless alternative notes.
</p><p>"The note is a way for any human being to say no to corruption without the fear of facing an encounter with persons in authority", 5th Pillar said in an official statement.<sup id="cite_ref-DN_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-DN-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>President of 5th Pillar, Vijay Anand, expressed satisfaction with the program's efficacy: "People have already started using them and it is working. One <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw" title="Auto rickshaw">auto rickshaw</a> driver was pulled over by a policeman in the middle of the night who said he could go if he was "taken care of". The driver gave him the note instead. The policeman was shocked but smiled and let him go. The purpose of this is to instill confidence in people to say no to bribery."<sup id="cite_ref-AO_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-AO-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>In addition to registering the individual's protest, zero-rupee notes provide corrupt officials with a sign that efforts are ongoing to fight systemic government corruption. Use of the notes is intended to shame or scare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucrat" title="Bureaucrat">bureaucrats</a> into honest behavior by reminding these officials that laws against bribery exist.<sup id="cite_ref-NG_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-NG-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>While the zero-rupee notes appear similar to a genuine Indian fifty-rupee note, they are not issued by the Indian government and are thus not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender" title="Legal tender">legal tender</a>. Only one side of the note is printed to resemble currency so as not to run afoul of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeiting" title="Counterfeiting">counterfeiting</a> laws.<sup id="cite_ref-AO_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-AO-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>According to 5th Pillar, Indian citizens pay approximately £3 billion (about $4.9 billion) in bribes each year—a figure considered to be substantially understated by many government insiders.<sup id="cite_ref-DN_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-DN-7">[7]</a></sup>

<p>Satindar Mohan Bhagat, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-resident_Indian" title="Non-resident Indian">Indian expatriate</a> who is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a> professor at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland" title="University of Maryland">University of Maryland</a> and the director of Association for India's Development, Inc. US, is credited with originating the concept of the zero-rupee note in 2001.<sup id="cite_ref-Economist_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-Economist-8">[8]</a></sup> Upon returning to India for a visit, Bhagat was frustrated by the petty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion" title="Extortion">extortion</a> demands of government officials that were part of daily life and conceived of the idea of a zero-rupee note as a polite way of declining participation.<sup id="cite_ref-Economist_8-1"><a href="#cite_note-Economist-8">[8]</a></sup> The charity 5th Pillar put Bhagat's idea into practice.<sup id="cite_ref-Economist_8-2"><a href="#cite_note-Economist-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>5th Pillar began the campaign in the spring of 2007 with a first printing of 25,000 notes that were distributed in the Indian city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai" title="Chennai">Chennai</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-AO_5-3"><a href="#cite_note-AO-5">[5]</a></sup> Buoyed by the success of the campaign, additional printings followed and use of the zero-rupee note spread across the nation. From their inception through August 2014, 5th Pillar distributed over 2.5 million zero-rupee notes.<sup id="cite_ref-NG_6-2"><a href="#cite_note-NG-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>Zero-rupee notes have been issued in five of the 22 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_with_official_status_in_India" title="Languages with official status in India">scheduled languages of India</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada" title="Kannada">Kannada</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam" title="Malayalam">Malayalam</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language" title="Telugu language">Telugu</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5thP_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-5thP-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>This concept for use in the fight against corruption has recently been adopted from 5th Pillar to few other nations suffering from endemic government bribery problems including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin" title="Benin">Benin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NG_6-3"><a href="#cite_note-NG-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>As of 2015, 5th Pillar expanded the zero-rupee note concept beyond India to other country currencies, on the website ZeroCurrency.org.

        </ol>
        <img src="https://usoldering.com/switch-lite/images/demo.jpg" alt="Small demo of output files">
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
	    <p>This is the output data for a process I solo-developed for extracting the netlist from an assembled Printed Circuit Board, in this case, a Nintendo Switch Lite logic board. Electrical components are soldered to exposed mounting pads on the PCB, and layers of copper form connections between these pads creating electrical circuits. The full list of these interconnects is called the netlist, and when combined with the part and pad geometries, constitute a boardview. Couple that boardview with reference images of both sides of the PCB, and you have the output data.</p>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>There are 3 novel-ish innovations working together to make this happen. They are:
            </p><ol>
                <li>A process to create geometrical and color-accurate panoramic images of assembled PCBs at 6,000 PPI.</li>
                <li>A point-and-click GUI to draw geometrical part/pad data over the panoramas, with support for adding/modifying other arbitrary data.</li>
                <li>My own PCB capable of powering an arbitrary number of pins one-by-one, reading the state of all pins between each step.</li>
            </ol>
            Once I had that figured out, the process is to simply:
            <ol>
                <li>Take all the images and stitch the bottom-side panorama, flip the board, desolder the RF Shields, then take all the images and stitch the top-side panorama. Use these 2 panoramas and other images against each other to further refine the geometrical and color accuracy.</li>
                <li>Import the completed panoramas into the GUI, and use it to lay down the initial part/pad geometries.</li>
                <li>Desolder every component individually and place them into unique binned locations for future analysis. Record the binned location and presumed reference designator in the GUI, correcting any discrepencies in the pad geometries made in Step 2.</li>
                <li>With all pads exposed and not-shorted, hook one lead of a DMM in continuity mode to the ground plane, and use the other lead to probe every single pad on the PCB. Record all hits into the GUI, merging them into a single net.</li>
                <li>Use the GUI to group remaining pads into net-fragments, based on visual connections in the two outer board layers. If there is no visible connection, assume it is it's own fragment.</li>
                <li>Use the GUI to record the order you solder wires from the extractor PCB pins to which net-fragments on the target PCB.</li>
                <li>Run the extractor. Power goes from the extractor PCB pin, down the wire, into the net-fragment, through all hidden connections in the PCB, into other net-fragments, up those wires, back into the extractor PCB, and are logged to create a complete mapping of all hidden connections.</li>
                <li>Use the GUI to merge all of the fragments into a completed netlist, based on the extractor mapping. Export all this data into a boardview file, pack it up with the panoramas, and then...</li>
                <li>Share and Enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
            The final stats are 2,444 photographs stitched into the 2 panoramas, 760 parts desoldered into binned locations, and 1,917 wires used for a total of approximately 30,176 lead-free, bismuth-free, and halide-free solder joints used to extract the netlist. While this is only about 3 weeks of soldering work, process/software/hardware development took over a year and over $10,000.
        
        <img src="https://usoldering.com/switch-lite/images/meme.jpg" alt="Homemade flying probe meme">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>You may have noticed the panoramas are actually at 2,000 PPI. That's because the 6,000 PPI versions are half a gigapixel, each. This causes problems. With everything. You can <a href="https://usoldering.com/switch-lite/files/switch-lite-logic-board-6k-ppi_archive.torrent">Torrent</a> or <a href="https://archive.org/details/switch-lite-logic-board-6k-ppi">Download</a> them here.</p>
        <p>You may also notice the part/pad outlines are rather simple. That's because the complex rendering feature is currently <a href="https://github.com/OpenBoardView/OpenBoardView/blob/8528b80cdc4928c220b552a772dff84ba3679cd5/src/openboardview/FileFormats/BVR3File.cpp#L110">not supported</a> in OBV. The data is all there, and all files are cross-compatible with the premium, closed-source fork of OBV, <a href="https://pldaniels.com/flexbv5/">FlexBV5</a>.</p>
        <p>Step One, post-RF Shield de-solder and Step Seven, pre-extraction, there should be ultrasonic cleaning cycles. It takes many tricks to get the RF Shields off without resorting to using low-melt (bismuth) solder. This is why the topside panorama is filthy compared to the bottomside one. There is also some risk pre-extraction that the flux residues can be conductive enough to cause false-positive connections between net-fragments. I don't have an ultrasonic.</p>
        <p>There's also a missing step between Step Eight and Nine. That is to take all the parts out of their bins and measure their electrical properties. I have a basic, low-accuracy LCR Meter, but testing them now would result in relatively low-quality and incomplete data.</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>My background is over a decade in Electronics Contract Manufacturing serving the medical, aerospace, military, and industrial sectors. More than half of that time is as a SMT Process Technician, with full read/write access to millions of dollars of state-of-the-art equipment. Therein lies the trap: you end up overspecialized, dependant on someone else's unaffordable equipment. Sprinkle in some monthly payments, insurance, ever-moving goalposts, and the mass psychosis of modern corporate dogma; it becomes an elaborate prison.</p>
        <p>Using 100% of my willpower to make no further mention of Sisyphus and The Boulder; this project is an experiment in fusing Work-From-Home internet freelancing with master electrical soldering, while still contributing meaningfully to society. I could open a repair shop but that's mostly disassembling and reassembling devices, and troubleshooting electrical circuits. Relatively, very little soldering. Pander to algorithms for ad money? Shill affiliate links? Resell junk tools? Also not soldering. If the goal is to just make money, I could sell 6,000 PPI panoramas of women's feet as NFT's. <b>Note: Do not contact me about this.</b></p>

With your help, I can add more devices, reduce cycle time, improve quality, and provide more data while cost-optimizing, documenting, and open-sourcing to make the entire process reproducible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It’s been three years since the inception of Marginalia Search, then
a dinky experiment to find where the heck the cool Internet has gone,
now my full time job.</p><p>While there’s always things that can be improved, it’s fair to say
the search engine has never worked as well as it does right now.</p><p>A great number of milestones have been reached, perhaps biggest
of all the search engine has moved out of my living room and into
a proper enterprise server.</p><p>An overarching theme for the year has been cleaning up the code
base and streamlining the application, not only to keep the
operational workload manageable, but to make the application and
codebase more accessible to other people, both operators and
developers. It’s been a lot of work, but it’s beginning to pay
off.</p><p>It feels distant, but the search engine used to require days-long outages when switching
indexes. This is gone. Since recently, it’s also capable of zero
downtime upgrades. So much of the operational side used to be weeks-long
manual processes, now you press a button in a GUI instead.</p><p>Something which had an outsized impact was adding support for
anchor text keywords. It’s made an incredible difference in
the search engine’s ability to find relevant results. It wasn’t
immediately apparant when the change was made, beacuse it initially
wasn’t very well integrated, but as this new relevance signal settled
in, that was a real wow moment.</p><p>It’s also been something like eight months since this became my full
time occupation, thanks to the generous people at nlnet.
This has been a bit of a trip in its own regard. The hardest part
about this has probably been not working <em>too</em> much, I’ve been trying to
take at least one day off per week, and sometimes succeeding! I know I’m
leaps and bounds smarter when I’m well rested, so actually resting sometimes
should theoretically be in line with getting stuff done. It’s just so fun
though…</p><p>The quest to reach 1B indexed documents is slowly ongoing. It’s proving
a bit harder than anticipated, not because the software can’t handle it,
but because the signal to noise ratio of the web isn’t very good; a huge
reason why the search engine works relatively well is because of what it
doesn’t index. That said, the index has gone from 50-100M a year ago,
to 220M last crawl, and likely 290-300M when the next crawl round is finished
based on the growth of the two partitions that have already finished.</p><p>Next on the chopping block is query parsing and execution. There’s a great
deal of room for improvement in this area. I’m currently engaged in a bit
of mise en place to clean up the affected code before the real work begins.</p><p>That said, the grand leaps forward in this project has always been experimental,
so even though things are planned, I think it’s fairly certain it’s the un-planned
things that will be the ones to really make a dent. Like those anchor texts.</p><p>Finally! Thanks <a href="https://www.nlnet.nl/">NLnet</a>, thanks <a href="https://www.futo.org/">FUTO</a>,
thanks Patreons, thanks advocates, and users. This wouldn’t be possible without you.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://computer.rip/2024-02-11-the-top-of-the-DNS-hierarchy.html">https://computer.rip/2024-02-11-the-top-of-the-DNS-hierarchy.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39500500">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>In the past (in fact two years ago, proof I have been doing this for a while
now!) I <a href="https://computer.rip/2022-01-16-peer-to-peer-but-mostly-the-main-peer.html">wrote
about</a>
the "inconvenient truth" that structural aspects of the Internet make truly
decentralized systems infeasible, due to the lack of a means to perform
broadcast discovery. As a result, most distributed systems rely on a set of
central, semi-static nodes to perform initial introductions.</p>
<p>For example, Bitcoin relies on a small list of volunteer-operated domain names
that resolve to known-good full nodes. Tor similarly uses a small set of
central "directory servers" that provide initial node lists. Both systems have
these lists hardcoded into their clients; coincidentally, both have nine
trusted, central hostnames.</p>
<p>This sort of problem exists in basically all distributed systems that operate
in environments where it is not possible to shout into the void and hope for a
response. The internet, for good historic reasons, does not permit this kind of
behavior. Here we should differentiate between distributed and decentralized,
two terms I do not tend to select very carefully. Not all distributed systems
are decentralized, indeed, many are not. One of the easiest and most practical
ways to organize a distributed system is according to a hierarchy. This is a
useful technique, so there are many examples, but a prominent and old one
happens to also be part of the drivetrain mechanics of the internet: DNS, the
domain name system.</p>
<p>My reader base is expanding and so I will provide a very brief bit of
background. Many know that DNS is responsible for translating human-readable
names like "computer.rip" into the actual numerical addresses used by the
internet protocol. Perhaps a bit fewer know that DNS, as a system, is
fundamentally organized around the hierarchy of these names. To examine the
process of resolving a DNS name, it is sometimes more intuitive to reverse
the name, and instead of "computer.rip", discuss "rip.computer" [1].</p>
<p>This name is hierarchical, it indicates that the record "computer" is within
the zone "rip". "computer" is itself a zone and can contain yet more records,
we tend to call these subdomains. But the term "subdomain" can be confusing
as everything is a subdomain of something, even "rip" itself, which in a
certain sense is a subdomain of the DNS root "." (which is why, of course,
a stricter writing of the domain name computer.rip would be computer.rip.,
but as a culture we have rejected the trailing root dot).</p>
<p>Many of us probably know that each level of the DNS hierarchy has authoritative
nameservers, operated typically by whoever controls the name (or their
third-party DNS vendor). "rip" has authoritative DNS servers provided by a
company called Rightside Group, a subsidiary of the operator of websites like
eHow that went headfirst into the great DNS land grab and snapped up "rip" as a
bit of land speculation, alongside such attractive properties as "lawyer" and
"navy" and "republican" and "democrat", all of which I would like to own the
"computer" subdomain of, but alas such dictionary words are usually already
taken.</p>
<p>"computer.rip", of course, has authoritative nameservers operated by myself or
my delegate. Unlike some people I know, I do not have any nostalgia for BIND,
and so I pay a modest fee to a commercial DNS operator to do it for me. Some
would be surprised that I pay for this; DNS is actually rather inexpensive to
operate and authoritative name servers are almost universally available as a
free perk from domain registrars and others. I just like to pay for this on the
general feeling that companies that charge for a given service are probably
more committed to its quality, and it really costs very little and changing it
would take work.</p>
<p>To the observant reader, this might leave an interesting question. If even the
top-level domains are subdomains of a secret, seldom-seen root domain ".", who
operates the authoritative name servers for that zone?</p>
<p>And here we return to the matter of even distributed systems requiring central
nodes. Bitcoin uses nine harcoded domain names for initial discovery of
decentralized peers. DNS uses thirteen harcoded root servers to establish the
top level of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>These root servers are commonly referred to as a.root-servers.net through
m.root-servers.net, and indeed those are their domain names, but remember that
when we need to use those root servers we have no entrypoint into the DNS
hierarchy and so are not capable of resolving names. The root servers are much
more meaningfully identified by their IP addresses, which are "semi-harcoded"
into recursive resolves in the form of what's often called a root hints file.
You can <a href="https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root">download a copy</a>, it's a
simple file in BIND zone format that BIND basically uses to bootstrap its
cache.</p>
<p>And yes, there are other DNS implementations too, a surprising number of them,
even in wide use. But when talking about DNS history we can mostly stick to
BIND. BIND used to stand for Berkeley Internet Name Domain, and it is an apt
rule of thumb in computer history that anything with a reference to UC Berkeley
in the name is probably structurally important to the modern technology
industry.</p>
<p>One of the things I wanted to get at, when I originally talked about central
nodes in distributed systems, is the impact it has on trust and reliability.
The TOR project is aware that the nine directory servers are an appealing
target for attack or compromise, and technical measures have been taken to
mitigate the possibility of malicious behavior. The Bitcoin project seems to
mostly ignore that the DNS seeds exist, but of course the design of the Bitcoin
system limits their compromise to certain types of attacks. In the case of DNS,
much like most decentralized systems, there is a layer of long-lived caching
for top-level domains that mitigates the impact of unavailability of the root
servers, but still, in every one of these systems, there is the possibility of
compromise or unavailability if the central nodes are attacked.</p>
<p>And so there is always a layer of policy. A trusted operator can never
guarantee the trustworthiness of a central node (the node could be compromised,
or the trusted operator could turn out to be the FBI), but it sure does help.
Tor's directory servers are operated by the Tor project. Bitcoin's DNS seeds
are operated by individuals with a long history of involvement in the project.
DNS's root nodes are operated by a hodgepodge of companies and institutions
that were important to the early internet.</p>
<p>Verisign operates two, of course. A California university operates one, of
course, but amusingly not Berkeley. Three are operated by various arms of US
defense. Some internet industry associations, an NCC, another university, ICANN
runs one of them themselves. It's pretty random, though, and just reflects a
set of organizations prominently involved in the early internet.</p>
<p>Some people, even some journalists I've come across, hear that there are 13 name
servers and picture 13 4U boxes with a lot of blinking lights in heavily
fortified data centers. Admittedly this description was more or less accurate
in the early days, and a couple of the smaller root server operators did have
single machines until surprisingly recently. But today, all thirteen root
server IP addresses are anycast groups.</p>
<p>Anycast is not a concept you run into every day, because it's not really useful
on local networks where multicast can be used. But it's very important to the
modern internet. The idea is this: an IP address (really a subnetwork) is
advertised by multiple BGP nodes. Other BGP nodes can select the advertisement
they like the best, typically based on lowest hop count. As a user, you connect
to a single IP address, but based on the BGP-informed routing tables of
internet service providers your traffic could be directed to any number of
sites. You can think of it as a form of load balancing at the IP layer, but it
also has the performance benefit of users mostly connecting to nearby nodes, so
it's widely used by CDNs for multiple reasons.</p>
<p>For DNS, though, where we often have a bootstrapping problem to solve, anycast
is extremely useful as a way to handle "special" IP addresses that are used
directly. For authoritative DNS servers like 192.5.5.241 [2001:500:2f::f] [2]
(root server F) or recursive resolvers like 8.8.8.8 [2001:4860:4860::8888]
(Google public DNS), anycast is the secret that allows a "single" address to
correspond to a distributed system of nodes.</p>
<p>So there are thirteen DNS root servers in the sense that there are thirteen
independently administered clusters of root servers (with the partial exception
of A and J, both operated by Verisign, due to their acquisition of former A
operator Network Solutions). Each of the thirteen root servers is, in practice,
a fairly large number of anycast sites, sometimes over 100. The root server
operators don't share much information about their internal implementation, but
one can assume that in most cases the anycast sites consist of multiple servers
as well, fronted by some sort of redundant network appliance. There may only be
thirteen of them, but each of the thirteen is quite robust. For example, the
root servers typically place their anycast sites in major internet exchanges
distributed across both geography and provider networks. This makes it unlikely
that any small number of failures would seriously affect the number of
available sites. Even if a root server were to experience a major failure due
to some sort of administration problem, there are twelve more.</p>
<p>Why thirteen, you might ask? No good reason. The number of root servers
basically grew until the answer to an NS request for "." hit the 512 byte limit
on UDP DNS responses. Optimizations over time allowed this number to grow
(actually using single letters to identify the servers was one of these
optimizations, allowing the basic compression used in DNS responses to collapse
the matching root-servers.net part). Of course IPv6 blew DNS response sizes
completely out of the water, leading to the development of the EDNS extension
that allows for much larger responses.</p>
<p>13 is no longer the practical limit, but with how large some of the 13 are, no
one sees a pressing need to add more.  Besides, can you imagine the political
considerations in our modern internet environment? The proposed operator would
probably be Cloudflare or Google or Amazon or something and their motives would
never be trusted. Incidentally, many of the anycast sites for root server F
(operated by ISC) are Cloudflare data centers used under agreement.</p>
<p>We are, of course, currently trusting the motives of Verisign. You should never
do this! But it's been that way for a long time, we're already committed. At
least it isn't Network Solutions any more. I kind of miss when SRI was running
DNS and military remote viewing.</p>
<p>But still, there's something a little uncomfortable about the situation.
Billions of internet hosts depend on thirteen "servers" to have any functional
access to the internet.</p>
<p>What if someone attacked them? Could they take the internet down? Wouldn't this
cause a global crisis of a type seldom before seen? Should I be stockpiling DNS
records alongside my canned water and iodine pills?</p>
<p>Wikipedia contains a great piece of comedic encyclopedia writing. In its
article on the history of attacks on DNS root servers, it mentions the time, in
2012, that some-pastebin-user-claiming-to-be-Anonymous (one of the great
internet security threats of that era) threatened to "shut the Internet down".
"It may only last one hour, maybe more, maybe even a few days," the statement
continues. "No matter what, it will be global. It will be known."</p>
<p>That's the end of the section. Some Wikipedia editor, no doubt familiar with
the activities of Anonymous in 2012, apparently considered it self-evident that
the attack never happened.</p>
<p>Anonymous may not have put in the effort, but others have. There have been
several apparent DDoS attacks on the root DNS servers. One, in 2007, was
significant enough that four of the root servers suffered---but there were nine
more, and no serious impact was felt by internet users. This attack, like most
meaningful DDoS, originated with a botnet. It had its footprint primarily in
Korea, but C2 in the United States. The motivation for the attack, and who
launched it, remains unknown.</p>
<p>There is a surprisingly large industry of "booters," commercial services that,
for a fee, will DDoS a target of your choice. These tend to be operated by
criminal groups with access to large botnets; the botnets are sometimes bought
and sold and get their tasking from a network of resellers. It's a competitive
industry. In the past, booters and botnet operators have sometimes been
observed announcing a somewhat random target and taking it offline as,
essentially, a sales demonstration. Since these demonstrations are a known
behavior, any time a botnet targets something important for no discernible
reason, analysts have a tendency to attribute it to a "show of force." I have
little doubt that this is sometimes true, but as with the tendency to attribute
monumental architecture to deity worship, it might be an overgeneralization of
the motivations of botnet operators. Sometimes I wonder if they made a mistake,
or maybe they were just a little drunk and a lot bored, who is to say?</p>
<p>The problem with this kind of attribution is evident in the case of the other
significant attack on the DNS root servers, in 2015. Once again, some root
servers were impacted badly enough that they became unreliable, but other root
servers held on and there was little or even no impact to the public. This
attack, though, had some interesting properties.</p>
<p>In the 2007 incident, the abnormal traffic to the root servers consisted of
large, mostly-random DNS requests. This is basically the expected behavior of a
DNS attack; using randomly generated hostnames in requests ensures that the
responses won't be cached, making the DNS server exert more effort. Several
major botnet clients have this "random subdomain request" functionality built
in, normally used for attacks on specific authoritative DNS servers as a way to
take the operator's website offline. Chinese security firm Qihoo 360, based on
a large botnet honeypot they operate, reports that this type of DNS attack was
very popular at the time.</p>
<p>The 2015 attack was different, though! Wikipedia, like many other websites,
describes the attack as "valid queries for a single undisclosed domain name and
then a different domain the next day." In fact, the domain names were
disclosed, by at least 2016. The attack happened on two days. On the first day,
all requests were for 336901.com. The second day, all requests were for
916yy.com.</p>
<p>Contemporaneous reporting is remarkably confused on the topic of these domain
names, perhaps because they were not widely known, perhaps because few
reporters bothered to check up on them thoroughly. Many sources make it sound
like they were random domain names perhaps operated by the attacker, one goes
so far as to say that they were registered with fake identities.</p>
<p>Well, my Mandarin isn't great, and I think the language barrier is a big part
of the confusion. No doubt another part is a Western lack of familiarity with
Chinese internet culture. To an American in the security industry, 336901.com
would probably look at first like the result of a DGA or domain generation
algorithm. A randomly-generated domain used specifically to be evasive. In
China, though, numeric names like this are quite popular. Qihoo 360 is, after
all, domestically branded as just 360---360.cn.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, both domains were pretty normal Chinese websites related
to mobile games. It's difficult or maybe impossible to tell now, but it seems
reasonable to speculate that they were operated by the same company. I would
assume they were something of a gray market operation, as there's a huge
intersection between "mobile games," "gambling," and "target of DDoS attacks."
For a long time, perhaps still today in the right corners of the industry, it
was pretty routine for gray-market gambling websites to pay booters to DDoS
each other.</p>
<p>In a 2016 presentation, security researchers from Verisign (Weinberg and
Wessels) reported on their analysis of the attack based on traffic observed at
Verisign root servers. They conclude that the traffic likely originated from
multiple botnets or at least botnet clients with different configurations,
since the attack traffic can be categorized into several apparently different
types [3]. Based on command and control traffic from a source they don't disclose
(perhaps from a Verisign honeynet?), they link the attack to the common
"BillGates" [4] botnet. Most interestingly, they conclude that it was probably
not intended as an attack on the DNS root: the choice of fixed domain names
just doesn't make sense, and the traffic wasn't targeted at all root servers.</p>
<p>Instead, they suspect it was just what it looks like: an attack on the two
websites the packets queried for, that for some reason was directed at the root
servers instead of the authoritative servers for that second-level domain.
This isn't a good strategy; the root servers are a far harder target than your
average web hosting company's authoritative servers. But perhaps it was a
mistake?  An experiment to see if the root server operators might mitigate the
DDoS by dropping requests for those two domains, incidentally taking the
websites offline?</p>
<p>Remember that Qihoo 360 operates a large honeynet and was kind enough to
publish a presentation on their analysis of root server attacks. Matching
Verisign's conclusions, they link the attack to the BillGates botnet, and also
note that they often observe multiple separate botnet C2 servers send tasks
targeting the same domain names. This probably reflects the commercialized
nature of modern botnets, with booters "subcontracting" operations to multiple
botnet operators. It also handily explains Verisign's observation that the 2015
attack traffic seems to have come from more than one implementation a DNS DDoS.</p>
<p>360 reports that, on the first day, five different C2 servers tasked bots with
attacking 336901.com. On the second day, three C2 servers tasked for 916yy.com.
But they also have a much bigger revelation: throughout the time period of the
attacks, they observed multiple tasks to attack 916yy.com using several
different methods.</p>
<p>360 concludes that the 2015 DNS attack was most likely the result of a
commodity DDoS operation that decided to experiment, directing traffic at the
DNS roots instead of the authoritative server for the target to see what would
happen. I doubt they thought they'd take down the root servers, but it seems
totally reasonable that they might have wondered if the root server operators
would filter DDoS traffic based on the domain name appearing in the requests.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, they note that some of the traffic originated with a DNS attack
tool that had significant similarities to BillGates but didn't produce quite
the same packets. Likely we will never know, but a likely explanation is that
some group modified the BillGates DNS attack module or implemented a new one
based on the method used by BillGates.</p>
<p>Tracking botnets gets very confusing very fast, there are just so many
different variants of any major botnet client! BillGates originated, for
example, as a Linux botnet. It was distributed to servers, not only through SSH
but through vulnerabilities in MySQL and ElasticSearch. It was unusual, for a
time, in being a major botnet that skipped over the most common desktop
operating system. But ports of BillGates to Windows were later observed,
distributed through an Internet Explorer vulnerability---classic Windows. Why
someone chose to port a Linux botnet to Windows instead of using one of the
several popular Windows botnets (Conficker, for example) is a mystery. Perhaps
they had spent a lot of time building out BillGates C2 infrastructure and, like
any good IT operation, wanted to simplify their cloud footprint.</p>
<p>High in the wizard's tower of the internet, thirteen elders are responsible for
starting every recursive resolver on its own path to truth. There's a whole
Neal Stephenson for Wired article there. But in practice it's a large and
robust system. The extent of anycast routing used for the root DNS servers, to
say nothing of CDNs, is one of those things that challenges are typical stacked
view of the internet. Geographic load balancing is something we think of at
high layers of the system, it's surprising to encounter it as a core part of a
very low level process.</p>
<p>That's why we need to keep our thinking flexible: computers are towers of
abstraction, and complexity can be added at nearly any level, as needed or
convenient. Seldom is this more apparent than it is in any process called
"bootstrapping." Some seemingly simpler parts of the internet, like DNS, rely
on a great deal of complexity within other parts of the system, like BGP.</p>
<p>Now I'm just complaining about pedagogical use of the OSI model again.</p>
<p>[1] The fact that the DNS hierarchy is written from right-to-left while it's
routinely used in URIs that are otherwise read left-to-right is one of those
quirks of computer history. Basically an endianness inconsistency. Like
American date order, to strictly interpret a URI you have to stop and reverse
your analysis part way through. There's no particular reason that DNS is like
that, there was just less consistency over most significant first/least
significant first hierarchical ordering at the time and contemporaneous network
protocols (consider the OSI stack) actually had a tendency towards least
significant first.</p>
<p>[2] The IPv4 addresses of the root servers are ages old and mostly just a
matter of chance, but the IPv6 addresses were assigned more recently and
allowed an opportunity for something more meaningful. Reflecting the long
tradition of identifying the root servers by their letter, many root server
operators use IPv6 addresses where the host part can be written as the single
letter of the server (i.e. root server C at [2001:500:2::c]). Others chose a
host part of "53," a gesture at the port number used for DNS (i.e.  root server
J, [2001:7fe::53]). Others seem more random, Verisign uses 2:30 for both of
their root servers (i.e. root server A, [2001:503:ba3e::2:30]), so maybe that
means something to them, or maybe it was just convenient. Amusingly, the only
operator that went for what I would call an address pun is the Defense
Information Systems Agency, which put root server G at [2001:500:12::d0d].</p>
<p>[3] It really dates this story that there was some controversy around the
source IPs of the attack, originating with none other than deceased security
industry personality John McAfee. He angrily insisted that it was not plausible
that the source IPs were spoofed. Of course botnets conducting DDoS attacks via
DNS virtually always spoof the source IP, as there are few protections in place
(at the time almost none at all) to prevent it. But John McAfee has always had
a way of ginning up controversy where none was needed.</p>
<p>[4] Botnets are often bought, modified, and sold. They tend to go by various
names from different security researchers and different variants. I'm calling
this one "BillGates" because that's the funniest of the several names used for
it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>In our the last post, we built a simple coordinator and a worker that could increment a number from a client request. That simple example introduced us to scheduling tasks on workers from a compute cluster in the same style that <a href="https://fly.io/?ref=aspiring.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">fly.io</a> uses to schedule machines on their compute nodes.</p><p>But our example was really simple, workers were only available or unavailable based on whether they were already executing a task. In reality workers would have more constraints to consider like available resources (CPU, Memory, GPU, Disk), locality (cloud region), and architecture (arm, x86).</p><p>In this post, we’ll build on our previous coordinator and worker to support specifying workload locality, and how many “slots” (arbitrary compute unit) a task takes. Workers will then only be able to schedule workloads if they meet all requested conditions for an incoming scheduling request.</p><p>All code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/danthegoodman1/ComputeSchedulerPost/?ref=aspiring.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Github</a>.</p><h2 id="understanding-requirements">Understanding requirements</h2><p>When our coordinator broadcasts a task scheduling request, we’ll now include some requirements:</p><figure><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3225257-f483-4141-9319-73ef1d3852b0_1686x1206.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1456" height="1041"></figure><p>Workers comparse these requirements and respond if they can fulfill the request:</p><figure><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b41091a-10b2-4c87-b073-85cd16070366_1894x1288.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1456" height="990"></figure><p>When a worker node can’t fulfill a request, it just ignores it.</p><p>This allows us to send out scheduling requests that meet our criteria, either from the client themselves, or our own.</p><h2 id="adding-task-requirements">Adding task requirements</h2><p>The first thing we need to do is add support for different kinds of requirements: Region and Slots as mentioned before.</p><pre><code>type (
	Requirements struct {
		Region string

		// Arbitrary compute unit
		Slots int64 `validate:"required,gte=1"`
	}

	ScheduleRequest struct {
		RequestID    string
		Task         string
		Requirements Requirements
	}
)</code></pre><p>The coordinator will be aware of all possible requirements, so they can be validated and have any defaults set.</p><p>Worker nodes will handle only known resource requirements, and if they come across a requirement they don’t know about, they immediately determine they can’t fulfill the request.</p><p>That will enable us to add new requirements in the future, like GPU and architecture, without having to update all workers.</p><p>Our previous code already included the requirements in the scheduling request emitted to workers, so now we need to add support for the requirements.</p><p>We’ll add some support for new worker configuration options:</p><pre><code>var (
	REGION    = os.Getenv("REGION")
	SLOTS     = GetEnvOrDefaultInt("SLOTS", 10)
)</code></pre><p>Then, when handling a scheduling request on the worker, we can add support for keeping track of the current number of available slots, and checking we if we fulfill a scheduling request.</p><p>We start by keeping track of resources, and make sure we are able to release them:</p><pre><code>func startWorkerNode(nc *nats.Conn) {
	logger.Debug().Msgf("starting worker node %s with slots %d", utils.WORKER_ID, utils.SLOTS)

	availableSlots := atomic.NewInt64(utils.SLOTS)

	// We need a sync map to track reservations
	reservations := sync.Map{}

	releaseResources := func(requestID string) {
		slots, found := reservations.LoadAndDelete(requestID)
		if !found {
			// We didn't even have it, ignore
			return
		}
		availableSlots.Add(slots.(int64))
		logger.Debug().Msgf("worker %s released resources", utils.WORKER_ID)
	}</code></pre><p>We then check to make sure that our region matches the region of the request. We’ll also allow a request that doesn’t specify a region to be answered by any node:</p><pre><code>// Scheduling loop
_, err := nc.Subscribe("scheduling.request.*", func(msg *nats.Msg) {
    logger.Debug().Msgf("Worker %s got scheduling request, reserving resources", utils.WORKER_ID)
    var request scheduling.ScheduleRequest
    utils.JSONMustUnmarshal(msg.Data, &amp;request)

    // Check whether the region matches (if provided)
    if request.Requirements.Region != "" &amp;&amp; request.Requirements.Region != utils.REGION {
        logger.Debug().Msgf(
            "worker %s cannot fulfill request, different region",
            utils.WORKER_ID,
        )
        return
    }

    // Check whether we have enough available slots
    if request.Requirements.Slots &gt; availableSlots.Load() {
        logger.Debug().Msgf(
            "worker %s cannot fulfill request, not enough slots",
            utils.WORKER_ID,
        )
        return
    }

    // Reserve the slots
    // Note: would need better handling to protect against going negative in prod
    availableSlots.Sub(request.Requirements.Slots)
    reservations.Store(request.RequestID, request.Requirements.Slots)</code></pre><p>If we match a region, and have enough slots, we’ll then respond that are able to take the task as usual.</p><p>We’ll also release the resource reservations when we get a release message, but now we check the request ID from the reservations map:</p><pre><code>// Release loop
_, err = nc.Subscribe("scheduling.release", func(msg *nats.Msg) {
    var payload scheduling.ReleaseResourcesMessage
    utils.JSONMustUnmarshal(msg.Data, &amp;payload)
    if payload.ExemptWorker == utils.WORKER_ID {
        // We are exempt from this
        return
    }

    releaseResources(payload.RequestID)

    logger.Debug().Msgf("Worker %s releasing resources", utils.WORKER_ID)
})</code></pre><p>We’ll also release them when we complete a task:</p><pre><code>_, err = nc.Subscribe(fmt.Sprintf("scheduling.reserve_task.%s", utils.WORKER_ID), func(msg *nats.Msg) {
    // Listen for our own reservations
    
    // ... code

    // we are done, we can release resources
    releaseResources(reservation.RequestID)
})</code></pre><h2 id="testing-our-new-requirements">Testing our new requirements</h2><p>We can simply define our two workers to be in two different virtual regions, but since incrementing a number is so fast we’ll have a hard time simulating unavailable slots between requests.</p><p>To solve this, we’ll add a `SleepSec` property to our payload, and if that exists we’ll sleep for that many seconds before completing the task:</p><pre><code>if sleepSec, ok := reservation.Payload["SleepSec"].(float64); ok {
    logger.Debug().Msgf(
        "worker %s sleeping for %f seconds",
        utils.WORKER_ID,
        sleepSec,
    )
    time.Sleep(time.Second * time.Duration(sleepSec))
}</code></pre><p>Now, we can try it out!</p><p>After getting NATs running again with</p><pre><code>docker-compose up -d</code></pre><p>we’ll get our coordinator running in one terminal:</p><pre><code>go run . coordinator</code></pre><p>And in another two terminals, start two workers in different regions (we’ll leave the default 10 slots)</p><pre><code>WORKER_ID=a REGION=us-east go run . worker</code></pre><pre><code>WORKER_ID=b REGION=us-west go run . worker</code></pre><p>Then, we can submit a request to schedule:</p><pre><code>curl -d '{
  "Task": "increment",
  "Payload": {
    "Num": 1
  },
  "Requirements": {
    "Slots": 5
  }
}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8080/schedule</code></pre><p>Just as before, this randomly selects a node and schedules on it:</p><pre><code>&gt; Worker b got scheduling request, reserving resources
&gt; Got reservation on worker node b with payload {Task:increment Payload:map[Num:1] RequestID:123b6d38-1e44-4dd2-8465-371b3a3222db}</code></pre><p>We can now add a region requirement to the request to see that it now only ever gets scheduled on a specific node:</p><pre><code>curl -d '{
  "Task": "increment",
  "Payload": {
    "Num": 1
  },
  "Requirements": {
    "Slots": 5,
    "Region": "us-east"
  }
}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8080/schedule</code></pre><p>No matter what, worker b will never schedule this request:</p><pre><code>&gt; Worker b got scheduling request, reserving resources
&gt; worker b cannot fulfill request, different region</code></pre><p>And worker a will always get it:</p><pre><code>&gt; Worker a got scheduling request, reserving resources
&gt; Got reservation on worker node a with payload {Task
94-cd738a1ceaad}

# task completion
&gt; worker a released resources</code></pre><p>To test running out of slots, we can increase the slots requirement, and add a sleep:</p><pre><code>curl -d '{
  "Task": "increment",
  "Payload": {
    "Num": 1,
    "SleepSec": 4
  },
  "Requirements": {
    "Slots": 8,
    "Region": "us-east"
  }
}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8080/schedule</code></pre><pre><code>&gt; Worker a got scheduling request, reserving resources
&gt; worker a sleeping for 4.000000 seconds

# another request:
&gt; Worker a got scheduling request, reserving resources
&gt; worker a cannot fulfill request, not enough slots</code></pre><p>If we take out the region requirement, we can see that the second request will now schedule on the other node:</p><pre><code>&gt; Worker a got scheduling request, reserving resources
&gt; worker a sleeping for 4.000000 seconds

# another request:
&gt; Worker b got scheduling request, reserving resources
&gt; worker b sleeping for 4.000000 seconds</code></pre><p>We’ve now successfully added requirements to our tasks so that they can only schedule in specific regions, and when enough resources (Slots) are available on a given node.</p><p>This system can be extended to many more kinds of requirements, a short list could be:</p><ul><li>CPU arch (x86 vs arm)</li><li>GPU support (for AI inference scheduling)</li><li>Available CPU, Memory, or Disk</li><li>Physical hardware (a robot in a factory, a drone, IoT device)</li></ul><p>I also emphasize that there is a lot of “production readiness” missing from this system, and this guide is just to serve as a reference. A few things that are missing:</p><ol><li>Timeouts for temporary resource reservations (e.g. what happens if we never get a release?)</li><li>Proper error handling</li><li>Proper draining and unsubscribing of topics</li></ol><p>That wraps up this post series for now!</p><p>Maybe I’ll add a third part in the future extending the functionality even further, or build some projects off this concept (like extending <a href="https://github.com/danthegoodman1/StableInterfaces?ref=aspiring.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">StableInterfaces</a> to run on these kinds of hosts for a better DX).</p><p>Here are some more resources if you’re curious:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/danthegoodman1/ComputeSchedulerPost?ref=aspiring.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Github repo for this post series</a></li><li><a href="https://plane.dev/?ref=aspiring.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Plane.dev</a> - a sort of open source fly.io on your own infrastructure, using similar scheduling techniques</li><li><a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/?ref=aspiring.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The original fly.io artcile on their scheduler</a></li></ul><h2 id="discuss-this-post">Discuss this post!</h2><p>Check out this post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39500397&amp;ref=aspiring.dev">HackerNews</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/9t2wvy/building_fly_io_like_scheduler_with?ref=aspiring.dev">Lobste.rs</a>!</p>

<!--more-->
<p>The week before Christmas last year, I went to a mall in my hometown.</p>
<p>I wanted to buy a gift for my brother and browse through Barnes &amp; Noble. Instead I purchased a smoothie from a vendor by the escalator and an overpriced cookie from the food court. I didn’t find any Christmas presents — I found a Korn T-shirt at Hot Topic that would’ve been a solid gag gift, but it was too large. Or did I see it at Spencer’s? The stores all blended together.</p>
<p>When I returned to my car in the parking lot, after a journey through a walkway brightened by artificial lighting, I wasn’t sure if I’d been shopping for 30 minutes or an hour. I’d lost track of my surroundings and bought something I didn’t need.</p>
<p>In other words, I was an ideal customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This experience is shared by millions of shoppers every year — and it’s by design. Malls, department stores, grocery stores, and even casinos enlist tactics that cause “temporal distortion,” making us lose track of time and spend more money.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><span>A time-free fantasy zone</span></strong></h4>
<p>When designing their layouts, malls took a cue from an industry that has perfected the art of separating people from their money: casinos.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.friedmandesign.com/about.html"><strong><span>Bill Friedman</span></strong></a> probably knows more about casinos than anybody else on the planet. He’s a former gambling addict, the only person to manage two casinos on the Strip at the same time, the author of two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Casino-Management-Bill-Friedman/dp/081840311X"><span>seminal</span></a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-casinos-dominate-competition-international/dp/0942828445/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=EQ8eS&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.cf86ec3a-68a6-43e9-8115-04171136930a&amp;pf_rd_p=cf86ec3a-68a6-43e9-8115-04171136930a&amp;pf_rd_r=134-1143932-6182800&amp;pd_rd_wg=ASNZz&amp;pd_rd_r=d08f5ac8-3965-490c-97ce-fd8f048ae640&amp;ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk"><span>books</span></a> about the casino industry, and a researcher who performed empirical studies on dozens of Nevada casinos and interviewed some of the earliest casino operators in the state.</p>
<p>Friedman confirms an oft-cited detail about casinos: There are typically no clocks.</p>
<p>Back when Nevada first legalized gambling, in 1931, the casinos <em>did</em> have clocks. Over the next few years, however, the owners heard complaints from the biggest gamblers: Remove the clocks, or they’d stop coming. The reason why?</p>
<p>“[The gamblers] don’t want time,” Friedman told <em>The Hustle</em>. “They are in a fantasy and an escape world.”</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/l-_kk7oQLJXulGbScS_9fET7MRMJw4WXfVwLpgFbyJsX7sMcFUfUv8Ig5Tl151xS1-mhIED0YutL9MqsC_i875PWx_8YBFSIhtSK0AuBXXehi9WkRv-I_-LhkUt-JucTu81G2Bo__MQ1JwoCiLmsxtw" width="528" height="393" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><em>Roulette at Nevada’s New Meadows Club in 1931. (Bettmann/Getty Images)</em></p>
<p>Friedman says he and other casino operators never unlocked an innovation that caused people to gamble more (not even free alcohol, he says). But they did what they could to eliminate distractions that interfered with the gamblers’ fantasy states.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, for instance, when Friedman started managing Castaways and The Glass Slipper, he identified a major obstacle: natural light.</p>
<p>One side of the Castaways casino was covered in glass. Every morning when the sun peeked over the buildings on the Strip, the slot machines and tables emptied. Some <strong>85%-90%</strong> of customers left the gambling floor.</p>
<p>“They realized it was daytime and they had a world they had to go back to,” Friedman says.</p>
<p>Friedman bought a dark plastic covering for the glass. His security team raised it over the glass about five minutes before sunrise every morning, blocking out most of the light. The daylight exodus ceased.</p>
<p>Under Friedman’s management, Castaways and The Glass Slipper became two of Vegas’ most profitable casinos in the 1970s and 1980s. He trained his staff not to interrupt gamblers who were in the zone — if somebody earned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comps_(casino)#:~:text=Comps%20are%20complimentary%20items%20and,and%20how%20long%20they%20play."><span>a comp</span></a>, a staffer was to quickly tell them they’d like to buy them a free meal and let the customer claim it when their “fantasy” ended.</p>
<p>“You don’t disrupt,” Friedman says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Friedman shared many of his techniques in his books and as a casino consultant. Some of his top design principles included:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Intricate spacing:</strong> Low ceilings, maze-like designs, and intimate nooks for slot machines allow customers to slow down and feel a busy energy as they pass through a casino — yet still have room to carve out their own private domains by the machines.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Mundane and medium sound levels:</strong> Sensual overload and environments in which sounds bounce off interior surfaces confuse customers. Most casinos use bland, low-volume music or ambient noise — researchers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19582553/"><span>have found</span></a> that songs provide gamblers a cue of how much time has passed, a big no-no.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Monotonous design:</strong> Friedman believed that the machines and tables should be the focal point of any casino. Decor shouldn’t be so elaborate that it draws attention away from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>With the atmosphere just right, gamblers become engrossed in the game in front of them, causing their “field of consciousness to break down,” <a href="https://theses.gla.ac.uk/2173/1/1996reithphd.pdf"><span>according to sociologist<span> </span></span><span><strong><span>Gerda Reith</span></strong></span></a>.</p>
<p>“In the arena of chance, as though under the sway of a magnetic field, the passage of time freezes into repetition, space contracts, and the value that accrues to money is obliterated,” she wrote in a thesis on gambling in western society.</p>
<p><strong>Raymond Lavoie</strong>, a New Mexico State University marketing professor, <a href="https://cdspress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Raymond-V-Lavoie-Kelley-J-Main.pdf"><span>studied gamblers and flow</span></a>, a state of mind where a person is so attentive to a task they lose track of everything else, including time. He found that gamblers who entered a flow state — caused by a distraction-free environment and a focus on a stimulating task — spent more time and money gambling than those who didn’t.</p>
<p>They kept going because it felt good, so much so that despite losing more money overall they enjoyed the experience more.</p>
<p>“You’re not thinking about the future,” Lavoie says, “you’re just enjoying this moment.”</p>
<h4><strong><span>The longer you stay, the more you spend</span></strong></h4>
<p>Casinos are unique in their aim. No other industry builds a world designed to maintain a customer’s fantasy so that they continue to partake in an activity that, in the long run, advantages the house. But retailers share at least one common goal with casinos: They want to keep people inside.</p>
<p>“The goal of the retailer is to make sure that they find ways to increase the time we spend in the store, the number of items we see at the store, and end up buying not just what we came in for but ideally a few additional things,” says <strong>Vassilis Dalakas</strong>, a business professor at California State University San Marcos who has researched consumer psychology.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TkX2wuQk5t_jRxfb00yL4_4bSjLJJrjEDxJzmC0SqxEaNpsqAiO5B8CI846DTl4vXAZSzouZWlXmgN-OrEBgk7MC8tE697TUulNw1Q-cnIoIMXdmXBDreS382mFhQ5mhVGyfjD3fVqHl3JXbnqpu1P8" width="528" height="352" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Extra time in the store, in fact, can be nearly as dangerous to one’s wallet as extra time in the casino. When we shop, we have about 20 minutes before our brains lose the power to keep us from making questionable financial decisions, according to <a href="https://www.seren.bangor.ac.uk/discovery/science/2013/12/11/mri-to-understand-how-we-shop/#:~:text=The%20experiment%20works%20by%20displaying,in%20the%20shops%20every%20day."><span>researchers from Bangor University in the United Kingdom</span></a>.</p>
<p>Using MRIs to gauge “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-24995031"><span>the neural basis of decision making</span></a>,” they found that after <strong>23 minutes</strong> supermarket shoppers began using the emotional part of their brain rather than the cognitive part. That switch made it harder for people to consider costs and made them more susceptible to marketing bargains.</p>
<p>After <strong>40 minutes</strong>, their brains effectively shut down. They struggled to make any logical decisions.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Ap7nZPz8vwpIusAPBpIHsaOMouaHm-9nZEs7Rga_57DyWdTj92j481Zgb3jkRUanqrwIJs7Y0DQnKzul3cBOlk4WQykmwoLQlq6jsPiH4peTHCTUYwDHda0xlQdIEUnvSBaeQVNLk9uVDcPfzBiqhQg" width="528" height="589" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><em>The Hustle</em></p>
<p>But grocery stores face an uphill battle in persuading customers to stick around. Most people go to the grocery store knowing the items they want and trying to get out quickly. To keep shoppers around longer, grocers and other retail stores employ several tactics and design elements similar to the casino industry:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Removing distractions:</strong> There are few clocks and windows, so customers won’t be reminded of the outside world. Boring designs draw attention to the products, especially at grocery stores and discount department stores.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Building a maze:</strong> These layouts, <a href="https://thehustle.co/how-ikea-tricks-you-into-buying-more-stuff/"><span>most prominently deployed at Ikea</span></a>, force customers to move through the store slowly and see as many products as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Retail stores also use sound and music to manipulate the environment. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1251706?seq=3"><span>A study from the early 1980s</span></a> showed that slow-tempo music led to shoppers moving more slowly through the store and spending more money than if fast-tempo music played. (There wasn’t a huge difference in results between slow-tempo music and no music at all.)</p>
<p>“It’s almost mood maintenance,” says <strong>Theodore Noseworthy</strong>, a York University business professor who has studied the impacts of sound. “They’re trying to keep you in this positive state and almost in flow [so] that if you’re shopping, [you] just stay shopping.”</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iVrgVmB_DlBkToLTtBo-W5jKsGuC2DOmY4wiws86Q7MKunk07eDrGh4hBbTJ29g3J7kzI735Fl-x2OJZN45vNy8QxoPb9-9OAWMGKVZJ6zIM4i-RXFlWmv4pfwMWurhwosCuBQiNl14b3BQos6HikJ0" width="528" height="533" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><em>The Hustle</em></p>
<p>Whether it’s inside a department store or a casino, it’s now harder than ever to minimize distractions and foster a sense of lost time and place. Blame smartphones.</p>
<p>A ping from a text or email can draw a person’s eyes to a screen, giving them an instant reminder of the time and something else they could be doing.</p>
<p>“When you pull that thing out, it breaks you from that immersive environment,” Noseworthy says.</p>
<p>The good news for retailers and casinos, though, is they may soon be able to use technology to create an environment more immersive than anything we’ve seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><span>No time in the future</span></strong></h4>
<p>When I asked Lavoie, the academic who studies flow state, for another area ideal for creating flow besides casinos, he offered an immediate answer: virtual reality.</p>
<p>People who don VR headsets don’t see or hear anything other than the virtual world in front of them. If VR <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/virtual-reality-check-how-long-before-we-live-in-the-metaverse"><span>takes off</span></a>, retailers, marketers, and casino operators will use it to their advantage, building mesmerizing simulations for people to shop, buy, and gamble in.</p>
<p>There would be no human distractions, such as friends or family members telling someone it’s time to stop gambling or shopping. And there would certainly be no clocks.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about any of that,” Lavoie says. “This is infinitely better than that. It narrows your attention fully.”</p>
<p>It also sounds dystopian. But if learning about this worrisome consumer future makes you queasy, at least take comfort in knowing that it’s natural to lose track of time and space.</p>
<p>As you get older, Noseworthy reminded me, it feels like time moves faster. In reality, it’s just that most of our days are mundane and monotonous, blending together and helping us lose track of time.</p>
<p>Casinos and malls may be time warps. But so is life.</p></span>

<p dir="auto">Sounds a bit better, but it's still plain wrong: there's no concept about automating workflows, managing packages, reviewing code or tracking issues in mkdocs-material...</p>

Why listing everything with poorly generated contents? All these projects have a description on GitHub, can't that be used instead? Or maybe fetch metadata from the respective registries?</p>
<p dir="auto">I get the generated pictures, waiting for maintainers to put their logo instead, but the descriptions...</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Hallucination has been widely recognized to be a significant drawback for large language models (LLMs). There have been many works that attempt to reduce the extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far, which cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely eliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is impossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal world where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable LLM and a computable ground truth function. By employing results from learning theory, we show that LLMs cannot learn all of the computable functions and will therefore always hallucinate. Since the formal world is a part of the real world which is much more complicated, hallucinations are also inevitable for real world LLMs. Furthermore, for real world LLMs constrained by provable time complexity, we describe the hallucination-prone tasks and empirically validate our claims. Finally, using the formal world framework, we discuss the possible mechanisms and efficacies of existing hallucination mitigators as well as the practical implications on the safe deployment of LLMs.

On February 24th <small>tsmc,</small> the world’s most advanced chip producer, will open its first fabrication plant in the country. Earlier this month it announced plans for a second plant nearby.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Contrast that with the Taiwanese giant’s other big international expansion, in America. Last summer it pushed back the start of production at the first of two plants it is building in Arizona from 2024 to 2025. In January it announced that a second plant, previously scheduled to open in 2026, would not be operational until 2027 or 2028. The second was meant to produce three-nanometre (nm) chips, the most advanced currently on the market, but <small>tsmc </small>has raised the prospect that it may now be used for less cutting-edge production.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Both the Japanese and American governments are eager to expand domestic production of chips, and are seeking the help of foreign firms. So what explains the contrast between celebrations in Kumamoto and headaches in Arizona? The first point of divergence is in labour relations. A protracted spat with the Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council, an association of labour unions, over the use of Taiwanese workers to build the plants was finally resolved in December with a promise by <small>tsmc </small>to hire and train local workers. Union activism is comparatively rare in Japan: the country typically loses fewer than 10,000 days of workers’ labour each year to stoppages, compared with more than a million in America.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Helpful local partners are the second reason why <small>TSMC</small>’s experience in Japan has been smoother. Denso, a Japanese maker of car parts, and the chipmaking arm of Sony, an electronics giant, both took minority stakes in <small>TSMC</small>’s subsidiary in Japan. Earlier this month Toyota, a carmaker, invested in the venture, too. Those companies have plenty of experience pulling off big projects in their country. Helpfully, they are also the primary customers for the chips the plants will build, notes Lim Tai Wei, a researcher at the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore. In contrast, the Taiwanese firm is going it alone in Arizona, its first large project in America since the 1990s.</p><p data-component="paragraph">A final difference concerns subsidies. Both the Japanese and American governments have tempted global chipmakers with offers of grants. <small>tsmc </small>has already received money from Japan’s government, which agreed to stump up half the cost of its capital spending for the Kumamoto project. But it has yet to get any funds from America under the <small>CHIPS</small> Act passed in 2022. Disbursements of cash have been slowed by negotiations over conditions, including what profits America’s government will be entitled to, says Stephen Ezell of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think-tank based in Washington. In the meantime, the costs of building and equipping the sites have been going up. Mark Liu, <small>tsmc</small>’s outgoing chairman, said in January that the technology in its second Arizona plant would depend on the incentives on offer.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The delays could drag on. In October Gina Raimondo, America’s Commerce Secretary, warned that projects like <small>tsmc</small>’s could be held up for years by the environmental reviews required for federal funding unless they are exempted on national-security grounds. In a survey of around 200 semiconductor firms by the Bureau for Industry and Security, an American government agency, 64% named environmental rules as among their biggest regulatory problems, compared with 21% who included export controls and 18% who cited local permit and zoning laws.</p><p data-component="paragraph">There are plenty of lessons to be learned. Subsidies are effective only if they are paid, and environmental red tape in America has become excessive. Combative unions may put off foreign firms. Would-be customers should take a keener interest in the success of their suppliers. Foreign firms, for their part, must also learn to adapt to local market conditions, rather than trying to copy and paste approaches that worked at home, argues Chris Miller, a historian of the semiconductor industry at Tufts University.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Japan, meanwhile, should avoid being smug about its success. The <small>TSMC </small>plant opening in Kumamoto on February 24th will produce chips ranging in size from 12nm to 28nm, less advanced than those in the works in Arizona. For the whizziest chips, Japan is instead pinning its hopes on Rapidus, a company established in 2022 with the backing of eight of the country’s biggest firms, including the three that took a stake in <small>TSMC</small>’s subsidiary. Its goal is to mass-produce bleeding-edge 2nm chips by 2027.
