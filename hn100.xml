His eyes are open and he seems to be watching what’s happening around him.”</p><p>The assistant, who also wrote a memoir titled <em>Chomsky and Me</em> on her time working with the world-renowned thinker, provided an update in April as she wrote, “Noam has not made significant progress, I’m sorry to say.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2>Ship something every day</h2><p><strong>Edit</strong>: A better title would've been "<em>commit</em> every day <em>that you work</em>". I don't mean you should work on weekends or not take time off, and

<p>I don't feel particularly qualified to give advice (I blame imposter syndrome),

It applies both to professional software dev and personal projects.</p>
<p>You probably guessed it from the title: <strong>ship something every day</strong>.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to be a major feature or even a bug fix. It just needs to be something you can point to.</p>
<p>Why? A few reasons:</p>

<li>The dopamine rush of your code being shipped</li>
<li>Your team sees you're working<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>There's more to this than just performance reviews; with remote work, it's easy for you and co-workers to feel isolated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It encourages incremental work. Your future self and co-workers will thank you</li>
<li>Your git commit streak looks good<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Yes, people say this doesn't matter. But I'm sure people like recruiters look at GitHub profiles, and an empty page isn't a great look.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/10/intel_israeli_fab/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/10/intel_israeli_fab/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40640499">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Construction work on Intel's $25 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat, Israel, has reportedly been postponed.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mako.co.il/news-money/2024_q2/Article-78566163f330091026.htm?sCh=31750a2610f26110&amp;pId=173113802">Israeli media</a> [in Hebrew], Intel has asked an infrastructure construction firm to pause work on the project.</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>The Register</em> on Monday, the x86 giant reaffirmed its commitment to Israel, where the biz employs nearly 12,000 workers, explaining that projects of this scope have many dependencies that delay work. Which is a fancy way of saying: Yes, the project's been paused.</p>

    

<p>"Israel continues to be one of our key global manufacturing and R&amp;D sites and we remain fully committed to the region. As we've previously noted, the scope and pace of Intel's manufacturing expansion at our sites around the world depends heavily on various factors," the chip giant explained.</p>

        


        

<p>"Managing large-scale projects, especially in our industry, often involves adapting to changing timelines. Our decisions are based on business conditions, market dynamics and responsible capital management."</p>
<p>It isn't clear how long the project will remain on hold. Intel's comment regarding capital management suggests it may be stalling while figuring out how to pay for the project. Intel has relied on private equity from the likes of Brookfield Asset Management and Apollo Global Management to help <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/23/intel_asks_private_equity_firms/">finance</a> some of its fab projects.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/05/intel_gets_11b_from_apollo/">Intel gets $11B from Apollo for joint venture at Irish chip fab</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/04/intel_gelsinger_computex_keynote/">Fired-up Pat Gelsinger shoots from the lip at Qualcomm and Nvidia</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/ai_chips_driving_recovery/">Even TSMC can't cook chips fast enough to sate AI's hunger</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/13/biden_polar_chip_fab/">Biden admin shells out $120M to return chip startup to US ownership</a></li>
</ul>
<p>News of the delay comes less than six months after Intel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/27/intel_israel_fab/">revealed</a> its plans to expand fab operations in Israel. The $25 billion project was slated to receive $3.2 billion in government subsidies and "foster a more resilient global supply chain."</p>
<p>The site is one of several fab projects announced by Intel following former-VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/13/intel_ceo_pat_gelsinger/">return</a> to Chipzilla as chief exec in early 2021. To date Intel has committed to spending more than $100 billion to establish itself as the number two foundry, behind TSMC, by 2030.</p>

        

<p>The plans include fab expansions in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, and Ireland, plus new facilities in Ohio and Germany.</p>
<p>The decision to pause work on the Israeli fab – which was reportedly already under construction – comes roughly a year and a half after Intel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/18/intel_israeli_research/">abandoned</a> its plans to build a luxury research and development complex in the Israeli city of Haifa.</p>
<p>The $200 million facility was slated to include creature comforts such as outdoor sports fields, green areas, pop-up restaurants, and even a rooftop health center and spa. However, the project was later reimagined as a parking lot, with the cash redirected to fuelling Intel's foundry push. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I came across this recent video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VickyZhaoBEEAMP/videos">Vicky Zhao</a> last week and loved her brief summary of how she grew in her ability to clearly articulate ideas on the spot by getting to the point, using story structure from improv, and forcing specificty in sharp, boilerplate phrasing with clever mental models. Highly recommended watch.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vVvcK74h1Mg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>I loved it so much, I took notes. I’m sharing those here but with some other related advice for writing, reading, thinking, and decision-making folded in.  I hope you’ll find it useful as you watch, or re-watch. </p>



<h2>Get to the point</h2>



<p>Vicky Zhao recommends following the framework of “the one thing you must know about this topic is …” when you start sharing an idea.</p>



<ul>
<li>Use your language to guide your thinking before you even have chance to ramble.</li>



<li>The easiest way to get to the point is to use the word “one.”</li>



<li>Start with, “the one thing you must know about this topic is …”</li>



<li>It doesn’t have to be a groundbreaking statement. The purpose is to provide clarity and direction for you and your audience.</li>



<li>As you continue, you’ll be able to refine the initial statement.</li>
</ul>



<p>This idea is a lot like a McKinsey- or BCG-style <a href="https://slideworks.io/resources/how-to-write-action-titles-like-mckinsey">Action Title for presentations in Slide Decks</a>. An action title is like the “So what?” statement for your slide that captures the singular point and key takeaway of what your slide is all about.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Conventional title</th><th>Action title</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Survey results</td><td>Survey output indicates main root cause of churn is awareness of better value for money offering.</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly churn by customer tenure</td><td>Yearly renewal prompt found to be strong driver of churn</td></tr><tr><td>Overview of churn management initiatives</td><td>Based on current performance and required implementation efforts we have identified 11 initiatives to initiate in the short run</td></tr><tr><td>Sales in M USD and number of widgets sold</td><td>Widget market in US is estimated to be 907 mUSD with 5.1% growth p.a. but with DtC segment in decline</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Providing this at the top of a slide — just like starting with “the one thing you must know about this topic is,” — frames the whole presentation you’re making, grabs your audience right away, and helps them evaluate and understand everything you’re going to say next.</p>



<p>Lately, I’ve been doing this even in my Slack communication, leading with <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/what-does-tldr-mean/">a tl;dr</a> or something like <a href="https://iandanielstewart.com/2024/04/28/dharmesh-shahs-communication-with-flashtags/">Dharmesh Shah’s communication with Flashtags</a> and then following with a short, bullet list expansion of the statement.</p>



<p>You can also follow this framework when it’s <em>you</em> who is the audience.</p>



<p>If you’re reading a non-fiction book, follow <a href="https://iandanielstewart.com/2010/09/20/ideas-on-how-to-read-a-book/">Mortimer Adler’s advice on <em>How to Read a Book</em></a>. Read the book backwards, read the index, and skim the whole book — before you even consider reading it. This lets you absorb the main thesis, the “one thing”, and better understand the arguments to follow.</p>



<h2>Add story structure</h2>



<p>Sharing ideas in the framework of a 3-line scene will help you think on your feet and get your point across.</p>



<p><strong>Line 1</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The first line sets the scene and you already have this in place if you’re starting with “the one thing you must know about this topic is …”</li>



<li>This will put everyone on the edge of their seat eager to know more.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Line 2</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The second line adds depth and you can add depth in two ways.</li>



<li>First, you can go deeper with statements like, “What I mean by X is …” and follow up with an explanation of your “one thing.”</li>



<li>Or you can add depth by introducing a surprise — something that people wouldn’t know by staying on the surface. Introduce a “BUT the surprising thing about X is …” statement that adds a surprising wrinkle to the “one thing.” This really puts people on the edge of their seat.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Line 3</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The third line answers the question, “What’s next?” and you have two options for resolution here.</li>



<li>First, you can open the conversation with a Question, “And the question is X — discuss.” This will propel you into a discussion and contribution phase.</li>



<li>Or, you can close the conversation with an Answer by using the phrase, “And it’s because … X.”</li>
</ul>



<p>This 3-line scene framework of setting the stage, introducing a new wrinkle, and then swinging into a resolution phase follows the structure of all great storytelling. <a href="https://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/22/the-story-spine-pixars-4th-rule-of-storytelling/#google_vignette">The Story Spine</a> is a great example of what that looks like in a structure we’re all probably more familiar with.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was ______. Every day, ______. One day ______. Because of that, ______. Because of that, ______. Until finally ______.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Be specific</h2>



<p>Specificity forces articulate communicaiton.</p>



<ul>
<li>The advice above uses set phrases to introduce specificity like, “The one thing you need to know about this topic is …”, “What I mean by X is …”, “But the surprising thing about X is …”, “And the question is …”, “And it’s because … X.”</li>



<li>To practice being more specific use <a href="https://www.wealest.com/articles/via-negativa">Via Negativa</a>: talking about what something is not rather than what it is.</li>



<li>Sometimes it can be really difficult to articulate exactly what something is but it’s easier to say what it’s not.</li>



<li>When you’re on the spot and under pressure, using Via Negativa can really help you rethink what you’re trying to say, and focus in on the specific things people need to understand.</li>
</ul>



<p>This is also just great advice when you’re not on the spot and trying to check your own thinking. I’ll leave you with the advice of legendary investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger">Charlie Munger</a> here in his famous speech at Harvard in 1986, <a href="https://www.alexanderjarvis.com/how-to-guarantee-a-life-of-misery-by-charlie-munger/">How to Guarantee a Life of Misery</a>, and expanded version of Johnny Carson’s similar speech to the Harvard Class, which itself is Via Negativa in action. His recommendation to always “invert” reminds me of it most though.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What Carson did was to approach the study of how to create X by turning the question backward, that is, by studying how to create non-X. The great algebraist, Jacobi, had exactly the same approach as Carson and was known for his constant repetition of one phrase: “Invert, always invert.” It is in the nature of things, as Jacobi knew, that many hard problems are best solved only when they are addressed backward</p>

<p>I’ve also heard this expressed as a way to get to decisions faster. When people can’t decide on a several options you can promote a “bad idea” and watch people start defining better ones in answer to it. Like suggesting McDonald’s as the choice when no one can decide on a restaurant. Suddenly, people can decide pretty quickly in the moment then. 🙂 </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Written by Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR), User Privacy, Core Operating Systems (Core OS), Services Engineering (ASE), and Machine Learning and AI (AIML)</p></div><article><div><p>Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system that brings powerful generative models to iPhone, iPad, and Mac. For advanced features that need to reason over complex data with <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/introducing-apple-foundation-models">larger foundation models</a>, we created Private Cloud Compute (PCC), a groundbreaking cloud intelligence system designed specifically for private AI processing. For the first time ever, Private Cloud Compute extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud, making sure that personal user data sent to PCC isn’t accessible to anyone other than the user — not even to Apple. Built with custom Apple silicon and a hardened operating system designed for privacy, we believe PCC is the most advanced security architecture ever deployed for cloud AI compute at scale.</p>
<hr>
<p>Apple has long championed on-device processing as the cornerstone for the security and privacy of user data. Data that exists only on user devices is by definition disaggregated and not subject to any centralized point of attack. When Apple is responsible for user data in the cloud, we protect it with state-of-the-art security in our services — and for the most sensitive data, we believe <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/personal-data-in-the-cloud-is-under-siege.-end-to-end-encryption-is-our-most-powerful-defense">end-to-end encryption is our most powerful defense</a>. For cloud services where end-to-end encryption is not appropriate, we strive to process user data ephemerally or under uncorrelated randomized identifiers that obscure the user’s identity.</p>
<p>Secure and private AI processing in the cloud poses a formidable new challenge. Powerful AI hardware in the data center can fulfill a user’s request with large, complex machine learning models — but it requires unencrypted access to the user's request and accompanying personal data. That precludes the use of end-to-end encryption, so cloud AI applications have to date employed traditional approaches to cloud security. Such approaches present a few key challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud AI security and privacy guarantees are difficult to verify and enforce.</strong> If a cloud AI service states that it does not log certain user data, there is generally no way for security researchers to verify this promise — and often no way for the service provider to durably enforce it. For example, a new version of the AI service may introduce additional routine logging that inadvertently logs sensitive user data without any way for a researcher to detect this. Similarly, a perimeter load balancer that terminates TLS may end up logging thousands of user requests wholesale during a troubleshooting session.</li>
<li><strong>It’s difficult to provide runtime transparency for AI in the cloud.</strong> Cloud AI services are opaque: providers do not typically specify details of the software stack they are using to run their services, and those details are often considered proprietary. Even if a cloud AI service relied only on open source software, which is inspectable by security researchers, there is no widely deployed way for a user device (or browser) to confirm that the service it’s connecting to is running an unmodified version of the software that it purports to run, or to detect that the software running on the service has changed.</li>
<li><strong>It’s challenging for cloud AI environments to enforce strong limits to privileged access.</strong> Cloud AI services are complex and expensive to run at scale, and their runtime performance and other operational metrics are constantly monitored and investigated by site reliability engineers and other administrative staff at the cloud service provider. During outages and other severe incidents, these administrators can generally make use of highly privileged access to the service, such as via SSH and equivalent remote shell interfaces. Though access controls for these privileged, break-glass interfaces may be well-designed, it’s exceptionally difficult to place enforceable limits on them while they’re in active use. For example, a service administrator who is trying to back up data from a live server during an outage could inadvertently copy sensitive user data in the process. More perniciously, criminals such as ransomware operators routinely strive to compromise service administrator credentials precisely to take advantage of privileged access interfaces and make away with user data.</li>
</ul>
<p>When on-device computation with Apple devices such as iPhone and Mac is possible, the security and privacy advantages are clear: users control their own devices, researchers can inspect both hardware and software, runtime transparency is cryptographically assured through Secure Boot, and Apple retains no privileged access (as a concrete example, the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/data-protection-overview-secf6276da8a/web">Data Protection</a> file encryption system cryptographically prevents Apple from disabling or guessing the passcode of a given iPhone).</p>
<p>However, to process more sophisticated requests, Apple Intelligence needs to be able to enlist help from larger, more complex models in the cloud. For these cloud requests to live up to the security and privacy guarantees that our users expect from our devices, the traditional cloud service security model isn't a viable starting point. Instead, we need to bring our industry-leading device security model, for the first time ever, to the cloud.</p>
<p>The rest of this post is an initial technical overview of Private Cloud Compute, to be followed by a deep dive after PCC becomes available in beta. We know researchers will have many detailed questions, and we look forward to answering more of them in our follow-up post.</p>
<h3>Designing Private Cloud Compute</h3>
<p>We set out to build Private Cloud Compute with a set of core requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stateless computation on personal user data.</strong> Private Cloud Compute must use the personal user data that it receives exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling the user’s request. This data must never be available to anyone other than the user, not even to Apple staff, not even during active processing. And this data must not be retained, including via logging or for debugging, after the response is returned to the user. In other words, we want a strong form of stateless data processing where personal data leaves no trace in the PCC system.</li>
<li><strong>Enforceable guarantees.</strong> Security and privacy guarantees are strongest when they are entirely technically enforceable, which means it must be possible to constrain and analyze all the components that critically contribute to the guarantees of the overall Private Cloud Compute system. To use our example from earlier, it’s very difficult to reason about what a TLS-terminating load balancer may do with user data during a debugging session. Therefore, PCC must not depend on such external components for its core security and privacy guarantees. Similarly, operational requirements such as collecting server metrics and error logs must be supported with mechanisms that do not undermine privacy protections.</li>
<li><strong>No privileged runtime access.</strong> Private Cloud Compute must not contain privileged interfaces that would enable Apple’s site reliability staff to bypass PCC privacy guarantees, even when working to resolve an outage or other severe incident. This also means that PCC must not support a mechanism by which the privileged access envelope could be enlarged at runtime, such as by loading additional software.</li>
<li><strong>Non-targetability.</strong> An attacker should not be able to attempt to compromise personal data that belongs to specific, targeted Private Cloud Compute users without attempting a broad compromise of the entire PCC system. This must hold true even for exceptionally sophisticated attackers who can attempt physical attacks on PCC nodes in the supply chain or attempt to obtain malicious access to PCC data centers. In other words, a limited PCC compromise must not allow the attacker to steer requests from specific users to compromised nodes; targeting users should require a wide attack that’s likely to be detected. To understand this more intuitively, contrast it with a traditional cloud service design where every application server is provisioned with database credentials for the entire application database, so a compromise of a single application server is sufficient to access any user’s data, even if that user doesn’t have any active sessions with the compromised application server.</li>
<li><strong>Verifiable transparency.</strong> Security researchers need to be able to verify, with a high degree of confidence, that our privacy and security guarantees for Private Cloud Compute match our public promises. We already have an earlier requirement for our guarantees to be enforceable. Hypothetically, then, if security researchers had sufficient access to the system, they would be able to verify the guarantees. But this last requirement, verifiable transparency, goes one step further and does away with the hypothetical: security researchers <em>must be able to verify</em> the security and privacy guarantees of Private Cloud Compute, and they <em>must be able to verify</em> that the software that’s running in the PCC production environment is the same as the software they inspected when verifying the guarantees.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an extraordinary set of requirements, and one that we believe represents a generational leap over any traditional cloud service security model.</p>
<h3>Introducing Private Cloud Compute nodes</h3>
<p>The root of trust for Private Cloud Compute is our compute node: custom-built server hardware that brings the power and security of Apple silicon to the data center, with the same hardware security technologies used in iPhone, including the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web">Secure Enclave</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/boot-process-for-iphone-and-ipad-devices-secb3000f149/web">Secure Boot</a>. We paired this hardware with a new operating system: a hardened subset of the foundations of iOS and macOS tailored to support Large Language Model (LLM) inference workloads while presenting an extremely narrow attack surface. This allows us to take advantage of iOS security technologies such as <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/app-code-signing-process-sec7c917bf14/web">Code Signing</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/security-of-runtime-process-sec15bfe098e/web">sandboxing</a>.</p>
<p>On top of this foundation, we built a custom set of cloud extensions with privacy in mind. We excluded components that are traditionally critical to data center administration, such as remote shells and system introspection and observability tools. We replaced those general-purpose software components with components that are purpose-built to deterministically provide only a small, restricted set of operational metrics to SRE staff. And finally, we used <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/server/">Swift on Server</a> to build a new Machine Learning stack specifically for hosting <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/introducing-apple-foundation-models">our cloud-based foundation model</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take another look at our core Private Cloud Compute requirements and the features we built to achieve them.</p>
<h4>Stateless computation and enforceable guarantees</h4>
<p>With services that are end-to-end encrypted, such as iMessage, the service operator cannot access the data that transits through the system. One of the key reasons such designs can assure privacy is specifically because they prevent the service from performing computations on user data. Since Private Cloud Compute needs to be able to access the data in the user’s request to allow a large foundation model to fulfill it, complete end-to-end encryption is not an option. Instead, the PCC compute node must have technical enforcement for the privacy of user data during processing, and must be incapable of retaining user data after its duty cycle is complete.</p>
<p>We designed Private Cloud Compute to make several guarantees about the way it handles user data:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user’s device sends data to PCC for the sole, exclusive purpose of fulfilling the user’s inference request. PCC uses that data only to perform the operations requested by the user.</li>
<li>User data stays on the PCC nodes that are processing the request only until the response is returned. PCC deletes the user’s data after fulfilling the request, and no user data is retained in any form after the response is returned.</li>
<li>User data is never available to Apple — even to staff with administrative access to the production service or hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Apple Intelligence needs to draw on Private Cloud Compute, it constructs a request — consisting of the prompt, plus the desired model and inferencing parameters — that will serve as input to the cloud model. The PCC client on the user’s device then encrypts this request directly to the public keys of the PCC nodes that it has first confirmed are valid and cryptographically certified. This provides end-to-end encryption from the user’s device to the validated PCC nodes, ensuring the request cannot be accessed in transit by anything outside those highly protected PCC nodes. Supporting data center services, such as load balancers and privacy gateways, run outside of this trust boundary and do not have the keys required to decrypt the user’s request, thus contributing to our enforceable guarantees.</p>
<p>Next, we must protect the integrity of the PCC node and prevent any tampering with the keys used by PCC to decrypt user requests. The system uses Secure Boot and Code Signing for an enforceable guarantee that only authorized and cryptographically measured code is executable on the node. All code that can run on the node must be part of a trust cache that has been signed by Apple, approved for that specific PCC node, and loaded by the Secure Enclave such that it cannot be changed or amended at runtime. This also ensures that JIT mappings cannot be created, preventing compilation or injection of new code at runtime. Additionally, all code and model assets use the same integrity protection that powers the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/signed-system-volume-security-secd698747c9/web">Signed System Volume</a>. Finally, the Secure Enclave provides an enforceable guarantee that the keys that are used to decrypt requests cannot be duplicated or extracted.</p>
<p>The Private Cloud Compute software stack is designed to ensure that user data is not leaked outside the trust boundary or retained once a request is complete, even in the presence of implementation errors.  The Secure Enclave randomizes the data volume’s encryption keys on every reboot and <em>does not persist these random keys</em>, ensuring that data written to the data volume cannot be retained across reboot. In other words, there is an enforceable guarantee that the data volume is cryptographically erased every time the PCC node’s Secure Enclave Processor reboots. The inference process on the PCC node deletes data associated with a request upon completion, and the address spaces that are used to handle user data are periodically recycled to limit the impact of any data that may have been unexpectedly retained in memory.</p>
<p>Finally, for our enforceable guarantees to be meaningful, we also need to protect against exploitation that could bypass these guarantees. Technologies such as <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/operating-system-integrity-sec8b776536b/1/web/1#sec0167b469d">Pointer Authentication Codes</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/security-of-runtime-process-sec15bfe098e/1/web/1">sandboxing</a> act to resist such exploitation and limit an attacker’s horizontal movement within the PCC node. The inference control and dispatch layers are written in Swift, ensuring memory safety, and use separate address spaces to isolate initial processing of requests. This combination of memory safety and the principle of least privilege removes entire classes of attacks on the inference stack itself and limits the level of control and capability that a successful attack can obtain.</p>
<h4>No privileged runtime access</h4>
<p>We designed Private Cloud Compute to ensure that privileged access doesn’t allow anyone to bypass our stateless computation guarantees.</p>
<p>First, we intentionally did not include remote shell or interactive debugging mechanisms on the PCC node. Our Code Signing machinery prevents such mechanisms from loading additional code, but this sort of open-ended access would provide a broad attack surface to subvert the system’s security or privacy. Beyond simply not including a shell, remote or otherwise, PCC nodes cannot enable Developer Mode and do not include the tools needed by debugging workflows.</p>
<p>Next, we built the system’s observability and management tooling with privacy safeguards that are designed to prevent user data from being exposed. For example, the system doesn’t even include a general-purpose logging mechanism. Instead, only pre-specified, structured, and audited logs and metrics can leave the node, and multiple independent layers of review help prevent user data from accidentally being exposed through these mechanisms. With traditional cloud AI services, such mechanisms might allow someone with privileged access to observe or collect user data.</p>
<p>Together, these techniques provide enforceable guarantees that only specifically designated code has access to user data and that user data cannot leak outside the PCC node during system administration.</p>
<h4>Non-targetability</h4>
<p>Our threat model for Private Cloud Compute includes an attacker with physical access to a compute node and a high level of sophistication — that is, an attacker who has the resources and expertise to subvert some of the hardware security properties of the system and potentially extract data that is being actively processed by a compute node.</p>
<p>We defend against this type of attack in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>We supplement the built-in protections of Apple silicon with a hardened supply chain for PCC hardware, so that performing a hardware attack at scale would be both prohibitively expensive and likely to be discovered.</li>
<li>We limit the impact of small-scale attacks by ensuring that they cannot be used to target the data of a specific user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Private Cloud Compute hardware security starts at manufacturing, where we inventory and perform high-resolution imaging of the components of the PCC node before each server is sealed and its tamper switch is activated. When they arrive in the data center, we perform extensive revalidation before the servers are allowed to be provisioned for PCC. The process involves multiple Apple teams that cross-check data from independent sources, and the process is further monitored by a third-party observer not affiliated with Apple. At the end, a certificate is issued for keys rooted in the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web#sec293d3d1f5">Secure Enclave UID</a> for each PCC node. The user’s device will not send data to any PCC nodes if it cannot validate their certificates.</p>
<p>These processes broadly protect hardware from compromise. To guard against smaller, more sophisticated attacks that might otherwise avoid detection, Private Cloud Compute uses an approach we call <em>target diffusion</em> to ensure requests cannot be routed to specific nodes based on the user or their content.</p>
<p>Target diffusion starts with the request metadata, which leaves out any personally identifiable information about the source device or user, and includes only limited contextual data about the request that’s required to enable routing to the appropriate model. This metadata is the only part of the user’s request that is available to load balancers and other data center components running outside of the PCC trust boundary. The metadata also includes a single-use credential, based on <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9474.html">RSA Blind Signatures</a>, to authorize valid requests without tying them to a specific user. Additionally, PCC requests go through an <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9458">OHTTP relay</a> — operated by a third party — which hides the device’s source IP address before the request ever reaches the PCC infrastructure. This prevents an attacker from using an IP address to identify requests or associate them with an individual. It also means that an attacker would have to compromise both the third-party relay and our load balancer to steer traffic based on the source IP address.</p>
<p>User devices encrypt requests only for a subset of PCC nodes, rather than the PCC service as a whole. When asked by a user device, the load balancer returns a subset of PCC nodes that are most likely to be ready to process the user’s inference request — however, as the load balancer has no identifying information about the user or device for which it’s choosing nodes, it cannot bias the set for targeted users. By limiting the PCC nodes that can decrypt each request in this way, we ensure that if a single node were ever to be compromised, it would not be able to decrypt more than a small portion of incoming requests. Finally, the selection of PCC nodes by the load balancer is statistically auditable to protect against a highly sophisticated attack where the attacker compromises a PCC node as well as obtains complete control of the PCC load balancer.</p>
<h4>Verifiable transparency</h4>
<p>We consider allowing security researchers to verify the end-to-end security and privacy guarantees of Private Cloud Compute to be a critical requirement for ongoing public trust in the system. Traditional cloud services do not make their full production software images available to researchers — and even if they did, there’s no general mechanism to allow researchers to verify that those software images match what’s actually running in the production environment. (Some specialized mechanisms exist, such as Intel SGX and AWS Nitro attestation.)</p>
<p>When we launch Private Cloud Compute, we’ll take the extraordinary step of making software images of <strong>every production build of PCC publicly available for security research</strong>. This promise, too, is an enforceable guarantee: user devices will be willing to send data only to PCC nodes that can cryptographically attest to running publicly listed software. We want to ensure that security and privacy researchers can inspect Private Cloud Compute software, verify its functionality, and help identify issues — just like they can with Apple devices.</p>
<p>Our commitment to verifiable transparency includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Publishing the measurements of all code running on PCC in an append-only and cryptographically tamper-proof transparency log.</li>
<li>Making the log and associated binary software images publicly available for inspection and validation by privacy and security experts.</li>
<li>Publishing and maintaining an official set of tools for researchers analyzing PCC node software.</li>
<li>Rewarding important research findings through the <a href="https://security.apple.com/bounty/">Apple Security Bounty</a> program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every production Private Cloud Compute software image will be published for independent binary inspection — including the OS, applications, and all relevant executables, which researchers can verify against the measurements in the transparency log. Software will be published within 90 days of inclusion in the log, or after relevant software updates are available, whichever is sooner. Once a release has been signed into the log, it cannot be removed without detection, much like the log-backed map data structure used by the Key Transparency mechanism for <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-contact-key-verification/">iMessage Contact Key Verification</a>.</p>
<p>As we mentioned, user devices will ensure that they’re communicating only with PCC nodes running authorized and verifiable software images. Specifically, the user’s device will wrap its request payload key only to the public keys of those PCC nodes whose attested measurements match a software release in the public transparency log. And the same strict Code Signing technologies that prevent loading unauthorized software also ensure that all code on the PCC node is included in the attestation.</p>
<p>Making Private Cloud Compute software logged and inspectable in this way is a strong demonstration of our commitment to enable independent research on the platform. But we want to ensure researchers can rapidly get up to speed, verify our PCC privacy claims, and look for issues, so we’re going further with three specific steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll release a PCC Virtual Research Environment: a set of tools and images that simulate a PCC node on a Mac with Apple silicon, and that can boot a version of PCC software minimally modified for successful virtualization.</li>
<li>While we’re publishing the binary images of every production PCC build, to further aid research we will periodically also publish a subset of the security-critical PCC source code.</li>
<li>In a first for any Apple platform, PCC images will include the sepOS firmware and the iBoot bootloader <em>in plaintext</em>, making it easier than ever for researchers to study these critical components.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apple Security Bounty will reward research findings in the entire Private Cloud Compute software stack — with especially significant payouts for any issues that undermine our privacy claims.</p>
<h3>More to come</h3>
<p>Private Cloud Compute continues Apple’s profound commitment to user privacy. With sophisticated technologies to satisfy our requirements of stateless computation, enforceable guarantees, no privileged access, non-targetability, and verifiable transparency, we believe Private Cloud Compute is nothing short of the world-leading security architecture for cloud AI compute at scale.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing many more technical details about PCC, including the implementation and behavior behind each of our core requirements. And we’re especially excited to soon invite security researchers for a first look at the Private Cloud Compute software and our PCC Virtual Research Environment.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><p>At the 2024 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>, we introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS&nbsp;18, iPadOS&nbsp;18, and macOS&nbsp;Sequoia.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence is comprised of multiple highly-capable generative models that are specialized for our users’ everyday tasks, and can adapt on the fly for their current activity. The foundation models built into Apple Intelligence have been fine-tuned for user experiences such as writing and refining text, prioritizing and summarizing notifications, creating playful images for conversations with family and friends, and taking in-app actions to simplify interactions across apps.</p>
<p>In the following overview, we will detail how two of these models — a ~3 billion parameter on-device language model, and a larger server-based language model available with <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/">Private Cloud Compute</a> and running on Apple silicon servers — have been built and adapted to perform specialized tasks efficiently, accurately, and responsibly. These two foundation models are part of a larger family of generative models created by Apple to support users and developers; this includes a coding model to build intelligence into Xcode, as well as a diffusion model to help users express themselves visually, for example, in the Messages app. We look forward to sharing more information soon on this broader set of models.</p>
<h2>Our Focus on Responsible AI Development</h2>
<p>Apple Intelligence is designed with our core values at every step and built on a foundation of groundbreaking privacy innovations.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have created a set of Responsible AI principles to guide how we develop AI tools, as well as the models that underpin them:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Empower users with intelligent tools</span>: We identify areas where AI can be used responsibly to create tools for addressing specific user needs. We respect how our users choose to use these tools to accomplish their goals.</li>
<li><span>Represent our users</span>: We build deeply personal products with the goal of representing users around the globe authentically. We work continuously to avoid perpetuating stereotypes and systemic biases across our AI tools and models.</li>
<li><span>Design with care</span>: We take precautions at every stage of our process, including design, model training, feature development, and quality evaluation to identify how our AI tools may be misused or lead to potential harm. We will continuously and proactively improve our AI tools with the help of user feedback.</li>
<li><span>Protect privacy</span>: We protect our users' privacy with powerful on-device processing and groundbreaking infrastructure like Private Cloud Compute. We do not use our users' private personal data or user interactions when training our foundation models.</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles are reflected throughout the architecture that enables Apple Intelligence, connects features and tools with specialized models, and scans inputs and outputs to provide each feature with the information needed to function responsibly.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this overview, we provide details on decisions such as: how we develop models that are highly capable, fast, and power-efficient; how we approach training these models; how our adapters are fine-tuned for specific user needs; and how we evaluate model performance for both helpfulness and unintended harm.</p>
<figure id="figure1" aria-labelledby="figure-figure1-caption" data-aos="fade-up"><p><a href="https://mlr.cdn-apple.com/media/Fig1_Responsible_AI_8bf7727ab5.png" aria-label="Modeling overview" tabindex="-1" target="_blank"><img src="https://mlr.cdn-apple.com/media/Fig1_Responsible_AI_8bf7727ab5.png" alt="Modeling overview" loading="lazy"></a></p><figcaption id="figure-figure1-caption" aria-hidden="false">Figure 1: Modeling overview for the Apple foundation models.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Pre-Training</h2>
<p>Our foundation models are trained on <a href="https://github.com/apple/axlearn" target="_blank" aria-label="Apple's AXLearn framework - Opens in a new window" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple's AXLearn framework</a>, an open-source project we released in 2023. It builds on top of JAX and XLA, and allows us to train the models with high efficiency and scalability on various training hardware and cloud platforms, including TPUs and both cloud and on-premise GPUs. We used a combination of data parallelism, tensor parallelism, sequence parallelism, and Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) to scale training along multiple dimensions such as data, model, and sequence length.</p>
<p>We train our foundation models on licensed data, including data selected to enhance specific features, as well as publicly available data collected by our web-crawler, AppleBot. Web publishers have <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/119829">the option to opt out</a> of the use of their web content for Apple Intelligence training with a data usage control.</p>
<p>We never use our users’ private personal data or user interactions when training our foundation models, and we apply filters to remove personally identifiable information like social security and credit card numbers that are publicly available on the Internet. We also filter profanity and other low-quality content to prevent its inclusion in the training corpus. In addition to filtering, we perform data extraction, deduplication, and the application of a model-based classifier to identify high quality documents.</p>
<h2>Post-Training</h2>
<p>We find that data quality is essential to model success, so we utilize a hybrid data strategy in our training pipeline, incorporating both human-annotated and synthetic data, and conduct thorough data curation and filtering procedures. We have developed two novel algorithms in post-training: (1) a rejection sampling fine-tuning algorithm with teacher committee, and (2) a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm with mirror descent policy optimization and a leave-one-out advantage estimator. We find that these two algorithms lead to significant improvement in the model’s instruction-following quality.</p>
<h2>Optimization</h2>
<p>In addition to ensuring our generative models are highly capable, we have used a range of innovative techniques to optimize them on-device and on our private cloud for speed and efficiency. We have applied an extensive set of optimizations for both first token and extended token inference performance.</p>
<p>Both the on-device and server models use grouped-query-attention. We use shared input and output vocab embedding tables to reduce memory requirements and inference cost. These shared embedding tensors are mapped without duplications. The on-device model uses a vocab size of 49K, while the server model uses a vocab size of 100K, which includes additional language and technical tokens.</p>
<p>For on-device inference, we use low-bit palletization, a critical optimization technique that achieves the necessary memory, power, and performance requirements. To maintain model quality, we developed a new framework using LoRA adapters that incorporates a mixed 2-bit and 4-bit configuration strategy — averaging 3.5 bits-per-weight — to achieve the same accuracy as the uncompressed models.</p>
<p>Additionally, we use an interactive model latency and power analysis tool, <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/talaria">Talaria</a>, to better guide the bit rate selection for each operation. We also utilize activation quantization and embedding quantization, and have developed an approach to enable efficient Key-Value (KV) cache update on our neural engines.</p>
<p>With this set of optimizations, on iPhone 15 Pro we are able to reach time-to-first-token latency of about 0.6 millisecond per prompt token, and a generation rate of 30 tokens per second. Notably, this performance is attained before employing token speculation techniques, from which we see further enhancement on the token generation rate.</p>
<h2>Model Adaptation</h2>
<p>Our foundation models are fine-tuned for users’ everyday activities, and can dynamically specialize themselves on-the-fly for the task at hand. We utilize adapters, small neural network modules that can be plugged into various layers of the pre-trained model, to fine-tune our models for specific tasks. For our models we adapt the attention matrices, the attention projection matrix, and the fully connected layers in the point-wise feedforward networks for a suitable set of the decoding layers of the transformer architecture.</p>
<p>By fine-tuning only the adapter layers, the original parameters of the base pre-trained model remain unchanged, preserving the general knowledge of the model while tailoring the adapter layers to support specific tasks.</p>
<figure id="figure2" aria-labelledby="figure-figure2-caption" data-aos="fade-up"><figcaption id="figure-figure2-caption" aria-hidden="false">Figure 2: Adapters are small collections of model weights that are overlaid onto the common base foundation model. They can be dynamically loaded and swapped — giving the foundation model the ability to specialize itself on-the-fly for the task at hand. Apple Intelligence includes a broad set of adapters, each fine-tuned for a specific feature. It’s an efficient way to scale the capabilities of our foundation model.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We represent the values of the adapter parameters using 16 bits, and for the ~3 billion parameter on-device model, the parameters for a rank 16 adapter typically require 10s of megabytes. The adapter models can be dynamically loaded, temporarily cached in memory, and swapped — giving our foundation model the ability to specialize itself on the fly for the task at hand while efficiently managing memory and guaranteeing the operating system's responsiveness.</p>
<p>To facilitate the training of the adapters, we created an efficient infrastructure that allows us to rapidly retrain, test, and deploy adapters when either the base model or the training data gets updated. The adapter parameters are initialized using&nbsp;the accuracy-recovery adapter introduced in the Optimization section.</p>
<h2>Performance and Evaluation</h2>
<p>Our focus is on delivering generative models that can enable users to communicate, work, express themselves, and get things done across their Apple products. When benchmarking our models, we focus on human evaluation as we find that these results are highly correlated to user experience in our products. We conducted performance evaluations on both feature-specific adapters and the foundation models.</p>
<p>To illustrate our approach, we look at how we evaluated our adapter for summarization. As product requirements for summaries of emails and notifications differ in subtle but important ways, we fine-tune accuracy-recovery low-rank (LoRA) adapters on top of the palletized model to meet these specific requirements. Our training data is based on synthetic summaries generated from bigger server models, filtered by a rejection sampling strategy that keeps only the high quality summaries.</p>
<p>To evaluate the product-specific summarization, we use a set of 750 responses carefully sampled for each use case. These evaluation datasets emphasize a diverse set of inputs that our product features are likely to face in production, and include a stratified mixture of single and stacked documents of varying content types and lengths. As product features, it was important to evaluate performance against datasets that are representative of real use cases. We find that our models with adapters generate better summaries than a comparable model.</p>
<p>As part of responsible development, we identified and evaluated specific risks inherent to summarization. For example, summaries occasionally remove important nuance or other details in ways that are undesirable. However, we found that the summarization adapter did not amplify sensitive content in over 99% of targeted adversarial examples. We continue to adversarially probe to identify unknown harms and expand our evaluations to help guide further improvements.</p>
<figure id="figure3" aria-labelledby="figure-figure3-caption" data-aos="fade-up"><figcaption id="figure-figure3-caption" aria-hidden="false">Figure 3: Ratio of "good" and "poor" responses for two summarization use cases relative to all responses. Summaries are classified as "good", "neutral", "poor" given the grader's scores across five dimensions. A result is classified as "good" if all of the dimensions are good (higher is better). A result is classified as "poor" if any of the dimensions are poor (lower is better). Our models with adapters generate better summaries than a comparable model.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to evaluating feature specific performance powered by foundation models and adapters, we evaluate both the on-device and server-based models’ general capabilities. We utilize a comprehensive evaluation set of real-world prompts to test the general model capabilities. These prompts are diverse across different difficulty levels and cover major categories such as brainstorming, classification, closed question answering, coding, extraction, mathematical reasoning, open question answering, rewriting, safety, summarization, and writing.</p>
<p>We compare our models with both open-source models (Phi-3, Gemma, Mistral, DBRX) and commercial models of comparable size (GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4-Turbo)<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup>. We find that our models are preferred by human graders over most comparable competitor models. On this benchmark, our on-device model, with ~3B parameters, outperforms larger models including Phi-3-mini, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B. Our server model compares favorably to DBRX-Instruct, Mixtral-8x22B, and GPT-3.5-Turbo while being highly efficient.</p>

We find that our models are preferred by human graders.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We use a set of diverse adversarial prompts to test the model performance on harmful content, sensitive topics, and factuality. We measure the violation rates of each model as evaluated by human graders on this evaluation set, with a lower number being desirable. Both the on-device and server models are robust when faced with adversarial prompts, achieving violation rates lower than open-source and commercial models.</p>
<figure id="figure5" aria-labelledby="figure-figure5-caption" data-aos="fade-up"><figcaption id="figure-figure5-caption" aria-hidden="false">Figure 5: Fraction of violating responses for harmful content, sensitive topics, and factuality (lower is better). Our models are robust when faced with adversarial prompts.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our models are preferred by human graders as safe and helpful over competitor models for these prompts. However, considering the broad capabilities of large language models, we understand the limitation of our safety benchmark. We are actively conducting both manual and automatic red-teaming with internal and external teams to continue evaluating our models' safety.</p>

Human graders found our responses safer and more helpful.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To further evaluate our models, we use the Instruction-Following Eval (IFEval) benchmark to compare their instruction-following capabilities with models of comparable size. The results suggest that both our on-device and server model follow detailed instructions better than the open-source and commercial models of comparable size.</p>

<p>We evaluate our models’ writing ability on our internal summarization and composition benchmarks, consisting of a variety of writing instructions. These results do not refer to our feature-specific adapter for summarization (seen in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>), nor do we have an adapter focused on composition.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Apple foundation models and adapters introduced at WWDC24 underlie Apple Intelligence, the new personal intelligence system that is integrated deeply into iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and enables powerful capabilities across language, images, actions, and personal context. Our models have been created with the purpose of helping users do everyday activities across their Apple products, and developed responsibly at every stage and guided by Apple’s core values. We look forward to sharing more information soon on our broader family of generative models, including language, diffusion, and coding models.</p>

  <p>Today, we are announcing an exciting development for the Swift programming language: its migration to a dedicated GitHub organization at <a href="http://github.com/swiftlang">GitHub.com/swiftlang</a>.</p>

<p>This migration reflects the growth and maturity of the Swift community and highlights Swift’s versatility beyond Apple’s own ecosystems. Over the last decade, many inspiring individuals’ hard and creative work has elevated Swift into various creative and practical applications. With a GitHub organization dedicated to Swift, we are creating an even more conducive environment for collaboration and innovation. This change will allow Swift to expand its reach to more platforms and use cases, sparking fresh possibilities and broadening Swift’s impact across the technology landscape.</p>

<h2 id="timeline-and-initial-scope">Timeline and Initial Scope <a title="Permalink for Timeline and Initial Scope section" href="#timeline-and-initial-scope">
            <!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?--> 
          </a></h2>

<p>The migration to the <code>swiftlang</code> organization will be phased over the coming weeks and months, striking a balance between minimizing disruption and ensuring a deliberate completion. Initially, the <code>swiftlang</code> organization will include foundational elements of the Swift project, such as:</p>

<ul>

A new framework has researchers hopeful that a solution is near.</p></div><figure></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>A few centuries ago, the swirling polychromatic chaos of Jupiter’s atmosphere spawned the immense vortex that we call the Great Red Spot.</p>
<p>From the frantic firing of billions of neurons in your brain comes your unique and coherent experience of reading these words.</p>
<p>As pedestrians each try to weave their path on a crowded sidewalk, they begin to follow one another, forming streams that no one ordained or consciously chose.</p>
<p>The world is full of such emergent phenomena: large-scale patterns and organization arising from innumerable interactions between component parts. And yet there is no agreed scientific theory to explain emergence. Loosely, the behavior of a complex system might be considered emergent if it can’t be predicted from the properties of the parts alone. But when will such large-scale structures and patterns arise, and what’s the criterion for when a phenomenon is emergent and when it isn’t? Confusion has reigned. “It’s just a muddle,” said <a href="https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/">Jim Crutchfield</a>, a physicist at the University of California, Davis.</p>
<p>“Philosophers have long been arguing about emergence, and going round in circles,” said <a href="https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p22981-anil-seth">Anil Seth</a>, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex in England. The problem, according to Seth, is that we haven’t had the right tools — “not only the tools for analysis, but the tools for thinking. Having measures and theories of emergence would not only be something we can throw at data but would also be tools that can help us think about these systems in a richer way.”</p>
<p>Though the problem remains unsolved, over the past few years, a community of physicists, computer scientists and neuroscientists has been working toward a better understanding. These researchers have developed theoretical tools for identifying when emergence has occurred. And in February, <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/f.rosas">Fernando Rosas</a>, a complex systems scientist at Sussex, together with Seth and five co-authors, went further, with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09090">a framework</a> for understanding how emergence arises.</p>

<p>A complex system exhibits emergence, according to the new framework, by organizing itself into a hierarchy of levels that each operate independently of the details of the lower levels. The researchers suggest we think about emergence as a kind of “software in the natural world.” Just as the software of your laptop runs without having to keep track of all the microscale information about the electrons in the computer circuitry, so emergent phenomena are governed by macroscale rules that seem self-contained, without heed to what the component parts are doing.</p>
<p>Using a mathematical formalism called computational mechanics, the researchers identified criteria for determining which systems have this kind of hierarchical structure. They tested these criteria on several model systems known to display emergent-type phenomena, including neural networks and Game-of-Life-style cellular automata. Indeed, the degrees of freedom, or independent variables, that capture the behavior of these systems at microscopic and macroscopic scales have precisely the relationship that the theory predicts.</p>
<p>No new matter or energy appears at the macroscopic level in emergent systems that isn’t there microscopically, of course. Rather, emergent phenomena, from Great Red Spots to conscious thoughts, demand a new language for describing the system. “What these authors have done is to try to formalize that,” said <a href="https://adami.natsci.msu.edu/">Chris Adami</a>, a complex-systems researcher at Michigan State University. “I fully applaud this idea of making things mathematical.”</p>
<h2><strong>A Need for Closure</strong></h2>
<p>Rosas came at the topic of emergence from multiple directions. His father was a famous conductor in Chile, where Rosas first studied and played music. “I grew up in concert halls,” he said. Then he switched to philosophy, followed by a degree in pure mathematics, giving him “an overdose of abstractions” that he “cured” with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Rosas started thinking about the vexed question of whether the brain is a computer. Consider what goes on in your laptop. The software generates predictable and repeatable outputs for a given set of inputs. But if you look at the actual physics of the system, the electrons won’t all follow identical trajectories each time. “It’s a mess,” said Rosas. “It’ll never be exactly the same.”</p>
<p>The software seems to be “closed,” in the sense that it doesn’t depend on the detailed physics of the microelectronic hardware. The brain behaves somewhat like this too: There’s a consistency to our behaviors even though the neural activity is never identical in any circumstance.</p>
<p>Rosas and colleagues figured that in fact there are three different types of closure involved in emergent systems. Would the output of your laptop be any more predictable if you invested lots of time and energy in collecting information about all the microstates — electron energies and so forth — in the system? Generally, no. This corresponds to the case of <em>informational closure</em>: As Rosas put it, “All the details below the macro are not helpful for predicting the macro.”</p>
<p>What if you want not just to predict but to control the system — does the lower-level information help there? Again, typically no: Interventions we make at the macro level, such as changing the software code by typing on the keyboard, are not made more reliable by trying to alter individual electron trajectories. If the lower-level information adds no further control of macro outcomes, the macro level is <em>causally closed</em>: It alone is causing its own future.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="A man with gray hair stands next to an array of gadgets on a table, including a stainless-steel sphere with wires coming out of it." src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/06/JamesCrutchfield-crTonjeHessenSchei.webp"></p></div><figcaption><div><p>Jim Crutchfield, a physicist at the University of California, Davis, is shown with an underwater microphone he recently designed for recording humpback whale vocalizations, to which he is applying his pattern discovery methods in hopes of decoding the causal relationships between vocalizations.</p><p>Tonje Hessen Schei</p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>This situation is rather common. Consider, for instance, that we can use macroscopic variables like pressure and viscosity to talk about (and control) fluid flow, and knowing the positions and trajectories of individual molecules doesn’t add useful information for those purposes. And we can describe the market economy by considering companies as single entities, ignoring any details about the individuals that constitute them.</p>
<p>The existence of a useful coarse-grained description doesn’t, however, by itself define an emergent phenomenon, said Seth. “You want to say something else in terms of the relationship between levels.” Enter the third level of closure that Rosas and colleagues think is needed to complete the conceptual apparatus: <em>computational closure</em>. For this they have turned to computational mechanics, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.63.105">a discipline pioneered by Crutchfield</a>.</p>
<p>Crutchfield introduced a conceptual device called the ε- (epsilon) machine. This device can exist in some finite set of states and can predict its own future state on the basis of its current one. It’s a bit like an elevator, said Rosas; an input to the machine, like pressing a button, will cause the machine to transition to a different state (floor) in a deterministic way that depends on its past history — namely, its current floor, whether it’s going up or down and which other buttons were pressed already. Of course an elevator has myriad component parts, but you don’t need to think about them. Likewise, an ε-machine is an optimal way to represent how unspecified interactions between component parts “compute” — or, one might say, cause — the machine’s future state.</p>
<p>Computational mechanics allows the web of interactions between a complex system’s components to be reduced to the simplest description, called its causal state. The state of the complex system at any moment, which includes information about its past states, produces a distribution of possible future states. Whenever two or more such present states have the same distribution of possible futures, they are said to be in the same causal state. Our brains will never twice have exactly the same firing pattern of neurons, but there are plenty of circumstances where nevertheless we’ll end up doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Rosas and colleagues considered a generic complex system as a set of ε-machines working at different scales. One of these might, say, represent all the molecular-scale ions, ion channels and so forth that produce currents in our neurons; another represents the firing patterns of the neurons themselves; another, the activity seen in compartments of the brain such as the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The system (here the brain) evolves at all those levels, and in general the relationship between these ε-machines is complicated. But for an emergent system that is computationally closed, the machines at each level can be constructed by coarse-graining the components on just the level below: They are, in the researchers’ terminology, “strongly lumpable.” We might, for example, imagine lumping all the dynamics of the ions and neurotransmitters moving in and out of a neuron into a representation of whether the neuron fires or not. In principle, one could imagine all kinds of different “lumpings” of this sort, but the system is only computationally closed if the ε-machines that represent them are coarse-grained versions of each other in this way. “There is a nestedness” to the structure, Rosas said.</p>
<p>A highly compressed description of the system then emerges at the macro level that captures those dynamics of the micro level that matter to the macroscale behavior — filtered, as it were, through the nested web of intermediate ε-machines. In that case, the behavior of the macro level can be predicted as fully as possible using only macroscale information — there is no need to refer to finer-scale information. It is, in other words, fully emergent. The key characteristic of this emergence, the researchers say, is this hierarchical structure of “strongly lumpable causal states.”</p>
<h2><strong>Leaky Emergence</strong></h2>
<p>The researchers tested their ideas by seeing what they reveal about a range of emergent behaviors in some model systems. One is a version of a random walk, where some agent wanders around haphazardly in a network that could represent, for example, the streets of a city. A city often exhibits a hierarchy of scales, with densely connected streets within neighborhoods and much more sparsely connected streets between neighborhoods. The researchers find that the outcome of a random walk through such a network is highly lumpable. That is, the probability of the wanderer starting in neighborhood A and ending up in neighborhood B — the macroscale behavior — remains the same regardless of which streets within A or B the walker randomly traverses.</p>
<p>The researchers also considered artificial neural networks like those used in machine-learning and artificial-intelligence algorithms. Some of these networks organize themselves into states that can reliably identify macroscopic patterns in data regardless of microscopic differences between the states of individual neurons in the network. The decision of which pattern will be output by the network “works at a higher level,” said Rosas.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="A man in profile strokes a paintbrush on the chests of a man in a VR head and a manequin." src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/06/AnilSeth-crTomMedwell-1.webp"></p></div><figcaption><div><p>Anil Seth, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex who studies consciousness, conducts an experiment on perception.</p><p>Tom Medwell</p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>Would Rosas’ scheme help to understand the emergence of robust, large-scale structure in a case like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot? The huge vortex “might satisfy computational closure” Rosas said, “but we’d need to do a proper analysis before being able to claim anything.”</p>
<p>As for living organisms, they seem sometimes to be emergent but sometimes more “vertically integrated,” where microscopic changes do influence large-scale behavior. Consider, for example, a heart. Despite considerable variations in the details of which genes are being expressed, and how much, or what the concentrations of proteins are from place to place, all of our heart muscle cells seem to work in essentially the same way, enabling them to function en masse as a pump driven by coherent, macroscopic electrical pulses passing through the tissue. But it’s not always this way. While many of our genes carry mutations that make no difference to our health, sometimes a mutation — just one genetic “letter” in a DNA sequence that is “wrong” — can be catastrophic. So the independence of the macro from the micro is not complete: There is some leakage between levels. Rosas wonders if living organisms are in fact optimized by allowing for such “leaky” partial emergence — because in life, sometimes it is essential for the macro to heed the details of the micro.</p>
<h2><strong>Emergent Causes</strong></h2>
<p>Rosas’ framework could help complex systems researchers see when they can and can’t hope to develop predictive coarse-grained models. When a system meets the key requirement of being computationally closed, “you don’t lose any faithfulness by simulating the upper levels and neglecting the lower levels,” he said. But ultimately Rosas hopes an approach like his might answer some deep questions about the structure of the universe — why, for example, life seems to exist only at scales intermediate between the atomic and the galactic.</p>
<p>The framework also has implications for understanding the tricky question of cause and effect in complex and emergent systems. Traditionally, causation has been assumed to flow from the bottom up: Our choices and actions, for example, are ultimately attributed to those firing patterns of our neurons, which in turn are caused by flows of ions across cell membranes.</p>

<p>But in an emergent system, this is not necessarily so; causation can operate at a higher level independently from lower-level details. Rosas’ new computational framework seems to capture this aspect of emergence, which was also explored in earlier work. In 2013, neuroscientist <a href="https://www.psychiatry.wisc.edu/staff/tononi-giulio/">Giulio Tononi</a> of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, working with Erik Hoel and Larissa Albantakis (also at Wisconsin), <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1314922110">claimed</a> that, according to a particular measure of causal influence called effective information, the overall behavior of some complex systems is caused more at the higher than the lower levels. This is called <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/19/5/188">causal emergence</a>.</p>
<p>The 2013 work using effective information could have been just a quirk of measuring causal influence this way. But recently, Hoel and neuroscientist <a href="https://centerforsleepandconsciousness.psychiatry.wisc.edu/people/renzo-comolatti/">Renzo Comolatti</a> have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01854">shown</a> that it is not. They took 12 different measures of causal power proposed in the literature and found that with all of them, some complex systems show causal emergence. “It doesn’t matter what measure of causation you pick,” Hoel said. “We just went out into the literature and picked other people’s definitions of causation, and all of them showed causal emergence.” It would be bizarre if this were some chance quirk of all those different measures.</p>
<p>For Hoel, emergent systems are ones whose macroscale behavior has some immunity to randomness or noise at the microscale. For many complex systems, there’s a good chance you can find coarse-grained, macroscopic descriptions that minimize that noise. “It’s that minimization that lies at the heart of a good notion of emergence,” he said.</p>
<p>Tononi says that, while his approach and that of Rosas and colleagues address the same kinds of systems, they have somewhat different criteria for causal emergence. “They define emergence as being when the macro system can predict itself as much as it can be predicted from the micro level,” he said. “But we require <em>more</em> causal information at the macro level than at the micro level.”</p>

<p>The new ideas touch on the issue of free will. While hardened reductionists have argued that there can be no free will because all causation ultimately arises from interactions of atoms and molecules, free will may be rescued by the formalism of higher-level causation. If the main cause of our actions is not our molecules but the emergent mental states that encode memories, intentions, beliefs and so forth, isn’t that enough for a meaningful notion of free will? The new work shows that “there are sensible ways to think about macro-level causation that explain how agents can have a worthwhile form of causal efficacy,” Seth said.</p>
<p>Still, there remains disagreement among researchers about whether macroscopic, agent-level causation can emerge in complex systems. “I’m uncomfortable with this idea that the macroscale can drive the microscale,” said Adami. “The macroscale is just degrees of freedom that you’ve invented.” This is the sort of issue that the scheme proposed by Rosas and colleagues might help to resolve, by burrowing into the mechanics of how different levels of the system speak to one another, and how this conversation must be structured to achieve independence of the macro from the details of the levels below.</p>
<p>At this point, some of the arguments are pretty fuzzy. But Crutchfield is optimistic. “We’ll have this figured out in five or 10 years,” he said. “I really think the pieces are there.”</p>

It publishes eight scientific journals and offers prestigious awards and fellowship designations for distinguished scientists. Its meetings lend prestige to scientists who are invited to speak.</p><p>From 2017 to 2023, the ESA’s corporate partnership program brought in an estimated $1 million, based upon publicly available records.</p><p>At its meeting in 2023, scientists encountered the pervasive face of Corteva while presenting research on weighty topics that included the health of bee colonies, the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases, food insecurity, the unintended effects of pesticides, and exotic topics such as utilizing insects for food and feed in impoverished societies.</p><p>However, during hundreds of sessions on these subjects, a significant topic went missing: scholarly research on one of Corteva’s products – neonicotinoids, a factor in one of the most controversial, high-profile areas of research in entomology.</p><p>That research concerns whether the neonicotinoids that coat corn and soybean seeds – the most widely used insecticides in human history – contribute to the decline of bee colonies. Extensive <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa1190" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">research</a> during the last two decades has shown that exposure to this type of insecticide, which was introduced during the 1990s, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28593544/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">harms</a> bees’ <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1215039" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">foraging</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38468795/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">survival and immune responses</a>, as well as damages their ability to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1215025" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">reproduce</a> and survive the winters.

Only four papers and posters that examined the topic made it into the conference, out of nearly 100 papers, posters and symposia on bee science.</p><p>In some instances, according to attendees, scholars engaged in general discussions of neonicotinoids and pollinators on panels that were not dedicated to the presentation of specific papers.</p><p>Top findings of U.S. Right to Know’s review of the papers, posters, symposia and workshops at the ESA meeting:</p><ul><li>Out of nearly 100 papers and posters presented on bee science in 2023, four specifically related to the role of neonicotinoids in the declining health of bees. All four were presented by students.</li></ul><ul><li>By comparison, in 2013, scholars presented at least 19 papers on the effects of neonicotinoids on bees at the ESA meeting.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2023, 26 percent of the symposia, workshops and science policy sessions were organized by employees from the corporate sector; in most cases, those organizers were employed by agrochemical companies.</li></ul><ul><li>Also in 2023, 16 percent of panelists in symposia, workshops and science policy discussions were employed by corporations.</li></ul><p>Chris Stelzig, the executive director of the ESA, did not dispute these findings, but in a written response to questions from U.S. Right to Know, he pointed out that in a search on the term “neonic” in the conference app, the results show 30 abstracts.</p><p>Those results included the student work on the effects of neonicotinoids on bees, as well as research conducted outside bee science, into areas such as resistance to the insecticides among bed bugs and the Colorado potato beetle, effects of pesticides on burying beetles, and effects of pesticides on restoration prairie plants.</p><p>Stelzig’s response noted that the ESA “doesn’t prescribe specific topics for coverage in its conference program, nor do we track the trends in conference presentation subjects in detail.</p><p>“For any given subject within entomology, what is covered in ESA conference programs reflects the ebb and flow of interest in it among the community and the focus of research being conducted in the field.”</p><p>Several entomologists who organized panels in bee science for the conference said that they were surprised to hear that research about the effects of neonicotinoids on bees had all but vanished from the program.</p><p>While many of these scientists said that they believe neonicotinoids should be banned to protect bees, they also said that the field has shifted to an approach that accounts for multiple stressors on individual bees and hives, rather than studies of individual factors, and that the research presented at the conference reflects that way of thinking.</p><p>That approach to research tracks with the point of view of agrochemical companies, which have posited, for years, that the collapse of bee colonies has occurred as a result of multiple factors – not just neonicotinoids – despite the extensive body of research that shows the harm caused by the products in isolation.</p><p>Bayer has even produced a children’s book called <a href="https://www.bayer.com/sites/default/files/Toby-and-the-Bees-Childrens-Book.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><em>Toby and the Bees</em></a>, in which the perils of mites figure prominently, without a word about neonicotinoids.</p><p>Here is an excerpt from a <a href="https://www.bayer.com/sites/default/files/BEEINFOrmed_issue3_The_Bee_Safety_of_Neonicotinoids-1iusc0izc_0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">fact sheet</a> on bee health and neonicotinoids by Bayer:</p><div><figure><a href="https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bayer-bee-health-graphic-sharpened-resized-e1717870121790.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" width="350" height="451" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzNTAgNDUxIiB3aWR0aD0iMzUwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQ1MSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnVzcnRrLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyNCUyRjA2JTJGQmF5ZXItYmVlLWhlYWx0aC1ncmFwaGljLXNoYXJwZW5lZC1yZXNpemVkLWUxNzE3ODcwMTIxNzkwLmpwZyIgZGF0YS13PSIzNTAiIGRhdGEtaD0iNDUxIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4=" data-spai="1" alt=""></a><figcaption><em>Source: Bayer</em></figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="h-two-hundred-thousand-square-feet-dedicated-to-science-nbsp">Two hundred thousand square feet dedicated to science&nbsp;</h2><p>The ESA meeting in 2023 brought in more than 3,000 attendees and offered more than 2,000 presentations.</p><p>It was held at the Gaylord National Resort &amp; Conference Center in National Harbor, Maryland.

SCJohnson provided an auto-response that acknowledged an inquiry sent through the company’s media web page, but no one from the company responded to the inquiry.</p><p>To Chartres, who considered the corporate presence at the meeting, as well as the board members from companies and the journal editors employed by corporations, it appeared that “the entire society is captured by industry.”</p><p>“If you are the ‘largest organization in the world serving the professional and scientific needs of entomologists and individuals in related disciplines,’ ” Chartres wrote in an email, “you would expect that people in positions of authority, like the governing board and editor-in-chief of a journal on pest management to be free of conflicts of interest.</p><p>“You can essentially buy credibility and endorsement in this society if you have the money.”</p><p>For the ESA, corporations are part of the entomological community as major funders of research and employers of entomologists.</p><p>“Throughout ESA membership, programs, and publications, we seek a diversity of scientific expertise, professional backgrounds, and personal perspectives,” Stelzig’s statement said.</p><p>&nbsp;“That diversity ensures a healthy and productive mix of ideas to advance ESA’s mission and strengthen entomology as a scientific field and profession.”</p><h2 id="h-on-the-topic-of-pesticides-debate-can-turn-into-intimidation">On the topic of pesticides, debate can turn into intimidation</h2><p>In a half-dozen interviews with presenters and organizers at the ESA conference – interviews that covered one-third of the organizers of bee science panels – most of the scientists said that they perceived that this meeting was dominated by corporations, much more than smaller conferences put on by universities and groups oriented toward bee health.</p><p>(Seven of the organizers of bee science panels worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, whose communications department <a href="https://usrtk.org/bees-neonics/usda-silences-scientists/" data-wpel-link="internal">forbade its scientists from speaking</a> with U.S. Right to Know for this story.)</p><p>Not every presenter has had an easy time when talking about pesticides at the ESA meeting.</p><p>Emily May, a pollinator conservation biologist who studies pesticides for the <a href="https://xerces.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Xerces Society</a>, a Portland, Ore.-based nonprofit group, recounted facing intimidation by agrochemical industry attendees after her talk.</p><p>She spoke at the meeting about how government regulators focus on the effects of individual pesticides on pollinators without factoring in the cumulative effects of a range of chemicals.</p><p>After she spoke, she said, five people from the audience stepped up and fired off highly technical questions, such as whether she had completed indexes of cumulative effects.</p><p>“Questions came in with ‘Have you done indexes about toxicity?’ . . . They were just getting very technical in their specific pushback on approaches to looking at cumulative toxicity,” May said.</p><p>“It was like my worst-case scenario, really. It made me nervous about the next conference I presented at, to be honest. It’s hard. People wanted to make me look bad.”</p><p>The source of that onslaught of technical questions: Employees of agrochemical companies, May said.</p><p>Stelzig’s statement noted that the ESA maintains a code of conduct that prohibits harassment at its events.</p><p>“As in any scientific field—and given the diversity of expertise and perspectives across entomology—healthy, constructive debate is a natural aspect of the exchange of ideas, and it is an important part of the scientific process,” his statement said. “At ESA conferences, our <a href="https://www.entsoc.org/conduct" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">code of conduct</a> fosters civil discourse and prohibits behavior that is threatening or harassing.”&nbsp;</p><p>May said that she had expected to face an audience that drew from industry because her talk involved pesticide regulation.&nbsp;</p><p>“I knew that it was likely to have an industry audience, that it was likely to have pushback,” she said. “So I didn’t exactly go in unprepared. I knew that what I was saying was not palatable to some parts of the audience.”</p><p>Even so, it’s not an experience that she is eager to repeat.&nbsp;</p><p>“I really don’t enjoy being in that scenario personally. I will have to work my nerve back up again, to do it again,” May said.&nbsp;</p><p>She also said that it was easier to get papers on any topic into the conference when she was a graduate student. She was not surprised to hear that neonicotinoid research was exclusively presented by students at the 2023 conference.</p><p>“On the grad student side of things, there’s a whole different mix of types of research being presented,” May said. “I don’t think there’s any direction on that side of things. I remember, when I was in grad school, I could submit a talk on anything and participate in the grad student sessions. . . . It’s a very diverse set of topics.”</p><p>Scientists who organize panels and present papers differ over whether research is marginalized when it is presented by students rather than full scholars.</p><p>“It should be that way,” Krischik said. “You get a grant, you put a student under grant, and they have to present papers, because they need a job. . . . So absolutely, it should be the students doing the papers.”</p><p>On the other hand, some researchers view scholarly presentations as carrying more weight.</p><p>“In general, what I find is that students, unless they’re at the end of their Ph.D., do not have a full, complete story,” said James Nieh, professor of biology in the department of ecology, behavior and evolution at the University of California at San Diego.</p><p>“They may have less weight in giving the presentation than somebody, for example, who’s a junior professor or a postdoc, who has a full story to dedicate a talk about.”</p><h2 id="h-the-largest-organization-dedicated-to-entomology-in-the-world">The ‘largest organization dedicated to entomology in the world’</h2><p>The Entomological Society of America is based in Annapolis, Md.</p><p>Aside from its thousands of members, scientific journals and fellowships for distinguished scientists, the society offers certification study courses, leadership training and robust job listings for entomologists who are starting their careers.</p><p>If anything, the robust recruitment environment at its meetings has attracted criticism as a “pipeline to industry.”&nbsp;</p><p>Symposia at the ESA conference in 2023 included sessions called “Learn More About Industry Careers, It’s Not the Dark Side!” as well as “How I joined the pest control family” and “We’re Not the Ferengi Either.”</p><p>It’s hard to overstate the organization’s prominence in the field.</p><p>According to its 2023 annual report, the nonprofit organization holds more than $5 million in investment reserves. Its total revenue in 2023 was $6.4 million, including the $1.7 million that came from attendees of meetings as well as organizations such as exhibitors.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="338" height="331" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMzggMzMxIiB3aWR0aD0iMzM4IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjMzMSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnVzcnRrLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyNCUyRjA2JTJGRVNBLXJldmVudWUtc2hhcnBlbmVkLmpwZyIgZGF0YS13PSIzMzgiIGRhdGEtaD0iMzMxIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4=" data-spai="1" alt="" title="ESA-revenue-sharpened"></figure><p><em>Source: Entomological Society of America 2023 annual report</em></p><p>In the science world, the ESA’s meetings are as influential as its standing in the field; researchers present critical findings on hundreds of topics. Many papers relate to phenomena that threaten insect species as well as the nation’s food supply.</p><p>A glance at the group’s conference program conveys the magnitude of the research presented through the society. Here are a few of the sessions from the program in 2023:</p><ul><li>“The Impact of Climate Change on Vector-Borne Diseases: Navigating the Social and Political Landscape”</li></ul><ul><li>“Unbiased Introduction: Is it more important to prioritize honey bee or native pollinator health for long-term food security within North America?</li></ul><ul><li>“Role of Pesticides in Addressing Food Insecurity”</li></ul><ul><li>“Food for Thought: Influences of Global Policy and Implementation on Insects as Food and Feed.”</li></ul><h2 id="h-esa-can-be-very-competitive">‘ESA can be very competitive’</h2><p>Seven hundred miles from Maryland, at the Hyatt Regency in Jacksonville, Fla., the<a href="https://aapa.us.org/abrc/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> American Bee Research Conference</a> held a meeting in 2023. At that conference, 10 percent of the papers that were presented dealt specifically with the effects of neonicotinoids on bees, including one paper presented by a student. The meeting, which is dedicated exclusively to bee science, is much smaller than ESA. In some cases, scientists present the same papers at both conferences.</p><p>“We try to accommodate everyone,” said Priyadarshini Chakrabarti Basu, the secretary and treasurer of the American Association of Professional Apiculturists, which organizes the bee research conference.</p><p>Funds from the nonprofit bee resource groups that sponsored the events cover less than 10 percent of the cost of the meetings and typically consist of a few hundred dollars for food at the poster sessions.</p><p>Chakrabarti Basu has also organized panels at the ESA conference.</p><p>“ESA symposium selection can be very competitive,” she said.</p><p>Chakrabarti Basu, who is also is also an assistant professor of pollinator health and apiculture at Mississippi State University, described the system like this:</p><p>The entomological society develops themes. Then, based on those themes, organizers of symposia and workshops come up with ideas for panels. They submit applications, and, if selected, invite scientists to speak at a symposium or panel.&nbsp;</p><p>Specific topics and papers can be selected on several criteria: Whether they track with the theme; whether they satisfy diversity interests, which can include the diversity of both the scientists and their career stages; and whether the topic is relevant to the changing world.</p><p>Chakrabarti Basu has never felt that corporate sponsors influenced her work for ESA.</p><p>“A lot of these decisions are made higher up,” she said. “I’ve organized a number of symposia. I’ve organized a number of workshops. Sponsorship had no effect on what I organized.”</p><p>She and other scientists noted that the current state of the research into bee colony collapse examines multiple stressors. As a result, bee science is becoming more interdisciplinary than ever.</p><p>“If you look at a bee in the landscape,” she said, “that bee is not only facing stress from climate change. It is also facing a mite or a disease stress. Or pesticides. Or poor nutrition. So it is actually a lot of different things that are happening at the same time.”</p><p>Several scientists said that 10 years ago, the field had less of an interdisciplinary focus, and research on single stressors, such as neonicotinoids, carried more weight. At ESA’s meeting in 2013, scientists presented at least 19 papers, posters and symposia focused on the effects of neonicotinoids on bees, according to multiple keyword searches of the sessions at that meeting.</p><p>S. Hollis Woodard, an associate professor of entomology at the University of California at Riverside, said that as an editor of the journal <em>Current Opinion in Insect Science</em>, a paper on neonicotinoids needs to say something new to get in. For many researchers, the fundamental idea that pesticides are harming bees is settled science, she said.</p><p>“I think it’s not as much of a focus,” Woodard said. “To me, now, when I have someone that wants to work on a neonic study, I always say, ‘There has to be something unique and interesting.’ It can’t just be, ‘What if they disrupt something,’ because they definitely do. They disrupt so many different processes in bees.</p><p>“For a lot of us bee scientists,” she said, “we already have a verdict. They’re doing harm, and if we care about conserving bee populations, we should do what’s been done in the UK and other countries where they stopped using them.”</p><p>The topics at the 2023 ESA meeting reflect that focus on multiple stressors contributing to the decline of bee colonies.</p><p>In nearly 100 papers, posters and symposia on bee science presented by scholars, the top topics were:</p><ul><li>Bees’ thermal tolerance in a warming world, with more than 20 panels and papers on the subject</li></ul><ul><li>Habitats that improve pollinators’ survival, with 19 panels and papers</li></ul><ul><li>Bee genetics, with 14 papers, posters and symposia.</li></ul><p>Other general areas of research included foraging; social behavior; the effects of varroa mites, which harm bees’ development; and effective beekeeping practices.</p><h2 id="h-globally-neonic-research-and-citation-rates-are-increasing">Globally, neonic research and citation rates are increasing</h2><p>While some researchers and symposium organizers at the ESA may be experiencing research fatigue with neonicotinoid studies, a recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935122010544" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">review</a> of the global scientific literature, published in the journal <em>Environmental Research</em> in 2022, showed that “the increase in publications over time is significant and shows a dynamic citation pattern. It indicates a comparatively high interest in current research, with ecological issues becoming more and more the focus of international research.”</p><p>The survey, conducted by researchers at Goethe University in Frankfurt, drew on the collection of literature in the database Web of Science, and deployed multiple search terms for neonicotinoids.</p><p>It showed robust funding for research into the effects of neonicotinoids, particularly in the United States and China, and that “the publication output on neonicotinoids has increased relatively more than in biomedical science as a whole, and also that this increase shows a steady trend with higher rates in recent years.”</p><p>The researchers also counted the number of grants for research, as identified in the literature, and found that globally, funding for neonicotinoid research has steadily increased since the products were introduced during the 1990s.</p><p>Top global funders of neonicotinoid research: The Chinese government at No. 1, followed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Bayer, according to the review.</p><h2 id="h-amid-a-serious-downturn-bayer-strives-to-control-the-message">Amid a serious downturn, Bayer strives to control the message</h2><p>One group has a vested interest in keeping negative narratives about the widely used pesticides out of the public eye: The agrochemical industry.</p><p>Of the big players in the sector, executives and employees for Bayer Crop Science – the division of the health conglomerate once known as Monsanto – have repeatedly pushed back on the idea that neonicotinoids harm bees.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.bayer.com/sites/default/files/BEEINFOrmed_issue3_The_Bee_Safety_of_Neonicotinoids-1iusc0izc_0.pdf#:~:text=The%20existing%2C%20extensive%20data%20consistently%20suggests%20that%20neonicotinoids%2C,unacceptable%20risk%20to%20honey%20bees%20and%20other%20pollinators." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">company information</a> on bee safety and neonicotinoids, the company wrote that “the existing, extensive data consistently suggests that neonicotinoids, if used responsibly and in accordance with usage recommendations, do not represent an unacceptable risk to honey bees and other pollinators.”</p><p>According to Global Market Insights, a global market research and management consulting firm, the neonicotinoid pesticide market was worth an estimated $5 billion in 2023.

Bayer’s provision for the glyphosate litigation totaled $6.3 billion, as of Dec. 31, 2023, from lawsuits over Roundup, an herbicide that has been the target of more than 11,000 lawsuits because of links to cancer.</p><p>The Bayer annual report also mentioned the risk of damages from a class action suit by beekeepers in Canada who claim neonicotinoids caused losses of bee colonies and impaired the health of their bees. The plaintiffs allege Bayer and Syngenta were negligent in the design, development, marketing and sales of neonicotinoids and seek both compensatory and punitive damages. Potential damages in the suit, which is moving through the court system in Canada, could reach $400 million, according to a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/canadian-beekeepers-sue-bayer-and-syngenta-over-neonicotinoid-pesticides-1.2754441" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">report</a> by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</p><p>According to the company’s annual report, “Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously” in the suit brought by beekeepers in Canada.</p><p>Linda J. Visser, a partner in Siskinds LLP, a law firm that is representing beekeepers in Ontario in the case, said that the class covers at least 500 beekeepers in Québec and 15,000 beekeepers in Ontario. The suit, if not settled, could go to trial in two to three years.</p><p>“There’s a lot of research out there – thousands of studies – supporting the link between neonics and harms to bees,” Visser said.</p><p>“Neonics were introduced in Canada around 2006,” she said. “And shortly thereafter is when honeybee keepers started experiencing larger than normal bee die-offs. And we saw that in other jurisdictions as well. France is probably an early good example, where, once neonics got introduced in the 1990s, and shortly thereafter, they experienced large-scale bee die-offs.”</p><p>When Bayer officials discuss the claims against the company and research that’s critical of any of its products, they use words like misrepresentation and “anti-neonic attack” to describe those claims.</p><p>For example, in his message in the <a href="https://www.bayer.com/sites/default/files/2024-03/bayer-annual-report-2023.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">2023 annual report</a> for Bayer, CEO Bill Anderson reported that the company will continue to advance its message about the safety of glyphosate:</p><p>“The scientific and regulatory facts are on our side, as was demonstrated again last year, when the safety of glyphosate was confirmed by its reapproval in the European Union. We will make every effort to ensure that the plaintiff attorneys are not allowed to misrepresent these facts in court. After all, we want to invest our resources in innovation, not in the US litigation industry.”</p><p>Creating carefully crafted messaging around the company’s products has been common practice for years.</p><p>According to documents acquired by U.S. Right to Know under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, in March 2013, David Fischer, a Bayer toxicologist who is now retired, was dismissive toward research that countered Bayer’s narrative about the safety of neonicotinoids.</p><p>“I was assuming I’d write up my abstract this weekend,” Fischer wrote to a Virginia Tech scientist who was organizing a panel for the American Chemical Society, “but had to spend it instead preparing a rebuttal to the latest anti-neonic NGO attack paper – this one coming from the American Bird Conservancy.”</p><p>The Virginia FOIA documents also showed that Bayer executives aggressively worked to place their employees on conference panels that related to neonicotinoids and bee health for various organizations.</p><p>In an email in 2013, Fischer asked Mary Purcell, who is currently a national program leader at the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture, to slot in a new employee, along with himself and two others from the company.

He has not presented at ESA in decades, but he said that the conferences of big, corporate-backed organizations look substantially different from the conferences run by smaller groups.</p><p>“One of the most conspicuous differences is the hospitality suites,” Inouye said. “If it’s got a corporate sponsor, they’ll have a hospitality suite and host a reception one afternoon or evening, and provide free drinks and food for people, and that’s something that’s often out of the budgets of nonprofits.”</p><p>The big conferences also differ because of their corporate recruiting environment, he said.</p><p>At ESA, he said, “they’re trying to attract people who may, at some point, want to work for their companies and do testing for the mortality of insects, testing for the effects on the plants that they’re trying to protect.</p><p>“I guess that’s a given, that their economic interest is selling their chemical products, and your research is going to be focused on one aspect or another of those chemical products.”</p><p>In one session at the ESA conference in 2023, which was organized by a scientist from Corteva, early career attendees could review CVs and resumes from professors, government researchers and corporate scientists. It was one of several resume-building sessions.</p><p>“There’s a real direct pipeline from entomology departments into Syngenta, Bayer, Corteva,” May said.</p><p>“This conference is one of those networking opportunities where industry meets students, students meet industry, and then there’s kind of that pipeline towards, ‘Well, if you don’t want to pursue a professorship, or even if you do, come work with us.’ ”</p><p>The ESA provided this breakdown of its membership composition:</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="741" height="495" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3NDEgNDk1IiB3aWR0aD0iNzQxIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQ5NSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnVzcnRrLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyNCUyRjA2JTJGRVNBLW1lbWJlcnNoaXAtZ3JpZC5wbmciIGRhdGEtdz0iNzQxIiBkYXRhLWg9IjQ5NSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="" title="ESA-membership-grid"></figure><p>Krischik, the entomologist from the University of Minnesota, said that the large footprint of the agrochemical companies does not trouble her, because insecticides are an essential part of maintaining the food supply, and the money keeps rigorous science in the public eye. She is quick to add that in her opinion, as a researcher of neonicotinoids, the products should be banned. But she does not find the presence of the companies at the meetings overbearing.</p><p>“I don’t think the scientific meetings are run by them or overrun by them,” she said.</p><p>“You donate money, you get a perk. . . . It doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t. Without pesticides, you’re not going to eat anything.

But the image that left the biggest impression – the Corteva ad — was gone.</p><p>Then, before Memorial Day, for just a few days, the whole experience on the app changed.

Teen mental health plunged in the middle of Act II.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But as Zach and I were finishing up the revisions of the book in the fall of 2023, and Zach was running additional analyses and making additional graphs, we began to realize that there was a third act, which predated Act I and caused it: </span><em>the decline of local community, trust, and social capital. </em><span>That’s the long process charted in Robert Putnam’s 2000 masterpiece</span><em><span> </span><a href="http://bowlingalone.com/" rel="">Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community </a></em><span>and updated in his more recent book, </span><em><a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/programs/growthpolicy/upswing-how-we-came-together-century-ago-and-how-we-can-do-it" rel="">The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again.</a></em></p><p><span>Building on the country’s long-standing associational spirit, which Alexis de Tocqueville had </span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/815/815-h/815-h.htm" rel="">praised</a><span> in the 1830s, the extensive civic cooperation and institutional trust developed in the Progressive Era, and solidarity spurred by the attack on Pearl Harbor and the four-year national struggle against Germany and Japan, Americans had extraordinarily high levels of social capital in the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. Civic groups, voluntary associations, and interfamily networks thrived in this era, giving Americans a strong sense of belonging as well as an abundance of place-based community networks.</span></p><p><span>But by most measures, these local relationships began to decline starting in the mid-1960s, and accelerating afterwards. Putnam points to changes in generation as the largest cause of the decline: as the World War II cohort began to die off, the Baby Boom generation that replaced it had not shared their unifying experiences. Putnam suggests that the second largest cause of the decline was the change in communication technology that occurred in these decades as television rose to dominance and changed patterns of association on a vast scale. Jean Twenge argues that technological change is the largest single driver of generational differences, in her book, </span><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Generations/Jean-M-Twenge/9781982181611" rel="">Generations: The Real Differences Between Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers, and Silents―and What They Mean for America's Future</a><span>. Putnam and Twenge both point to the “individualizing” or “atomizing” effect of new technologies of convenience, including everything from the car to the rise of malls to television. People stopped hanging out with their neighbors and were no longer available to watch kids on their streets. They stopped shopping locally, and had less and less time to give to local institutions and associations. Family life moved decisively indoors as the television became the new family hearth. (The arrival of home air conditioning also amplified that move indoors.) Of course, these new technologies brought many benefits to consumers, but their main effect on social capital appears to have been negative.</span></p><p><span>In 1995, in </span><a href="https://www.socialcapitalgateway.org/content/paper/putnam-r-d-1995-bowling-alone-americas-declining-social-capital-journal-democracy-6-1-" rel="">the initial academic essay</a><span> that became the book, Putnam described the social-capital-destroying effects of the rise of television in terms that extend our story in </span><em>The Anxious Generation</em><span> back another generation:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Television has made our communities (or, rather, what we experience as our communities) wider and shallower. In the language of economics, electronic technology enables individual tastes to be satisfied more fully, but at the cost of the positive social externalities associated with more primitive forms of entertainment. The same logic applies to the replacement of vaudeville by the movies and now of movies by the VCR. </span><em>The new "virtual reality" helmets that we will soon don to be entertained in total isolation are merely the latest extension of this trend</em><span>. Is technology thus driving a wedge between our individual interests and our collective interests? It is a question that seems worth exploring more systematically.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In other words: Act I of the tragedy was the loss of local community (1960s to 1990s), driven in part by the atomizing and individualizing effects of a variety of technologies and other changes to society. </span><em>That loss of local community and trust in act I is one of the major reasons why Americans began to lock up their kids in the 1990s, which is Act II. </em><span>Since we now had less knowledge of or trust in the other adults in our neighborhoods, we became much less likely to let children out for unsupervised free play or just plain “hanging out” until a much later age. But just as we were doing this, in came personal computers (in the 1980s) and the wondrous internet (in the 1990s), which called out to children and teens as an attractive alternative to outdoor unsupervised physical play and exploration.</span></p><p>By 2010, with the arrival of smartphones, high-speed internet, and highly addictive social media, we were ready for Act III: The arrival of the phone-based childhood. It was during this era that Putnam’s prediction came true. We did indeed get virtual reality goggles (not “helmets”), but far more insidiously, smartphones, social media, and ever-better headphones and AirPods did indeed allow adolescents to be “entertained in total isolation.”</p><p>Zach and I have been working this new three-act story into our talks and writings over the past few months, helped along by some fortuitous discoveries and contacts.&nbsp;</p><p><span>In April, Zach came across a </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sethkaplan28_essay-children-need-neighborhoods-where-activity-7187625662784884736-jUU1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" rel="">LinkedIn post</a><span> by </span><a href="https://sethkaplan.org/" rel="">Seth Kaplan</a><span>, an author and expert on fragile states.

After reading Kaplan's book </span><em><a href="https://sethkaplan.org/" rel="">Fragile Neighborhoods</a></em><span>, which examines why neighborhood-based communities are essential to addressing many of the country’s social problems, Zach realized that many of Kaplan's insights aligned with our own.

He lived or worked in 75 countries before settling down in a small Orthodox Jewish community about an hour north of Washington, D.C. Although he was raised Jewish, Kaplan told me the faith wasn’t a central part of his identity while growing up. In fact, it isn’t even the reason he now lives in an Orthodox community. “I moved here for the lifestyle,” he says.</p><p>I laughed. I’ve always been resistant to the idea of living a religious life. It feels constraining, with too many rigid and seemingly arbitrary rules. The idea that someone would move to an Orthodox community for the lifestyle sounded, well, crazy. But as Kaplan explained his story in more detail, it began to make more sense — and it resonated with my research.</p><p>I’ve spent much of the last few years as the lead researcher for Jonathan Haidt’s recently published book “The Anxious Generation,” which explains how we’ve inadvertently deprived Gen Z (those born after 1995) of real-world community, independence, and free play, and replaced those things with smartphones and social media, contributing to a precipitous decline in their mental health. Kaplan isn’t part of the generation we’re most concerned about, but as sociologist Robert Putnam observed in his 2001 book “Bowling Alone,” the disintegration of communal life in the United States began in the 1960s as fewer adults attended religious services and civic engagement fell. The introduction of the smartphone and digital life has only exacerbated these existing problems: loneliness, lack of civic engagement, and the erosion of local communities.</p><p><span>But this disintegration of community did not happen as significantly for one subset of Americans: Religious conservatives continued attending faith services, and those adults and teens continued to engage in civic activities like</span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/esr/article/40/1/143/7140383" rel=""> volunteering</a><span> and</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/09/10/10-key-findings-about-the-religious-lives-of-u-s-teens-and-their-parents/" rel=""> youth groups</a><span> at higher rates than others. It seems that kids from conservative religious communities may have been less likely to lose their community- and free-play-based childhoods. This is the kind of childhood Kaplan wanted for his kids.</span></p><p>Kemp Mill, Md., where Kaplan lives, is not exclusively religious or Jewish, but its 1,200 Orthodox Jewish families (which are politically diverse) are especially focused on community building. The community is small enough for everyone to know one another but big enough to make sure all the amenities are there: schools, restaurants, supermarkets, synagogues, and community centers. “People are constantly doing things for each other: delivering groceries to the elderly, mentoring youth, joining park cleanups,” he says. “I wouldn’t call it volunteering. . . . It’s just what’s expected.”</p><p>His three kids live near their classmates, and there’s no shortage of neighborhood-based camps and after-school activities. He says because the neighbors trust one another, the kids go freely between houses, to the parks, or to the pizza parlor without adult supervision. The children are also expected to be contributing members of the community from an early age, from babysitting to tutoring and becoming camp counselors. “Everyone has a role.”</p><p>Kaplan’s description of his kids’ lives in their religious community strongly reflected what Haidt and I found likely to help solve the nation’s youth mental health crisis: real-world community.</p><p><span>Kaplan believes, more than anyone I have ever met, in the power of strong, tight-knit communities to solve our personal and social ills. In fact, Kaplan has become</span><a href="https://sethkaplan.org/" rel=""> one of the world’s leading experts</a><span> on what makes some societies and communities thrive and others not. He has come to believe that many of the crises we face today — the youth mental health crisis, the loneliness epidemic, the drug overdose crisis, and political polarization — can be traced back to the deterioration of local communities.</span></p><p>The more I have talked with him and members of other religious communities, and the more I have dug into the research, the more I think he might be onto something.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/community-based-childhood?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/community-based-childhood?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>That today’s youths are experiencing a mental health crisis is now common knowledge.

We used data from </span><a href="https://monitoringthefuture.org/" rel="">Monitoring the Future</a><span>, a yearly survey conducted among thousands of American high school students since 1977. The survey asks students how much they agree with these statements: “I feel I do not have much to be proud of”; “Sometimes I think I am no good at all”; “I feel that I can’t do anything right”; and “I feel that my life is not very useful.”</span></p><p>Before 2010, teens agreed with those statements at similar rates across political and religious divides, with religious conservatives slightly less likely to agree. But after 2010, the gap between religious conservatives and everyone else grew rapidly. By 2019, it became clear that secular liberals were the most likely to agree with these self-disparaging statements.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png" width="980" height="586" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:586,&quot;width&quot;:980,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ce2c341-2e5d-41d6-97ea-05a0fdae4926_980x586.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Figure 1. </strong><span>Rising “self-derogation” among American high school students by religiosity and conservatism.

Adolescents traded their flip phones for smartphones loaded with social media apps, and their play-based childhoods became disembodied and placeless phone-based childhoods. The new phone-based childhood pushes out most of teens’ real-world play and social interaction and brings young people a </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/teen-childhood-smartphone-use-mental-health-effects/677722/" rel="">variety of harms</a><span>, from loneliness and anxiety to attention fragmentation and sleep deprivation.

We often mistake social </span><em>networks</em><span> for communities. As he noted in an email to me, “An understanding of what community is has been lost to . . . people who have never experienced it. . . . Until very recently, human communities were always rooted in specific places — places imbued with meaning, places with history and a shared identity. Such communities may have constrained their members in various ways — limiting, as [author Alan] Ehrenhalt writes in ‘The Lost City,’ ‘privacy, individuality, and choice’ — but they provided ‘some anchors of stability to help us through times of . . . unsettling change.’”</span></p><p>Tight-knit communities provide a stable network of peers and adults (not just parents!) whom children can trust, collaborate with, and learn skills from. They also offer connections with supportive, trusted adults who act as guardians and mentors and can help a child through hard times during adolescence. The community features that help children thrive are much more difficult to build into the virtual world.</p><p><span>This can help us understand — beyond differences in parenting — why most secular teens across the political spectrum raced into the virtual world more quickly and stayed online longer than their religious conservative peers: They were searching for a community many felt </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563222003557" rel="">was</a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/04/third-places-meet-new-people-pandemic/629468/" rel=""> missing</a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6934089/" rel=""> from</a><a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/third-places-disappearing" rel=""> their</a><span> lives. Religious conservative teens, on the other hand, were more likely to be rooted in their real-world communities and less likely to move their lives so deeply into the virtual world, and thus less likely to have been harmed by a phone-based childhood.</span></p><p>Knowing all this, the solution becomes obvious. No, I’m not calling for everyone to fully abandon the digital world or decide to become religious and conservative. But I am saying that secular families and liberal parents may need to work harder and be more intentional about providing their children with tight-knit, real-world communities that can combat the ill effects of the immersive and addictive virtual world.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This is the key point: </span><em>Virtual networks are not sufficient replacements for real-world communities.</em></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/community-based-childhood?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/community-based-childhood?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>One common objection to the claim that real-world communities are better than virtual networks is that social media platforms offer marginalized youth many social benefits — they can find the like-minded peers they don’t have in their real-world communities.</p><p><span>Of course, that’s a good thing. This is a major advantage of the internet and, sometimes, of social media, too. However, kids from marginalized groups are also </span><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/how-girls-really-feel-about-social-media-researchreport_web_final_2.pdf" rel="">far more likely</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/opinion/social-media-inequality.html" rel="">to experience</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/12/15/teens-and-cyberbullying-2022/#:~:text=Black%20teens%20are%20about%20twice%20as%20likely,teen%20may%20be%20targeted%20with%20online%20abuse." rel="">the risks</a><span> of the phone-based childhood — from cyberbullying and predation from peers and strangers to being fed self-harm content by the platforms’ algorithms.

                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/" target="_blank">Apple Intelligence</a>, the personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that’s incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. It harnesses the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. With Private Cloud Compute, Apple sets a new standard for privacy in AI, with the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“We’re thrilled to introduce a new chapter in Apple innovation. Apple Intelligence will transform what users can do with our products — and what our products can do for our users,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Our unique approach combines generative AI with a user’s personal context to deliver truly helpful intelligence. And it can access that information in a completely private and secure way to help users do the things that matter most to them. This is AI as only Apple can deliver it, and we can’t wait for users to experience what it can do.”

                 <div>Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Whether tidying up class notes, ensuring a blog post reads just right, or making sure an email is perfectly crafted, Writing Tools help users feel more confident in their writing. With Rewrite, Apple Intelligence allows users to choose from different versions of what they have written, adjusting the tone to suit the audience and task at hand. From finessing a cover letter, to adding humor and creativity to a party invitation, Rewrite helps deliver the right words to meet the occasion. Proofread checks grammar, word choice, and sentence structure while also suggesting edits — along with explanations of the edits — that users can review or quickly accept. With Summarize, users can select text and have it recapped in the form of a digestible paragraph, bulleted key points, a table, or a list.

        <div>In Mail, staying on top of emails has never been easier. With Priority Messages, a new section at the top of the inbox shows the most urgent emails, like a same-day dinner invitation or boarding pass. Across a user’s inbox, instead of previewing the first few lines of each email, they can see summaries without needing to open a message. For long threads, users can view pertinent details with just a tap. Smart Reply provides suggestions for a quick response, and will identify questions in an email to ensure everything is answered.

        <div>Deep understanding of language also extends to Notifications. Priority Notifications appear at the top of the stack to surface what’s most important, and summaries help users scan long or stacked notifications to show key details right on the Lock Screen, such as when a group chat is particularly active. And to help users stay present in what they’re doing, Reduce Interruptions is a new Focus that surfaces only the notifications that might need immediate attention, like a text about an early pickup from daycare.

                 <div>Searching for photos and videos becomes even more convenient with Apple Intelligence. Natural language can be used to search for specific photos, such as “Maya skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt,” or “Katie with stickers on her face.” Search in videos also becomes more powerful with the ability to find specific moments in clips so users can go right to the relevant segment. Additionally, the new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.

Using language and image understanding, Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on the description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc. Users will even get song suggestions to match their memory from Apple Music. As with all Apple Intelligence features, user photos and videos are kept private on device and are not shared with Apple or anyone else.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Powered by Apple Intelligence, Siri becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri is more natural, more contextually relevant, and more personal, with the ability to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. It can follow along if users stumble over words and maintain context from one request to the next. Additionally, users can type to Siri, and switch between text and voice to communicate with Siri in whatever way feels right for the moment. Siri also has a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when Siri is active.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>To be truly helpful, Apple Intelligence relies on understanding deep personal context while also protecting user privacy. A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device. To run more complex requests that require more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>With Private Cloud Compute, Apple Intelligence can flex and scale its computational capacity and draw on larger, server-based models for more complex requests. These models run on servers powered by Apple silicon, providing a foundation that allows Apple to ensure that data is never retained or exposed.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Independent experts can inspect the code that runs on Apple silicon servers to verify privacy, and Private Cloud Compute cryptographically ensures that iPhone, iPad, and Mac do not talk to a server unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection. Apple Intelligence with Private Cloud Compute sets a new standard for privacy in AI, unlocking intelligence users can trust.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple is integrating ChatGPT access into experiences within iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, allowing users to access its expertise — as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities — without needing to jump between tools.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-is-launching-its-own-password-manager-app/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-is-launching-its-own-password-manager-app/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40636502">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">While you can already use your iCloud account to store and sync passwords across your devices, it wasn’t easy to figure out. Passwords were available from the Settings app on your Mac or iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/everything-apple-announced-wwdc-2024/">At WWDC 2024 on Monday</a>, Apple introduced the Passwords app. It will be available with the next major releases of iOS, macOS and visionOS — that is, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-unveils-ios-18-with-more-customization-options/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-unveils-macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-debuts-visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to all the features you can find in the Passwords menu today, there’s a new column on the left that lets you more easily navigate your password collection. For instance, you can view all your passwords or just Wi-Fi passwords (a new addition), passkeys or codes that aren’t related to a website or service.</p>

<p>As a reminder, iCloud Passwords already support shared passwords, verification codes and a note field for every password entry. This new app will make it easier to get started and think about using iCloud Passwords to store your sensitive information.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple on Monday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/everything-apple-announced-wwdc-2024/">at WWDC 2024</a> unveiled Apple Intelligence, its long awaited, ecosystem-wide push into generative AI. As earlier rumors suggested, the new feature is called Apple Intelligence (A.I., get it?). The company promised the feature will be built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences.</p>

<p>“Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications, and more,” CEO Tim Cook noted. “And of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It’s personal intelligence, and it’s the next big step for Apple.”</p>

	
	


<p>The company has been pushing the feature as integral to all of its various operating system offerings, including iOS, macOS and the latest, VisionOS. </p>

<p>“It has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,” Cook said. “It has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences. Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more and of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up. Together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. it’s personal intelligence. and it’s the next big step for Apple.”</p>

<p>SVP Craig Federighi added, “Apple intelligence is grounded in your personal data and context.” The feature will effectively build upon all of the personal data that users input into applications like Calendar and Maps. </p>

<p>The system is built on large language and intelligence models. Much of that processing is done locally according to the company, utilizes the latest version Apple silicon. “Many of these models run entirely on device,” Federighi claimed during the event. </p>

<p>That said, these consumer systems still have limitations. As such, some of the heavy lifting needs to be done off device in the cloud. Apple is adding Private Cloud Compute” to the offering. The back end uses services that run Apple chips, in a bid to increase privacy for this highly personal data.</p>

	
	



<p>Apple Intelligence also includes what is likely the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-gives-siri-a-makeover/">biggest update to Siri</a> since it was announced more than a decade ago. the company says the feature is “more deeply integrated” into its operating systems. In the case of iOS, that means trading the familiar Siri icon for a blue glowing border that surrounds the desktop while in use.</p>

	
	


<p>Siri is no longer just a voice interface. Apple is also adding the ability to type queries directly into the system to access its generative AI-based intelligence. It’s an acknowledgment that voice is often not the best interface for these systems. </p>

<figure><img decoding="async" width="3840" height="2160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-siri-rewrite.jpg?w=680" alt="" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-siri-rewrite.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-siri-rewrite.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-siri-rewrite.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-siri-rewrite.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-siri-rewrite.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-siri-rewrite.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-siri-rewrite.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-siri-rewrite.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px"></figure>

	
	


<p>App Intents, meanwhile, brings the ability to integrate the assistant more directly into different apps. That will start with first-party applications, but the company will also be opening up access to third parties. That addition will dramatically improve the kinds of things that Siri can do directly.</p>

<p>The offering will also open up multitasking in a profound way, allowing a kind of cross-app compatibility. That means, for instance, that users won’t have to keep switching between Calendar, Mail and Maps in order to schedule meetings, for example.</p>

<p>Apple Intelligence will be integrated into most of the company’s apps. That includes things like the ability to help compose messages inside Mail (along with third party apps) or just utilize Smart Replies to respond. This is, notably, a feature Google has offered for some time now in Gmail, and has continued to build out using its own generative AI model, Gemini.</p>

<p>The company is even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-debuts-ai-generated-bitmoji/">bringing the feature to emojis with Genmoji</a> (yep, that’s the name). The feature uses a text field to build customized emojis. Image Playground, meanwhile, is an on-device image generator that is built into apps like Messages, Keynote, Pages and Freeform. Apple is also bringing a standalone Image Playground app to iOS and opening up access to the offering via an API.</p>

<p>Image Wand, meanwhile, is a new tool for Apple Pencil that lets users circle text to create an image. Effectively it’s Apple’s take on Google’s Circle to Search, only focused on images. </p>

	
	


<p>Search has been built, as well, for content like photos and videos. The company promising more natural language searches inside of these applications. The gen AI models also make it easier to build slideshows inside of Photos, again, using natural language prompts. Apple Intelligence will be rolling out to the latest versions of its operating systems, including iOS and iPadOS 18, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-unveils-macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/visionos-can-now-make-spatial-photos-out-of-3d-images/">visionOS 2</a>. It’s available for free with those updates.</p>

<p>The feature will be coming to iPhone 15 Pro and M1 Mac and iPad devices. The standard iPhone 15 will not be getting the feature, likely owing to limitations of the chip.</p>

<p>As expected, Apple also announced a partnership with OpenAI that brings ChatGPT to offerings like Siri. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-brings-chatgpt-to-its-apps-including-siri/">The GPT 4.0-powered feature</a> utilizes that company’s image and text generation. The offering will give users access without having to sign up for an account or pay a fee (though, they can still upgrade to premium).</p>

<p>That’s arriving for iOS, iPadOS and macOS later this year. The company says it also be bringing integration to other third-party LLMs, though didn’t offer much detail. It seems likely that Google’s Gemini is near the top of that list.</p>

<p>App Review has <a href="https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1799647652134654045">rejected a submission</a> from the developers of <a href="https://getutm.app/">UTM</a>, a generic PC system emulator for iPhone and iPad. </p>



<p>The open source app was submitted to the store, given the recent rule change that allows retro game console emulators, like Delta or Folium. App Review rejected UTM, deciding that a “PC is not a console”. What is more surprising, is the fact that UTM says that Apple is also blocking the app from being listed in third-party app stores in the EU.</p>



<p>As written in the App Review Guidelines, Rule 4.7 covers “mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins and game emulators”. </p>



<p>UTM says Apple refused to notarize the app because of the violation of rule 4.7, as that is included in Notarization Review Guidelines. However, the App Review Guidelines page disagrees. It does not annotate rule 4.7 as being part of the Notarization Review Guidelines. Indeed, if you select the “Show Notarization Review Guidelines Only” toggle, rule 4.7 is greyed out as not being applicable.</p>



<p>It’s therefore unclear if the Apple reviewers for UTM were incorrect in asserting the application was not suitable for distribution by third-party app stores in the EU. </p>



<p>However, as it stands, UTM is not proceeding to contest the ruling. As apps distributed on iOS cannot use a JIT compiler (other than specially entitled alternative browser engines), the functionality and performance of the emulators running through UTM SE, the version submitted for review that had JIT disabled, was significantly impaired. UTM says getting UTM SE approved “isn’t worth fighting for”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>UTM for iOS will continue to be available using older ‘grey market’ sideloading methods for open source software, such as compiling and installing the app manually via Xcode. UTM for Mac is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-virtual-machines/id1538878817">available in the Mac App Store</a>.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/everything-apple-announced-wwdc-2024/">WWDC 2024</a> in Cupertino, Apple announced updates to visionOS, the operating system running on the Vision Pro.</p>

<p>The upgraded visionOS — visionOS 2 — brings with it productivity enhancements and “new immersive experiences,” as Apple describes them. One lets you “spatialize” photos from regular photos, leveraging AI and machine learning tech to turn photos into interactive experiences. Another is a new navigation option: visionOS 2 lets you switch to the home screen by just tapping, or flip your hand over to pull up the control center with access to notifications, shortcuts and more.</p>

	
	


<p>visionOS 2 adds train support to the travel mode feature on the Vision Pro. And Apple says that later this year, it’ll deliver higher-display resolution and sizes for the Mac virtual display capability (plus mice pairing support), which allows Vision Pro users to see the content on a connected Mac within an immersive desktop view.</p>

<p>visionOS 2 will also make it easier for developers to make apps for the Vision Pro, which Apple says has around 2,000 native apps so far. There are new volumetric APIs that allow for two apps at once, a new dev kit called TabletopKit for games on flat surfaces (e.g. board games) and new enterprise APIs.</p>

<p>In related news, Apple announced Apple Immersive Video, its 180-degree 8K video format for the Vision Pro, is getting new content partners. Red Bull is doing a sports series, and Apple has a new scripted feature coming, as well. Apple’s also working with partners like Canon and BlackMagic to make more hardware and workflow integrations to capture and create immersive programming, the company says.</p>

<p>visionOS 2 will come to Vision Pro as a free update in late 2024.</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>The rules are the same as normal tic-tac-toe, but each square has a different probability of a good (smiley face), neutral (meh face), or bad (frowny face) event happening when selected.</p>

<p>Good events place your mark (X or O) in the square. Bad events place your opponent’s mark. Neutral events do nothing but pass the turn to the opponent.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about the role of random chance in our lives. Which of our successes can we take credit for and which do we owe to luck? And even when things seem clear-cut, what about all the other factors we have no control over? The parents we’re born to, societal power structures, the meteor that killed the dinosaurs - so many past events have an invisible impact on each new action we take. So what gives us the right to claim responsibility for our victories? Do we ever truly win? Or do we just get lucky sometimes?</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with the children’s game embedded into this blog post?</p>

<p>Well, in any given game of Probabilistic Tic-Tac-Toe you can do everything right and still lose (or do everything wrong and win.) However, the better player always rises to the top over time. These are characteristics that I find interesting about a lot of other games, and I thought they’d be fun to apply to an otherwise boring, solved game like tic-tac-toe. They’re also highly relevant to my life philosophy - that every outcome is effectively random, but our actions can often skew the odds in our favor. Bad breaks are inevitable, but good judgment is always rewarded (eventually, and given enough chances.)</p>

<p>If there’s an optimal, human-executable strategy for this game, it’s not immediately obvious to me. A computer could probably do an exhaustive search and play optimally, but the AI I implemented is only based on simple heuristics. Over 10k trials it beat a completely random actor about 70% of the time. Over ~50 trials I beat the AI about 60% of the time.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p><em>This is a very long post for people who want a lot of details. If you want the shorter story of how I plan to avoid these mistakes at Otherbranch, look </em><a href="https://www.otherbranch.com/blog/rebooting-something-like-triplebyte"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Discussion on Hacker News </em><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40634774" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3>It's a long story</h3><p>It's been a year and a half now since I was at the helm of a dying company.</p><p>I've had a lot of time to think.</p><p>My name is Rachel. I joined Triplebyte in 2018 as a random ops employee; after a few other roles I eventually became Triplebyte's head of product for its last two years. I'm also the founder here at Otherbranch.</p><p>I'm writing this retrospective for three reasons.</p><p>First, <a href="https://www.otherbranch.com/blog/rebooting-something-like-triplebyte"><strong>I’m trying to bring something like it back</strong></a> (if the website didn’t tip you off). And to try again, <em>I personally</em> need to understand why Triplebyte failed. I want to avoid those failure modes, and that means I need to know what they were and how to avoid them. Writing about them is a way to demand enough clarity and rigor from myself to publish something for the world.</p><p>Second, Triplebyte was, at one time, a company with an excellent brand delivering a well-liked product. Many people have asked me, both professionally and personally, why a product that had such a good reputation with engineers would abandon the product they loved - or how such an apparently-healthy product would fail. I'd like to answer that question as well as I can.</p><p>And third, I'd like to offer a peek into the realities and difficulties of business for readers who may never have faced such challenges themselves. I don’t mean to offer an excuse for our (or my) failures, nor for the many failures - both moral and tactical - made by businesses in general. But if you want to do business better, you need to <em>understand</em> business better, or at least as well as those who do it today. You have to know why those failures exist before you can avoid them. And I'd like to put some of that knowledge out into the public consciousness.</p><h3><strong>What was Triplebyte?</strong></h3><p><em>(I suggest reading this section even if you’re familiar with Triplebyte, since a lot of things changed over time.)</em></p><p>Triplebyte was a technical recruiting company for software engineers.</p><p>It came with an impressive founding pedigree. The founders were Harj Taggar, the first non-founding partner at<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator" rel="noopener"> Y Combinator</a>, and Ammon Bartram and Guillaume Luccisano, both engineers themselves. Ammon and Guillaume had previously co-founded and sold social-video company<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialcam" rel="noopener"> SocialCam</a> with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Kan" rel="noopener"> Justin Kan</a>, himself best known for founding gaming site<a href="http://twitch.tv/" rel="noopener"> Twitch.tv</a> (its original name, justin.tv, is derived from his name). Triplebyte was funded by Y Combinator (and by their extended investment arm, YC Continuity) throughout its history, along with other major Silicon Valley investors.</p><p>Triplebyte sat at the intersection of two things that are central to tech culture: a(n at least nominally) meritocratic culture of testing and statistical rigor, and the problem of hiring good software engineers. It grew up alongside the rise of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_bootcamp" rel="noopener"> coding bootcamps</a>, growing skepticism about higher education (I think we might have done a podcast with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case_Against_Education" rel="noopener"> Bryan Caplan</a> once? it would certainly be on brand), and a huge boom in Silicon Valley investment driven by low interest rates and the wild success of Uber, Airbnb, and others.</p><p>The idea was this: if higher-education and prestigious experience weren't reliable sources of quality, and if you could make an ML model that could identify it better through testing, you could find great engineers who'd be missed by the usual resume screens. Then, because top engineering talent is <em>enormously</em> competitive, companies would be willing to pay for this newly-unearthed talent in a way that would result in a viable business.</p><p><em>(You may notice the double-vision here between "this is a good business opportunity" and "this is a meritocratic moral good". This pairing would become a defining feature of Triplebyte's culture. Like most organizations, the former often won out, but unlike many organizations the latter was not merely an excuse for the former. We really did struggle with that a lot.)</em></p><p>Over the eight years it existed, Triplebyte operated four main products. Some of their names changed over time, but I’ll call them by these names:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>FastTrack</strong>. Engineering candidates would take a quiz, followed by an interview with Triplebyte's engineers. If they passed both, we would introduce them to companies on the promise that those companies would skip them to onsite interviews. FastTrack emphasized speed, an elite cohort of engineers, and white-glove service. This was our main product from the founding of Triplebyte through 2019, then faded into a secondary role in 2020 before ultimately being shut down in 2021. (This is the product we're most heavily drawing on here at Otherbranch.)</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Source</strong>. Source was described internally as “LinkedIn for engineers”. The idea was to take the candidate pool we’d built up through years of the FastTrack product and create a network of skills-verified engineers that we could sell access to as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaaS</a> product. Source emphasized volume and scalability. This was our main product in 2020-2021.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Screen</strong>. Screen began as a growth experiment. The idea was that we’d give companies access to our quizzes for free, as long as we could ask candidates to sign up for a Triplebyte account afterward. This proved very popular with companies. Screen was never monetized meaningfully (although we did occasionally charge for it to get companies to use it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blatant violation</a> of all economic sense). instead, it was meant to bring in candidates to create a valuable candidate database. It became our primary growth avenue in early 2021 and remained so for the remainder of Triplebyte’s history.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Magnet</strong>. Magnet was an automated sourcing tool built on Source’s infrastructure. We would set up campaigns on behalf of companies hiring through us, and Magnet would message candidates automatically (transparently; they knew they were automated) with potential leads. Magnet emphasized signal quality and lack of required effort from both employers and engineers. Magnet was our main product in 2022 as a last effort before we ran out of runway.</p></li></ul><p>So. With the preliminaries out of the way, why did we fail?</p><h4><strong>We never solved candidate acquisition at scale</strong></h4><p>Companies usually don't fail for a single reason. But if I had to pick one, this would be it.</p><p>Recruiting firms work best when they're working with candidates that are hard to hire. Great engineers, in particular, are hard to hire (and were harder to acquire in 2018 than in 2024) because there are always fewer of them than the market wants - or rather, that's the case for the <em>experienced, skilled, US-based</em> engineers that most US companies are trying to hire. The candidates we most needed to acquire were, by nature, the hardest candidates <em>to</em> acquire.</p><p><em>Some</em> companies (the companies I intend to focus on myself) do want smart people who don’t have much of a resume. But that list is not very long, and (as we’ll see in a moment), Triplebyte wasn’t and couldn’t be satisfied with such a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TAM</a>. So in practice, seniority mattered a lot. This was especially true after we pivoted from FastTrack to Source, deemphasizing high-touch quality and emphasizing pay-for-access. No one wanted to pay for access to a pool that didn't come pre-filled with the people they already knew they wanted to hire (as opposed to the ones we could tell them they should consider).</p><p>During the 2010s free-money tech boom (senior, US-based, credentialed) engineers did not have trouble finding a job if they wanted one. The slow-motion tech implosion (nice name for a band) of 2022-2023 changed this dynamic, with a glut of engineers on the market after layoffs and company failures, but that wasn't the case for most of Triplebyte's history (and likely will not be the case in the future, at least not until/unless AI meaningfully replaces a large percentage of engineers). For Triplebyte, that meant that convincing sought-after engineers to use Triplebyte instead of their many alternatives was a core problem. And <strong>we never succeeded at doing that at scale.</strong></p><p>Even though early Triplebyte had a well-known and well-liked brand (particularly in the early FastTrack era), and even though we could identify talent the market would otherwise ignore, neither of those things was bringing in enough candidates for Triplebyte to grow at the rate expected of a venture-backed startup.</p><p>Instead, the vast majority of candidates in the FastTrack era - roughly three-quarters - came in from ad campaigns. Any engineer active on Reddit from 2016-2018 is no doubt familiar with Triplebyte Mike (our growth-guy-turned-erstwhile-mascot). Our ad channels saturated to the point that<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/againstTriplebyteMike/" rel="noopener"> organic (hopefully-tongue-in-cheek!) hate subreddits</a> developed purely because people were sick of hearing about us. For all that people loved FastTrack as a product (and people really did), ad spend dominated word of mouth by almost an order of magnitude.</p><p>Worse, ad spend doesn't scale well: each marginal dollar you spend on ads gives you less value than the last. Harj, one of the founders and the CEO at the time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtzUo6vL3Iw&amp;t=473s" rel="noopener">talked about it for YC</a> as part of a series on mistakes startups make. We scaled ad spend to maintain a targeted growth rate, but this became less and less effective as ads ran into greater and greater diminishing returns. And when those diminishing returns came home to roost, we had no other means by which to scale.</p><p>In short, FastTrack was a viable product at moderate scale (on the order of $10M in revenue a year), but it didn’t have a path to growth. Or at least, it didn't have a path to the kind of growth expected of a VC-backed company in 2018.</p><p>Which brings us to…</p><h4><strong>The catch-22 of venture capital</strong></h4><p>In the days following the pivot from FastTrack to Source, a common lament among engineers was "ugh, another company ruining a viable and valuable business in favor of pursuing growth". The word "<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/" rel="noopener">enshittification</a>" hadn't been popularized yet, but if it had been, that’s the word people would have used. And it would have been (in a broad sense, at least) the <em>right</em> word to use.</p><p>But what I think might be hard to understand from the outside is that (in an appropriate sense) we <em>didn't</em> have a viable business. Yes, it was financially break-even, at times even profitable, even with little focus on optimizing ops costs. Yes, we had a pretty good brand. Yes, engineers loved us and companies liked us. But to understand why it wasn't viable at low-mid-scale, you have to consider how we <em>got</em> to that state in the first place.</p><p>Triplebyte was and is widely known among software engineers. But for all that I'd love to believe that that was because of the wonderful quality of our product, it realistically wasn't. It was ads. A great product can get you a great brand <em>image</em>, but it doesn't create that kind of brand <em>awareness</em> quickly. The overwhelming ad spend described in the previous section made sure it was almost impossible to <em>avoid</em> hearing about us.</p><p>Why were we able to buy those ads? Because investors <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/triplebyte-raises-35m-to-help-engineers-escape-the-bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave us a lot of money</a>.</p><p>And why do investors give companies a lot of money? On the expectation that they will pursue aggressive growth, not stop at small to middling scale. (This is somewhat less true today than it was in 2015, but it is still mostly true.)</p><p>In short: <strong>if you needed venture capital to produce a viable small-scale business, you didn't really have a viable small-scale business to begin with</strong>. Triplebyte's break-even status was an illusion, predicated on funding that would probably never have existed if that scale were the founders' only ambition.</p><p>I’ll be honest here and say that I don’t know what the ratio of investor pressure to founder ambition was in the decision to pivot to a new product. My personal belief, based on my knowledge of the people involved, is that there was almost certainly at least a little of both. And it's a little hard to separate them - a VC doesn't have to exert any deliberate pressure for an ambitious founder to know that their future chances of funding depend on their success.</p><p>This isn't a shot at venture capitalists. I have <em>plenty</em> of grievances with venture capital and the anticompetitive or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40421669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robber-baron-ish practices</a> it often creates. There's a reason this section starts with a link to Cory Doctorow. But expecting founders to deliver what they implicitly or explicitly promised is not one of those grievances.</p><p>None of Triplebyte's founders were fools. Harj was actually from Y Combinator itself; Ammon and Guillaume had founded a company before. All three were <em>very</em> familiar with the way venture-backed business is done. They knew exactly what they were getting into and went into it with open eyes, and I do not place any blame on any of them for that. Their ambition was to build a large and disruptive company that would change the way an entire industry is run. And ambition is not evil, even though it often justifies things that are.</p><p>There is nothing inherently wrong with shooting for the moon, even if your rocket blows up halfway. That is literally how we <em>got</em> to the moon.</p><p>But regardless, Triplebyte as defined by FastTrack sat in that catch-22: we needed venture funds to create a viable company, but that viable company did not satisfy investors' growth targets. And in that sense, we did not have a viable company in the first place.</p><p>That meant a pivot to a direction with better growth potential. Unfortunately…</p><h4><strong>We pivoted to a product no one wanted</strong></h4><p>"LinkedIn For Engineers" - that was the by-phrase within Triplebyte for most of 2020 as we shifted into the Source era.</p><p>Job searching on LinkedIn sucks! (True.) Engineers hate LinkedIn! (Often true.) So if we just make a LinkedIn that doesn't suck (uh-oh), everyone should want to use us instead!</p><p>I present it here in a somewhat comedic tone, but this wasn't a ridiculous idea on the face of it. We didn't need to worry about the <a href="https://andrewchen.com/how-to-solve-the-cold-start-problem-for-social-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cold-start problem</a> (because we already had a bunch of users on both sides of the hiring process) and we were competing against an incumbent people don't like. Again, none of Triplebyte's leadership were stupid, and they didn’t pick that direction arbitrarily.</p><p>Conventional wisdom, and wisdom within the company at the time, was that if you want to disrupt an incumbent, you need to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener">step function</a> better. The claim was that our skill assessments and our engineer-specific functions could accomplish that. And, again, this wasn't crazy. Our assessments <em>were</em> very, very good. That part wasn’t wrong.</p><p>But the problem was that we couldn’t just be a step function better at <em>something</em>. That can work for a company just starting out (and in fact it’s standard advice for making a great startup), but we were a growth-stage Series B company with a nine-figure valuation. We needed to be a step function better <em>at the core value proposition</em> <em>of our space</em>. And <strong>the core value proposition of LinkedIn isn't "we make finding a job easy and pleasant". It’s "we have all the jobs and all the candidates".</strong> One of the other members of Triplebyte's leadership later on understood this very well, and spent a good chunk of a year trying to get it through my thick skull.</p><p>No one wanted another LinkedIn, because LinkedIn had already perfected its we-have-all-the-jobs-and-all-the-candidates value prop. FastTrack-era Triplebyte had niches LinkedIn couldn't match, but Source-era post-pivot Triplebyte largely lost them.</p><p>Nor was there any particular reason for engineers to seek us out. We’d lost the claim to unlock opportunity, the claim to expedience and convenience for senior engineers, and the claim of human help from a team of friendly and supportive people. We’d lost all the things that (insofar as they ever had) made engineers seek us out. So they didn't. For the remainder of Triplebyte's lifetime, activity on the platform, and value delivered to both candidates and company clients, would be heavily dominated by candidates who had used Triplebyte during the early FastTrack days. This would remain true even years later, when FastTrack candidates were outnumbered three-to-one and were years removed from signing up. Candidates from the FastTrack era were more than an order of magnitude more active up until the very last time I looked at our analytics.</p><p>If you want one reason I'm starting a company inspired by FastTrack: that's it. That's what <a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product-market fit</a> feels like. We broke the thing they loved, pissed them off with anti-privacy decisions, failed to deliver much of any value for years, and they <em>still</em> had so much loyalty to what we'd done for them in the past that they were still our best users.</p><p>Ultimately, the late-Triplebyte product that <em>did</em> partially succeed - Magnet - succeeded by breaking away from the LinkedIn-for-engineers mold and trying to do something fundamentally different, something that LinkedIn does not and cannot do.</p><p>(I won’t talk about Magnet much here, because the proximate reasons for its failure are pretty simple: we ran out of money and the market fell out from under it. It might have - smart money says probably <em>did</em> have - other means of failure, but we didn’t last long enough to find them in any great detail.)</p><p>Still, if we’d had enough of a candidate pool, it’s possible that we could’ve survived as a secondary, auxiliary tool alongside LinkedIn. To do that, we needed a way to build that pool.</p><h4><strong>Our bet on Screen didn't work</strong></h4><p>In 2020, we began to aggressively experiment with a product we called Screen.</p><p>Screen took Triplebyte's assessments (which, again, were as good as we claimed they were) and made them available to companies to use to screen their own candidates. Candidates would apply to a company and the company would use our assessments to screen those candidates, with the understanding that we would present candidates with a chance to sign up for Triplebyte to reuse their assessment scores in the future.</p><p>The idea here was that we could solve candidate acquisition by having companies do it for us. We could just let them use our assessments, at almost zero marginal cost to us, to bring in a constant flow of candidates. And we could do so in a way that served our more moralistic goal of more meritocratic hiring.</p><p>On paper, this worked pretty well. At its peak, Screen brought in tens of thousands of candidates a month, at almost zero marginal cost. By the time Triplebyte closed its doors, our candidate database was heavily dominated by candidates sourced this way. Of our approximately 250,000 accounts at the end, somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4 were Screen-derived.</p><p>And companies loved it! Screen was the only thing that did have market fit for much of Triplebyte's late history. It had a good growth curve, solid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPS</a>, and seemed largely inoffensive to candidates going through it as part of a company's hiring process. <em>As a product</em>, Screen was wildly successful (granted, it helps to not be charging anything). If you’d been in any of our company leads meetings during this period, you’d have seen a wall of red “not on pace” quarterly goals with some yellow/green Screen goals being the only thing that came anywhere close).</p><p>But Screen had a problem, one that was not obvious at first glance.</p><p>Remember that fundamental problem I mentioned about forty paragraphs ago? The one where companies came to us (particularly post-pivot) to hire the candidates (senior engineers in the US, especially ones from top schools or with FAANG-like experience) that are hardest to acquire? Well, it turns out that companies also don't feel much need to pre-screen such candidates and want to avoid putting barriers (like, say, an online quiz) in their way.</p><p>The candidates that companies wanted to send through an automated screening step were the candidates that they considered both plentiful and of dubious quality. For most companies, that meant inbound applicants (if you've ever hired before, you know how awful the average inbound candidate is), it meant junior candidates, and it meant candidates from abroad.</p><p>For those use cases, Screen was an excellent fit. It offered a way to trim down the firehose of inbound candidates in a way that actually meaningfully measured knowledge and ability. In fact, usage was so high that a user in India actually crashed our whole web app on Christmas Eve by sending a class of some 15,000 students through it at once. (From a coworker who read over a draft of this post: “I remember this! [Our recruiter/recruiter-liaison] and I were debugging it. He was drunk at a bar, I think.”)</p><p>For a product meant as a growth channel, “we brought in so many candidates it crashed our website” <em>sounds</em> like as clear a win as we could get.</p><p>But remember, our goal wasn't <em>get people to use Screen</em> - our goal was <em>acquire valuable candidates</em>. And unfortunately, the candidate groups brought in by Screen were mostly mutually-exclusive with the US-based senior candidates that our clients were buying Triplebyte subscriptions to find. <strong>We built a database - but not a valuable one.</strong></p><p>Our core metrics didn't take this into account until too late. Our main metric for Screen was simply usage, and that metric looked great. Conversion to accounts was lower, but at around 30-50% it literally could not have been more than a factor of 2 or 3 better. It was only when you looked at downstream results that you'd find trouble brewing. We realized what was going on about seven months into this strategy, in late 2022, but by then it was too late: we'd committed to a path, didn't have runway to pick another, and were already facing much larger and more immediate crises (which, in my anti-defense, were at least partially a result of my own inexperience as a then-new head of product - I don't think I was doing a very good job at the time).</p><p>This problem wasn't the fault of Screen as a product. For quite some time it was literally the only part of Triplebyte that was achieving anything. Users liked it, it delivered value, and it accomplished the product goals it set out to accomplish. It just didn't accomplish its <em>business</em> goals, because it fundamentally did not work for the kind of growth we needed.</p><p>The tactical execution of Screen was fine, but the strategic decision to focus on it was wrong. (Granted, I do not really have a better idea for what we should have done instead. There’s a reason candidate acquisition remains my #1 bullet point here. It's possible that by this point we were simply playing a losing hand with no path to victory.) </p><p>The way it could succeed at its metrics and fail at its business objectives is an example of a classic business lesson: make sure your metrics actually reflect your strategic goals.</p><h4><strong>We tried to change our users</strong></h4><p>The last thing I want to talk about is more abstract. It's a fundamental philosophical difference between Triplebyte and our major competitors.</p><p>Triplebyte was, at its heart, a technical organization. Two of the three founders were engineers themselves, and the company culture bore that DNA. We were a geeky, technical, quantitative, introverted, opinionated company, dominated for better and for worse by that particular kind of intellectual adventurousness that makes the Bay Area a fascinating place to live.</p><p>When we presented an ethos of background-blindness and meritocracy, that wasn't just a brand. It really was the way we thought about things, a spirit that everyone in the company cared about, and that was deeply embedded in company culture. I myself was hired with no tech credentials almost literally off the street. I would eventually myself hire a fantastic employee with no tech background out of an ersatz Home Depot in rural New York thanks to that same ethos. My predecessor on my original team <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/kelsey-piper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is now a journalist at Vox</a>. We were a weird bunch.</p><p><em>(This is not to say that that ethos was never violated. It was. Strategic decisions sometimes overrode it, sometimes in ways I agreed with and sometimes not. But the ethos was still embedded in company culture so strongly that these strategic calls sometimes led to people leaving the company out of loyalty to it.)</em></p><p>In short, we believed, with the specific sort of arrogance that is another thing that makes the Bay Area a fascinating place to live, that <em>we knew how engineering hiring should be done</em>. Our goal was to <em>change what companies wanted to do</em>, not <em>enable them to do they already wanted to do</em>.</p><p>And I don't think this was necessarily wrong. Our users often behaved in ways that I thought - and still think - weren't to their benefit, ways that create painful externalities that make job hunting awful for everyone.</p><p>But this post is called Why Triplebyte <em>Failed</em>, not Where Triplebyte Did Something Wrong.</p><p>Changing user behavior is fundamentally harder than just giving people what they want. And we were always fighting an uphill battle against established hiring patterns. It was a battle our ethos pushed us to fight, but it was often a losing one. We began with the premise that we were right, and that the goal was to convince users that we were right. That’s almost always an uphill battle.</p><p>After Triplebyte closed down, I spent a short time at one of our competitors, helping them get some of the assets they bought from us integrated into their product. I saw a very different approach there. They were an extremely user-, revenue-, and customer-driven organization, as much to a fault in that direction as Triplebyte was in our own direction. They begin with the premise of "what does the user want?" and work backward to get it for them, while Triplebyte began with the premise "what is the <em>right way to do this</em> in the abstract?" and worked backward to convince users to try it.</p><p>One of the key questions in my mind at the time: why were they alive when Triplebyte wasn't? It seemed important to answer that question, and to take philosophies very different from ours with deadly seriousness. And this difference in philosophy is one of the theories I came away with. (The other two are (a) that they simply got luckier with fundraising timing and (b) that, by nature of being an interviewing-as-a-service product, they avoided the candidate-acquisition problem entirely. These theories are not mutually exclusive, and all three may have played a part.)</p><p>In any case, "changing user behavior is extremely hard" is a pretty fundamental piece of product wisdom, and it is what we were trying to do.</p><h4><strong>What you should take from this</strong></h4><p>Doing business is hard. Some of these decisions were mine. Some involved me. Some did not; some of which I agreed with and some of which I hated. And I'm not, for the most part, going to say which is which, because the only thing worse than backseat driving is retroactive-seat driving. There is no shame in trying something hard and coming up short, and that's as true in business as it is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1daumg4/i_dont_feel_qualified_to_apply_to_any_jobs/l7mxoso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the job hunt</a>.</p><p>I had more than my share of confident, well-justified, and <em>wrong</em> positions both as a lower-level employee and as a leader. And ultimately, I was a member of the leadership team of a company that failed. The buck has to stop with us, all of us, including me. None of this is about blame, and insofar as there is blame, that blame lies on me as much as anyone.</p><p>But what I hope is that all of this serves as a useful lesson. A bit of fluoride in the water supply of tech, to prevent the decay of the next company that tries to do what we did. A lesson in how a well-beloved company can fail not through any specific cataclysm but by a sequence of factors not obvious in any given moment.</p><p>And for me, a chance to try again.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<article about="/newsroom/irs-makes-direct-file-a-permanent-option-to-file-federal-tax-returns-expanded-access-for-more-taxpayers-planned-for-the-2025-filing-season">

  
    

  
            <div><p>IR-2024-151, May 30, 2024</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Following a successful filing season pilot and feedback from a variety of partners, the Internal Revenue Service announced today that it will make Direct File a permanent option for filing federal tax returns starting in the 2025 tax season.</p>

<p>The agency is exploring ways to expand Direct File to make more taxpayers eligible in the 2025 filing season and beyond by examining options to broaden Direct File’s availability across the nation, including covering more tax situations and inviting all states to partner with Direct File next year.</p>

<p>The IRS plans to announce additional details on the 2025 expansion in the coming months.</p>

<p>The decision follows a highly successful, limited pilot during the 2024 filing season, where 140,803 taxpayers in 12 states filed their taxes using Direct File. The IRS closely analyzed data collected during the pilot, held numerous meetings with diverse groups of stakeholders and gathered feedback from individual Direct File users, state officials and representatives across the tax landscape. The IRS heard directly from hundreds of organizations across the country, more than a hundred members of Congress and from those interested in using Direct File in the future. The IRS has also heard from a limited number of stakeholders who believe the current free electronic filing options provided by third party vendors are adequate.</p>

<p>The IRS will continue data analysis and stakeholder engagement to identify improvements to Direct File; however, initial post-pilot analysis yielded enough information for the decision to make Direct File a permanent filing option. The IRS noted that an early decision on 2025 was critical for planning and programming both for the IRS and for additional states to join the program. IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel recommended to Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen to make Direct File permanent. He cited overwhelming satisfaction from users and improved ease of tax filing among the reasons for his recommendation, which Secretary Yellen has accepted.</p>

<p>“The clear message is that many taxpayers across the nation want the IRS to provide more than one no-cost option for filing electronically,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. “So, starting with the 2025 filing season, the IRS will make Direct File a permanent option for filing federal tax returns. Giving taxpayers additional options strengthens the tax filing system. And adding Direct File to the menu of filing options fits squarely into our effort to make taxes as easy as possible for Americans, including saving time and money.”</p>

<h2>State and eligibility expansion</h2>

<p>Building on the success of the limited pilot – where taxpayers with relatively simple tax situations in 12 states were eligible to use Direct File – the IRS is examining ways to expand eligibility to more taxpayers across the country. For the 2025 filing season, the IRS will work with all states that want to partner with Direct File, and there will be no limit to the number of states that can participate in the coming year. The agency expects several new states will choose to participate.</p>

<p>The IRS is also exploring ways to gradually expand the scope of tax situations supported by Direct File. Over the coming years, the agency’s goal is to expand Direct File to support most common tax situations, with a particular focus on those situations that impact working families. Announcements about new state partners and expanded eligibility are expected in the coming months.</p>

<p>“User experience – both within the product and integration with state tax systems – will continue to be the foundation for Direct File moving forward,” Werfel said. “We will focus, first and foremost, on continuing to get it right. Accuracy and comprehensive tax credit uptake will be paramount concerns to ensure taxpayers file a correct return and get the refund they’re entitled to. And our North Star will be improving the experience of tax filing itself and helping taxpayers meet their obligations as easily and quickly as possible.”</p>

<h2>Direct File’s role in the tax system</h2>

<p>During the agency’s review, many taxpayers told the IRS they want no-cost filing options. Millions of taxpayers who did not live in one of the 12 pilot states visited the Direct File website to learn more about this option or asked live chat assistors to make Direct File available in their state.</p>

<p>As a permanent filing option, Direct File will continue to be one option among many from which taxpayers can choose. It is not meant to replace other important options by tax professionals or commercial software providers, who are critical partners with the IRS in delivering a successful tax system for the nation. The IRS also remains committed to the ongoing relationship with Free File Inc., which has served taxpayers for two decades in the joint effort to provide free commercial software. Earlier this month, the IRS signed a five-year extension with industry to continue Free File.</p>

<p>As the IRS works to expand Direct File, it will also work to strengthen all free filing options for taxpayers, including Free File, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program (VITA) and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program (TCE).</p>

<h2>Pilot analysis and feedback</h2>

<p>In the six weeks following the close of the Direct File pilot, the IRS closely analyzed pilot data and gathered feedback from diverse groups of stakeholders, including Direct File users, state officials and representatives across the country’s tax community.</p>

<p>While data analysis and partner engagement are ongoing, the IRS’ post-pilot analysis has yielded three conclusions that support making Direct File a permanent tax filing solution:</p>

<h3>1. Taxpayers overwhelmingly liked using Direct File</h3>

<p>As detailed in the <a data-entity-substitution="pup_linkit_media" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f83f7ed4-d56a-4eee-84e6-12bbc205d7a7" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5969.pdf" title="0524 Publ 5969                           (PDF)">IRS Direct File Pilot: Filing Season 2024 After Action Report</a><span title="Download pdf file" aria-label="press enter to download pdf file">PDF</span>, more than 15,000 Direct File users participated in the General Services Administration’s Touchpoints survey, which collects comprehensive user feedback about government systems:</p>

<ul><li><strong>90% of respondents</strong> ranked their experience as Excellent or Above Average.</li>
	<li>When asked what they particularly liked, respondents most commonly cited Direct File’s ease of use, trustworthiness and that it was free.</li>
	<li>Additionally, <strong>86% of respondents</strong> said that their experience with Direct File increased their trust in the IRS.</li>
	<li><strong>90% of survey respondents</strong> who used customer support rated that experience as Excellent or Above Average.</li>
</ul><p>For the primary quantitative measure of taxpayer opinions of Direct File, the IRS selected the Net Promoter Score (NPS) customer sentiment metric, which asks users, “On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend Direct File to a friend or family member?” NPS scores range from -100-+100. Direct File has a NPS of +74. If compared to benchmark scores from financial services companies, Direct File would lead in eight of nine categories.</p>

<h3>2. Direct File made the tax filing experience easier</h3>

<p>Direct File’s users reported saving time: Filing taxes with Direct File generally took less than an hour, and many reported filing in as little as 30 minutes. Nearly half of Direct File users reported paying for tax preparation the previous year, and the Treasury Department estimates that Direct File users saved $5.6 million in tax preparation fees this filing season.</p>

<h3>3. Direct File helps catalyze the IRS’s digital transformation</h3>

<p>To build Direct File, the IRS assembled a team of experienced tax experts, digital product specialists, engineers and data scientists from across the federal government. The agency partnered with the U.S. Digital Service and GSA’s 18F, as well as private sector partners, who all brought critical agile technology expertise. Working side by side at IRS headquarters and collaborating with remote team members across the country, the Direct File team developed and delivered a strong technology product.</p>

<p>The Direct File pilot also gave the IRS the chance to test customer service innovations on a large scale.</p>

<p>Live Chat served as Direct File’s primary customer support channel because it could be integrated directly into the product. This allowed customer support to gradually expand in concert with the overall number of users in each phase of the pilot. The IRS is exploring how this approach could impact taxpayer service overall as the agency works to provide taxpayers with more choices in how they can interact with the IRS.</p>

<p>“We’re mindful that the most important decision we made during the pilot was to focus on executional certainty,” Werfel said. “We took the time to get it right. We found the right first step to test the demand and the user experience and build a strong product. We will apply that same critical lesson for next year as we take a strategic approach to expanding Direct File’s availability and capabilities.”</p>

                                      <p>Gainax, known for producing the popular anime series "Neon Genesis Evangelion," said Friday that it filed for bankruptcy at Tokyo District Court on May 29.</p>

<p>Founded in 1984, the Tokyo-based company produced hit anime titles, including the Evangelion series by film director Hideaki Anno and "Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water."</p>

<p>Its business conditions began to deteriorate around 2012, due to careless management by executives, and the company lost its anime production capabilities following an exodus of its creative staff. In addition, its representative director was arrested in 2019 for alleged sexual abuse of a minor.</p>

<p>Gainax tried to rebuild itself with the support of Khara, which currently owns the rights to the Evangelion series and of which Anno serves as president. However, Gainax was sued over unpaid debts in May and concluded that it was difficult to continue its business.</p>

<p>Gainax released a statement on its website, saying that it feels very sorry for fans, while expressing its heartfelt gratitude for their support over the past 40 years.</p>

<p>The total amount of liabilities left by the company is unknown, according to credit research firm Teikoku Databank.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The emergence of the microprocessor in the early 1970s allowed the design of computers that did not require the substantial economic resources possessed by large computer companies of that era. Shortly after this event, a variety of computers based on microprocessors appeared in the United States and other developed countries. Unlike in those countries, where small and large companies developed most personal computers, in Mexico, the first microprocessor-based computers were designed within academic institutions. It is little known that Mexican computers of that era include a variety of systems ranging from purpose-specific research and teaching-oriented computers to high-performance personal computers. The goal of this article is to describe in detail some of these Mexican computers designed between the late 1970s and mid-1980s.

    <p>In 2020 just in between two lockdowns, my wife gave birth to our son <strong>Linus</strong>. I'm not going to describe in detail how my life was changed that day (because other bloggers do this better) but for me his birth sparked a whole lot of new feelings and plans for our future.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/600x600/forcesize/93d9i7.png"><figcaption>Me with my son about 30 minutes after his birth</figcaption></figure>
<h2>His own Email Address</h2>
<p>You might think it's too early for a 1 month old baby to have an email address but I had a plan when I created his email address in our family's Google Workspace domain.</p>
<p>My plan was to give him access to the account when he's in secondary school but theres much more to it.</p>

<h3>Sending him the family history while it's still in the making</h3>
<p>Most of the things I know about my grandparents I have not heard from them directly. When my grandfather died in 1999 I was just 12 years old and it was the first time I lost someone from my closer family.</p>
<p>He lived an interesting life, when he was 19 he was drafted by the Nazis and became a mechanic for the Luftwaffe. After the war when he came back from a PoW camp in Siberia he was a bus driver, mechanic, father and later grandfather. He never talked about anything he experienced in the war and according to my family he came back deeply traumatized. Many parts of his life were only reveiled to me after his death - not because of a particular reason just because I was too young to ask any interesting questions at the time.</p>

<h3>What does this have to do with email?</h3>
<p>When I realized that <em>I</em> have a son now and that these years will be his vague memories in the future I thought I'd start <strong>emailing him things from our daily lives and I encourage all of his family members to do the same</strong> to tell him about themselves and write about memories they share.</p>
<p>I usually send him two to three emails per year with photos of our family and friends and his sourroundings like what car we drive, what our house and our garden looks like.</p>

<h3>The grandparent equasion</h3>
<p>Even though I plan to be by his side for the next 50 years or so, you never know when he's going to lose a loved one in his future and I want him to have first-hand messages from everyone in our family right there in his inbox.</p>
<p>Once every year I remind his grandparents, aunts and uncles to send him an email and just tell them what they are up to these days, where they live and who they met. I encurage them to include photos of them and their sourroundings so he can watch them age over the years and emails.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/800x600/ms7xke.png"><figcaption>Linus with his grandparents</figcaption></figure>
<p>I imagine him in his teen years scrolling through and reading messages from loved ones who might no longer be with us and read about their lives and their own history.</p>
<p>Linus will be 4 years old in a few months and I have sent him 10 emails so far. I write him on his birthdays and after events like first vacation, first Christmas or first day in Kindergarten.</p>
<p>But apart from the emails I have another plan.</p>
<h2>Leaving time capsules</h2>
<p>When I met my wife she showed me the concept of Geocaches. Geocaching.com describes it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor adventure that is happening all the time, all around the world. To play, participants use the Geocaching app and/or a GPS device to navigate to cleverly hidden containers called geocaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2018/03/what-is-geocaching/">https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2018/03/what-is-geocaching/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This concept was very interesting to me and one day I connected the idea of geocaching with the virtual legacy I'm planning for him.</p>
<h3>Geocaching but 10+ years apart</h3>
<p>I have prepared a few capsules with random items from our lives or toys he doesn't play with anymore. My plan is to bury them in random places, make photos and note the GPS coordinates of the locations to send it to him. Some of them however I will not tell him about but save in my personal documents for him to possibly find many years down the line.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/krz1d0.jpg"><figcaption>Example of a time capsule. This one is from the UK <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/uk_parliament/48365677416">(c) UK Parliament Jessica Taylor</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hard part here is finding spots that are easily accessible now and will be in many years too. But I already have a few ideas.</p>
<p>Maybe even an ETH paper wallet with 50€ on it? Who knows</p>

				At a time when employee retention should be of a top concern, some companies are using questionable ways of enforcing return-to-office mandates.			</h2>
			
		</div>					
						<div id="remove_no_follow">
		<div>




<p>The battle royale for the future of workplace culture continues as companies and employees square off over the right to work at home and the return to office (RTO) movement.</p>



<p>A sizable list of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1611819/will-employees-bow-down-to-stricter-rto-policies.html">companies elected to order employees back to the office</a>&nbsp;earlier this year. Many directed workers to return to three, four, or five days a week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How’s that turned out so far? Not so well.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column0 -->
								
					<div>


<p>Companies that think they’ve won the battle by issuing strict return-to-office (RTO) mandates could lose the larger war. RTO mandates are causing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1611739/women-high-performers-and-millennials-flee-return-to-office-policies.html">senior-level employees, women, and millennials</a>&nbsp;among others to push the eject button and find other jobs with companies that have more liberal remote-work polices. If, by some miracle, the Federal Trade Commission’s move to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2098958/ftc-ban-on-non-competes-would-put-employees-in-the-drivers-seat.html">strike down most existing and future non-compete agreements</a>&nbsp;takes effect this year, an increasing number of employees looking for new work could wind up at competitors.</p>

		
		
			


<p>Finding AI talent, which more and more companies are going to need, is already a search for the proverbial needle in a haystack. Adding strict RTO policies to that scenario won’t make the talent search easier.</p>



<p>And while RTO policy pronouncements have slowed in recent months, there have been numerous reports of affected employees searching for new jobs, refusing to comply, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/bosses-mandated-them-back-to-the-office-they-took-legal-action-instead/ar-BB1lTAIL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking legal action</a>.</p>

					<div>


<p>Who will blink first?</p>



<h2><strong>Keeping track of&nbsp;&nbsp;employees</strong></h2>



<p>It hasn’t helped that some companies, including Amazon, Dell, Google, JPMorgan, Meta and TikTok, have reportedly begun tracking employees’ badge swipes. Dell is also using VPN (virtual private network) monitoring, and has created a badge color-coding system to categorize employee onsite presence. According to Business Insider, Dell also told workers who work remotely full time that they won’t be eligible for promotions.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to comprehend why some top execs at companies with RTO mandates seem more focused on making their employees suffer with commutes, added costs, lost productivity, and in some cases invasive tracking than they are with making a profit. At some organizations, there’s almost a vindictive quality to the RTO policies and the tone of communications. What possesses CEOs and other leaders to create such a toxic environment at their companies? What is this obsession with making employees work in the office when research has shown that employees are more productive when working where they choose?</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column3 -->
								
					<div>


<h2><strong>The cost of doing business in the office</strong></h2>



<p>One motivation behind employees’ desire for the freedom to work at home involves the financial costs of going into the office. RTO means some sort of commute for employees, which means time and money, especially if you’re a two-income family and two adults have to commute by car. Gas, maintenance, insurance, parking, public transportation, and toll roads are just some of the possible added commute expenses.</p>



<p>Working at home could lead to potentially less expensive, less stressful, and more flexible childcare options. (Many parents with older children are able to drop before- and after-school daycare programs when they work remotely, for example.)</p>



<p>With the likelihood of buying more lunches in the office, and less time to cook dinner after a long commute home, food costs go up, too.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column4 -->
								
					<div>


<p>All of these considerations add up to a significant drag on work-life balance. The desire to improve that balance is the single most important reason why remote work is so highly prized by employees. The COVID-19 pandemic gave many workers a good long taste of it — and they don’t want to let it go. It makes employees more productive on the job&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;gives them more control over their personal lives.</p>



<p>This is playing out now in companies around the globe. And with neither side willing to give in, the fight will continue to bubble up this year and perhaps even next, leaving employees frustrated and on the hunt for new jobs — and companies in danger of undermining their best assets: their workers.</p>

<p>Burnout can make one feel helpless, incompetent, emotionally exhausted, isolated and cynical. Yale faculty provided insight into the neurobiological basis behind symptoms of burnout — and what can be done to reverse it.</p>



<p>Professor of neuroscience and psychology Amy Arnsten’s decades of research on the effects of stress on the brain were inspired by seeing “how people fall apart,” she said. When her father was very ill, Arnsten witnessed the process by which people who are normally “very rational” can suddenly become “emotional tornadoes.” Through volunteering in her local state psychiatric hospital, she further witnessed how even small stressors had immediate effects on thought patterns. Arnsten found that understanding the effects of stress on the brain would provide vital clues as to how higher brain functioning is regulated.</p>



<p>“A lot of my own research is on how uncontrollable stress affects the prefrontal cortex, which is the most recently evolved part of our brains,” Arnsten said. “It does higher cognition, abstract thought, working memory, the executive functions — so being able to concentrate, multitask, plan and organize, all these things you ideally need to thrive at Yale, for example.”</p>



<p>Arnsten highlighted that a person’s perceived ability to control a stressor is a key determinant of its effect on their brain. For example, if someone is overwhelmed by what is being asked of them, believing it to be beyond their capabilities even if it is not, they will view the task as something to be afraid of and such fear will prevail. The stress signaling pathways engaged will then weaken the prefrontal cortex and strengthen more primitive parts of the brain. According to Arnsten, this phenomenon may have had survival value over the course of human evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arnsten recounted walking in the woods in Vermont, when suddenly along the path, a bear appeared in front of her. Luckily, the bear was facing the other way. Rather than consciously reasoning that most mammals lack a ventral stream, and therefore would not be able to recognize a still object, she froze. In this moment of fear, her reflex of freezing was engaged. When the bear turned around, it did not notice her because of her lack of movement, and ended up wandering off.</p>



<p>“Freezing is a reflex that can be mediated by the brainstem,” Arnsten explained. “So you can see that there are many instances where having this rapid switch to more primitive brain circuits can save your life. But there are others where the stressor really demands that you need your prefrontal cortex online. For example, during COVID, being able to imagine an invisible virus, you can’t see it the way you see a bear.”</p>



<p>Human neuroimaging can help researchers study the prefrontal cortex’s specific response to stress, such as the stress students experience before an important exam. Arnsten pointed to a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19139412/">Cornell study</a> that analyzed the brains of medical students after a month of preparation for a major board exam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The month of study for the exam can be characterized as “psychosocial stress,” an imbalance between adverse life situations and one’s ability to cope with them. Brain imaging revealed that the stressor of studying for the major exam weakened the connectivity of the prefrontal network, leading to impaired prefrontal function and impaired attention regulation.</p>



<p>“We can see symptoms of breakdown when we begin to lose our ability to concentrate,” clinical assistant professor of psychiatry Mark Rego said. “We have the tip of the tongue phenomenon, we lose things easily — these are both from working memory breaking down — and our emotions escape their confines into harsh speech. Eventually the system will break down and we will need to rest to focus at all.”</p>



<p>The Cornell study found that after a month of reduced stress, these effects disappeared. In healthy individuals, the plasticity of the prefrontal cortex allowed for such cognitive impairments from stress to be reversed. However, this cycle could threaten long-term mental health.</p>



<p>In Rego’s book “Frontal Fatigue” he hypothesized that if this cycle of mentally breaking down and resting is repeated enough, the prefrontal cortex can become vulnerable to dysfunction, possibly leading to mental disorders. Rego terms this vulnerability “frontal fatigue,” defining it as a background condition caused by the “unique pressures of modern life” overwhelming the prefrontal cortex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rego said that if frontal fatigue represents a state of vulnerability, then burnout is the next step before stress overwhelms an individual into a state of depression. Rego quoted Arnsten’s conclusion that if something is deemed “mental illness,” then it likely involves the prefrontal cortex.</p>



<p>“[The prefrontal cortex] does not function well under stress,” Rego said. “Virtually all imaging and injury studies have found that mental illness always involves the [prefrontal cortex].&nbsp; Change the [prefrontal cortex] and changes in personality and behavior follow.”</p>



<p>According to Rego, without the prefrontal cortex, humans would be unable to control any action compelled by emotion. The prefrontal cortex’s numerous connections to the limbic system, where emotions form, explain its vital role in dealing with “our emotional lives,” he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professor of psychology Laurie Santos said that burnout consists of three different phases. The first is emotional exhaustion, characterized by feeling worn out and drained, with not even a good night’s sleep seeming to help. The second phase is known as depersonalization or cynicism. This stage causes a person to be annoyed with others, have a shorter fuse, become more cynical of people’s intentions and become more distant with people.</p>



<p>“The final feature is a reduced sense of personal accomplishment,” Santos said. “You never feel like you’re doing things effectively and so you feel ineffective and like the work you do doesn’t matter. If you notice signs like this, it’s important that you pay attention early on and make some changes in order to feel better.”</p>



<p>Because it is the prefrontal cortex that helps control emotions and thereby avoid panicking, this continual stress cycle can cause a person to spiral downwards. Meanwhile, primitive circuits like the amygdala are strengthened, becoming enlarged as a result of burnout.</p>



<p>“The amygdala’s job is to look for threats,” Arnsten said. “And it’s something called the aversive lens, where people who are depressed, their amygdala actually views neutral faces as sad or threatening. So, yes, by being in chronic stress, you’re setting up your brain to be concentrating on the negative and interpreting things in a negative way.”</p>



<p>Arnsten advised people to have a low threshold for reaching out for help. She observed that many students may not be aware that help is available, and may view asking for help as a personal sign of weakness. She noted the importance of a balanced diet, deep breathing, exercise and good sleep.</p>



<p>Rego emphasized the need to lean into life “with your hands, senses and via others.” To allow the prefrontal cortex to rest, he suggested doing hands-on activities, such as arts and cooking, and indulging the senses — especially in nature — and talking to people often. Rego also recommended quieting the mind, whether through sports, long walks or yoga.</p>



<p>“Understanding the neuroscience can give you perspective to say ‘it’s not that I’m stupid or weak,’” Arnsten said. “This is how our neurobiology is built. This is a natural response of my brain, and I need to do things that will help me feel more in control.”</p>



<p>Students can schedule meetings with counselors at Yale Mental Health &amp; Counseling by calling (203) 432-0290, or access the expanded mental health services through Yale College Community Counseling.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="The Mythical Non-Roboticist"><p><em>The original version of this post by Benjie Holson was published on Substack <a href="https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/the-mythical-non-roboticist" target="_blank">here</a>, and includes </em><em>Benjie’s original comics as <a href="https://generalrobots.substack.com/" target="_blank">part of his series on robots and startups</a>.</em></p><p>
	I worked on this idea for months before I decided it was a mistake. The second time I heard someone mention it, I thought, “That’s strange, these two groups had the same idea. Maybe I should tell them it didn’t work for us.” The third and fourth time I rolled my eyes and ignored it. The fifth time I heard about a group struggling with this mistake, I decided it was worth a blog post all on its own. I call this idea “The Mythical Non-Roboticist.”<br></p><hr><h2>The Mistake</h2><p>
	The idea goes something like this: Programming robots is hard. And there are some people with really arcane skills and PhDs who are really expensive and seem to be required for some reason. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could do <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/">robotics</a> without them?
	<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> What if everyone could do robotics? That would be great, right? We should make a software framework so that non-roboticists can program robots.
</p><p>
	This idea is so close to a correct idea that it’s hard to tell why it doesn’t work out. On the surface, it’s not 
	<em>wrong</em>: All else being equal, it would be good if programming robots was more accessible. The problem is that we don’t have a good recipe for making working robots. So we don’t know how to make that recipe easier to follow. In order to make things simple, people end up removing things that folks might need, because no one knows for sure what’s absolutely required. It’s like saying you want to invent an invisibility cloak and want to be able to make it from materials you can buy from Home Depot. Sure, that would be nice, but if you invented an invisibility cloak that required some mercury and neodymium to manufacture would you toss the recipe?
</p><p>
	In robotics, this mistake is based on a very true and very real observation: Programming robots 
	<em>is</em> super hard. Famously hard. It would be super great if programming robots was easier. The issue is this: Programming robots has two different kinds of hard parts.

	The first kind of hard part is that robots deal with the real world, imperfectly sensed and imperfectly actuated. Global mutable state is bad programming style because it’s really hard to deal with, but to robot software the entire physical world is global mutable state, and you only get to unreliably observe it and hope your actions approximate what you wanted to achieve. Getting robotics to work at all is often at the very limit of what a person can reason about, and requires the flexibility to employ whatever heuristic might work for your special problem. This is the
	<em> intrinsic </em>complexity of the problem: Robots live in complex worlds, and for every working solution there are millions of solutions that don’t work, and finding the right one is hard, and often very dependent on the task, robot, sensors, and environment.
</p><p>
	Folks look at that challenge, see that it is super hard, and decide that, sure, maybe some fancy roboticist could solve it in one particular scenario, but what about “normal” people? “We should make this possible for non-roboticists” they say. I call these users “Mythical Non-Roboticists” because once they are programming a robot, I feel they 
	<em>become</em> roboticists. Isn’t anyone programming a robot for a purpose a roboticist? Stop gatekeeping, people.
</p><h2>Don’t design for amorphous groups</h2><p>
	I call also them “mythical” because usually the “non-roboticist” implied is a vague, amorphous group. Don’t design for amorphous groups. If you can’t name three real people (that you have talked to) that your API is for, then you are designing for an amorphous group and only amorphous people will like your API.
</p><p>
	And with this hazy group of users in mind (and seeing how difficult everything is), folks think, “Surely we could make this easier for everyone else by papering over these things with simple APIs?”
</p><p>
	No. No you can’t. Stop it.
</p><p>
	You can’t paper over intrinsic complexity with simple APIs because 
	<strong>if your APIs are simple they can’t cover the complexity of the problem</strong>. You will inevitably end up with a beautiful looking API, with calls like “grasp_object” and “approach_person” which demo nicely in a hackathon kickoff but last about 15 minutes of someone actually trying to get some work done. It will turn out that, for their particular application, “grasp_object()” makes 3 or 4 wrong assumptions about “grasp” <em>and</em> “object” and doesn’t work for them at all.
</p><h2>Your users are just as smart as you</h2><p>
	This is made worse by the pervasive assumption that these people are less savvy (read: less intelligent) than the creators of this magical framework.
	<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> That feeling of superiority will cause the designers to cling desperately to their beautiful, simple “grasp_object()”s and resist adding the knobs and arguments needed to cover more use cases and allow the users to customize what they get.
</p><p>
	Ironically this foists a bunch of complexity on to the poor users of the API who have to come up with clever workarounds to get it to work at all.

	The sad, salty, bitter icing on this cake-of-frustration is that, even if done really well, the goal of this kind of framework would be to expand the group of people who can do the work. And to achieve that, it would sacrifice some performance you can only get by super-specializing your solution to your problem. If we lived in a world where expert roboticists could program robots that worked really well, but there was so much demand for robots that there just wasn’t enough time for those folks to do all the programming, this would be a great solution.
	<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>
	The obvious truth is that (outside of really constrained environments like manufacturing cells) even the very best collection of real bone-fide, card-carrying roboticists working at the best of their ability struggle to get close to a level of performance that makes the robots commercially viable, even with long timelines and mountains of funding.
	<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a> We don’t have <em>any</em> headroom to sacrifice power and effectiveness for ease.
</p><h2>What problem are we solving?</h2><p>
	So should we give up making it easier? Is robotic development available only to a small group of elites with fancy PhDs?
	<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a> No to both! I have worked with tons of undergrad interns who have been completely able to do robotics.<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> I myself am mostly self-taught in robot programming.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a> While there is a lot of intrinsic complexity in making robots work, I don’t think there is any more than, say, video game development.
</p><p>
	In robotics, like in all things, experience helps, some things are teachable, and as you master many areas you can see things start to connect together. These skills are not magical or unique to robotics. We are not as special as we like to think we are.
</p><p>
	But what about making programming robots easier? Remember way back at the beginning of the post when I said that there were two different kinds of hard parts? One is the intrinsic complexity of the problem, and that one will be hard no matter what.
	<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a> But the second is the incidental complexity, or as I like to call it, the stupid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BS#:~:text=Bullshit%2C%20a%20phrase%20denoting%20something%20worthless" target="_blank">BS</a> complexity.
</p><h2>Stupid BS Complexity</h2><p>
	Robots are asynchronous, distributed, real-time systems with weird hardware. All of that will be hard to configure for stupid BS reasons. Those drivers need to work in the weird flavor of Linux you want for hard real-time for your controls and getting that all set up will be hard for stupid BS reasons. You are abusing Wi-Fi so you can roam seamlessly without interruption but Linux’s Wi-Fi will not want to do that. Your log files are huge and you have to upload them somewhere so they don’t fill up your robot. You’ll need to integrate with some cloud something or other and deal with its stupid BS.
	<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p><img alt="An illustration of a robot whose head has exploded off " data-rm-shortcode-id="5d8145dc2ed005a011a7b8cd4d21efe1" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-robot-whose-head-has-exploded-off.jpg?id=52208747&amp;width=980" height="1250" id="d818f" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-robot-whose-head-has-exploded-off.jpg?id=52208747&amp;width=980" width="2000"><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Moor Studio/Getty Images</small></p><p>
	There is a ton of crap to deal with before you even get to complexity of dealing with 3D rotation, moving reference frames, time synchronization, messaging protocols. Those things have intrinsic complexity (you have to think about when something was observed and how to reason about it as other things have moved) and stupid BS complexity (There’s a weird bug because someone multiplied two transform matrices in the wrong order and now you’re getting an error message that deep in some protocol a quaternion is not normalized. WTF does that mean?)
	<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>
	One of the biggest challenges of robot programming is wading through the sea of stupid BS you need to wrangle in order to 
	<em>start</em> working on your interesting and challenging robotics problem.
</p><p>
	So a simple heuristic to make good APIs is:
</p><p><em>Design your APIs for someone as smart as you, but less tolerant of stupid BS.</em></p><p>
	That feels universal enough that I’m tempted to call it 
	<strong>Holson’s Law of Tolerable API Design</strong>.
</p><p>
	When you are using tools you’ve made, you know them well enough to know the rough edges and how to avoid them.
</p><p>
	But rough edges are things that have to be held in a programmer’s memory while they are using your system. If you insist on making a robotics framework
	<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a>, you should strive to make it as powerful as you can with the least amount of stupid BS. Eradicate incidental complexity everywhere you can. You want to make APIs that have maximum flexibility but good defaults. I like python’s default-argument syntax for this because it means you can write APIs that can be used like:

	It is possible to have easy things be simple 
	<em>and</em> allow complex things. And please, please, please don’t make condescending APIs. Thanks!

Reviewed by Sammy Gill.

We won't try to adjust computed font sizes if (visibleWidth &gt;= width())
at RenderBlockFlow::adjustComputedFontSizes.

On the first load, RenderBlockFlow::width is calculated to a value that
allows TextAutoSizing to set new computed font sizes for the text nodes
on the page. Width is much larger than visibleWidth, ultimately coming from
WebPageProxy::textAutosizingWidth which returns WebCore::screenSize().width().

At refresh,RenderBlockFlow::width returns a value that is actually equal
to visibleWidth (and screenSize().width()). There seems to depend on
timing. I wasn't able to reproduce that when simulator CPU load was too
high.

Since the page where the bug manifests itself already has responsive CSS
styling, we can quirk TextAutoSizing to skip adjusting for it, at least
until we figure out why we are calculating RenderBlockFlow width inconsistently:
