(I have since recorded podcasts with four other teachers at the studio and am completely unsure how to express my gratitude to Joe — honestly perhaps less words about it?) While I would be the one asking Joe questions on the podcast, he had an important question for me. With all the casual profundity of a yoga teacher, Joe asked, “<u>what is your earliest memory?</u>”<p>Without pause for an inhale I responded, “</p><u>probably a panic attack.</u>” I feel like Joe did his best asana poker face, based on projecting my own insecurities and/or the hyper-vigilant observance that comes with anxiety.<u>I began having panic attacks at a young age. I felt the impending doom of death before I had any concept of death.</u> (Do I really have any concept of death now, though? Does anyone??) I define panic attacks as feeling “too alive,” like diving off the deep end into awareness of existence without any proper scuba gear or knowledge of free diving. Panic attacks, I’ve learned, come like an ambulance flashing lights and blaring a siren indicating that my mind and my body are… experiencing a missed connection in terms of communication — they’re refusing to listen to each other. More accurately: my mind is disregarding the messages from my body, convinced she can think her way through feelings, and so my body goes into panic mode like she’s on strike."</li><li id="block97">Annie then basically proceeds to mention that "panic attack" doesn't quite feel like her first memory, but doesn't decisively settle on a "first memory." She concludes the article: "TBD on the first memory of that history. Here’s to exploring."<ol><li id="block98">This becomes relevant later on, as Annie ends up remembering an earlier memory than her panic attacks - Sam sexually assaulting her.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li id="block99"><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">Period lost, period found</a> - published Feb 21, 2019<ol><li id="block100">Annie started taking Zoloft at age 13 to help with symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety, and Depression.</li><li id="block101">Annie tapered herself off of Zoloft at age 22.</li><li id="block102">Annie graduated from college with a major in Biopsychology, a minor and dance, and also completed all of the prerequisite courses for medical school.</li><li id="block103">After graduation, Annie chose not to pursue a pre-med route, opting instead to focus on movement, writing, comedy, music, and food. She got certified as a yoga teacher, worked for an online CSA (community-supported agriculture) company, began writing more frequently, started slowly going to open mic nights and putting videos on YouTube, and began a podcast and this blog.</li></ol></li><li id="block104"><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/18-reasons-i-spent-18-years-criticizing-my-appearance-988b94f1b7df">18 reasons I spent 18 years criticizing my appearance</a> - published Mar 6, 2019<ol><li id="block105">Annie lists various reasons, including many related to mental illness and body image issues.</li></ol></li><li id="block106"><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/an-open-letter-to-relatives-b88d917b6f57">An open letter to relatives</a> - published Sep 22, 2020<ol><li id="block107">As I'll get to later on, I'm pretty sure that Annie published this shortly after (as she claims):<ol><li id="block108">Her millionaire relatives (esp. Sam and her mother) exploited a loophole to screw her out of the money that her Dad left for her in his will</li><li id="block109">Sam (through lawyers) told Annie she'd have to get back on Zoloft if she wanted the money</li><li id="block110">Annie had (and still was having?) extremely intense, nearly all-day PTSD flashbacks of the sexual assault she experienced in her childhood from Sam Altman, plus other forms of assault from all members of her nuclear family (except her Dad, I think.)</li><li id="block111">Annie had started publicly speaking out against Sam on social media, though this received surpisingly little attention/audience, which Annie thinks is due to Sam shadowbanning her posts.</li></ol></li><li id="block112">In light of this, to me, this letter seems to be somewhat sarcastic. Annie is "thanking" her relatives in a way that carries subliminal criticisms.&nbsp;</li><li id="block113">Example: "Thank you for strengthening my sense of self. I am where I am and doing what I’m doing in part because of each of you. My tenacity and gentleness to take care of myself has increased because of you. The lessons I’ve received from my relationships with you have shifted my perspectives beyond their limitations. Thank you for providing contrast." -- What I think Annie is referencing here is how her relatives screwed her out of her money and (esp. Sam) abused her for a very long time. To this, she had to adapt by developing better ways to take care of herself, and was also forced to move around in a state of relative financial poverty.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block114">As with the rest of the letter, Annie includes seemingly-upbeat, purposefully vague one-liners throughout the letter, such as "Thank you for providing me with contrast."

She was never going to be an <i>Übermensch. </i>She’s always been someone who felt the pain of the world. <u>At age 5, she began waking up in the middle of the night, needing to take a bath to calm her anxiety. By 6, she thought about suicide, though she didn’t know the word.</u>"</li><li id="block127">&nbsp;"When I visited Annie on Maui this summer, she told me stories that will resonate with anyone who has been the emo-artsy person in a businessy family, or who has felt profoundly hurt by experiences family members seem not to understand. Annie — her long dark hair braided, her voice low, measured, and intense — <u>told me about visiting Sam in San Francisco in 2018. He had some friends over. One of them asked Annie to sing a song she’d written. She found her ukulele. She began. “Midway through, Sam gets up wordlessly and walks upstairs to his room,”</u> she told me over a smoothie in Paia, a hippie town on Maui’s North Shore. “I’m like, <i>Do I keep playing? Is he okay? What just happened?</i>” The next day, she told him she was upset and asked him why he left. “And he was kind of like, ‘My stomach hurt,’ or ‘I was too drunk,’ or ‘too stoned, I needed to take a moment.’ And I was like, ‘Really? That moment? You couldn’t wait another 90 seconds?’” That same year, Jerry Altman died. He’d had his heart issues, along with a lot of stress, partly, Annie told me, from driving to Kansas City to nurse along his real-estate business. The Altmans’ parents had separated. Jerry kept working because he needed the money. After his death, Annie cracked. Her body fell apart. Her mental health fell apart. She’d always been the family’s pain sponge. She absorbed more than she could take now. <u>Sam offered to help her with money for a while, then he stopped. In their email and text exchanges, his love — and leverage — is clear. He wants to encourage Annie to get on her feet. He wants to encourage her to get back on Zoloft, which she’d quit under the care of a psychiatrist because she hated how it made her feel.</u> Among her various art projects, Annie makes a podcast called <i>All Humans Are Human.</i> The first Thanksgiving after their father’s death, all the brothers agreed to record an episode with her. <u>Annie wanted to talk on air about the psychological phenomenon of projection: what we put on other people. The brothers steered the conversation into the idea of feedback</u> — specifically, how to give feedback at work. After she posted the show online, Annie hoped her siblings, particularly Sam, would share it. He’d contributed to their brothers’ careers. Jack’s company, Lattice, had been through YC. <u>“I was like, ‘You could just tweet the link. That would help. You don’t want to share your sister’s podcast that you came on?’” He did not. “Jack and Sam said it didn’t align with their businesses.”</u></li><li id="block128">"In May 2020, she relocated to the Big Island of Hawaii. One day, shortly after she’d moved to a farm to do a live-work trade, she got an email from Sam <u>asking for her address.</u> He wanted to send her a memorial diamond he’d made out of some of their father’s ashes. “Picturing him sending a diamond of my dad’s ashes to the mailbox where it’s one of those rural places where there are all these open boxes for all these farms … It was so heavy and sad and angering, but it was also so hilarious and so ridiculous. So disconnected-feeling. Just the lack of fucks given.” Their father never asked to be a diamond. <u>Annie’s mental health was fragile. She worried about money for groceries.</u> It was hard to interact with somebody for whom money meant everything but also so little. “Like, either you aren’t realizing or you are not caring about this whole situation here,” she said. By “whole situation,” she meant her life.<u> “You’re willing to spend $5,000 — for each one — to make this thing that was your idea, not Dad’s, and you’re wanting to send that to me instead of sending me $300 so I can have food security. What?”</u>"</li><li id="block129">"The two are now estranged. <u>Sam offered to buy Annie a house. She doesn’t want to be controlled.</u> For the past three years, she has supported herself doing sex work, “both in person and virtual,” she told me. She posts porn on OnlyFans. She posts on Instagram Stories about mutual aid, trying to connect people who have money to share with those who need financial help."</li><li id="block130">"<span>Annie has moved more than 20 times in the past year.</span> When she called me in mid-September, her housing was unstable yet again. She had $1,000 in her bank account. <u>Since 2020, she has been having flashbacks.</u> She knows everybody takes the bits of their life and arranges them into narratives to make sense of their world. <u>As Annie tells her life story, Sam, their brothers, and her mother kept money her father left her from her.</u> As Annie tells her life story, she felt special and loved when, as a child, Sam read her bedtime stories. <u>Now those memories feel like abuse.</u> The Altman family would like the world to know: “We love Annie and will continue our best efforts to support and protect her, as any family would.” Annie is working on a one-woman show called the <i>HumAnnie</i> about how nobody really knows how to be a human. We’re all winging it."</li></ol><p id="block131"><i>Note</i>: Elizabeth Weil has stated the following on X in regards to her nymag article:</p><ol><li id="block132"><a href="https://twitter.com/lizweil/status/1709975840598130982">lizweil on X: "@RemmeltE This is also a story about the tech media &amp;amp; its entanglement with industry.

Annie is largely self-consistent with the claims she makes over time.</li><li id="block147">In my view, Annie's claims have been paid little attention, considering the power and notoriety of the person about whom she is making them - Sam Altman - and the seriousness of the claims she has been making. Besides Elizabeth Weil's nymag article (<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">here</a>), there has been virtually <i>zero</i> (mainstream) media coverage of the extremely serious claims that Annie has consistently made many, many times against Sam Altman over the past 4 years.&nbsp;</li></ol><p id="block148"><i><span>So -- </span></i><span>since it seems like no writer or journalist on the planet, besides me, for some reason, has ever properly answered this question</span>, I'll take a swing at it:<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p id="block149"><i>What exactly has Annie Altman claimed about Sam Altman</i>?</p><h2 id="My_Personal_Understanding_Interpretation_of_Annie_s_story_and_the_chronology_of_her_life"><u>My Personal Understanding/Interpretation of Annie's story and the chronology of her life</u></h2><p id="block150">The following provides a chronology of Annie's life that I have constructed from her claims. This is <i>my understanding of her claims. </i>This is <i>not</i> me asserting that the following <i>has been proven to be true</i>, as it has not.</p><ol><li id="block151">In ~1998, when Annie is 4 years old, a 13-years-old Sam Altman non-consensually climbs into her bed (<i>implied</i>: sexually assaults Annie.) The specifics are unclear. All that Annie has stated is that Sam was something like her "first {sex work} client", that he used her to "help him figure out his sexuality", and that her brothers "touched her." (<i>implied</i>: in an inappropriate / nonconsensual way that would be classified as sexual abuse.)<ol><li id="block152">Annie, being 4 years old, does not form a concrete memory of this event that she fully understands / comprehends / accepts. That is, as she grows up and develops higher consciousness, sentience, intelligence, and self-awareness, <i>she does not remember what Sam did to her</i>, due to the fact that, when Sam sexually assaulted her (when she was 4 years old), <i>her brain was extremely young, and the event was extremely traumatic for her younger self in a way that was hard for her to even conceptualize, much less understand and remember</i>. Instead, Annie's "remembrances" of Sam's sexual assault of her manifest as extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts around the age of 5-6, and emotional and mental problems (e.g. issues with relationship with her own body, needing to take antidepressants, depression, etc.)</li></ol></li><li id="block153">Around age 5-6, Annie starts dealing with extreme anxiety and suicidal ideation. As Annie puts it, she "{tells} her birth mother about wanting to end this life thing and being touched by older siblings, and said 'mother' decided to instead protect her sons and demand to receive therapy and chores only from her female child."</li><li id="block154">As she grows up, though Annie does not have a complete memory of the sexual abuse she experienced in her early childhood, she practically embodies the dictionary definition of "symptoms common in those who have experienced sexual abuse in early childhood." Panic attacks, depression, body image problems, eating disorders, anxiety, suicidal thoughts - the list goes on.</li><li id="block155">Annie <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">starts using Zoloft at age 13</a> to help with symptoms of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), anxiety, and depression. She eventually tapers herself off of Zoloft at age 22.<ol><li id="block156">Zoloft becomes relevant again later on in Annie's chronology.</li></ol></li><li id="block157">Annie enters college. She ends up finishing college early (even though she was <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/my-denied-appeal-letter-for-early-college-graduation-dcd0ca74bca2">trying to graduate even earlier</a>, I think?). However, upon graduating, she is extremely depressed, and ends up forsaking the medical school route. Instead, she seeks out a place to live that, as <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">Elizabeth Weil writes</a>, "felt better to her. She wanted to make art." <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">In Annie's own words</a>, she "majored in Biopsychology in college, with a minor in dance, and took all the prerequisite courses for medical school. Then I noped out of the pre-med route to focus on movement, writing, comedy, music, and food. I got certified as a yoga teacher, worked for an online CSA (community-supported agriculture) company, began writing more frequently, started slowly going to open mic nights and putting videos on YouTube, and began a podcast and this blog."</li><li id="block158">At some point in 2018, Annie visits Sam in San Francisco and plays ukulele to an audience including Sam and his friends. While she is playing the ukulele, Sam abruptly, wordlessly gets up and walks upstairs to his room (as reported in the nymag article; see above.)&nbsp;<ol><li id="block159">The next day, Sam says something along the lines of "his stomach hurt" or "he was too drunk/stoned" or "he needed to take a moment." Annie finds this explanation to be odd.</li></ol></li><li id="block160"><a href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/jerold-altman-7862632">In May 2018, Annie's Dad dies.</a>&nbsp;</li><li id="block161">In Aug 2018, Annie starts a podcast, the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0SKQ3vKzn2pSYXWRWwWb7J?si=d7fb748fff654cb5"><i>All Humans Are Human</i> podcast</a>.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block162">Annie experiences "6 months of hacking into all her accounts" after <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/1-we-are-all-self-conscious-with-avram-ellner/id1428943256?i=1000417931953">starting her podcast (in 2018)</a>.</li></ol></li><li id="block163">On <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/all-humans-are-human/21-podcastukkah-5-feedback-GV1w9h8mJld/">Dec 7, 2018</a>, Annie records and publishes an episode of her podcast featuring Sam Altman, Max Altman, and Jack Altman: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/09LDNc5PMBfpJUr3M02Tcp?si=VUxVTmnRTnGGqfu5Mld04w">21. Podcastukkah #5: Feedback is feedback with Sam Altman, Max Altman, and Jack Altman</a>.<ol><li id="block164">At this point in time, Annie still has not yet remembered / processed what Sam did to her at age 4. This is why she is ok with doing this podcast episode with Sam and her other brothers.</li><li id="block165">Following the recording of Annie's podcast episode with her brothers Sam, Jack, and Max in 2018, Sam (and Jack) refuse to share a link to the podcast, citing the argument that it "didn't align with their businesses" (as reported in nymag; see above.)</li></ol></li><li id="block166">In 2019, Annie gets sick with PCOS, an IBS flare-up, a long-term problem with her Achilles (not sure on the specifics), and posterior tibial tendinopathy, as well as with a bout of tonsilitis.</li><li id="block167">Also, in 2019, about a year after her Dad's death, Annie is notified about being (as stated in her Dad's will) the primary beneficiary of her Dad's 401K.</li><li id="block168">In light of these situational factors, Annie makes a plan to quit her job for 6 months to focus on her health. <i>She notifies her relatives </i>(from what I understand, primarily: Sam Altman, Jack Altman, Max Altman, and her mother) <i>of this plan.</i>&nbsp;</li><li id="block169"><span>Annie carries out her plan as intended. However,</span><i><span> </span></i><span>Sam, as well as Annie's mother and some of her other relatives, exploit a loophole that allows them to withhold the money that Annie's Dad left to her in his will.&nbsp;</span><br><span>At some point, Annie is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709977862252658703"><span>connected with one of Sam Altman's lawyers.</span></a><span> Annie is told that she will only receive money if she starts taking Zoloft again (c.f. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1708193951319306299"><span>this source</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html"><span>this source</span></a><span>), which she had stopped taking at age 22 (c.f. </span><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830"><span>this source</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html"><span>this source</span></a><span>.)&nbsp;</span></li><span></span><li id="block170">As a result, Annie basically ends up sick <i>and </i>low on money. She sells some items, returns to an older job, and, for the first time, asks her millionaire brothers/relatives for money, who proceed to haggle her about it and give her a hard time. She does "two family therapy sessions", which terminate when she is professionally advised to stop doing such sessions.</li><li id="block171">She moves back to Big Island (Hawai'i.) For some reason, Sam offers to send her a diamond of her Dad's ashes, even though 1) Annie is low on cash, and could use cash much more than an expensive Dad-ashes-diamond, and 2) Annie's Dad wanted just cremation, not diamond-ification. Annie finds this to be a very odd / insensitive gesture.</li><li id="block172">At this point, Annie has begun speaking out against Sam on social media. She has also begun "survival sex work." That is, because she was sick and broke, her options for (more conventional forms of) employment were very limited, and thus she was forced to resort to sex work to financially support herself.</li><li id="block173">In 2020, Sam offers to buy Annie a house...but there's strings attached. She has to meet with a Sam Altman lawyer. Annie sees this as an attempt by Sam to increase his control over her / suppress her (and her speaking out against him on social media.) She <i>refuses</i> his offer (which she frequently references as a "no contact" or "no family" decision.)</li><li id="block174">In 2020, Annie begins having <i>intense</i>, nearly day-long flashbacks, which last for 18 months. That is -<i> she begins to remember, and realize, that Sam Altman sexually assaulted her at age 4</i>.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block175">From what I understand, these flashbacks are a part of PTSD (relating to Sam's sexual assault of her 4-year-old self) that Annie begins to experience (she mentions PTSD specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1710039374224933175">here</a> and <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/an-open-letter-to-the-emdr-trauma-therapist-who-fired-me-for-doing-sex-work-f5f537218b45">here</a>.)</li></ol></li><li id="block176">Annie seems to think (<a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709629089366348100">here</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709629659242242058">here</a>) that Sam was hoping that Annie would die or commit suicide before she could do too much damage to Sam' s reputation, carrying her knowledge to the grave.</li><li id="block177">Annie continues to speak out against Sam on social media, including through various posts on Twitter/X (c.f. the <i>Relevant excerpts from Annie's social media accounts</i> section of this post.)</li><li id="block178">In 2023, some of Annie's X posts receive newfound attention / rediscovery on X.<ol><li id="block179">One of the people who sees them first the first time is me. This leads to the writing of this post.</li></ol></li></ol><h2 id="How_to_interpret_these_claims_"><u>How to interpret these claims?</u></h2><ul><li id="block181">Annie has been making these claims for a long time, and has been self-consistent in the way she has been making them, from what I can tell.</li><li id="block182">However, Annie has not yet provided what I would consider <i><u>direct / indisputable proof</u></i> that her claims are true. Thus, rationally, I must consider Sam Altman innocent.</li><li id="block183">However, this is not to say that think Annie's claims are entirely false or implausible. Rather, I simply <i>do not know</i> whether Annie's claims are true or false.&nbsp;</li><li id="block184">Given the degree to which Annie has pursued these claims, I think one of the following is likely:<ol><li id="block185">The severe mental / psychological problems which Annie is dealing with have unfortunately caused her to misunderstand, misrepresent, disconnect (to some degree from), or selectively-filter reality into an incomplete understanding.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block186">Or, relatedly, perhaps <i>some</i> of the (less serious) things Annie has claimed (e.g. that she had problems with her phone service, had low engagement / potential shadowbanning on some of her social media accounts) did indeed occur, but she overextrapolated to a larger narrative behind these events that is innaccurate.</li></ol></li><li id="block187">Annie is indeed telling the truth, in whole or in part.</li></ol></li><li id="block188">I don't know which is true. Both are certainly <i>plausible</i> explanations.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 id="Things_I_find_Questionable_Unexplained"><u>Things I find Questionable/Unexplained</u></h2><ul><li id="block190">Annie has been speaking out about Sam for roughly 4 years now. In 2021, she made her claims <i>quite </i>clear on her X account. I am confused as to why there has been basically 0 coverage of her claims in the media? In general, why is Annie so absent in anything related to Sam Altman on the Internet, especially considering the nature of her relationship with Sam?<ul><li id="block191">The sole exception here, of course, is Elizabeth Weil's nymag article, but even this article doesn't directly state the entirety of the claims that Annie has made. Instead, it kind of vaguely addresses them, using somewhat inspecific phrasing like "Now those memories feel like abuse", or "Since 2020, she has been having flashbacks" that don't quite capture the gravity of what Annie has been claiming.</li></ul></li><li id="block192">If was Sam Altman was completely fine with <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/959528971913146368?lang=en">posting a link to Annie's Youtube channel on Twitter on Feb 2, 2018</a>, why did he (and Jack Altman) refuse to post a link to the <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/all-humans-are-human/21-podcastukkah-5-feedback-GV1w9h8mJld/#google_vignette">podcast episode he filmed with Annie on Dec 7, 2018</a> <i>on the basis that it "didn't align with {his} businesses", </i><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">as Annie claimed to Elizabeth Weil</a>?<ul><li id="block193">Assuming that Sam did indeed say this - again, as I am trying to be unbiased, there is no current <i>proof </i>that he said this - I am a bit confused, as it seems a bit inconsistent to me that Sam identified Annie's Youtube channel as "aligning with his businesses", yet identified the podcast that he recorded with Annie as "not aligning with his businesses." The reason I state that this seems inconsistent is because I don't see what exactly what it was about Annie's podcast that made it "not align" with Sam's businesses <i>given</i> that Annie's Youtube channel "did align."</li></ul></li><li id="block194">Why, as some commenters on Hacker News claim, has a post regarding Annie's claims that Sam sexually assaulted her at age 4 been repeatedly removed?<ol><li id="block195"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37785072">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37785072</a></li><li id="block196"><a href="https://twitter.com/JOSourcing/status/1710390512455401888">https://twitter.com/JOSourcing/status/1710390512455401888</a></li></ol></li></ul><h2 id="Anticipating_and_Responding_to_Potential_Objections"><u>Anticipating and Responding to Potential Objections</u></h2><p id="block198">I initially hesitated to make this post, because I was initially skeptical of Annie's claims.

She's <a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy">linking to her OnlyFans</a> and to her <a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1627113432205099008">Venmo, CashApp, and PayPal</a> on X."<ul><li id="block202"><i>My response</i>: I do think this is a reasonable objection. However, I think this behavior could be <i>plausible</i> in light of the chronology of Annie's life:&nbsp;<ul><li id="block203">A 13-year-old Sam sexually assaults a 4-year-old Annie.&nbsp;</li><li id="block204">As Annie grows older, she does not explicitly remember this event (until 2020), but experiences a multitude of severe psychological and mental traumas and illnesses stemming from this early sexual abuse (see above.)</li><li id="block205">When she begins to remember this event in 2020, it takes a severe toll on her (and she had already been dealing with many mental health issues since the age of 4 even without explicitly remembering Sam's sexual assault of her (as the source of her psychological maladies)), and weakens her ability to financially support herself.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li id="block206"><i>Objection 2</i>: "Annie hosted a podcast in 2018 with her brothers (Sam, Jack, and Max), but seems to have been unhappy that her brothers, particularly Sam, refused her request to share (the link to) her podcast (e.g. on Twitter.) This seems to potentially be part of a pattern of behavior wherein Annie tries to exploit the status of her brothers for her own gain."<ul><li id="block207"><i>My response</i>: I do think that this objection holds merit. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">In her nymag article</a>, Elizabeth Weil writes, "Among her various art projects, Annie makes a podcast called <i>All Humans Are Human.</i> The first Thanksgiving after their father’s death, all the brothers agreed to record an episode with her. Annie wanted to talk on air about the psychological phenomenon of projection: what we put on other people. The brothers steered the conversation into the idea of feedback — specifically, how to give feedback at work. After she posted the show online, Annie hoped her siblings, particularly Sam, would share it. He’d contributed to their brothers’ careers. Jack’s company, Lattice, had been through YC. “I was like, ‘You could just tweet the link. That would help. You don’t want to share your sister’s podcast that you came on?’” He did not. “Jack and Sam said it didn’t align with their businesses.”" I find this account to be <i>plausible</i>, yet do not think it entirely dispels the objection.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li id="block208"><i>Objection 3:</i> "It seems Annie has been dealing with a variety of severe mental and psychological ailments throughout her life. She also seems to smoke/drink occasionally. It may well be that these claims are borne purely out these sorts of ailments of hers (or are of some other untrustworthy origin)."<ul><li id="block209"><i>My response</i>: I think this is a valid concern to raise. As with much of the information presented here, I would be interested in hearing more from Annie.</li></ul></li><li id="block210"><i>Objection 4</i>: "While Annie's claims are concerning, and her online activity and presence across a variety of media platforms does potentially support her claims, Annie has provided no direct evidence to corroborate her claims. We ought to hold Sam Altman innocent until proven guilty."<ul><li id="block211"><i>My response</i>: I think this is a valid position. I actually agree with it.

Annie, to the best of my knowledge, has not provided direct proof - the sort that would be usable in court - of the claims she's made of Sam Altman.</p><p id="block213">I currently hold that I <i>do not know if Annie's claims are true or not</i>, though I will note that her online activity have been self-consistent over a long period of time, and seems to match up with activity from Sam in a few places (e.g. in the podcast episode she recorded with him.) I currently <i>cannot disprove</i> Sam Altman's innocence, as I do not think I can say that he has been <i>proven guilty</i>.&nbsp;</p><p id="block214">Rather, as previously stated, I am hoping to draw attention to a body of information that I think warrants further investigation, as I think that there is a nonzero probability that Annie is telling the truth, in whole or in part, and that this must be taken extremely seriously in light of the gravity of the claims she is making and the position of the person about whom she is making them.</p><p id="block215">The information provided above makes me think it is likely that Sam Altman is aware of the claims that Annie Altman has made about him.

The idea of recovered memories was already discredited decades ago after the peak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_panic">satanic ritual abuse hysteria/panic</a> of the 80's.  At its peak some parents were jailed based on testimonies of children, children that had been coerced (both deliberately and indirectly) into recanting fantastical, increasingly outlandish tales of satanic baby eating rituals.  The FBI even eventually investigated and found 0 evidence, but the turning point was when some lawyers and psychiatrists started winning lawsuits against the psychologists and social workers at the center of the recovered memory movement.</p>
<p>Memories change every time they are rehearsed/reimagined; the magnitude of such change varies and can be significant, and the thin separation between imaginings (imagined memories, memories/stories of others, etc) and 'factual' memories doesn't really erode so much as not really exist in the first place.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some people's detailed memories from childhood are probably largely accurate, but some detailed childhood memories are complete confabulations based on internalization of external evidence, and some are later confabulations based on attempts to remember or recall and extensive dwelling on the past, and some are complete fiction.  No way with current tech to distinguish between, even for the rememberer.</p>
</div><div id="ejFAkp9msr2bpTFBc"><p>Bessel van der Kolk claimed the following in <i>The Body Keeps the Score:</i></p><blockquote><p>There have in fact been hundreds of scientific publications spanning well over a century documenting how the memory of trauma can be repressed, only to resurface years or decades later. Memory loss has been reported in people who have experienced natural disasters, accidents, war trauma, kidnapping, torture, concentration camps, and physical and sexual abuse. Total memory loss is most common in childhood sexual abuse, with incidence ranging from 19 percent to 38 percent. This issue is not particularly controversial: As early as 1980 the DSM-III recognized the existence of memory loss for traumatic events in the diagnostic criteria for dissociative amnesia: “an inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness.” Memory loss has been part of the criteria for PTSD since that diagnosis was first introduced.</p><p>One of the most interesting studies of repressed memory was conducted by Dr. Linda Meyer Williams, which began when she was a graduate student in sociology at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1970s</p></blockquote><p>... <span>(read more)</span></p></div><div id="PDyHgqK5aWGnWpt5W"><p>I know someone who recovered memories of repeated abuse including from the age of four later in their teenage years. The parents could corroborate a lot of circumstances around those memories, which suggests that they're likely broadly accurate. For instance, things like "they told their mother about the abuse when they were four, and the mother remembered that this conversation happened." Or "the parents spoke to the abuser and he basically admitted it." There was also suicidal ideation at around age six (similarity to Annie's story). In addition, the person remembers things like, when playing with children's toy figures (human-like animals), they would not play with these toy figures like ordinary children and instead think about plots that involve bleeding between legs and sexual assault. (This is much more detailed than Annie’s story, but remembering panic attacks as the first memory and having them as a child at least seems like evidence that she was strongly affected by something that had happened.)</p><p>Note that the person in question recovered these memories alone years before having any therapy.</p><p>It's probably easier to remember abuse (or for this to manifest itself in child beha... <span>(read more)</span></p></div><div id="bqXvsxhF9vDtxX9Ht"><p><span><div><p><span>8</span><span>Elizabeth</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>The chances she remembers it accurately? very small.

Is it true that someone with psychosis (assuming your judgement is correct) making an allegation of sexual abuse is more likely to be lying/mistaken than not?&nbsp;

I.e someone with psychosis making a claim like the above is less likely than someone without psychosis to be accurately interpreting reality, but is their claim more likely to be false than not? Your argument leans heavily on her having psychosis. Do people with psychosis make more false allegations of sexual assault that true allegations?&nbsp;

Breiding et al., 2014 estimates that around 19.3% of women in the US have been sexually assaulted.

It's probably partly that, but it's also partly that it's considered impolite to point out when someone is mentally ill. In part this is because unfortunately doing so can strengthen a paranoid person's feeling of persecution.

When a friend of mine suffered a psychotic break, she had many technology related delusions, and she reached out to me for advice because I work in technology. I wasn't sure how to handle it so I consulted a professional. Under their advice, I gave her general advice on how to protect herself from breaches (strong passwords, HTTPS everywhere extension, etc.) and didn't otherwise try to disillusion her. My role as a friend was to stay her friend, not try to break her delusions. Paranoid people already have enough enemies, imaginary though they may be.&nbsp;

Of course, once delusions have been put into print, it's now a public forum. (One might question the ethics of publishing such an article). But politeness norms often extend into public forums.&nbsp;

If anything, happening of Me-Too movement is an evidence in favor of base rates of sexual assault being highter. You can't use it existence to lower the probability estimate of this particular allegation being true, without contradicting conservation of expected evidence.

Similarly, with mental health issues. They can be downstream of sexual abuse or they can lead to falsly believing that you were abused. Priviledging one hypothesis over the other requires some kind of evidence. What are the rates of abused person developping mental health issues, similar to what can be observed of Annie Altman? What are the rates of people with similar to Annie Altman issues having delusions about sexual assault?

You are comparing wrong numbers. As I've already said what we need to compare is the rate of this kind of mental health symptoms among people who were not sexually abused in their childhood and then developped delusions about sexual assualt with the probability of people being sexually abused in their childhood and then developping this kind of simptoms. This will give us a prior to distinguish between two hypothesis.&nbsp;

All the other complications like shadowbanning, family members conspiring, being written out of the will, etc. are not relevant to the main issue. A scenario where a girl was sexually abused as by her brothers, which resulted in her devolopping mental health issues, which lead her to inaccurately believe that she is shadowbanned in the internet isn't absolving for the brothers. Of course if the other allegations are also true/partially true it makes the situation even more severe. But they have to be examined on their own and not dissmissed all together.</p></div></span></p></div></div></div><div id="htzd7BtAA9upCLkPL"><div><p>I'm confused about and skeptical of the justifiability of all the downvotes this post received.</p><ol><li>If the allegations are true, well, I'm <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/sam-altman-s-sister-annie-altman-claims-sam-has-severely?commentId=hcqiBJCAKuXqC9tKP">not sure</a> how important exactly it is, but it seems at least like it passes the bar of "worth knowing about" pretty easily.</li><li>If something passes that bar pretty easily, I guess the next question is how plausible it is.

I think, though I did a pretty good job with being rational in this post, and trying to make rational, unbiased claims from/using the information that exists, I could have been a bit more refined and clear-cut.

I honestly feel a bit bad, because this is an important issue, and I hope I didn't screw things up by (unintentionally) presenting things in a irrational or biased way. I'll try to be very rational and unbiased in this comment.

I think my statement that I was "trying to figure out the truth" in an earlier comment was misguided and imprecise. You were keen to notice this. In a situation like this, there are large amounts of uncertainty, and there is currently no proof of misconduct (that I've seen.)

I think what this post does is {provide a (relatively) accurate description of the state of affairs regarding Annie's claims.} I do feel pretty good about the way in which I presented the information relevant to this matter in this post. Though I don't want to necessarily "take shots" at Elizabeth Weil, whose nymag article provided basically the only significant written third-party acknowledgment of Annie's claims, I will say that I prefer the (hopefully, more) objective, straight-from-the-source, uncertainty-acknowledging approach I've taken here.

The key thing here is that, currently, the primary information we have is:

 1. Claims that Annie has made on social media, as well as a few pictures of her from when she was sick that she took, and a few screenshots of her social media that potentially indicate, but do not provably or definitively, indicate that she experienced shadowbanning, let alone that the low engagement/shadowbanning occured because of Sam. It is important to avoid the conjunction fallacy:
    
    Let A = the event that Annie Altman, or (digital) media relating to her did indeed experience shadowbanning, low engagement, etc.
    Let B = the event that </p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="ewihvex9FczJayebj"><div><p>Also a practical question about how to interpret this is how reliable flashbacks that occur many years later the event without memory of the event in the time inbetween are.

<p>Like as far as I understand, dissociation is A Thing, but the people who talk about it still don't have a solid understanding of how it can or cannot work, and are often mistaken about the science of it and of trauma? (In particular overestimating the validity of some of the science.)</p>
<p>And conversely, some recovered memories are fake, but the people who talk about this tend to deny the possibility of dissociation and don't really have any scalable way of determining the validity or invalidity of such memories, so they just round it off to always being fake without having solid support for that?</p>

As I note in my response to "Objection 4", Annie has provided no direct evidence to corroborate her claims, to the best of my knowledge.&nbsp;

I also acknowledge that the links I provided (e.g. from saprea.org) do not meet rigorous standards that would enable me to label them as "scientific" or "empiric" evidence to corroborate Annie's account. I provide them merely as a way of noting that the symptoms that Annie's reported seem plausible.

As I mentioned, the intent of this post is to promote discussion about the claims that Annie has made, and to spread awareness of the fact that Sam has not yet responded to Annie's (very serious claims.) This post does not claim that Annie's claims are provably or indisputably valid. In fact, I think the opposite is true: her claims are not yet corroborated by direct evidence, and they certainly are disputable. I currently hold Sam Altman to be innocent, until proven guilty.&nbsp;

In spite of this, I still thought that this post was worth making, as a means of bringing attention to Annie's claims, which I think have a nonzero probability of being true in whole or in part.</p></div></span></p><div id="b39yT8g7p8f9yHpui"><p><span><div><p><span>3</span><span>tailcalled</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>This seems like a thing that, even if true, would not lead to any direct evidence?

Deviating a bit from your reply to the more general question of "What direct evidence could be provided (e.g. by Annie) to corroborate the claims Annie is making?" -- I do think that a potentially useful piece of evidence that could be provided to corroborate (some of) Annie's claims would be proof that:

Obviously pedophiles are much more likely to sexually assault children than teliophiles are, and from what I've heard pedophiles are more likely to have no particular preference (or only weak preferences) for whether their victims are male or female. But pedophilic child molesters tend to have strong preferences for children, which is in tension with Sam Altman being attracted to adult men.

Alternatively I've heard that some teliophiles molest children out of opportunism, but that seems somewhat counterintuitive to me (in order to see children as a sexual opportunity, wouldn't they need to be attracted to them?). It's less counterintuitive if we're talking about teens (sexual attractiveness to teliophiles tends to gradually increase due to age, rather than suddenly spiking up at the age of consent), but that doesn't square with Annie being four years old. I'm pretty sure this type of child molester tends to have a correspondence between their preference for adults's sex and their preference for children's sex, but I also think their preference for children's sex is weaker than their preference for adult's sex.

These explanations are all making reference to the perpetrator's sexuality, though of course in much more complex and nuanced ways than gay/straight/bi.</p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="GcGdpqhgrMiySch6J"><p><span><div><p><span>8</span><span>DanielFilan</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>[epistemic status: i know nothing]

Also -- I could care less about what people opine (without backing logical/rational arguments.) I could have chosen to do a big long rant with a bunch of clickbait-y quips and half-truthisms on X to try to jack up engagement and suck ad revenue out of X like a leach, but luckily I'm not an asshole (in my humble opinion, lol), so I came here instead. (Not to imply that you said that; I just say this more in an attempt to convey my motives and character.) I came to this site in particular because:

 1. I thought its users would probably understand the significance of a claim that Sam Altman has been quietly hiding the fact that he sexually assaulted his 4-year-old sister.
 2. I thought that its users would be good at calling me out on any logical/irrational bullshit that I (unintentionally) propagated. I want to be right, not to feel right. Say what you will about LessWrong, but its users do love to be quite exacting in their arguments about whether or not they think a person is making rational arguments. Indeed, I've modified this post, and my replies, many times in response to comments I've received in a way that I think has been to the benefit of the clarity of this post and its conveyance of my position. I'm glad that my karma score has jumped all over the place as I've updated my post - it means that LessWrong users are actually thinking critically about the degree to which I am being rational.&nbsp;

It seems to me, at this point, one of two things is true:

 1. Annie Altman is lying left, right,. and center, or is deluded, disconnected from reality, or just misinformed/misunderstanding things to the point that she believes she is telling the truth when she is not.
 2. She is not lying (at least, to some degree.)

We can debate whether Sam Altman's alleged offenses are relevant to this forum, but I don't think there's any case to be made that his sister's mental health or honesty is relevant to anyone here. In which case the question isn't "is Annie lying?", it's "what did Sam Altman do? is it a pattern" and perhaps "is there any additional context we should know?"[1].&nbsp;

If this doesn't happen, it's probabilistic evidence against the worst tail scenarios of character traits, which would be helpful if we could significantly discount that.

FWIW the information you have presented makes it seem like you are building a case against Sam Altman moreso than Annie herself is.

Actually, right now, I believe that, based upon the information I currently have, it is improper for me to conclude that Sam Altman abused Annie Altman, and that the proper stance is I do not know if Annie Altman's claims are correct or not; therefore, it is only rational to hold Sam Altman innocent.

However -- I'm in the process of gathering more information. Once I've conducted research to a degree I consider satisfactory, I'd be happy to hear your reasoning if, at that point, our conclusions disagree. For now, I'll suggest that you wait until I finish up my research, though feel free to ignore this suggestion if you want :)&nbsp;</p></div></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="w9bKuLEfGpfApmDT6"><div><p>"I would like to note that this is my first post on LessWrong."

What could cause me to change my mind? Here are my cruxes.

If character assessment posts about particular people can be shown to cause a useful actions or ways of thinking for readers more often than they distract readers by unverifiable gossip.

If character assessment posts about particular people is used as a case study for reasoning about particular people to teach a broader lesson.

If character assessment posts about particular people allows community members to protect themselves from a real danger.

However, my beliefs are that these types of posts are juicy gossip that fuel idle speculation and status hierarchy games and serve no purpose except to make those who engage with content worse people who think more simplistically about human behavior and motivation. Even though this particular post is done fairly well for what it is, I think it is "bad form" and, perhaps, on the wrong site.</p></div></span></p><div id="AzseGSZ6pzwEJ5zqm"><p><span><div><p><span>4</span><span>Adam Zerner</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>It makes me happy to see such a cruxy comment like this. Thanks.

The cruxes seem reasonable. However, I feel like it's appropriate to upvote/downvote based on how confident you are on your position for each of them. Like, if it's really clear that a particular post will have the consequence of pushing people really far towards distracting gossip and away from useful actions, then downvote. If the opposite, maybe upvote. If it's unclear, probably do nothing.

Because this post is about the person who might be the most powerful person in the domain of AI, and thus is perhaps the most important person in the entire world, or even perhaps throughout history, I think it's actually a decently important topic. Because of magnitude, not probability. Like, even if there is a low probability that we figure out the truth, and of P(useful action | figure out truth), the magnitude of the positive impact could very well be large, and so it seems to me like a topic that is plausibly worth exploring. Enough that I upvoted it.

I think I personally have a tendency to see people like Sam Altman and Elon Musk and get caught up in thinking they're so awesome, and then am a victim of the halo effect. I find concrete examples of "wait, they frequently do things that aren't very awesome" helpful. I suspect the same is true for many others.</p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="F4Qoo7qQupEuaZNBW"><p><span><div><p><span>0</span><span>Adam Zerner</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>It makes things more difficult, but by wielding Bayescraft appropriately, discussion and updating can certainly still occur.

Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, will serve as interim CEO, effective immediately.</p><p>A member of OpenAI’s leadership team for five years, Mira has played a critical role in OpenAI’s evolution into a global AI leader. She brings a unique skill set, understanding of the company’s values, operations, and business, and already leads the company’s research, product, and safety functions.&nbsp;Given her long tenure and close engagement with all aspects of the company, including her experience in AI governance and policy, the board believes she is uniquely qualified for the role and anticipates a seamless transition while it conducts a formal search for a permanent CEO.</p><p>Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.</p><p>In a statement, the board of directors said: “OpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity. The board remains fully committed to serving this mission. We are grateful for Sam’s many contributions to the founding and growth of OpenAI. At the same time, we believe new leadership is necessary as we move forward. As the leader of the company’s research, product, and safety functions, Mira is exceptionally qualified to step into the role of interim CEO. We have the utmost confidence in her ability to lead OpenAI during this transition period.”</p><p>OpenAI’s board of directors consists of OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, independent directors Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, technology entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology’s Helen Toner.</p><p>As a part of this transition,&nbsp;Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board and will remain in his role at the company, reporting to the CEO.</p><p>OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015 with the core mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. In 2019, OpenAI restructured to ensure that the company could raise capital in pursuit of this mission, while preserving the nonprofit's mission, governance, and oversight. The majority of the board is independent, and the independent directors do not hold equity in OpenAI. While the company has experienced dramatic growth, it remains the fundamental governance responsibility of the board to advance OpenAI’s mission and preserve the principles of its Charter.<br></p></div></div>]]></description>

                            <p>Originally released as a CD exclusive for magazines and hardware manufacturers, this mini-campaign was built by the Half-Life team right after the game went gold. As this was many people's first experience with Half-Life, we thought it was finally time to bundle it with the main game—no sound card purchase necessary.</p>

                            <p>Built by Valve level designers, these new maps push the limits of what's possible in the Half-Life engine.</p>

                                    <p>Two-foot-thick steel doors block off access to this contaminated waste facility, which has questionable scientific goals at best. Strap on a gluon gun and roast all intruders.</p>

                                    <p>Enjoy a relaxing stay at this abandoned Xen outpost built around a cluster of soothing healing pools free-floating in space. How do you breathe here? It doesn't matter!</p>

                                    <p>Processing Area 3, a massive radioactive waste plant gone quiet. Tons of room for you and your colleagues to do experiments with a Tau Cannon or some hand grenades.</p>

                                    <p>The creaking weight of this decaying orbital satellite launch facility somehow feels familiar… If we could switch on the oxygen lines, power, and fuel, we might just be able to light this candle.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>At the Malmo port in southern Sweden, a cargo ship looms over row after row of shiny new cars — Volkswagens, Volvos, Mercedes.</p><p>Notably missing are Teslas. That's because dockworkers are refusing to unload them.</p><p>Goran Larsson, a cargo ship inspector, said he's informing the crew on each arriving vessel of the labor action and assessing whether any Teslas are on board.</p><p>"We want there to be good regulation in Sweden — law and order all around the workplaces," Larsson said. "And this is the first step that we will do."</p><p>Tesla has long fended off efforts to unionize its workforce around the world. But in Sweden, the electric vehicle maker is facing its first formal labor action over its anti-union stance, with potential ripple effects for the company globally.</p><p>The Swedish metal and industrial workers union, IF Metall, which represents Tesla's roughly 120 workers, launched a walkout at the company in late October.</p><p>And now, Swedish workers of all stripes – dockworkers, electricians, cleaners and others – are banding together to boycott the U.S. company in solidarity.</p><p>The strike is a response to the company's refusal to sign a collective bargaining agreement for its employees, almost all of them mechanics, because Tesla doesn't have a manufacturing plant in Sweden.</p><h3>Even postal workers will stop delivering mail to Tesla</h3><p>About 90% of the entire Swedish workforce belong to trade unions and they are covered by contracts with their employers, which standardize pay rates, insurance and pensions, among other work conditions, in each sector.</p>
      <hr><p>
      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/1209109868">Why workers are resorting to more strikes this year to pressure companies </a></p><hr><p>"This is the way we regulate working conditions in Sweden and has been for a long, long time," said IF Metall spokesperson Jesper Pettersson. "It has been very beneficial for both parties – both for employers and for employees."</p><p>The Swedish labor movement is rallying behind the relatively small group of Tesla mechanics, who repair Tesla vehicles at service centers.</p><p>Thousands of workers are refusing to touch any Teslas until the company signs a contract. And the boycott keeps expanding. Postal workers have said they will stop delivering mail addressed to the company if there's no deal by Nov. 20.</p><h3>Trade unions are part of the fabric of the Swedish economy</h3><p>They see the American EV maker's efforts to circumvent collective bargaining as an affront to the entire Swedish labor system, where trade unions are part of the fabric of the economy.</p><p>Dockworkers represented by Sweden's transport workers' union have been blocking all imports of Teslas at Sweden's four main ports since last week. And this Friday, they're set to expand their blockade to the entire country.</p><p>Tommy Wreeth, chairman of the transport workers' union, said the Swedish labor system is based on collective bargaining agreements, which Tesla, led by the staunchly anti-union Elon Musk, is reluctant to embrace.</p>
      <hr><p>
      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/1198938942">Sky-high CEO pay is in focus as workers everywhere are demanding higher wages</a></p><hr><p>"It's very important to protect our model – it's a fight for the model, not just for the Tesla workers," Wreeth said, referring to his union's solidarity boycott.</p><p>Tesla did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. A Tesla representative told Sweden's TT News Agency that the company is choosing not to enter into a collective agreement.</p><p>"We already offer equivalent or better agreements than those covered by collective bargaining and find no reason to sign any other agreement," Tesla told TT.</p><p>A Tesla mechanic in Gothenburg, who requested anonymity due to concern about retaliation by the company, said he thinks a union agreement would provide a financial safety net that "allows us as employees to be able to have security."</p><h3>"Symbolically important" fight</h3><p>Despite the broad nature of the protests lodged by the unions, they have an uphill battle on their hands. Sweden is a relatively small market for Tesla – its fifth biggest in Europe this year. And Tesla doesn't manufacture any cars in the Nordic country, meaning it could theoretically decide to leave the country altogether.</p>
      <hr><p>
      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/1206209107">UAW members aren't all assembling cars. More and more are unionized grad students</a></p><hr><p>But German Bender, a labor market analyst at Stockholm think tank Arena Idé, said it's unlikely Tesla will leave Sweden. And he doubts the Swedish unions will give up anytime soon – their fight, he said, is "too symbolically important" to abandon.</p><p>"And it becomes more symbolically important the longer the strike goes on," Bender said.</p><h3>Europe's one Tesla factory in Germany also has a union drive</h3><p>The strike is, at its core, a domestic issue – it's about a foreign company at odds with Sweden's labor norms and values.</p><p>But the labor action comes as unions in bigger markets are also challenging Tesla. Musk is facing, for instance, a union drive at its factory in Germany.</p><p>It is Tesla's only factory in Europe: the Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory, one of six such plants worldwide.</p><p>In the United States, the Texas-based automaker has so far thwarted all attempts to unionize its workforce. But the United Auto Workers union has set its sights on Tesla, after negotiating major deals with the Detroit Three automakers.</p><p>"If the Tesla workers in Sweden would manage to sign the first collective agreement ever with Tesla, I think that could have a symbolic importance in other markets," Bender said.</p><p>Atle Hoie, general secretary of IndustriALL Global Union which represents industrial workers around the world, said large-scale strikes like this one are rare in Sweden. He said the solidarity from Swedish unions across sectors, including from dockworkers, is a "big blow to Tesla" both within and beyond the Nordic country, sending the message that Tesla "is not immune to organizing."</p><p>Anders Gustafsson, a former dockworker who now works for the Swedish transport workers' union, said his union has received messages of support from unions in other countries, including in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>"We hope that Tesla workers all around the world actually take that fight," Gustafsson said. "Somebody needs to be first."</p>

Entirely unique to Rocket, sentinels offer an automatic last line of defense against runtime errors by enabling any type that appears in a route to abort application launch under invalid conditions. For example, the <a href="https://api.rocket.rs/master/rocket/struct.State.html"><code>&amp;State&lt;T&gt;</code></a> guard in v0.5 is a <a href="https://api.rocket.rs/master/rocket/trait.Sentinel.html"><code>Sentinel</code></a> that aborts launch if the type <code>T</code> is not in managed state, thus preventing associated runtime errors.</p><p><a href="https://api.rocket.rs/master/rocket/trait.Sentinel.html"><code>Sentinel</code></a>s can be implemented outside of Rocket, too, and you should seek to do so whenever possible.

To that end, here's what's on the docket for the next major release:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Migration to RWF2</strong></p><p>Discussed further in the <a href="https://rocket.rs/v0.5/news/2023-11-17-rwf2-prelaunch/">RWF2 prelaunch announcement</a>, Rocket will transition to being managed by the newly formed Rocket Web Framework Foundation: <em>RWF2</em>. The net effect is increased development transparency, including public roadmaps and periodic updates, financial support for high-quality contributions, and codified pathways into the project's governance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pluggable Connection Listeners</strong></p><p>Rocket currently expects and enjoins connection origination via TCP/IP. While sufficient for the common case, it excludes other desirable interfaces such as Unix Domain Sockets (UDS).</p><p>In the next major release, Rocket will expose [an interface for implementing and plugging-in custom connection listeners]. Rocket itself will make use of this interface to expose more common mediums out-of-the-box, such as the aforementioned UDS.</p></li><li><p><strong>Native <code>async</code> Traits</strong></p><p>Given the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/115822">stabilization of <code>async fn</code> in traits</a>, the next major release will seek to eliminate Rocket's dependence on <code>#[async_trait]</code> opting instead for native <code>async</code> traits. This will greatly improve our documentation, which currently calls out the attribute for each affected trait, as well as offer modest performance improvements.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/749"><strong>Typed Catchers</strong></a></p><p>Today's catchers cannot receive strictly typed error data. This results in workarounds where error data is queried for well-typedness at runtime. While it <em>has</em> been possible to implement a form of typed error catching prior, doing so necessitated limiting error data to <code>'static</code> values, as other Rust web frameworks do, a concession we're unwilling to make.</p><p>After much experimentation, we have an approach that is ergonomic to use, safe, and correct, all without the <code>'static</code> limitation. This will allow error catchers to "pattern match" against error types at compile-time. At runtime, Rocket will match emerging error types against the declared catchers and call the appropriate catcher with the fully-typed value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Short-Circuitable Request Processing</strong></p><p>Whether with success or failure, fairings and guards cannot presently terminate request processing early. The rationale for forbidding this functionality was that it would allow third-party crates and plugins to dictate responses without offering any recourse to the top-level application.</p><p>With the advent of typed catchers, however, we now have a mechanism by which a top-level application can intercept early responses via their type, resolving the prior concern. As such, in the next major release, fairings and guards will be able to respond to requests early, and catchers will be able to intercept those early responses at will.</p></li><li><p><strong>Associated Resources</strong></p><p>Often a set of routes will share a set requirements. For example, they may share a URI prefix, subset of guards, and some managed state. In today's Rocket, these common requirements must be repeatedly specified for each route. While this is by design (we <em>want</em> a route's requirements to be obvious), the repetition is arduous and potentially error prone.</p><p>In an upcoming major release, Rocket will introduce new mechanisms by which a set of routes can share an explicitly declared set of requirements. Their <em>explicit</em> and <em>declarative</em> nature results in requirements that are simultaneously obvious <em>and</em> declared once.</p><p>We're really excited about this upcoming change and will be announcing more in the near future.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance Improvements</strong></p><p>Rocket appears to lag behind other Rust web frameworks in benchmarks. This is partly due to <a href="https://rocket.rs/guide/faq/#performance">poor benchmarking</a>, partly due to security-minded design decisions, and partially due to unexploited opportunities. In the next release, we'll be addressing the latter points. Specifically:</p><ul><li><p><em>Explore making work stealing optional.</em></p><p>Rocket currently defaults to using tokio's multithreaded, work-stealing scheduler. This avoids tail latency issues when faced with irregular and heterogeneous tasks at the expense of throughput due to higher bookkeeping costs associated with work stealing. Other Rust web frameworks instead opt to use tokio's single-threaded scheduler, which while theoretically suboptimal, may yield better performance results in practice, especially when benchmarking homogeneous workloads.</p><p>While we believe work-stealing schedulers are the right choice for the majority of applications desireing robust performance characteristics, we also believe the choice should be the user's. We'll seek to make this choice easier in the next release.</p></li><li><p><em>Reduce conversions from external to internal HTTP types.</em></p><p>Rocket revalidates and sometimes copies incoming HTTP request data. In Rocket v0.5, we began transitioning to a model where we revalidate security insensitive data in debug mode only, allowing for bugs to be caught and reported while reducing performance impacts in production. In the next release, we seek to extend this approach.</p></li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="thank-you">❤️ Thank You<a href="#thank-you" title="perma link">#</a></h3><p>A very special thank you to <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/commits?author=jebrosen">Jeb Rosen</a>, Rocket's maintainer from v0.4 to v0.5-rc.1, without whom Rocket v0.5 wouldn't exist.

(US Army/Sgt. 1st Class Marisol Walker)</p></div>
<p><span>WASHINGTON — For the sixth year in a row, the Pentagon has failed its </span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/tag/audit/"><span>annual audit</span></a><span>, while contending it made incremental, year-over-year progress.</span></p>
<p><span>“Auditing the Department’s $3.8 trillion in assets and $4.0 trillion in liabilities is a massive undertaking… but the improvements and changes we are making every day as a result of these audits positively affect every soldier, sailor, airman, marine, guardian, and DoD civilian,” Michael McCord, the Department of Defense (DoD) Under Secretary of Defense and Chief Financial Officer, wrote in a statement Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>The department unveiled its latest audit on Wednesday and, similar to<a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2022/11/not-the-progress-i-would-have-hoped-for-pentagon-fails-latest-financial-audit/"> last year’s</a>, it examined 29 standalone entities, from the Military Retirement Fund to different military agencies. Of those it gave only seven an “unmodified opinion,” or clean audit, in which auditors determined their financial statements were presented fairly and that they adhered to accounting principles.</p>

<p><span>Only one audit, the Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund, received an “qualified opinion” this year, meaning auditors determined there were misstatements, or potentially undetected misstatements, but those did not adversely influence the financial statements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While there are still three outstanding audits not yet wrapped up, the DoD reported that the remaining 18 failed, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and National Security Agency.<br>
</span></p>

<p><span>“We are working hard to address audit findings as well as recommendations from the </span><span>Government Accountability Office,” McCord wrote. “The components are making good progress resulting in meaningful benefits, but we must do more, and we cannot do this alone.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The department has now failed every audit since 2018, the year the first audit took place. The audit is conducted by the DoD’s Office of Inspector General along with an independent public accounting firm.<br>
</span></p>


<p><span> In 2020, then-Acting Comptroller Thomas Harker signaled that by 2027 the Pentagon could begin to pass its annual audit, an ascertain </span><span>McCord </span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2021/11/as-most-military-agencies-fail-annual-audit-comptroller-claims-steady-progress/"><span>previously stated </span></a><span>might not be viable.</span></p>
<p><span>While there is a lot of heavy lifting to do to get to a clean audit, McCord noted several steps forward this year and outlined additional ones that can be taken to help achieve a passing grade.</span></p>
<p><span>Those additional steps include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>An Oct. 13 memo from Dense Secretary Lloyd Austin to the service secretaries and principal staff assistants emphasizing and reinforcing expectations for supporting the DoD financial statement audits;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>More collaboration across DoD’s planners and programmers, the DoD financial management community, DoD leadership, the Office of Management and Budget, and Congress “to ensure alignment of priorities and resources;”&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A call for lawmakers to pass annual budgets on time and avoid continuing resolutions and shutdowns; and&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Asking defense contractors to pitch in by introducing “innovative, time-saving enterprise solutions,” and bringing their property into audit compliance.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The call for congressional help is a timely one, coming just hours after lawmakers agreed on a new continuing resolution that pushes the DoD’s budget battle to February next year — a regular source of frustration for senior Pentagon officials.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>We hop in the car to get groceries or drop kids at school. But while the car is convenient, these short trips add up in terms of emissions, pollution and petrol cost.  </p>

<p>Close to half (44%) of all Australian commuter trips are by car –&nbsp;and under 10km. Of Perth’s 4.2 million daily car trips, 2.8 are for distances of less than 2km.   </p>

<p>This is common in wealthier countries. In the United States, a staggering 60% of all car trips cover <a href="https://www.urbanismnext.org/resources/summary-of-travel-trends-2017-national-household-travel-survey">less than 10km</a>. </p>

<p>So what’s the best solution? You might think switching to an electric vehicle is the natural step. In fact, for short trips, an electric bike or moped might be better for you –&nbsp;and for the planet. That’s because these forms of transport – collectively known as electric micromobility – are cheaper to buy and run. </p>

<h2>How can that be?</h2>

<p>On the world’s roads last year, there were over 20 million electric vehicles and 1.3 million commercial EVs such as buses, delivery vans and trucks. </p>

<p>But these numbers of four or more wheel vehicles are wholly eclipsed by two- and three-wheelers. There were over 280 million electric mopeds, scooters, motorcycles and three-wheelers on the road last year. Their sheer popularity is already cutting demand for oil by a million barrels of oil a day –&nbsp;about 1% of the world’s total oil demand, according to estimates by <a href="https://bnef.turtl.co/story/evo-2022/page/2/1">Bloomberg New Energy Finance</a>. </p>

<p>What about electric vehicles, you ask? After all, EVs have been heralded as a silver bullet for car emissions and air pollution in cities, as their tailpipe emissions are zero. If charged with renewable power, they get even greener. </p>

<p>But to see them as an inarguable good is an error. They are cleaner cars, but they are still cars, taking up space on the roads and requiring a lot of electricity to power them. Their batteries make them heavier than a traditional car, and draw heavily on the extraction of rare earth elements. While EVs are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/climate/electric-vehicles-environment.html">overall much greener</a> than internal combustion engine cars, battery manufacture can undermine <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x">some of the gains</a>.</p>

<p>On the plus side, petrol cars cost about <a href="https://www.carsguide.com.au/ev/advice/do-electric-cars-actually-save-you-money-83060">A$0.14 per kilometre</a> in fuel, or about $1,820 in fuel annually for the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/tourism-and-transport/survey-motor-vehicle-use-australia/latest-release">average car doing 12,000km</a>. Maintenance averages at $910 a year, bringing the total to $2,730 for a petrol car.</p>

<p>By contrast, charging an EV would cost around $480 for that distance. Maintenance of $240 takes annual running costs to $720. So EVs are much cheaper to run. But they are expensive to buy.   </p>

<h2>What advantages do electric mopeds and bikes have?</h2>

<p>The electric transport revolution is a great chance to rethink how we move through our cities –&nbsp;and whether we even need a car at all. </p>

<p>Cars, after all, often have only one occupant. You’re expending a lot of energy to transport yourself. </p>

<p>By contrast, electric mopeds and bikes use a lot less energy to transport one or two people. They’re also a lot cheaper to buy and run than electric cars. </p>

<p>If you commute on an e-bike 20km a day, five days a week, your charging cost would be about $20 – annually. </p>

<p>In Australia, electric bikes are very rapidly going from a hobbyist pursuit to a serious mode of urban transport. Over 100,000 e-bikes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/08/its-also-just-fun-why-a-growing-number-of-australia-families-are-ditching-cars-for-e-bikes">were sold here</a> last year.</p>

<p>Of course, you’re unlikely to use electric mopeds or bikes to drive from Sydney to Melbourne. Their real value is in short-hop trips –&nbsp;the school run, the milk and bread run or even the commute –&nbsp;where they take roughly the same time or shorter than a car. </p>

<p>Smaller electric options like scooters and skateboards also offer a way to overcome the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation)">last kilometre problem</a> which plagues public  transport systems. This, in short, is the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-16/study-working-near-public-transit-is-more-important-to-non-car-commuters-than-living-near-it">inconvenient distance</a> between your home and the station or bus stop. Being able to cover this distance fast can be a game-changer for public transport. </p>

<p>If taken up, electric micromobility can cut urban emissions. A study of e-scooter riders in the United Kingdom found <a href="https://www.voi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/UCL-C_Emissions-Savings-Emissions-from-Shared-E-Scooters.pdf">these trips produced</a> up to 45% less carbon dioxide than alternatives. </p>

<p>US researchers estimate that if e-bike trips expanded to 11% of all vehicle trips, transport emissions <a href="https://www.itdp.org/2019/09/24/e-bikes-e-scooters-drivers-of-climate-action/">would fall by about 7%</a>. </p>

<p>As petrol prices increase and battery prices fall, the cheaper running costs of electric vehicles and even cheaper running costs of electric mopeds, bikes and scooters will keep eating away at the demand for oil. </p>

<p>Global oil demand is now <a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/iea-forecasts-global-oil-demand-peaking-by-2028">projected to peak</a> in 2028 at 105.7 million barrels per day –&nbsp;and then begin to fall, according to the International Energy Agency. </p>

<p>Electric vehicles will play a role in cutting oil demand. But it may well be that electric micromobility cuts demand faster, given how fast these cheaper, more plentiful options are being taken up. </p>

<h2>What does this mean for me?</h2>

<p>If you’re looking to go electric, it’s worth taking a close look at your transport needs. If you live in an outer suburb or regional towns, you may find the longer range and larger capacity of an electric car is better suited.</p>

<p>But for many people, it’s likely you’ll have a range of options. You might have one electric vehicle for longer trips, or group trips, as well as an e-bike for the school run or groceries. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> 
     <div> 
       <p> <img alt="" src="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/electric-vehicle-battery-prices-falling-f/800x450.png"></p> 
       <p> It wasn’t long ago rising demand and component shortages sparked concern that <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/batteries-the-greenflation-challenge-2.html">“greenflation” would drive up prices</a> for the batteries used in electric vehicles. That’s subsiding as prices cool for battery metals, which could help make EVs more competitive with traditional cars more quickly.&nbsp;</p> 
        
       <p> Goldman Sachs Research now expects battery prices to fall to $99 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of storage capacity by 2025 — a 40% decrease from 2022 (the previous forecast was for a 33% decline). Our analysts estimate that almost half of the decline will come from declining prices of <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/infographics/green-metals/index.html">EV raw materials</a> such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt. Battery pack prices are now expected to fall by an average of 11% per year from 2023 to 2030, writes Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Goldman Sachs Research’s Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research, in the team’s report.</p> 
       <p> As battery prices fall, Goldman Sachs Research estimates the EV market could achieve cost parity, without subsidies, with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles around the middle of this decade on a total-cost-of-ownership basis.&nbsp;</p> 
        
       <div><p> “The reduction in battery costs could lead to more competitive EV pricing, more extensive consumer adoption, and further growth in the total addressable markets for EVs and batteries,” says Bhandari.</p><p>  The EV market was initially driven by regulatory support around the world, but global EV penetration is starting to retreat from recent highs, a potential driver of which could be governments in Europe and China cutting back on subsidies.</p></div> 
        
       <p> Still, our analysts see the EV market transitioning to a new phase that is more heavily influenced by consumer adoption than government largesse as battery prices drop. The team’s base case estimate for global EV penetration jumps to 17% in 2025 from just 2% in 2020, and to 35% and 63% by 2030 and 2040, respectively. But its “hyper adoption” scenario sees EVs accounting for 21% of total global vehicle sales by 2025, 47% by 2030, and 86% by 2040.&nbsp;</p> 
        
       <p> So far China is leading the way — its EVs are more competitively priced against ICEs in its local market relative to Europe and the US. While EV sales there have been subsidized by Chinese EV producers, which are selling EVs at a loss, the Goldman Sachs Research expects this to eventually change in around the middle of the decade, when battery price declines and a scale-up in EV sales volumes lead to a significant reduction in EV costs. And whereas Chinese consumers are seeing more options of competitively priced EVs, carmakers in the US and Europe have so far focused on larger and more luxurious EV models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
       <p> “We believe the EV market in China could be the closest to a consumer-led EV adoption phase,” Bhandari says.</p> 
       <p> Our analysts also credit new battery technologies for their forecast of a more rapid decline in battery prices. The report highlights a handful of EV battery innovations that could be commercialized this decade, creating “pockets of strength” along the battery value chain. These include novel anode materials featuring silicon that replace or blend with graphite and improve energy density. Bhandari also notes there are new battery structures such as those that increase the size of each battery cell (large cylindrical batteries) that help simplify the pack manufacturing process, “leading to a meaningful savings of labor and machine time.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>from the <i>gop-living-down-to-its-reputation</i> dept</h3>

<p>For decades, big ISPs like AT&amp;T have refused to upgrade low income and poor communities to fiber, despite billions in subsidies, regulatory favors, and tax breaks that were supposed to accomplish <em>precisely that</em>. Groups like the National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA) have released studies on cities like <a href="https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2017/03/10/atts-digital-redlining-of-cleveland/">Cleveland</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2017/09/06/more-digital-redlining-att-deployment-and-poverty-in-detroit-and-toledo/">Detroit</a>, documenting how this discrimination lines up with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america">30s “redlining” efforts</a>. </p>
<p>Section 60506 of the 2021 infrastructure bill dedicated $65 billion in new broadband subsidies. But it also tasked the FCC with creating rules that would prevent future broadband deployment discrimination. The FCC came in just under the wire for Congress’ November 15 deadline, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-adopts-rules-prevent-eliminate-digital-discrimination">finally unveiling its full rules yesterday</a>. </p>
<p>I’ve spent much of the last few weeks talking to consumer groups, activists, and telecom policy experts about the rules.</p>
<p>The general consensus is that it’s a hugely welcome and long overdue improvement, even though the FCC stubbornly refuses to name and shame ISPs with long histories of clear discrimination (wouldn’t want to upset <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/08/17/new-leaks-confirm-ats-position-as-nsas-favorite-telco-partner/">key domestic surveillance allies</a>), the complaint process isn’t transparent, and many are worried that this FCC, with its sketchy track record on consumer protection, won’t consistently enforce them.</p>
<p>FCC boss Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-398477A2.pdf">had this to say about the new rules</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“These rules are strong. When you consider Congress explicitly directed us to “prevent”<br>and “eliminate” digital discrimination of access, they had better be. But I would also argue that they are fair and reasonable.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, these rules are a welcome and long overdue admission by the government that minority and low income Americans have been systematically discriminated against when it comes to broadband deployment, something that’s documentable and indisputably true, despite industry denials. </p>
<p>Late last year you’ll recall <a href="https://themarkup.org/still-loading/2022/10/19/dollars-to-megabits-you-may-be-paying-400-times-as-much-as-your-neighbor-for-internet-service">The Markup released a story</a> showing that not only do big ISPs systematically discriminate in deployment, they charge low income and minority customers more money for slower service than less diverse, more affluent neighborhoods. It’s not really a debate. </p>
<p>One thing consumer groups are happy about: the rules govern both “disparate treatment” (spotty broadband deployment caused by active, provable discrimination) and “disparate impact” (spotty broadband deployment that falls along discriminatory lines regardless of intent). Telecom execs don’t often put discriminatory intent in emails to staff, so proving discriminatory intent isn’t always possible. Other agencies like the NTIA had <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/press-release/2023/ntia-calls-strong-digital-discrimination-rules#:~:text=NTIA's%20filing%20urges%20the%20FCC,an%20ISP%20against%20a%20group.">advised the FCC adopt this broader approach</a>. </p>
<p>“Strong rules are needed to identify and remedy unequal access to Internet service, no matter what the cause may be,” NTIA Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information Alan Davidson wrote<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;“Rules that combat these inequities will bring lasting relief for vulnerable communities that historically have been left behind online.”</p>
<p>Giant incumbent telecom monopolies with decades of discrimination under their belt are unsurprisingly upset. Key trade groups have already <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/industry-hints-at-possible-legal-challenges-to-fcc-s-digital-discrimination-rules?mc_cid=e3190e9f79&amp;mc_eid=eb527a594e">threatened to sue</a> over the rules, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/internet-providers-say-the-fcc-should-not-investigate-broadband-prices/">seem particularly chaffed</a> that the rules govern discrimination in broadband pricing. They insist the rules interfere with “the practical business choices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant and dynamic free enterprise system.”</p>
<p>Here in reality, U.S. broadband is anything but a vibrant and dynamic free enterprise system. It’s a failed market, dominated by a handful of politically powerful regional mono/duopolies, who hoover up untold billions in taxpayer subsidies for networks they routinely fail to fully deploy. All protected by layers upon layers of state and federal corruption policymakers like to pretend doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Enter the GOP, which was quick to hyperventilate about the rules at industry’s prompt. Senator Ted Cruz and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/11/14/fcc-commish-brendan-carr-takes-a-break-from-crying-about-tiktok-to-lie-about-his-agencys-plan-to-combat-racism-in-broadband-deployment/">FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr</a> were particularly incensed, and quickly got to work <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fcc-commissioner-blasts-bidens-digital-equity-plan-unlawful-power-grab">peppering the media with false claims</a> that the rules were a dystopian Biden administration attempt to <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/gop-to-fcc-back-off-from-overbroad-digital-equity-rules">exert “government control over virtually all aspects of the Internet</a>,” despite it being a congressional mandate. </p>
<p>Recall, Republicans largely voted against the infrastructure bill, despite the fact that they <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/27/republicans-keep-taking-credit-for-billions-in-broadband-subsidies-only-made-possible-by-the-covid-relief-and-infrastructure-bills-they-vehemently-opposed/">still take credit for the numerous broadband projects it’s funding</a> among local constituents. </p>
<p>Again, I’m not particularly sure this FCC will consistently enforce the rules (assuming they survive industry legal challenge) or bring any meaningful penalties against big companies, since that’s never been the agency’s strong suit. And the FCC’s failure to name and shape specific ISPs or address very clear past discrimination is a bit feckless. Also, with FCC leadership shifting every election, it’s extremely unlikely that a Trump-run FCC would ever bother to enforce the rules. </p>
<p>At the same time, absolutely <strong>any</strong> effort to hold big telecom accountable for shitty behavior is treated by the GOP as if it’s some kind of dystopian hellscape of government overreach (though this is the same GOP that wants to abuse FCC authority to bully social media companies that moderate, however sloppily, the party’s race-baiting political propaganda). </p>
<p>Still, simply having the U.S. government overtly acknowledge a generation of discrimination in broadband deployment remains a big deal. It at least <strong>attempts</strong> to begin to rebalance the scales after generations of redlining and government apathy, something predatory regional monopolies and their loyal puppies in Congress clearly aren’t too keen on. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.volvotrucks.com/en-en/news-stories/press-releases/2023/jun/volvo-delivers-74-tonne-electric-truck.html">https://www.volvotrucks.com/en-en/news-stories/press-releases/2023/jun/volvo-delivers-74-tonne-electric-truck.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38302844">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-nc="Text">
      <p>More and more hauliers are now starting to invest in electric trucks, also for heavy transport. Mattson Åkeri in Gothenburg, Sweden is one of them, and the company has now bought three heavy electric Volvo FH trucks from Volvo.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the past few weeks, testing has been ongoing on one of the trucks in container traffic in the port area of ​​Arendal in Gothenburg. The test is a so-called HCT (High-Capacity Transport) project. The truck with two trailers is 32 m long and can handle a gross combination weight of 74 tonnes.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We want to show that all-electric solutions also work in applications with high total weights and a high utilization rate. Together with Mattson Åkeri, the Swedish Transport Administration and several other partners, we are now looking at how we can optimize the operation of the electric truck, including how charging should take place in the most efficient way,” explains Lena Larsson, project manager of the HCT project within Volvo's technology organization.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The electric truck being tested is a Volvo FH Electric 6X4 and is charged with green electricity at the two fast 180 kW chargers that Mattsson Åkeri has installed in the company's depot in Arendal. In the long term, the truck will also run between Gothenburg and the city of Borås, 70 km from Gothenburg.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>In operation 12 hours a day</b></p>
<p>“Driving long and heavy loads using electricity works very well so far, and we can carry as much cargo as a diesel truck,” says Jan-Olof Mattsson, CEO of Mattson Åkeri. “The truck runs 12 hours a day, with a stop for charging when the driver takes a break. We charge with green electricity and thus get no CO2 emissions. Silent, electric operation also means a better working environment for the driver.”<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>Since Volvo Trucks started production of all-electric trucks in 2019, the company has sold nearly 5,000 electric trucks in 40 countries around the world. Volvo today offers the industry's widest product range with six electric models in series production that meet a broad range of needs for transport in and between cities. Globally, Volvo Trucks has set the target that half of all trucks sold are electric by 2030.</p></div>
<p><b>High-Capacity Transports</b><br>
High-Capacity Transports (HCT) means that the vehicle's length and/or gross weight is allowed to increase, which allows for a larger load to be transported per vehicle. HCT can be applied on all types of drivelines. The idea is that HCT will contribute to lower transport costs, reduced environmental impact, higher traffic safety, reduced road wear and lower maintenance costs. In Europe there are a number of ongoing and planned HCT projects. One example is Finland, where it is permitted to drive with 76 tonnes of total weight and 34,5m truck combinations on most roads. Another is Sweden, where it is allowed to drive 74 tonnes (BK4 road network) and test, with permission from authorities, truck combinations of up to 34,5m and 100 tonnes on a defined road network.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p>ChatGPT is a bullshit generator. To understand AI, we should think harder about bullshit</p>
<p>This post appears in a blog created in 2019 to focus on AI in Africa. Long before the release of ChatGPT, many wondered why AI would be relevant to Africans. But I’m writing in a week when US President Biden published an executive order on AI, and British PM Rishi Sunak listened enthusiastically to Elon Musk promising a magical AI future where nobody needs to work. When the richest man in the world talks up a storm with NATO leaders, Africa will get blown around in those political and economic winds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my fieldwork in Africa, I’ve learned to ask different questions about AI, and in recent months, I’ve started to feel like the boy who questions the emperor’s new clothes. The problem I see, apparently not reported in coverage of Sunak’s AI Summit, is that AI <em>literally produces bullshit</em>. (Do I mean “literally”? My friends complain that I take everything literally, but I’m not a kleptomaniac).&nbsp;</p>
<p>MIT Professor of AI Rodney Brooks summarises the working principle of ChatGPT as “it just makes up stuff that sounds good”. This is mathematically accurate, where “sounds good” is an algorithm to imitate text found on the internet, while “makes up” is the basic randomness of relying on predictive text rather than logic or facts. Other leading researchers and professors of AI say the same things, with more technical detail, as in the famous “stochastic parrots” paper by Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru and their colleagues, or Murray Shanahan’s explanation of the text prediction principles (references below).</p>
<p>“Godfather of AI” Geoff Hinton, in recent public talks, explains that one of the greatest risks is not that chatbots will become super-intelligent, but that they will generate text that is super-persuasive without being intelligent, in the manner of Donald Trump or Boris Johnson. In a world where evidence and logic are not respected in public debate, Hinton imagines that systems operating without evidence or logic could become our overlords by becoming superhumanly persuasive, imitating and supplanting the worst kinds of political leader.</p>
<p>If this isn’t about evidence or logic, what is the scientific principle involved? Quite simply, we are talking about bullshit. Philosopher Harry Frankfurt, in his classic text <em>On Bullshit</em>, explains that the bullshitter “does not reject the authority of truth, as the liar does […] He pays no attention to it at all.” This is exactly what senior AI researchers such as Brooks, Bender, Shanahan and Hinton are telling us, when they explain how ChatGPT works. The problem, as Frankfurt explains, is that “[b]y virtue of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.” (p. 61). At a time when a public enquiry is reporting the astonishing behaviour of our most senior leaders during the Covid pandemic, the British people wonder how we came to elect such such bullshitters to lead us. But as Frankfurt observes, “Bullshit is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about” (p.63)</p>
<p>Perhaps this explains why the latest leader of the same government is so impressed by AI, and by billionaires promoting automated bullshit generators? But Frankfurt’s book is not the only classic text on bullshit. David Graeber’s famous analysis of <em>Bullshit Jobs</em> explains precisely why Elon Musk’s claim to the British PM is so revealing of the true nature of AI. Graeber revealed that over 30% of British workers believe their own job contributes nothing of any value to society. These are people who spend their lives writing pointless reports, relaying messages from one person to another, or listening to complaints they can do nothing about. Every part of their job could easily be done by ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Graeber observes that aspects of university education prepare young people to expect little more from life, training them to submit to bureaucratic processes, while writing reams of text that few will ever read. In the kind of education that produces a Boris Johnson, verbal fluency and entertaining arguments may be rewarded more highly than close attention to the truth. As Graeber says, we train people for bullshit jobs by training them to generate bullshit. So is Elon Musk right, that nobody will have to work any more once AI is achieved? Perhaps so, if producing bullshit is the only kind of work we need - and you can see how the owner of (eX)Twitter might see the world that way.</p>
<p>AI systems like ChatGPT are trained with text from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and other huge archives of bullshit, alongside plenty of actual facts (including Wikipedia and text ripped off from professional writers). But there is no algorithm in ChatGPT to check which parts are true. The output is literally bullshit, exactly as defined by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, and as we would expect from Graeber’s study of bullshit jobs. Just as Twitter encourages bullshitting politicians who don’t care whether what they say is true or false, the archives of what they have said can be used to train automatic bullshit generators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem isn’t AI. What we need to regulate is the bullshit. Perhaps the next British PM should convene a summit on bullshit, to figure out whose jobs are worthwhile, and which ones we could happily lose?</p>

By masquerading as legitimate music rightsholders, two men managed to extract over $23 million in revenue from YouTube's Content ID system. Both were arrested and sentenced to prison. In the wake of the criminal proceeding, hundreds of disadvantaged artists came forward, and the court has now ordered the scammers to pay $3.3 million in restitution.

<p>YouTube’s flagship anti-piracy system is supposed to protect rightsholders but, in this case, it was used to exploit them.</p>
<h2>Multi-Million Dollar Scam</h2>
<p>The scammers’ company, MediaMuv LLC., wasn’t a direct member of the Content ID program. Instead, it operated through a trusted third-party company, which had access to the platform.</p>
<p>By falsely claiming to own the rights to more than 50,000 copyrighted songs, the scammers generated more than $23 million in revenue.</p>
<p>In 2022, the first defendant confessed to his part in the copyright swindle by pleading guilty. Webster Fernandez admitted it was a simple scheme: find Latin music that wasn’t yet monetized on YouTube and claim the content as their own.</p>
<p>In February of this year, the second defendant pleaded guilty. Jose Teran signed a plea agreement admitting that he was part of the conspiracy, engaging in wire fraud and money laundering.</p>
<h2>Prison Sentences</h2>
<p>The guilty pleas may have helped to reduce their sentences but the defendants didn’t get off easily. This summer, a federal court in Arizona handed a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/court-sentences-youtube-content-id-scammer-to-over-five-years-in-prison-230629/">70 month prison term</a> to Mr. Teran, to be followed by three years of probation. </p>
<p>A few weeks later, the same court sentenced Mr. Fernandez to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/lead-youtube-content-id-scammer-sentenced-to-46-months-230821/">46 months in prison</a> for his role in the conspiracy, to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>
<p>In addition to the jail time, both convicts had to forfeit multiple possessions related to their crimes, including bank accounts, several pieces of real estate, and cars.</p>
<h2>$3.3 Million Restitution</h2>
<p>At the time of the sentencing, the authorities requested victims of the YouTube Content ID scam to come forward, as they are entitled to restitution. The MediaMuv operation mostly targeted Spanish language artists, who were not monetizing their content on YouTube yet. </p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, hundreds of these artists submitted their claims, ranging from a few dozen dollars, to well over $100,000. Some of these artists were represented by lawyers or their label and the RIAA submitted a claim on behalf of artists as well. </p>
<p>All told, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and defense attorneys agreed to a total restitution amount of more than $3.3 million, which is due immediately. </p>
<p>“The United States, counsel for Webster Batista, and counsel for Jose Teran, respectfully stipulate to the restitution amount of $3,365,352.85,” the stipulation reads.</p>
<p>“Along with the other standard conditions concerning the repayment of restitution, the parties agree that Webster Batista and Jose Teran will be jointly and severally liable for the restitution, restitution is due immediately, and Batista and Teran be ordered to make minimum monthly payments..” </p>

<p>A quick tally shows that roughly 800 affected artists came forward. One of the largest claims comes from Cecilia Ramirez, widow of the Mexican singer-songwriter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agust%C3%ADn_Ram%C3%ADrez_(singer)">Agustín Ramírez</a>, who was the frontman of the band Los Caminantes. Ramírez passed away last year.</p>

<p>The RIAA’s claim totals $1,247,719.76 and is based on falsely claimed music of hundreds of artists, as detailed in this <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/webster-judg-c.pdf">57-page exhibit</a>. </p>
<p>Both convicted defendants are jointly and severally liable for the restitution payments. How long it will take to repay the affected artists will depend on their income and available funds. </p>
<p>A copy of the joint stipulation on the restitution amount is available <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mediamuvrest.pdf">here (pdf)</a>. The amount was agreed upon by all parties and granted by the Arizona federal court earlier this week.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Replicate developer Charlie Holtz <a href="https://x.com/charliebholtz/status/1724815159590293764?s=20">combined</a> GPT-4 Vision (commonly called GPT-4V) and ElevenLabs voice cloning technology to create an unauthorized AI version of the famous naturalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough">David Attenborough</a> narrating Holtz's every move on camera. As of Thursday afternoon, the <a href="https://x.com/charliebholtz/status/1724815159590293764?s=20">X post</a> describing the stunt had garnered over 21,000 likes.</p>

<p>"Here we have a remarkable specimen of <em>Homo sapiens</em> distinguished by his silver circular spectacles and a mane of tousled curly locks," the false Attenborough says in the demo as Holtz looks on with a grin. "He's wearing what appears to be a blue fabric covering, which can only be assumed to be part of his mating display."</p>
<p>"Look closely at the subtle arch of his eyebrow," it continues, as if narrating a BBC wildlife documentary. "It's as if he's in the midst of an intricate ritual of curiosity or skepticism. The backdrop suggests a sheltered habitat, possibly a communal feeding area or watering hole."</p>
<figure>
    
    </figure>
<p>How does it work? Every five seconds, a Python script called "narrator" takes a photo from Holtz's webcam and feeds it to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/chatgpt-goes-multimodal-with-image-recognition-and-speech-synthesis/">GPT-4V</a>—the version of OpenAI's language model that can process image inputs—via an API, which has a special prompt to make it create text in the style of Attenborough's narrations. Then it feeds that text into an <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/">ElevenLabs</a> AI voice profile trained on audio samples of Attenborough's speech. Holtz provided <a href="https://github.com/cbh123/narrator">the code</a> (called "narrator") that pulls it all together on GitHub, and it requires API tokens for OpenAI and ElevenLabs that cost money to run.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>While some of these capabilities have been available separately for some time, developers have recently begun to experiment with combining these capabilities together thanks to API availability, which can create surprising demonstrations like this one.</p>
<p>During the demo video, when Holtz holds up a cup and takes a drink, the fake Attenborough narrator says, "Ah, in its natural environment, we observe the sophisticated <em>Homo sapiens</em> engaging in the critical ritual of hydration. This male individual has selected a small cylindrical container, likely filled with life-sustaining H<sub>2</sub>O, and is tilting it expertly towards his intake orifice. Such grace, such poise."</p>

<p>In a different demo <a href="https://x.com/skirano/status/1724944550790135926?s=20">posted on X</a> by Pietro Schirano, you can hear the cloned voice of Steve Jobs critiquing designs created in Figma, a design app. Schirano used a similar technique, with an image being streamed to GPT-4V via API (which was prompted to reply in the style of Jobs), then fed into an ElevenLabs clone of Jobs' voice.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/james-earl-jones-signed-darth-vader-voice-rights-to-disney-for-ai-use/">previously</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">covered</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-koe-recast-you-can-change-your-voice-as-easily-as-your-clothing/">voice cloning</a> technology, which is fraught with ethical and legal concerns where the software creates convincing deepfakes of a person's voice, making them "say" things the real person never said. This has legal implications regarding a celebrity's publicity rights, and it has already been used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/rising-scams-use-ai-to-mimic-voices-of-loved-ones-in-financial-distress/">scam people</a> by faking the voices of loved ones seeking money. ElevenLabs' <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/terms">terms of service</a> prohibit people from making clones of other people's voices in a way that would violate "Intellectual Property Rights, publicity rights and Copyright," but it's a rule that can be difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>For now, while some people expressed deep discomfort from someone imitating Attenborough's voice without permission, many others seem bemused by the demo. "Okay, I'm going to get David Attenborough to narrate videos of my baby learning how to eat broccoli," <a href="https://x.com/JeremyNguyenPhD/status/1724837709158731887?s=20">quipped</a> Jeremy Nguyen in an X reply.</p>

<p>Google News is known to most people as a big pile of web links, but it actually hosts magazines, too. Before the days of the Internet, a "magazine" was a big bundle of paper full of articles you could get shipped to your door, sort of like if you printed out a website. For a time, you could pay cold, hard cash for a digital copy of a paper magazine through Google and then view that content through whatever the latest Google magazine/news app was.</p>
<p>Magazine content sales were shut down <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/01/03/google-news-killing-digital-magazines-refunds-subscriptions/">in 2020</a>, though, and soon, Google's magazine content will no longer be hosted online. The <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenews/thread/243673441/an-update-to-google-news-magazine-support">company announced</a> on a support page that purchased content will be shut down starting December 18. You can see if you have purchased (or freebie) magazines at <a href="https://news.google.com/my/magazines">this link</a>.</p>
<p>Let's see if we can put on our "Google archeology" hats and figure out where this all came from. Google started selling magazines in 2012 with "<a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2012/06/27/google-play-store-updated-to-bring-new-tv-shows-magazines-and-movies-for-purchase/">Google Play Magazines</a>." You could buy individual magazine issues for around $8 or subscribe yearly for $11. These were all hosted by Google, with access available through the app and web. One year later, in 2013, Play Magazines was merged with another Google news app, Google Currents, to create <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/google-launches-play-newsstand-a-hybrid-magazine-store-and-rss-reader/">Google Play Newsstand</a>. Newsstand featured paid magazines and free website content. Google spent 2013–2016 rolling out purchasing support across more and more countries.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/floorp_gdyDUPo63u.jpg" data-height="1011" data-width="1622" alt="A magazine on Google News."><img alt="A magazine on Google News." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/floorp_gdyDUPo63u-980x611.jpg" width="980" height="611"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/floorp_gdyDUPo63u.jpg" data-height="1011" data-width="1622">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A magazine on Google News.</p><p>Google</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>By 2018, Play Newsstand <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/the-revamped-google-news-app-is-now-available-on-iphones-and-ipads/">was replaced</a> by the first "Google News" app, a long-overdue entry in the Google app portfolio given how much of a powerhouse Google News has been online. The new app focused more on online content but kept a spot for your magazine subscriptions. The Android Google News app still has the same package name from 2012: "com.google.android.apps.magazines."</p>
<p>With sales of new magazines dead in 2020, it was only a matter of time until Google shut down the hosting of old, purchased magazine content. The good news is that you can download a PDF of your purchased magazine before December 18. Anyone who has purchased magazine content should be getting an email with an option to download or, for some magazines, request a refund.</p>
<p>Google says that some magazines will be refund-eligible because they "contain interactive elements that cannot be downloaded and saved for future access." December 18 isn't just the date for the hosting shutdown, but also the deadline for downloads or refund requests.</p>
<p>Offering a PDF download is better than nothing, but static PDFs are a lot more cumbersome and miserable than the slick user experience Google's original magazine offering had across all your devices. Remember, all online content purchases are really just rentals.</p>

Ethernet has become the standard wired local area network around the world, and it is widely used in businesses and homes. It was honored this year as an <a href="https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Milestone-Proposal:Ethernet_Local_Area_Network_(LAN),_1973-1985" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Milestone</a>, a half century after it was born.</p><h2>Connecting PARC’s Alto computers</h2><p> Ethernet’s development began in 1973, when <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/thacker_1336106.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Charles P. Thacker</a>—who was working on the design of the Alto computer—envisioned a network that would allow Altos to communicate with each other, as well as with laser printers and with PARC’s gateway to the <a href="https://ethw.org/ARPANET" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ARPANET</a>. PARC researcher <a href="https://ethw.org/Robert_M._Metcalfe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert M. Metcalfe</a>, an IEEE Fellow, took on the challenge of creating the technology. Metcalfe soon was joined by computer scientist <a href="https://ethw.org/David_Boggs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Boggs</a>.</p><p>Metcalfe and Boggs had two criteria: The network had to be fast enough to support their laser printer, and it had to connect hundreds of computers within the same building.</p><p>The Ethernet design was inspired by the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/alohanet-introduced-random-access-protocols-to-the-computing-world" target="_self">Additive Links On-line Hawaii Area network</a> (ALOHAnet), a radio-based system at the <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Hawai’i</a>. Computers transmitted packets, prefaced by the addresses of the recipients, over a shared channel as soon as they had information to send. If two messages collided, the computers that had sent them would wait a random interval and try again. </p><p>Metcalfe outlined his proposal, then called the Alto Aloha Network, in a <a href="https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/w/images/a/af/Ref1_PARC_Ethernet_Memo_1973.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now-famous memo</a> to his colleagues. Using coaxial cables rather than radio waves would allow faster transmission of data and limit interference. The cables also meant that users could join or exit the network without having to shut off the entire system, Metcalfe said in a 2004 <a href="https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Robert_Metcalfe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oral history</a> conducted by the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE History Center</a>.</p><p>“There was something called a cable television tap, which allows one to tap into a coax without cutting it,” Metcalfe said. “Therefore, [Boggs and I] chose coax as our means of communication. In [the] memo, I described the principles of operation—very distributed, no central control, a single piece of ‘ether.’”</p><p>Metcalfe and Boggs designed the first version of what is now known as Ethernet in 1973. It sent data at up to 2.94 megabits per second and was “fast enough to feed the laser printer and easy to send through the coax,” Metcalfe told the IEEE History Center.</p><p>A 9.5-millimeter thick and stiff coaxial cable was laid in the middle of a hall in the PARC building. The 500-meter cable had 100 transceiver nodes attached to it with N connectors, known as vampire taps. Each of the taps—small boxes with a hard shell—had two probes that “bit” through the cable’s outer insulation to contact its copper core. Thus new nodes could be added while existing connections were live.</p><p>Each vampire tap had a D-type connector socket in it, consisting of a plug with nine pins that matched to a socket with nine jacks. The sockets allowed Alto computers, printers, and file servers to attach to the network.</p><p>To enable the devices to communicate, Metcalfe and Boggs created the first high-speed network interface card (NIC)—a circuit board that is connected to a computer’s motherboard. It included what is now known as an Ethernet port.</p><p>The researchers changed the name from the original Alto Aloha Network to Ethernet to make it clearer that the system could support any computer. It reflected a comment Thacker had made early on, that “coaxial cable is nothing but captive ether,” PARC researcher <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/kay_3972189.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alan Kay</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/xerox-parc" target="_self">recalled</a>.</p><p>Metcalfe, Boggs, Thacker, and <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/lampson_1142421.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Butler W. Lampson</a> were granted a U.S. patent in 1978 for their invention.</p><p>They continued to develop the technology and, in 1980, PARC released Ethernet that ran at 10 Mb/s. The update was done in collaboration with researchers at <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intel</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Equipment Corp.</a> (DEC) to create a version of Ethernet for broad industry use, according to the Milestone entry.</p><h2>Becoming an IEEE standard</h2><p>Ethernet became commercially available in 1980 and quickly grew into the industry LAN standard. To provide computer companies with a framework for the technology, in June 1983 Ethernet was adopted as a standard by the <a href="https://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/es-ecsg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE 802 Local Area Network Standards Committee</a>.</p><p>Currently, the <a href="https://www.ieee802.org/#:~:text=The%20IEEE%20802%20LAN%2FMAN,them%20on%20a%20global%20basis." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE 802</a> family consists of 67 published standards, with 49 projects under development. The committee works with standards agencies worldwide to publish certain IEEE 802 standards as international guidelines. </p><p>A plaque recognizing the technology is displayed outside the PARC facility. It reads:</p><p><em>Ethernet wired LAN was invented at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1973, inspired by the ALOHAnet packet radio network and the ARPANET.

  <div><p><span>Manifest V3, Google Chrome’s soon-to-be definitive basket of changes to the world of web browser extensions, has been framed by its authors as “a step in the direction of privacy, security, and performance.” But we think these changes are a raw deal for users.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security" title="We've said that"><span>We’ve said that</span></a><span> since Manifest V3 was announced, and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/am/deeplinks/2021/11/manifest-v3-open-web-politics-sheeps-clothing"><span>continue to say so</span></a><span> as its implementation is now imminent. Like </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"><span>FLoC</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/dont-play-googles-privacy-sandbox-1"><span>Privacy Sandbox</span></a><span> before it, Manifest V3 is another example of the inherent conflict of interest that comes from Google controlling both the dominant web browser and one of the largest internet advertising networks.</span></p>
<p><span>Manifest V3, or Mv3 for short, is outright harmful to privacy efforts. It will restrict the capabilities of web extensions—especially those that are designed to monitor, modify, and compute alongside the conversation your browser has with the websites you visit. Under the new specifications, extensions like these– like some privacy-protective tracker blockers– will have greatly reduced capabilities. Google’s efforts to limit that access is concerning, especially considering that </span><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/biggest-tracker-networks/"><span>Google has trackers installed on 75% of the top one million websites</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s also doubtful Mv3 will do much for security. Firefox maintains the largest extension market that’s not based on Chrome, and the company has said it will adopt Mv3 in the interest of cross-browser compatibility. Yet, at the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpDFS-GUytg&amp;t=416s"><span>2020 AdBlocker Dev Summit</span></a><span>, Firefox’s Add-On Operations Manager said about the extensions security review process: “For malicious add-ons, we feel that for Firefox it has been at a manageable level....since the add-ons are mostly interested in grabbing bad data, they can still do that with the current webRequest API that is not blocking.” In plain English, this means that when a malicious extension sneaks through the security review process, it is usually interested in simply observing the conversation between your browser and whatever websites you visit. The malicious activity happens elsewhere, after the data has already been read. A more thorough review process could improve security, but Chrome hasn’t said they’ll do that. Instead, their solution is to restrict capabilities for all extensions.</span></p>
<p><span>As for Chrome’s other justification for Mv3– performance– </span><a href="https://kevin.borgolte.me/files/pdf/www2020-privacy-extensions.pdf"><span>a 2020 study by researchers at Princeton and the University of Chicago revealed that privacy extensions</span></a><span>, the very ones that will be hindered by Mv3, actually improve browser performance. <br></span></p>
<p><span>The development specifications of web browser extensions may seem in the weeds, but the broader implications should matter to all internet citizens: it’s another step towards Google defining how we get to live online. Considering that Google has been </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/02/google-and-facebook-bring-in-one-fifth-of-global-ad-revenue"><span>the world’s largest advertising company</span></a><span> for years now, these new limitations are paternalistic and downright creepy.</span></p>
<p><span><a id="MV3quotes"></a>But don’t just take our words for it. Here are some thoughts from technologists, privacy advocates, and extension developers who share our concern over Manifest V3:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span>"A web browser is supposed to act on behalf of the user and respect the user's interests. Unfortunately, Chrome now has a track record as a Google agent, not a user agent. It is the only major web browser that lacks meaningful privacy protections by default, shoves users toward linking activity with a Google Account, and implements invasive new advertising capabilities. Google's latest changes will break Chrome privacy extensions, despite academic research demonstrating that no change is necessary. These user-hostile decisions are all directly attributable to Google's surveillance business model and enabled by its dominance of the desktop browser market." <br></span></i></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s 11:43pm on a Monday night. My 6-week-old son is asleep in my office so my wife can get some uninterrupted rest for the first half of the night. He’s finally asleep now, and I probably should be also after a full day of work. But I’m not done for the day. Even though I’m a software engineer by trade, I’m also a computer programmer by hobby and passion. So I do what I’ve been doing for well over a decade now: I boot up my computer to write some code.</p><p>What to do, what to do… Learn something new? Maybe. Write a blog post? Well… here I am. But… in the back of my mind I know that I have open source projects that need some attention. One happens to be heavily used. I’m nearly 3/4 million downloads, and it’s something that people seem to think has some level of usefullness. Those are the good parts. The bad parts are that there’s a dozen issues that I haven’t even reviewed much less triaged, investigated, and fixed. There are a few PRs from the community that I need to look through. There are dependencies that need to be updated. The list goes on and on. This project has hit a not-so-uncommon OSS milestone: Maintainer burnout.</p><h2 id="what-compels-all-software-builders">What compels all software builders</h2><p>I’m certainly not alone in my pursuits of writing software. And with the fear of overgeneralizing a massive group of us software craftspeople, I think the effort we put into software is a simple equation:</p><p><code>time = passion + money</code></p><p>Every hour we spend writing code is because of some combination of passion and money. Both of those can be zero, but the other part must be great enough to compensate the zeroed value. Let’s see me as an example:</p><p><img src="https://trstringer.com/images/oss-is-broken1.png" alt="Time and money"></p><p>My job as a software engineer is great. They give me money to write code. I’m also super lucky that I have a high level of passion for the code I write and the things I build. There’s also a high level of demand on my work. That’s a massive win! I’m lucky. Others may have low or no passion for their work, but their compensation keeps them coming back on Monday morning at 9am. That’s totally fine too!</p><p>Let’s see some of my other current projects. My blog, this blog, is one of them. I don’t get money, but I have a bit of passion with it and that matches the demand well enough. Then there is <code>passion project</code>, which I get no money from but I’m pretty stoked about so my motivation is pretty high. And there’s no demand, so I go at my own pace and take it whatever direction I want!</p><p>And then finally, there’s my <code>uninteresting (to me) OSS project</code>. What once resembled <code>passion project</code> is now unrecognizable from a motivation perspective. But the demand is high. There are lots of users, many in a corporate sense using my software to further progress their organization. And the bad news is, I get no money at all from it. So motivation is essentially nonexistent at this point. Where passion is falling short, money <em>could</em> motivate me to routinely work on this product.</p><h2 id="whats-really-going-on">What’s really going on?</h2><p>This all boils down to a situation where you have many profit-generating companies using software that some programmer volunteered to write. That software contributes to that company making even more money. But the developer sees none of it because they are just an author on some git commits, and aren’t on the company’s payroll.</p><p>This is Volunteering as a Service (VaaS). It is quite literally a free lunch at the expense of hard-working individuals.</p><p>That’s pretty dark, so let me bring that back a little bit. It is not all companies treating OSS this way. And even the ones that are, I would be willing to bet that 99% of these companies don’t neglect compensation out of malice. The OSS system is just entirely not equipped to facilitate these companies to pay contributors.</p><h2 id="whats-the-solution">What’s the solution?</h2><p>So that problem statement isn’t new. It has bounced around often and in many forms. So what do <em>I</em> think could be a solution? Open source software developers should have compensation that follows this:</p><p><code>money = contributions * usage</code></p><p>If you are an active contributor on a product with high utilization, the payout should reflect that. Likewise, if you’ve submitted a couple of commits on a product that nobody uses, the money (or lack thereof) should represent that. But it’s not that simple, because there are different types of open source software developers out there. Some write OSS code as part of their employment, in which case they are likely already compensated for their contributions. It comes in their checks twice a month. But the other type of OSS developer is the one that is making those OSS contributors after hours and not affiliated with an organization.</p><p>OSS-using companies should be funding these projects. After all, they are using them. And even though they aren’t forced to buy licenses from SomeClosedSourceSoftwareCompany, that doesn’t mean that they <em>shouldn’t</em> be contributing.</p><h2 id="how-can-companies-contribute">How can companies contribute?</h2><p>The obvious answer is money. The less obvious answer is with developer time. This is quite common. Companies might have employees full or part time contributing to open source software projects. A great example of this is <a href="https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/companies-table?orgId=1">Kubernetes, and all the developers that contribute to Kubernetes on company time</a>. Those companies in that list (Google, Red Hat, VMware, and Microsoft to name the top ones) <em>are</em> contributing to the success of those projects. They’re giving developer time.</p><p>When a company doesn’t contribute any or enough developer time to the projects, they should be supplementing with money that is distributed to those OSS developers that <em>aren’t</em> representing their company. Enterprise compensation should resemble the following:</p><p><code>compensation = developers + money</code></p><p>Here’s another way to look at this:</p><p><img src="https://trstringer.com/images/oss-is-broken2.png" alt="OSS is broken"></p><p>All three of these companies are responsibly contributing to the OSS product, but in different ways. <code>company1</code> contributes both money and developer time, <code>company2</code> sends just money, and finally <code>company3</code> provides adequate developers to the project. <code>company3</code> is the Googles or Microsofts of Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="how-do-dependencies-get-compensated">How do dependencies get compensated?</h2><p>Quick, name all the dependencies of Kubernetes. You can’t, and I can’t either. There’s just too many. It shouldn’t be only end user facing products that get appropriate compensation. It should be these products that send a portion of their contributions (money and developer time) down to these dependencies in a big happy tree of contributions.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-so-hard">Why is this so hard?</h2><p>There is a lot of challenges to this. And these are only the things I <em>thought</em> of. I’m sure in reality it’s even more complicated. That’s why I don’t think the moral reponsibility at the moment falls on these companies. There needs to be a system in place that handles the contributions from users and distributes them to projects and dependency projects. It’s just too complicated to do otherwise. <code>company2</code> can wake up one day and say “I want to do the right thing and compensate OSS developers.” But… uhhhh… where do they send the money to? I have no clue. There is nobody to send it to without adding a <em>ton</em> of overhead, which isn’t fair to anybody. And no, I don’t think GitHub Sponsors is the answer to this.</p><h2 id="summarizing">Summarizing</h2><p>Hopefully one day we do figure out how to fairly compensate open source software builders. It’s the right thing to do, and I don’t know anybody (including these companies) that would argue that point. We’re all in this big software world together.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Renewables alone have powered the Uruguayan economy for nearly four straight months.</p>



<p>In the three months to end-September 2023, the South American nation generated all of its electricity from renewable sources — with wind the single-biggest contributor, according to data from the country’s electricity market operator. And as of October 25, it’s on track to extend that streak by another month.</p>



<p>Uruguay hit the same milestone in 2022 during the spring months. But it had to turn back to fossil fuels — in the form of imported oil — over the summer period when a historic drought curbed hydro output. The polluting fuel accounted for roughly 10% of the power mix through 2022.</p>



<p><strong>How it got here:</strong>&nbsp;Uruguay used to rely almost entirely on hydro- and oil &amp; gas-based power. But as the economy grew and electricity demand threatened to overtake supply from the early 2010s, it needed to add additional generating capacity, and fast. New hydro wasn’t an option as it had already made the most of that resource.</p>



<p>To chart the way forward, the president appointed Ramón Méndez Galain, a particle physicist from the private sector, as the country’s director of energy — a position he held until 2015.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/podcast/how-uruguay-went-almost-completely-fossil-fuel-free/">podcast discussion</a>&nbsp;with the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, Méndez Galain said one of his primary goals was to make Uruguay less reliant on volatile imported oil &amp; gas. The quest for energy independence made him rule out nuclear power, which would’ve require uranium imports.</p>



<p>A decision was ultimately made to better exploit the country’s ample solar, wind, water and biomass waste resources.</p>



<p>Because the state couldn’t fund a massive energy programme alone, it ran a series of clean power auctions, where it offered project developers 20-year contracts to sell electricity into the national grid at guaranteed rates.</p>



<p>In just five years, $6 billion was invested in renewable energy — the equivalent of 12% of Uruguay’s GDP.</p>



<p><strong>The results:</strong>&nbsp;Power production costs have declined “by almost half”, according to Méndez Galain. And the clean energy sector has created 50,000 new jobs — the equivalent of 3% of the labour force. Further, Uruguay has become a net exporter of electricity.</p>



<p>The rapid increase in wind power capacity has largely displaced oil use, even as electricity demand has steadily grown. Between 2017 and 2020, renewables made up 97% of the electricity mix and oil &amp; gas just 3%.</p>



<p>“You become independent of all these kinds of wars or other geopolitical events,” Méndez Galain said.</p>



<p>“Ask me what was the impact on the electricity sector in Uruguay after this tragic war in Europe — zero. We have no impact because we’re not dependent on energy commodities.”</p>

<p>UnitedHealthcare, the largest health insurance company in the US, is allegedly using a deeply flawed AI algorithm to override doctors' judgments and wrongfully deny critical health coverage to elderly patients. This has resulted in patients being kicked out of rehabilitation programs and care facilities far too early, forcing them to drain their life savings to obtain needed care that should be covered under their government-funded Medicare Advantage Plan.</p>
<p>That's all according to <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/class-action-v-unitedhealth-and-navihealth-1.pdf">a lawsuit</a> filed this week in the US District Court for the District of Minnesota. The lawsuit is brought by the estates of two deceased people who were denied health coverage by UnitedHealth. The suit also seeks class-action status for similarly situated people, of which there may be tens of thousands across the country.</p>
<p>The lawsuit lands alongside <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/14/unitedhealth-algorithm-medicare-advantage-investigation/">an investigation by Stat News</a> that largely backs the lawsuit's claims. The investigation's findings stem from internal documents and communications the outlet obtained, as well as interviews with former employees of NaviHealth, the UnitedHealth subsidiary that developed the AI algorithm called nH Predict.</p>
<p>"By the end of my time at NaviHealth I realized: I'm not an advocate, I'm just a moneymaker for this company," Amber Lynch, an occupational therapist and former NaviHealth case manager, told Stat. "It's all about money and data points," she added. 'It takes the dignity out of the patient, and I hated that."</p>
<h2>AI-based denials</h2>
<p>According to the lawsuit, UnitedHealth started using nH Predict in at least November 2019, and it is still in use. The algorithm estimates how much post-acute care a patient on a Medicare Advantage Plan will need after an acute injury, illness, or event, like a fall or a stroke. Post-acute care can include things like therapy and skilled care from home health agencies, skilled nursing homes, and inpatient rehabilitation centers.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>It's unclear how nH Predict works exactly, but it reportedly estimates post-acute care by pulling information from a database containing medical cases from 6 million patients. NaviHealth case managers plug in certain information about a given patient—including age, living situation, and physical functions—and the AI algorithm spits out estimates based on similar patients in the database. The algorithm estimates medical needs, length of stay, and discharge date.</p>
<p>But Lynch noted to Stat that the algorithm doesn't account for many relevant factors in a patient's health and recovery time, including comorbidities and things that occur during stays, like if they develop pneumonia while in the hospital or catch COVID-19 in a nursing home.</p>
<p>According to the Stat investigation and the lawsuit, the estimates are often draconian. For instance, on a Medicare Advantage Plan, patients who stay in a hospital for three days are typically entitled to up to 100 days of covered care in a nursing home. But with nH Predict, patients rarely stay in nursing homes for more than 14 days before receiving payment denials from UnitedHealth.</p>
<p>When patients or their doctors have requested to see nH Predict's reports, UnitedHealth has denied their requests, telling them the information is proprietary, according to the lawsuit. And, when prescribing physicians disagree with UnitedHealth's determination of how much post-acute care their patients need, their judgments are overridden.</p>
<h2>Favorable failings</h2>
<p>The use of faulty AI is not new for the health care industry. While AI chatbots and image generators are currently grabbing headlines and causing alarm, the health care industry in the US has a longer record of problematic AI use, including establishing <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/medical-algorithms-failing-communities-color">algorithmic racial bias</a> in patient care. But, what sets this situation apart is that the dubious estimates nH Predict spits out seem to be a feature, not a bug, for UnitedHealth.</p>
<p>Since UnitedHealth acquired NaviHealth in 2020, former employees told Stat that the company's focus shifted from patient advocacy to performance metrics and keeping post-acute care as short and lean as possible. Various statements by UnitedHealth executives echoed this shift, Stat noted. In particular, the UnitedHealth executive overseeing NaviHealth, Patrick Conway, was quoted in a company podcast saying: "If [people] go to a nursing home, how do we get them out as soon as possible?"</p>

<p>I read hackernews sometimes, and articles like <a href="https://py-code.org/stats">I mirrored all the code from PyPI to GitHub and analysed it</a> made me think, maybe there are less obvious places with leaked information.</p>

<p>This was in the back of my mind until recently, when I tried to <a href="https://github.com/kivy/buildozer/pull/1709">contribute</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/kivy/buildozer">buildozer</a> project. 
I implemented rich logs, and I felt like I understood buildozer, so I searched for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/buildozer">stackoverflow</a> questions about it.

<p>So, I downloaded stackOverflow from the <a href="https://archive.org/download/stackexchange">stackexchange archive.org dump</a>, and started to think how to parse it. It’s a huge (103G) XML file, where each line is a question or answer.</p>

<p>I tried different “leak detect” tools, most of them crashed or taking too much cpu:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>gitleaks : <code>fatal error: runtime: out of memory</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>truffleHog : Actually works (and takes 100% cpu), but giving very poor results (e.g. a simple <code>%s</code> is considered a SQL server base64 encoded: <code>Detector Type: SQLServer,Decoder Type: BASE64,Raw result: %s</code> ).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ripsecrets : no output 1 hour after I run it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Yelp) detect-secrets: <code>Traceback (most recent call last): ... MemoryError</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ripgrep : freeze my system after few minutes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So I ended up returning to my zsh and doing <code>grep</code>  , and even writing a my own rust script to do the searches.</p>

<h2 id="results">results</h2>

<p>As I suspected , there are a lot of leaks in stackoverflow (on the graph, only unique and not junk data is displayed. click on a label to hide it ):</p>




<p>As you can see, a lot of data.</p>

<p>Then, I asked myself, what could an attacker do with this information? Turns out, most of it is useless:</p>

<p>For using most data, you need more information than just the api key. For example, for stripe , you need the customer ID. For grafana, an instance url. For aws, a site url.</p>

<p>And even if you have an api key which goes to a centralized location without need for a “username”, most of the data is old. All the JWTs (<a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens</a>) - forget about them, the average life of a JWT is a month.</p>

<p>Until I run a simple scan (again using the best hacking tools : <code>xargs</code> and <code>curl</code> ) against all the 74 real looking GitHub user tokens (which is a token that grants access to pretty much the full GitHub user) and discovered that 6 of them are actually valid.</p>

<p>Still, only 2 of them actually have bio and email, but one of them (a c/c++ developer)  has a repo with <code>3.4k</code> stars. So I finally found the path an attacker would take.</p>

<p>I sent both developers an email (I told them about this research and referred them to the question where they leak the token, with a little “if you find this message helpful, you can <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/matanh">buy me a coffee</a>” at the end) and they both revoked the tokens (and both actually bought me a coffee, the first time I got money since I opened this buymeacoffee account in March 2021!).</p>

<p>I obviously couldn’t verify all the secrets. From most of them I’ll probably be banned,  so I stooped here.</p>

<h2 id="cause">cause</h2>

<p>Unlike PyPi and GitHub leaks articles, this article is not because of people leaving the password in their <code>deploy-to-server.py</code> and accidentally committing it (well, sometimes they copy <code>deploy-to-server-example.py</code> into stackoverflow and forget to mask the id …).</p>

<p>Most leaks are in the output of tools, a long output that people like to copy/paste right into stackoverflow, without actually looking at it,  because of people publish <strong>the output/ the tool config file</strong> of the tool they using (e.g. did you know that <code>curl -v</code> also displays your request with the headers, or that a long <code>package.json</code> with private dependencies can contain <code>git+your-private-gh-token</code> ? )</p>

<div>

  <pre><code>why is this not working?  I run this command curl -v --path-as-is 'https://matan-h.com/[redundant]'
and I get this output:
*   Trying 185.199.108.153:80...

</div>

<p>I hope you enjoyed the article, and pay more attention to what you copy/paste in StackOverflow.</p>

<p>Using Windows these days means putting up with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/windows-11-has-made-the-clean-windows-install-an-oxymoron/">many, many pitches to use and purchase other Microsoft products</a>. Some are subtle, like the built-in Edge browser suggesting you use its "recommended settings" after each major update. Some are not so subtle, like testing a "quiz" that made some users <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/microsoft-pulls-onedrive-update-that-would-quiz-you-before-letting-you-quit/">explain why they're trying to quit the OneDrive app</a>.</p>
<p>Those living in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">European Economic Area (EEA)</a>—which includes the EU and adds Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway—will soon get the volume turned down on their Windows 11 systems. To meet the demands of <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en">the European Commission's Digital Markets Act</a>—slated to be enforced in March 2024—Microsoft must make its apps easier to uninstall, its default settings easier to change, and its attempts at steering people toward its services easier to avoid.</p>
<p>Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/11/16/previewing-changes-in-windows-to-comply-with-the-digital-markets-act-in-the-european-economic-area/">writes in a blog post</a> that many of these changes will be available in a preview update of Windows 11 (version 23H2) this month. Windows 10 will get similar changes "at a later date." A couple of changes affect all Windows 10 and 11 users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apps that are critical to Windows will be labeled with a "System" tag in Settings, the Start menu, and search results</li>
<li>Camera, Cortana, and Photos can now be uninstalled</li>
</ul>                                            
                                                        
<p>In the EEA, much more is on the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bing's web search from the Start menu and the Edge browser can be uninstalled</li>
<li>Third parties can add to the Windows Widgets Board feeds</li>
<li>Third parties, like Google or DuckDuckGo, can provide the built-in web search results that Bing once had exclusively</li>
<li>Windows users who choose to sync their Microsoft accounts will have their pinned apps and preferences synced, seemingly keeping their EEA-enabled choices</li>
<li>Windows will now "always use customers' configured app default settings for link and file types"</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft's post notes that Windows uses the region picked during Windows install to offer the EEA-exclusive options. Only a PC reset can undo the options. EEA Windows devices will also not get the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/bing-chat-is-now-microsoft-copilot-in-potentially-confusing-rebranding-move/">Microsoft Copilot preview</a> that is rolling out in other markets.</p>
<p>The Digital Markets Act's impending arrival <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/eu-to-regulate-gatekeepers-in-crackdown-on-google-apple-amazon-facebook/">will impact other major tech firms</a> that are considered "gatekeepers" providing "core platform services" that are "most prone to unfair business practices." Google has recently pitched the European Union on the idea of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-argues-imessage-should-be-regulated-by-the-eus-digital-markets-act/">forcing Apple to make iMessage interoperable</a> under the Act. Apple has reportedly worked on changes to iOS that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/report-apple-engineers-are-working-on-third-party-app-store-support-in-ios/">would allow "sideloading" apps</a> outside Apple's own App Store, while another provision in the Digital Markets Act would demand developers be able to use their preferred payments systems.</p>
<p>A companion piece of legislation focused on online platforms, the Digital Services Act, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/google-runs-5-of-the-19-platforms-that-must-follow-eus-new-internet-rules/">will impact 19 platforms</a>, including five Google services, Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, and Microsoft's Bing search engine. On Wednesday, Meta became the first platform to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/meta-tiktok-fight-eu-gatekeeper-status-to-avoid-opening-up-services-to-rivals/">appeal its gatekeeper status</a> for its Messenger and Marketplace services, <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-eu/appealing-our-gatekeeper-designation-under-the-digital-markets-act">followed shortly thereafter by TikTok</a>.</p>

            <pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 02:40:26 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components-an-example/">https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components-an-example/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38298694">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <p>In <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components/">my article on HTML web components</a>, I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the unique power of web components (in the browser) is that they can render before JavaScript. React components cannot do this — full stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot in there I wanted to explain more in-depth, but I just never go to it.</p>
<p>Then a reader kindly emailed me and asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what do you mean? As far as I know, web components need a JS API to be defined. How can they run before JS?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a great question. Allow me to explain my thinking.</p>
<p>There are different ways to use web components.</p>
<p>One way of using them requires JavaScript in order for them to “run” and display anything in the browser.</p>
<p>An alternate way of using them allows you to display information/content in the browser before any JavaScript executes, and then you use web component structured JavaScript<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">[1]</a></sup> to enhance what’s already on display.</p>
<p>In an attempt to explain this more, let’s use an simplified example.</p>
<p>Imagine we want to build a component for displaying a user’s avatar. It will be an image and, when hovered, it will display a tooltip that shows their full name.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2023/user-avatar-end-result.png" width="220" height="220" alt="Screenshot of a profile photo with a mouse cursor hovering over it and dispaying a name.">

</p><p>If you were building this in React, you could imagine a typical implementation looking something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>Tooltip</span> <span>from</span> <span>"3rd-party-tooltip-on-npm"</span>;

<span>function</span> <span>UserAvatar</span>(<span>{ src, name }</span>) {
  <span>const</span> [showTooltip, setShowTooltip] = <span>useState</span>(<span>false</span>);
  <span>return</span> (
    <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>img</span>
        <span>src</span>=<span>{src}</span>
        <span>alt</span>=<span>{</span>`<span>Profile</span> <span>photo</span> <span>of</span> ${<span>name</span>}`}
        <span>width</span>=<span>"32"</span>
        <span>height</span>=<span>"32"</span>
      /&gt;</span>
      {showTooltip &amp;&amp; <span>&lt;<span>Tooltip</span>&gt;</span>{name}<span>&lt;/<span>Tooltip</span>&gt;</span>}
    <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
  )
}

<span>/**
 * Example usage:
 *
 * &lt;UserAvatar
 *   src="https://www.jim-nielsen.com/.well-known/avatar"
 *   name="Jim Nielsen"
 * /&gt;
 */</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This is nice enough. But the point is: it requires JavaScript (React, <code>3rd-party-tooltip-on-npm</code>, your JS code) before <em>anything</em> will render in the browser. It’s an all-or-nothing approach. If any JavaScript fails to download, parse, and run, the end user will see absolutely nothing. This is what it will look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2023/user-avatar-blank.png" width="220" height="220" alt="Screenshot of a mouse cursor on a blank white screen.">

</p><p>Now, since this is a “component” and the web has components, couldn’t you port it to a web component and remove the dependency on React? Yes, you could. (Note: this code is not meant to be production ready, but illustrative.)</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>user-avatar</span>
  <span>src</span>=<span>"https://www.jim-nielsen.com/.well-known/avatar"</span>
  <span>name</span>=<span>"Jim Nielsen"</span>
&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span><span>
  class UserAvatar extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      const src = this.getAttribute("src");
      const name = this.getAttribute("name");
      this.innerHTML = `
        <span>&lt;<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
          <span>&lt;<span>img</span>
            <span>src</span>=<span>"${src}"</span>
            <span>alt</span>=<span>"Profile photo of ${name}"</span>
            <span>width</span>=<span>"32"</span>
            <span>height</span>=<span>"32"</span>
          /&gt;</span>
          <span>&lt;!-- Markup/code for the tooltip --&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
      `;
    }
  }
  customElements.define('user-avatar', UserAvatar);
</span></span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can see we have a web component that does something very similar to the React component but it doesn’t require React.</p>
<p>It does, however, still require JavaScript. If the user’s browser fails to download, parse, and run any JavaScript, nothing will display on screen. This is what they’ll see:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2023/user-avatar-blank.png" width="220" height="220" alt="Screenshot of a mouse cursor on a blank white screen.">

</p><p>This kind of approach to building web components, per the original question, has a dependence on JavaScript. This web component cannot display anything on screen without JavaScript. It is what I meant in <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components/">my original article</a> when I said “JavaScript web components”.</p>
<p>But there’s another approach to building web components.</p>
<p>This approach is what Jeremy called <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618">“HTML web components”</a>. It does not require JavaScript in order to provide basic functionality. But it does require the author of the component to step back and ask, “What am I trying to build here and how can I do it in a way that progressively enhances the end user’s experience?”</p>
<p>What we want to show to is a profile picture of the user. That shouldn’t require JavaScript, it’s just an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Is there a way for us to provide the basic functionality of <code>&lt;user-avatar&gt;</code> so that, before JavaScript loads (if it loads at all), the user still sees something?</p>
<p>With an approach that considers the idea of HTML web components, you can! Starting with the HTML, you could write something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>img</span>
  <span>src</span>=<span>"https://www.jim-nielsen.com/.well-known/avatar"</span>
  <span>alt</span>=<span>"Profile photo of Jim Nielsen"</span>
  <span>width</span>=<span>"32"</span>
  <span>height</span>=<span>"32"</span>
  <span>title</span>=<span>"Jim Nielsen"</span>
/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Given this HTML, we have a profile photo with some meta information. Note the <code>title</code> attribute: this will display a tooltip on hover (in browsers that support it). So before any JavaScript has been downloaded, parsed, and run, a desktop browser could display something like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2023/user-avatar-base.png" width="220" height="220" alt="Screenshot of a profile photo with a mouse cursor hovering over it displaying a browser-native tooltip.">

</p><p>Is it what we want our end result to look like? No. Will that tooltip work everywhere? No. Is this The Best Thing Ever™️? No.</p>
<p>But that’s not the point. The point is we’re starting with a baseline, core experience that will provide basic functionality and content to a wide array of user agents before any JavaScript is required.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done everything you can in vanilla HTML to provide core elements of your baseline experience, you can begin enhancing the existing markup with additional functionality.</p>
<p>This is where HTML web components shine. You can wrap that basic functionality in a custom element and then, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements">using the JavaScript APIs of web components</a>, enhance the markup.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>img</span>
    <span>src</span>=<span>"https://www.jim-nielsen.com/.well-known/avatar"</span>
    <span>alt</span>=<span>"Profile photo of Jim Nielsen"</span>
    <span>width</span>=<span>"32"</span>
    <span>height</span>=<span>"32"</span>
    <span>title</span>=<span>"Jim Nielsen"</span>
  /&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>
  <span>class</span> <span>UserAvatar</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HTMLElement</span> {
    <span>connectedCallback</span>(<span></span>) {
      <span>// Get the data for the component from exisiting markup</span>
      <span>const</span> $img = <span>this</span>.<span>querySelector</span>(<span>"img"</span>);
      <span>const</span> src = $img.<span>getAttribute</span>(<span>"src"</span>);
      <span>const</span> name = $img.<span>getAttribute</span>(<span>"title"</span>);

      <span>// Create the markup and event listeners for tooltip...</span>

      <span>// Append it to the DOM</span>
      <span>this</span>.<span>insertAdjacentHTML</span>(
        <span>'beforeend'</span>, 
        <span>'&lt;!-- code for tooltip here --&gt;'</span>
      );
    }
  }
  customElements.<span>define</span>(<span>'user-avatar'</span>, <span>UserAvatar</span>);
</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this code is for illustration purposes, but it shows how you can leverage HTML to provide the basic functionality of a component and then you enhance it with JavaScript.</p>
<p>Now you have something that works pretty decent. It displays <em>something</em> before JavaScript without any layout shift<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">[2]</a></sup>. And if/when JavaScript loads, you get that nice experience we wanted from the get go.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2023/user-avatar-both.png" width="520" height="220" alt="Screenshot of a basic HTML profile photo with a `title` tooltip on the left, and an enhanced tooltip with a profile photo on the right.">

</p><p>Hopefully this answers the question of, “I thought web components required JavaScript? How can they run before JavaScript?”</p>
<p>It’s all about approach. Web components give you an approach of augmentation, where you can provide basic functionality and then progressively enhance the experience depending on the end user’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Endnote: I know, I know, there’s a whole lot more that could be said about all the above. For example, a JS framework like <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a> allows you to do something very similar to the above: provide basic HTML over the wire and then enhance (i.e. hydrate) that experience with JavaScript (i.e. React). RSC looks like it’ll do something similar — but that’s all a discussion for another day.</p>
<hr><ol><li id="fn:1">I wrote about <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/web-components-icon-galleries/">how I used custom elements to structure my JavaScript and enhance markup</a>. Then Eric wrote <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/11/01/blinded-by-the-light-dom/">a thoughtful, lengthy post</a> on the same idea, but going way, way deeper into how web components can serve to structure and enhance your HTML, CSS, and JS. <a href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></li><li id="fn:2"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Ri4ft7bXY">Zach’s talk</a> is a great introduction to this idea of building web components in a way that delivers something useful in the initial HTML while also preventing layout shift as JavaScript enhances the markup with additional functionality — a very important UX detail IMO. <a href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></li></ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yes, but ublock origin lite lacks a lot of features that actually makes ublock the best:</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/lbgozpmljr0c1.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33863c01942ae5fda6de2a6e95995e76e3a29241" target="_blank">&lt;image&gt;</a></p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/1067als/eli5_ublock_lite_vs_ublock_origin/">https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/1067als/eli5_ublock_lite_vs_ublock_origin/</a></p>

<p>Not being able to update the filters without having to update the extension itself is a really big deal! I mean when ublock 1.53 came out, it took google almost a freaking week to finally allow the new version.</p>

<p>Why is that a big deal? Imagine that you have a site that you use a lot, that site then implements a way to detect adblock but you are stuck with ublock origin lite, in other words, you can't craft your own filter to by pass that site anti-adblocking(if you have the know how), you can't also come to ubo reddit to ask someone else to craft them for you and with that instantly solve the issue and you also don't have access to element picker which could also solve problem!</p>

<p>Now, the only thing you can do? Report the problem to ubo team, then wait until they add the new filter which will bypass the antiblock to the new version of ubo lite which you don't know when its getting released and after that you will have to wait until google authorizes the new update to be released which like I've said, takes several days!</p>

<p>Another example is youtube itself, if we were stuck with <strong>ubo lite</strong> right now, we would be losing the war against youtube anti-adblock badly! Because the only reason ubo is kinda able to keep up with youtube anti-adblocking is because after youtube updates their blocking script(which is every 12 hours), ubo team then updates their filters and then we as users just need to run the update manually inside the extension and boom we are back on business! Which won't be possible with ubo lite at all.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p dir="ltr">One recent autumn afternoon, I&nbsp;watched the Atlantic gusts collide with the cliffs that rise above Nazaré, Portugal. Rain pelted down, and the world-renowned swells rose into walls of water that even the most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJc4Ir78KdE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death-defying surfers</a> reach only via Jet Ski. For me, this looked like a&nbsp;rained-out, late-season beach getaway, but for the sliver of Iberia that is Portugal, it looked like a&nbsp;bright future. That weekend, the nation of <span>10</span> million <a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/portugal-has-been-using-green-electricity-for-over-24-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ran on nothing but wind, solar and hydropower.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">As it turned out, those rainy, blustery days were just a&nbsp;warmup. Portugal produced more than enough renewable power to serve all its customers for <a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/renewable-energy-production-sets-new-records" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six straight days</a>, from October <span>31</span> to November <span>6</span>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“</span>The gas plants were there, waiting to dispatch energy, should it be needed. It was not, because the wind was blowing; it was raining a&nbsp;lot,” said Hugo Costa, who oversees Portugal for <span>EDP</span> Renewables, the renewables arm of the state utility, which was <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2012/pdf/ocp95_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privatized in <span>2012</span></a>. <span></span>​<span>“</span>And we were producing with a&nbsp;positive impact to the consumers because the prices have dropped dramatically, almost to&nbsp;zero.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">To hit Paris Agreement climate goals by <span>2050</span>, nations need to run their grids without carbon emissions not just for three or six days, but year-round. A&nbsp;handful of countries already do this, thanks to generous endowments of hydropower, largely developed well before the climate crisis drove investment decisions for power plants. Others score highly on carbon-free power thanks to big fleets of nuclear plants.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Portugal falls into a&nbsp;different, more relatable bucket: It started its decarbonization journey with some legacy hydropower, but no nuclear capacity nor plans to build any. That meant it had to figure out how to cut fossil fuel use by maximizing new renewables.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How did Portugal make this happen? It committed to building renewables early and often, pledging a&nbsp;<span>2050</span> deadline for net-zero carbon emissions <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/RNC2050_EN_PT%20Long%20Term%20Strategy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in <span>2016</span></a>, several years before the European Union as a&nbsp;whole found the conviction to <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20191213-european-union-brussels-carbon-neutral-green-deal-2050-poland-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take that step</a>. Portugal’s last coal plants shut down in <span>2022</span>, leaving (imported) fossil gas as the backstop for on-demand power.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>“</span>The key conclusion, in my opinion, is that it shows that the Portuguese grid is prepared for very high shares of renewable electricity and for its expected variation: We were able to manage both the sharp increase of hydro and wind production, and also the return to a&nbsp;lower share of renewables, when natural-gas power plants were requested again to supply some of the country’s demand,” said <a href="https://expresso.pt/autores/2015-05-02-Miguel-Prado-14b44dbf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miguel Prado</a>, who covers Portugal’s energy sector for <em>Expresso</em> newspaper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The task ahead for Portugal’s grid decarbonization is to reduce and ultimately eliminate the number of hours when the country needs to burn gas to keep the lights on. Leaders want gas generation, which made up <a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/renewables-supplied-67-of-the-electricity-consumed-in-october" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>21</span>% of electricity consumption</a> from January through October, to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/portugal-doubles-2030-goals-solar-hydrogen-capacity-2023-07-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end completely by <span>2040</span></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To reach its climate goals, Portugal has focused on diversification of renewable resources; instead of depending primarily on wind, water or sun, it blends each into the portfolio and finds ways to make them more complementary. The country’s power companies are now chasing major additional offshore wind opportunities, expanding solar installations and repowering older onshore wind projects to get more out of the best locations.</p>
<h2><strong>Anatomy of a&nbsp;six-day clean energy streak</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation_Revolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overthrow of the authoritarian Estado Novo dictatorship</a> in <span>1974</span>, the newly formed state utility Energias de Portugal constructed a&nbsp;series of hydroelectric dams on the once-wild rivers that rushed from the eastern mountains to the western coast. The company built its first onshore wind projects in the <span>1990</span>s, when solar simply couldn’t compete economically, and solar installations have only recently started to catch&nbsp;up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why the gray skies didn’t hurt overall renewable production during the country’s recent record-setting stretch, as they would have in, say, California or Hawaii. The wind and hydro were cranking, and that’s what mattered.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any milestone in the rapidly evolving clean energy sector should come with specific parameters. So what exactly did the Portuguese grid accomplish earlier this&nbsp;month?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The six-day record refers to the <a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/renewable-energy-production-sets-new-records" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>149</span> consecutive hours</a> in which <span></span>​<span>“</span>energy from renewable sources exceeded the industrial and household consumption needs across the country.” The country’s previous record for that metric was <span>131</span>&nbsp;hours (a little over five days), achieved in <span>2019</span>. That doesn’t mean that fossil fuel plants weren’t operating — just that the overall renewable generation more than met customer needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But Portugal also just set a&nbsp;national record for meeting the entire electricity system’s needs <span></span>​<span>“</span>without resorting to conventional thermal power generation.” This gas-free stretch started Halloween night and ran for <span>131</span> consecutive hours, about <span>5</span>&nbsp;days, nearly tripling Portugal’s previous record of <span>56</span>&nbsp;hours straight in <span>2021</span>. And for <span>95</span> of those consecutive hours, Portugal exported clean electricity to Spain, because it consistently had more than it needed — again without burning gas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That trendline is the thing to watch. Renewables-friendly weather will come and go, and shoulder months are ripe for renewables to outpace consumer demand because heating or cooling needs are lower than in the summer and winter. But the last time Portugal had ideal conditions for a&nbsp;renewables record, it only lasted one-third as long without burning gas. As more wind and solar capacity comes online, Portugal expands its arsenal for running entirely on renewables.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This particular week stood out, but it exemplifies a&nbsp;historic shift in energy sources. Natural-gas use for Portugal’s electricity production <a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/renewables-supplied-67-of-the-electricity-consumed-in-october" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell <span>39</span>% year-over-year</a> for the period from January to October, according to <span>REN</span>. That brought overall gas use to its lowest level since&nbsp;<span>2006</span>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Portugal has made grid decarbonization perfectly tangible for itself. To reach its climate goals, it needs to take the playbook from this one week in November and run it for longer periods of time, until eventually it doesn’t even need gas on standby. And it has to do so even in the parts of the year when the winds and the rain don’t lash the off-season traveler who’d heard so much about a&nbsp;climate reminiscent of Southern California.</p>

In fact, the status of the Tesla Semi has been classified as “pilot production” in Tesla’s Shareholder Deck for the past year since its launch and Tesla Semi drivers are forbidden (most likely by non-disclosure agreements) from speaking about the Semi, as CNBC reported </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-BVM673pDs&amp;t=828s&amp;ab_channel=CNBC" rel="">here</a><span> (watch from 8:20). </span></p><p>This is why it was with great fortune to receive the details below, which were told to a trusted automotive source of mine by a PepsiCo employee who happened to have time for my friend’s questions about the Semi at a charging station the other day (my friend has owned a Tesla and many other EVs). </p><p>But let’s first look at what Tesla promised about the Semi back in 2017, when they first revealed the new product and said it would be in production by 2019: </p><ul><li><p>500-mile range (800 km) at a maximum load of 82,000 lbs or 37,195 kg</p></li><li><p>0-60 mph in 5 seconds vs 20 seconds for a diesel semi</p></li><li><p>100,000 in output by 2022 (only 90 Semis have been produced through October 2023, according to InsideEVs)</p></li></ul><p>And after one year since its first deliveries to PepsiCo, Tesla has yet to divulge any data on the Tesla Semi except for a tweet from Elon Musk saying that the battery efficiency was 1.7 kWh per mile (a useful number to have with the details from PepsiCo below).  </p><p>Below are the comments from a PepsiCo employee about the Tesla Semi.

[</span><em>this is odd, as all cells made by Panasonic in Nevada are cylindrical cells, but Tesla could be importing these pouches from overseas and packaging them at their Nevada plant. Pouches are lighter than cylindrical cells, so better to be used for the Semi</em><span>]</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The Tesla Semi’s pouch-style battery pack appears to be problematic, as they were easily damaged during a spate of heavy rain showers in California this year</strong><span>. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>All Tesla Semis and other electric trucks are subsidized by California state and the Megacharger station alone cost around $6 million</strong><span> [</span><em>these mega chargers can power up to 28,000 homes</em><span>].&nbsp; </span></p></li><li><p><strong>During the installation process, the Megachargers took down the power grid for a good chunk of the city</strong><span> [</span><em>imagine what happens when 100% of ICE vehicles have switched over to BEV in California by 2035</em><span>]. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Tesla isn’t using special-grade truck parts for the Tesla Semi</strong><span> (i.e. weight and energy-grade heavy-duty parts).&nbsp; </span><strong>Tesla is using car parts on the Semi, which is why it breaks down so often given the range at which PepsiCo is driving its fleet</strong><span>.  </span></p></li><li><p><strong>There is a team of Tesla engineers on call 24 hours a day, ready to fly out and fix anything wrong with the Tesla Semis. No one at PepsiCo is allowed to fix the Semi</strong><span>.&nbsp; </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Tesla is using a double wishbone suspension on the Semi which the PepsiCo employee said makes zero sense and shows how Tesla simply threw car parts—not heavy-duty truck parts—into the Tesla Semi</strong><span>.&nbsp; </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Center seating, which looks cool in the Tesla Semi launch video, is actually not practical and not well liked by PepsiCo’s drivers</strong><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>There is no consideration for battery longevity, which is another reason why the batteries keep dying and Tesla Semis need to be towed away</strong><span> [</span><em>the Megachargers used for the Semi release 750 kW and only require 50 minutes for a 400-mile charge; that’s a ton of energy that will wear the batteries out quickly, but cost isn’t a consideration it appears; just performance</em><span>]. &nbsp; </span></p></li><li><p><strong>None of the Tesla Semi drivers care about the fact that the Semi can accelerate to 60 mph (96 kph) in 20 seconds. People commenting on the Tesla Semi say it might help in passing other trucks, but PepsiCo’s employee said nobody cared</strong><span> [</span><em>Tesla uses the the tri-motor system from the Models S/X Plaid on one axle of the Semi, which seems both dangerous and needless, given the lack of concern among Semi users for quick acceleration</em><span>].</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Pepsi is “all in” on the Tesla Semi despite all the problems </strong><span>[</span><em>this is no surprise, given that California taxpayers are paying for all of the absurd costs of this project</em><span>].</span></p></li></ul><p>All of the above tidbits on the Tesla Semi from inside PepsiCo make sense and some of it was speculated over by Jason Fenske, the brilliant man behind the YouTube channel, “Engineering Explained”. </p><p><span>Specifically, he said that the 500-mile test drive of the Semi was suspect, as the size of the battery pack couldn’t support a drive that long at 60 miles per hour (96 kph) of constant speed. He showed that the Tesla-filmed test drive of the Semi revealed that the Semi’s odometer was only at 60 mph for 15% of the haul (full video </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvg_i0GE0Vo&amp;ab_channel=EngineeringExplained" rel="">here</a><span>).  </span></p><p>Why is PepsiCo going to all this trouble to use such ineffective vehicles to transport their products? Because they need all the ESG points they can get by using electric vehicles (they also use Volvos, Fords &amp; others) to transport the poison they peddle: PepsiCo’s food and beverage products are a major cause of the rising obesity problems in the US.

Because Elon needed a pump for Tesla’s stock back in 2017. Keep in mind that Tesla was close to bankruptcy due to troubles with the Model 3 launch between 2017 to 2019, but Elon Musk’s own admission. </p><p>And Musk recently said in June that the Semi won’t see higher-volume production until late 2024 “due to battery supply constraints”. This was a blatant lie. Recent earnings calls at Panasonic and LG Energy Solutions revealed that the two battery cell makers are seeing excess capacity as their customers’ EV models are seeing a slowdown in sales (Tesla Models S/X) and others are pushing out their EV capex to 2025 (Ford and GM). </p><p>The Semi was simply another pump that never came to fruition, somewhat like battery pack swapping back in 2014 at Tesla. It would be no surprise to see the Tesla Semi discontinued or simply not mentioned anymore after 2024 unless battery packs become as cheap as ICE vehicle engines. For now, I believe it’s safe to say that electric Semis are a joke. And Elon Musk is the master joker.   </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg" width="1015" height="931" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:931,&quot;width&quot;:1015,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:118310,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Nothing in this report is investment advice.
