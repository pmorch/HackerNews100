A <a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?members/1486/" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="1486" data-username="@Wesk">@Wesk</a> and Yveltal collaboration!</p><p>

Last summer, while Wesk was developing the Final Destination OMEGA, he and I discussed creating a Wii micro build even smaller than the GC Nano.</p><p>

The first build to ever <b><span>FULLY</span> </b>utilize the OMEGA trim. The smallest functional Wii ever made, barely larger than the outline of the OMEGA trim itself. A literal <span><b>keychain </b></span><b><span><b>Wii!</b></span></b></p><p>

Back then, I was imagining a more traditional form factor, with a fan, 5mm heatsink, controller ports, and micro-HDMI out. Here are some of my early CAD mockups.</p><p>

<a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34376/" target="_blank">View attachment 34376</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34377/" target="_blank">View attachment 34377</a></p><p>

A few weeks later, I had the idea to replace the plastic shell and heatsink with a machined metal unibody. Also, I replaced the controller, A/V and power ports with magnetic pogo pin connectors, shrinking it even further. Wesk did some sweet renders of this design.</p><p>

<a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34378/" target="_blank">View attachment 34378</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34382/" target="_blank">View attachment 34382</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34383/" target="_blank">View attachment 34383</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34384/" target="_blank">View attachment 34384</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34385/" target="_blank">View attachment 34385</a></p><p>

As you can see, the regulators were still off-board at this point in time (on that triangular sub-PCB). This was all pre-undervolting and pre-Thundervolt! But just a few short weeks later, Wesk and Drew had cracked the code on Wii undervolting, and we started talking about <b><span>passively cooling</span></b> the Kawaii.</p><p>

Somehow nearly a year passed as I worked on Wii U trim development, and then Thundervolt development. Wesk and I realized that putting Thundervolt in Kawaii was a no-brainer, even if it meant we couldn't use an FD Omega and the unit had to grow a tiny bit, from <b><span>57x57mm</span></b> to <b><span>60x60mm</span></b>.</p><p>

Wesk took over MCAD duties and reworked the shell with new organic fins, and soon after a single magnetic pogo-pin connector.</p><p>

He also designed a dock! Originally, I anticipated using a bunch of octopus adapter cables to connect everything to the unit. But this dock will keep the Kawaii vertically oriented for optimal heat convection through the fins, and means we don't need to lug around adapters for GC controllers.</p><p>

That brings us to today! The final Kawaii shell will be machined from aluminum and anodized in a variety of gorgeous colors. The back will be laser-etched with the project logo and dope-looking fake compliance markings.</p><p>

<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b><span>60x60x16mm</span></b> CNC'd aluminum chassis (passively-cooled) with laser etched artwork</li>

Just in case the <b>60x60x16mm </b>size wasn't registering, here's how Kawaii compares to the GC Nano and Short Stack:<br>

One more thing: like the GC Nano and Short Stack, Kawaii will be fully open source once it's complete!

<p>I’m sorry, Dell. This is 2024, not 2014. Now that people have gotten a taste of working from home, they’re not going back to the office. You’d think that would be clear by now — now just at Dell, but almost everywhere.</p>

		
		
			


<p>Why? Let me count the reasons:</p>



<ol>
<li>&nbsp;No commute on crowded highways;</li>



<li>&nbsp;A better life/work balance;</li>



<li>&nbsp;Cost savings;</li>



<li>&nbsp;Flexibility to choose where to live (and work).</li>



<li>&nbsp;More control over your workplace.</li>
</ol>



<p>I’ve been working from home for decades, which makes me something of an exception compared to a lot of workers. But my experience holds for people who got their work-from-home start during the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column1 -->
								
					<div>


<p>I used to work out of a Manhattan office, but I lived in New Carrollton, Maryland. How did I do it? I took Amtrak to work on Monday and returned home on Friday. I’d joke that I walked to work — first to my local train station and then from Penn Station to the office. There were just a few hours in the middle when I’d work from the dining car.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More often than not, though, I’d just work from home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I decided to move to Asheville, NC, in 2001, my bosses agreed to let me move because, as I told them then, I could always catch a same-day flight if they really needed me in the office. But, as I told them, I doubted there would be any reason I’d need to be there.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column2 -->
								
					<div>


<p>I was right. While I still fly to New York City occasionally for work, I never had to be there for the job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Better still. I had more time to be home — and I saved money to boot. It’s cheaper to make a sandwich in my kitchen than to get lunch at a deli near the office in midtown Manhattan. Finally, I love living in mountainous and green Asheville rather than the flat and asphalt-covered area inside the Washington, DC beltway.</p>



<p>In short, I’m happy working at home and have been for more than two decades. Most <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2075520/why-even-hybrid-return-to-office-mandates-are-hurting-overall-job-satisfaction.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2075520/why-even-hybrid-return-to-office-mandates-are-hurting-overall-job-satisfaction.html">people who work from home feel the same</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column3 -->
								
					<div>


<p>Companies might want people’s rumps back in office chairs, but according to a recent&nbsp;Gartner&nbsp;report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-01-30-gartner-hr-research-finds-high-performers-women-millennials-are-greatest-flight-risks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">48% of employees say their company’s mandates prioritize what leaders want</a>&nbsp;rather than what employees need to do good work.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s right. At far too many companies, the desire for control trumps what people really need to do their best work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In particular, Caitlin Duffy, the Gartner HR practice director, said: “High-performing employees are more easily able to pursue opportunities at organizations that offer hybrid or fully remote policies.”&nbsp;</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column4 -->
								
					<div>


<p>If they don’t get those work-from-home opportunities, they’ll leave. That, in turn, “means <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2138277/senior-employees-ordered-back-to-the-office-are-jumping-ship.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2138277/senior-employees-ordered-back-to-the-office-are-jumping-ship.html">losing high-performers to attrition</a>, costs organizations in terms of productivity, [can cause] difficulty in backfilling the role, and the overall loss of high-quality talent available to fill critical positions,” Duffy said.</p>



<p>Ding! Ding! Ding!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s another piece of evidence that people are not, in capital letters, returning to the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the latest Moody’s commercial real estate analysis,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/09/office-vacancy-rate-record-high" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">office vacancy rates have never been higher</a>. Just over one in five offices is now vacant. (The only reason that percentage isn’t higher is that companies have yet to be able to get out of long-term leases.)</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column5 -->
								
					<div>


<p>Might I note that once that lease has ended, companies&nbsp;&nbsp;won’t have to pay for that office space. It’s a win-win  —unless your business is commercial real estate.</p>



<p>Put it all together, and what do you get? You get the new work culture of the early-mid-21st century and beyond. It’s all work from home from here on out, folks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deal with it. And enjoy it.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A newly discovered hormone that keeps the bones of breastfeeding women strong could also help bone fractures heal and treat osteoporosis in the broader population. Researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Davis showed that in mice, the hormone known as Maternal Brain Hormone (CCN3) increases bone density and strength.</p>

<p>Their results, published July 10 in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07634-3">Nature</a></em>, solve a long-standing puzzle about how women’s bones remain relatively robust during breastfeeding, even as calcium is stripped from bones to support milk production.</p>

<p>“One of the remarkable things about these findings is that if we hadn’t been studying female mice, which unfortunately is the norm in biomedical research, then we could have completely missed out on this finding,” said <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/holly.ingraham">Holly Ingraham</a>, PhD, the senior author of the new paper and a professor cellular molecular pharmacology at UCSF. “It underscores just how important it is to look at both male and female animals across the lifespan to get a full understanding of biology.”</p>

<p>More than 200 million people worldwide suffer from osteoporosis, a severe weakening of the bones that can cause frequent fractures. Women are at particularly high risk of osteoporosis after menopause because of declining levels of the sex hormone estrogen, which normally promotes bone formation. Estrogen levels are also low during breastfeeding, yet osteoporosis and bone fractures are much rarer during this time, suggesting that something other than estrogen promotes bone growth.</p>

<h2>A hormone that is only produced during lactation</h2>

<p>Ingraham’s lab <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a15f8a6-ac1d-44ac-bde0-ba4d117aecda" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2019/01/413001/ultra-sturdy-bones-surprising-origin-suggest-new-osteoporosis-approach" title="Ultra-Sturdy Bones, with a Surprising Origin, Suggest New Osteoporosis Approach ">previously discovered</a> that in female mice, but not male mice, blocking a particular estrogen receptor found in select neurons in a small area of the brain led to huge increases in bone mass. They suspected that a hormone in the blood was responsible for the super-strong bones but, at the time, could not find it – a quest that was further protracted during the worldwide pandemic.</p>

<p>In the new work, Ingraham and collaborators carried out an exhaustive search for this bone-building hormone and finally pinpointed CCN3 as the factor responsible in mutant females. Initially, the team was surprised by this result, as CCN3 did not fit the typical profile of a secreted hormone from neurons.</p>

<p>Their doubts vanished after they found CCN3 in the same brain region in lactating female mice. Without the production of CCN3 in these select neurons, lactating female mice rapidly lost bone, and their babies began to lose weight, confirming the importance of the hormone in maintaining bone health during lactation. Based on this discovery, they now refer to CCN3 as Maternal Brain Hormone (MBH).</p>

<h2>Hormone strengthens bones in young, old, male and female mice</h2>



<p>When strategies to increase circulating CCN3 were implemented in young adult and older female or male mice, their bone mass and strength increased dramatically over the course of weeks. In some female mice who lacked all estrogen or were very old, CCN3 was able to more than double bone mass.</p>

<p>When Ingraham’s scientific collaborator, <a href="https://profiles.ucdavis.edu/thomas.ambrosi">Thomas Ambrosi</a>, PhD, an assistant professor of orthopaedic surgery at UC Davis, tested these bones, he was surprised by their strength.</p>

<p>“There are some situations where highly mineralized bones are not better; they can be weaker and actually break more easily,” he explained. “But when we tested these bones, they turned out to be much stronger than usual.”</p>

<p>Ambrosi looked closely at the stem cells within the bones that are responsible for generating new bone and found that when these cells were exposed to CCN3, they were much more prone to generate new bone cells.</p>

<h2>A hydrogel patch heals fractures in mice</h2>

<p>To test the ability of the hormone to assist in bone healing, the researchers created a hydrogel patch that could be applied directly to the site of a bone fracture, where it would slowly release CCN3 for two weeks. In elderly mice, bone fractures don’t usually heal well. However, the CCN3 patch spurred the formation of new bone at the site of the fracture, contributing to youthful healing of the fracture.</p>

<p>“We’ve never been able to achieve this kind of mineralization and healing outcome with any other strategy,” Ambrosi said. “We’re really excited to follow it up and potentially apply CCN3 in the context of other problems, such as regrowing cartilage.”</p>

<p>The researchers plan to carry out future studies on the molecular mechanisms of CCN3, its levels in breastfeeding women, as well as the potential of the hormone to treat a variety of bone conditions.</p>

<p><a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/muriel.babey">Muriel Babey</a>, MD, a co-first author and mentored physician-scientist in the Division of Endocrinology at UCSF, is keen to begin asking how CCN3 impacts bone metabolism in clinically relevant disease settings. Partnering with the UCSF Catalyst program, <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/william.krause">William Krause</a>, PhD, a senior scientist and co-lead on this project will begin translating these new results.</p>

<p>“Bone loss happens not only in post-menopausal women but often occurs in breast cancer survivors that take certain hormone blockers; in younger, highly trained elite female athletes; and in older men whose relative survival rate is poorer than women after a hip fracture,” Ingraham said. “It would be incredibly exciting if CCN3 could increase bone mass in all these scenarios.”</p>

            <p>Hello brr readers!</p>
            <p>It’s been an absolute delight keeping in touch with y’all during my ~8 months post-Antarctica.</p>
            <p>I’ve connected with folks all over the world – at remote outposts, on ships, at other Antarctic (and Arctic!)
              stations, and in all sorts of fascinating life circumstances. People have shared their stories, asked insightful
              questions, and compared notes about remote infrastructure, itinerant “gig” work, and the vastness of human
              experience.</p>
            <p>Now, it’s time for me to commit to something new, build connections in a new place, and find new things to
              work on that bring me joy and fulfillment.</p>
            <p>Maybe some of you can help!</p>
            <p><strong><em>tl;dr:</em></strong> <em>Please reach out to me if you know of work opportunities, primarily (but not exclusively) in Denver, that
                I might enjoy, as a mid-career IT and infrastructure generalist with an interest in clean energy and electrical grids.
                Also, separate from work and jobs, I’d love to meet people who are local to the Denver area!</em></p>

            <h2 id="adventures">What I’ve been up to</h2>
            <p>In the 8 months since leaving the South Pole in November 2023, I’ve done a fair bit of exploring, and a bit of
              short-term contract IT work.</p>
            <p>After returning from my post-ice vacation in New Zealand, I visited friends and family in the US Midwest,
              then took the meandering route back to San Francisco using an
              <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/tickets/departure-rail-pass.html">Amtrak USA Rail Pass</a>:
              10 rail segments, 30 days, and a great way to see the United States.</p>
            <p>I spent a few months doing a fixed-term IT contract with some friends, at a radio astronomy observatory in rural
              Northern California. We got to witness the auroras caused by
              the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2024_solar_storms">May 2024 solar storms</a>.</p>
            
            <p>And finally – I recently relocated to the Denver Metro Area, where I’m writing this post.</p>
            <p>And that brings us to now. It’s time for me to get a job. Based on my past communications with brr readers,
              I think some of you might have ideas or recommendations.</p>
            <h2 id="anonymity">Who I am</h2>
            <p>When I started this blog, for my friends and family, I was “anonymous” only on paper. Sure, the blog
              didn’t give away my identity, but people who I knew in real life were well aware that I was running it.
              I was writing for an audience of just a handful of people.
              Anonymity was just a technical feature, one that I chose to implement for fun. It
              wasn’t something that I felt strongly about.</p>
            <p>But in late October / early November 2022, shortly after I wrote about
              <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/wastewater-plant">The McMurdo Wastewater Treatment Plant</a>, I noticed that brr had been picked up by a
              handful of online message boards. There’s no stopping Internet momentum once it starts.</p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://brr.fyi/media/brr-wants-a-job/blog-traffic-01.png">

                </picture>
                <em>oh no</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>It was fun to discover that there was an audience hungry
              for this type of writing, but it was also terrifying to realize that every word I wrote, from then on,
              would be combed over and scrutinized by Internet strangers. I knew this to be true, because I
              watched it happen, in real time, across message boards.</p>
            <p>I have a distinct memory of sitting in the
              Crary IT office in McMurdo, on a Sunday afternoon, feeling a mix of shock and horror as thousands of
              Internet strangers read my post. I remember reading along as dozens of commenters picked apart the technical
              minutiae of wastewater treatment processing across online message boards.</p>
            <p>I combed through my posts over and over, trying to reassure myself that I hadn’t gotten anything
              factually wrong, disclosed any restricted information, or otherwise made any mistakes that would stick out
              with this newfound attention.</p>
            <p>At this point, I decided to 1.) lean into the momentum and continue writing, 2.) be precise and careful,
              3.) tailor my writing to my newly-expanded audience, and 4.) commit to staying anonymous.</p>
            <p>And the blog continued to grow in popularity. When I published <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/last-flight-out">Last Flight Out</a> in
              February 2023, I surpassed 1TB of monthly CloudFront egress for the first time, as tens of thousands
              of people around the world read about how we prepared South Pole Station for the long winter.</p>
            <p>When I published <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/engineering-for-slow-internet">Engineering for Slow Internet</a> in late May 2024, I found myself
              at the top of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2024-05-31">Hacker News</a> for the day, and the post
              received about 200,000 non-bot pageviews in the first 48 hours.</p>
            <p>Throughout this adventure, anonymity was a helpful tool, and I was glad I had built it in from the start.
              Anonymity kept the focus on my experience <em>in Antarctica</em>. It allowed Antarctic Infrastructure to
              stay front and center, just as I had originally intended. It helped me, my colleagues, and my back-home friends
              stay out of a personal spotlight that none of us had signed up for.</p>
            <p>Antarctica is vast, and the people who work there have a variety of opinions about a variety of topics.
              I was extremely wary of thrusting any person, team, or project into the spotlight.
              Some people explicitly cultivate real-name publicity associated with their time in Antarctica;
              others recoil in horror at the slightest risk of being Perceived™.</p>
            <p>Some “ice people” love that the brr blog took off the way it did, and they believe it’s a wholesome and good-natured
              way to share a love of infrastructure with fellow enthusiasts around the world. Others are
              baffled that thousands of Internet strangers care about wastewater treatment at all.</p>
            <p>Still others find the tone of this blog to be
              off-putting, either because they believe that nothing should be said in public at all, or because
              they believe I have drastically mis-represented the day-to-day experience of working within the program. This is
              an entirely valid critique, and it’s one that I fully accept.</p>
            <p>Brr is primarily an infrastructure blog. If you are interested in the United States Antarctic Program in more
              detail, I recommend reading
              Nicholas Johnson’s <a href="https://feralhouse.com/big-dead-place/">Big Dead Place</a>. I have done so, and it resonates
              strongly with me. Johnson cared deeply about Antarctica, and
              I appreciate that he was willing to write candidly about its shortcomings.
              I can’t recommend this book highly enough if
              you’re interested in getting a more holistic picture about the day-to-day sociological context of Antarctic
              contract work. Johnson wrote about this topic more eloquently
              than I could ever hope to accomplish. His insights are as valid today as they were in 2005.</p>
            <p>Anonymity was also helpful due to my status as a worker on
              the United States Antarctic Program’s Antarctic Support Contract.
              For the firms that administer these large contracts, one aspect of the job
              is to keep an eye on staff members’ social media activity. This is especially true for
              contracts associated with subjects of high public interest such as Antarctica.</p>
            <p>Nothing in my employment contract prohibited
              me from maintaining this blog, as long as I complied with the relevant
              <a href="https://www.usap.gov/technology/1563/">policies</a>. But – I’m sure that
              some folks at <a href="https://www.leidos.com/capabilities/mission-operations/antarctic-support-contract">Leidos</a> and
              the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OPP">NSF Office of Polar Programs</a> were
              monitoring this blog, because I know with certainty that they were
              monitoring (and, in some cases, actively intervening with) colleagues’ social media.</p>
            <p>For people inside the
              Antarctic program, it would have been trivial to work out who I was.
              For example, just the two datapoints
              <em>“flew to McMurdo on August 28, 2022”</em> and <em>“flew to Pole on December 15, 2022”</em> are
              enough for anyone with access to the flight manifests to narrow it down to just me.</p>
            <p>Staying officially anonymous sent a signal that I wasn’t live-blogging my experience for real-world
              professional gain while I was still employed in Antarctica. This is a big no-no according to the policies.
              This was also one of the reasons I turned down higher-profile inquiries, such as newspapers or documentaries.</p>
            <p>But now that I’m 1.) no longer in Antarctica, 2.) a healthy 8 months removed from the experience, and
              3.) starting to look for non-Antarctica things to do next, I don’t feel that anonymity is necessary or helpful
              anymore.</p>
            <p>Brr is the only thing I’ve ever written on the Internet, and it grew beyond my expectations.
              You’ve all been so kind, and I’ve truly enjoyed every connection, however small,
              that I’ve been able to make with fascinating people around the world.</p>
            <p>Hi – my name is <a href="https://paulcoldren.org/">Paul Coldren</a>, and it has been quite an adventure keeping this blog
              anonymously

            </p>
            <p>So, now that I’m a Real Person™️ instead of an anonymous blogger, I’d like some help finding a new project to
              work on. Thanks in advance!</p>
            <h2 id="job">Help me find a job</h2>
            <p>I’ve always been interested in infrastructure and systems. Working at the South Pole was a
              fantastic way to see a bunch of this up close.</p>
            <p>I’m not just referring to technological infrastructure
              (<em>how exactly</em> <strong><em>do</em></strong> <em>you run server infrastructure at the South Pole?</em>). I’m also referring
              to organizational infrastructure. I got to see the ins and outs of government employment, contracting,
              procurement, supply chains, budgeting, and military logistics.</p>
            <p>I also got to meet a bunch of new people, and I got to explore the world of
              itinerant, gig-chasing contract work. This was all new to me, and I found it all
              to be fascinating and fulfilling.</p>
            <p>For this next phase, I’d like to try establishing a home base, finding a community, and working on something new.</p>
            <p>For the rest of this post, I’ll be describing my skills and interests. My hope is that brr readers who
              are hiring or are aware of openings will reach out.</p>
            <h3 id="skills">What I’m good at</h3>
            <p>I come from a high tech background.
              I have a computer science degree, and just over a decade of experience doing a variety of high tech work.</p>
            <p>I’ve worked at FAANG and FAANG-adjacent megacorps, tiny 10-person startups, and everything in between. I’ve worked
              on software applications, consumer electronics, and business hardware products. My 14 months in Antarctica
              gave me exposure to the world of regulated government engineering. I spent approximately two years
              as a self-employed IT and infrastructure consultant. I’ve worked in individual contributor and tech lead roles.</p>
            <p>My expertise these days is primarily as an IT engineering and infrastructure engineering generalist.
              That being said, go back about ~8 years, and my job title was “Senior Software Test Engineer”. So – there
              is some pure software experience in there.</p>
            <p>In Antarctica, they called me “Senior Systems Administrator, South Pole Station”. Prior to that, I’ve worn a
              variety of hats, including “IT Director”, “Senior Infrastructure Engineer”, “IT Engineering Consultant”, and
              “Senior Software Test Engineer”.</p>
            <p>I work best in a high-trust environment, where I’m accountable for an outcome instead of a series of
              predetermined steps. I’m a systems thinker, and I feel most at home when I’m bringing order, robustness,
              determinism, and risk characterization to an ad-hoc system. I’m precise and detail-oriented, when such traits
              are warranted for the task at hand.
              I enjoy working on resilience engineering, contingency planning, workflow automation, and monitoring projects.</p>
            <p>For example, from day one, I’ll think about
              building and securing out-of-band administrative access for important services. I’ll be the one
              documenting service owners, runbooks, and recovery playbooks. Or, depending on risk tolerance, it means
              I’ll at least explicitly document our decision to defer building these items.</p>
            <p>It also means I’m the person who grabs the RJ45 crimper “just in case”. I’m
              the person who remembers to photograph the inside of the junction box, before we seal it up and stuff it back in
              the attic. I’m the person who maintains the wiki page listing all our vendor contacts.</p>
            <h3 id="goals">What I’m looking for</h3>
            <p>I’m passionate about physical, civil infrastructure, so I’m hoping my next role will be <strong>tangible</strong>. I’m interested
              in working on a team and in a role where I routinely interact with tangible facets of our built environment.</p>
            <p>I am especially interested in clean energy, electrification, and power grid engineering. Some of my past jobs
              have been on grid analytics, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and battery engineering. I’d love to continue
              working in this field.</p>
            <p>As a hobby, I hold an <a href="https://abycinc.org/marine-electrical-certification/">ABYC</a> marine electrical certification,
              and I’ve built small-scale solar + storage energy projects for off-grid installations.</p>
            <p>I’m particularly interested in solar, wind, and hydro developers. Grid resiliency engineering companies.
              Home and commercial electrification companies. Anything where I can help push the industry forward, get more
              renewable energy online, build a robust electrical grid, and electrify everything.</p>
            <p>I’m also interested in Internet accessibility and reliability. I spend time with the
              <a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/">FCC Broadband map</a> and the <a href="https://atlas.ripe.net/">RIPE Atlas</a>
              portal for fun, and in past jobs I’ve worked on connectivity tools and services.</p>
            <p>I’m mostly interested in IT and infrastructure roles. I am qualified, but not particularly interested, in pure
              software roles. I did those for the first ~5 years of my career, before beginning to transition over more to
              the IT and infrastructure side.</p>
            <p>Is your growing company hiring its first IT Administrator? Are you looking for someone to handle
              your 50+ SaaS applications, identity challenges, office IT, compliance, and corporate hardware management tasks?
              Let’s talk.</p>
            <p>Do you have a fleet of systems, services, and workloads, running in an onprem, cloud, or hybrid environment, and
              you need a competent Systems Administrator generalist to help tame the chaos? Let’s talk.</p>
            <p>Is your growing engineering team facing engineering workflow, testing, staging, productionization, or
              monitoring challenges? Are you looking for a competent Infrastructure Engineer? Let’s talk.</p>
            <p><em>And of course, as a wildcard –</em> <strong><em>do you work on something that someone who geeks out about Antarctic Infrastructure
                  might enjoy, even if it doesn’t neatly fall into one of the above categories?</em></strong> <em>Let’s talk!</em></p>
            <p>Again, I’m <a href="https://paulcoldren.org/">Paul Coldren</a>, and you can find relevant professional information about me
              on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/coldren-paul/">LinkedIn</a>.
              You can reach me via email at <a href="mailto:hello@brr.fyi">hello@brr.fyi</a>.</p>
            <p><em>Also, I’m just starting to socialize and meet new people here. I’d love to meet up
                with brr readers in the Denver area! I need to find groups for lap swimming and day hikes. And, of course,
                I’ll need to get connected with local Denver infrastructure enthusiasts…
                <a href="https://www.metrowaterrecovery.com/community/tours/">wastewater treatment plant tour</a>, anyone?</em></p>
            <p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>In the future, computers will not crash due to bad software updates, even those updates that involve kernel code. In the future, these updates will push <a href="https://ebpf.io/">eBPF</a> code.</p>

<p>Friday July 19th provided an unprecedented example of the inherent dangers of kernel programming, and has been called the largest outage in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident#Cost">history</a> of information technology. Windows computers around the world encountered blue-screens-of-death and boot loops, causing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/19/microsoft-windows-outage-blue-screen-bsod/">outages</a> for hospitals, airlines, banks, grocery stores, media broadcasters, and more. This was caused by a <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-update-for-windows-hosts-technical-details/">config update</a> by a security company for their widely used product that included a kernel driver on Windows systems. The update caused the kernel driver to <a href="https://medium.com/@shyamsundarb/technical-details-of-the-windows-bsod-disaster-due-to-crowdstrike-58de2371c19c">try to read invalid memory</a>, an error type that will crash the kernel.</p>

<p>For Linux systems, the company behind this outage was already in the process of adopting eBPF, which is immune to such crashes. Once Microsoft's <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows">eBPF support for Windows</a> becomes production-ready, Windows security software can be ported to eBPF as well. These security agents will then be safe and unable to cause a Windows kernel crash.</p>

<p>eBPF (no longer an acronym) is a secure kernel execution environment, similar to the secure JavaScript runtime built into web browsers. If you're using Linux, you likely already have eBPF available on your systems whether you know it or not, as it was included in the kernel several years ago. eBPF programs cannot crash the entire system because they are safety-checked by a software verifier and are effectively run in a sandbox. If the verifier finds any unsafe code, the program is rejected and not executed. The verifier is rigorous -- the Linux implementation has <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/bpf/verifier.c">over 20,000 lines of code</a> -- with contributions from industry (e.g., Meta, Isovalent, Google) and academia (e.g., <a href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~sn624/verified-sandboxing.html">Rutgers University</a>, <a href="https://unsat.cs.washington.edu/projects/jitterbug/">University of Washington</a>). The safety this provides is a key benefit of eBPF, along with heightened security and lower resource usage.</p>

<p>Some eBPF-based security startups (e.g., <a href="https://www.oligo.security/blog/recent-crowdstrike-outage-emphasizes-the-need-for-ebpf-based-sensors">Oligo</a>, <a href="https://www.uptycs.com/blog/crowdstrike-outage-less-intrusive-malware-detection">Uptycs</a>) have made their own statements about the recent outage, and the advantages of migrating to eBPF. Larger tech companies are also adopting eBPF for security. As an example, Cisco acquired the eBPF-startup Isovalent and has announced a new eBPF security product: <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco-hypershield-reimagining-security">Cisco Hypershield</a>, a fabric for security enforcement and monitoring. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4YKcMV8iaY">Google</a> and <a href="https://lpc.events/event/17/contributions/1602/">Meta</a> already rely on eBPF to detect and stop bad actors in their fleet, thanks to eBPF's speed, deep visibility, and safety guarantees. Beyond security, eBPF is also used for networking and observability.</p>

<p>The worst thing an eBPF program can do is to merely consume more resources than is desirable, such as CPU cycles and memory. eBPF cannot prevent developers writing poor code -- wasteful code -- but it will prevent serious issues that cause a system to crash. That said, as a new technology eBPF has had some bugs in its management code, including a <a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7068083">Linux kernel panic</a> discovered by the same security company in the news today. This doesn't mean that eBPF has solved nothing, substituting a vendor's bug for its own. Fixing these bugs in eBPF means fixing these bugs for <em>all</em> eBPF vendors, and more quickly improving the security of everyone.</p>

<p>There are other ways to reduce risks during software deployment that can be employed as well: canary testing, staged rollouts, and "resilience engineering" in general. What's important about the eBPF method is that it is a software solution that will be available in both Linux and Windows kernels by default, and has already been adopted for this use case.</p>

<p>If your company is paying for commercial software that includes kernel drivers or kernel modules, you can make eBPF a requirement. It's possible for Linux today, and Windows soon. While some vendors have already proactively adopted eBPF (thank you), others might need a little encouragement from their paying customers. Please help raise awareness, and together we can make such global outages a lesson of the past.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A trailblazing physicist who gave up her PhD 75 years ago to have a family has received an honorary doctorate from her former university.</p><p>Rosemary Fowler, 98, discovered the kaon particle during her doctoral research under Cecil Powell at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofbristol" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">University of Bristol</a> in 1948, which contributed to his Nobel prize for physics in 1950.</p><p>Fowler’s discovery helped lead to a revolution in the theory of particle physics, and it continues to be proven correct – predicting particles such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/higgs-boson" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Higgs boson</a>, discovered at Cern in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>But she left university without completing her PhD to marry fellow physicist Peter Fowler in 1949, a decision she later described as pragmatic after she went on to have three children in a time of postwar food rationing.</p><p>She has now been awarded an honorary doctor of science by the University of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bristol" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Bristol</a> chancellor, Sir Paul Nurse, in a private graduation ceremony close to her Cambridge home.</p><p>Fowler said she felt “very honoured” but added: “I haven’t done anything since to deserve special respect.”</p><p>Nurse praised Fowler’s “intellectual rigour and curiosity”, which “paved the way for critical discoveries that continue to shape the work of today’s physicists, and our understanding of the universe”.</p><p>At 22, Fowler spotted something when viewing unusual particle tracks – a particle that decayed into three pions, a type of subatomic particle.</p><p>She said: “I knew at once that it was new and would be very important. We were seeing things that hadn’t been seen before – that’s what research in particle physics was. It was very exciting.”</p><p>The track, later labelled K, was evidence of an unknown particle, now known as the kaon or K meson.</p><p>The K track was the mirror image of a particle seen before by colleagues in Manchester, but their track decayed into two pions, not three. Trying to understand how these images were the same, yet behaved differently, helped lead to a revolution in the theory of particle physics.</p><p>The year after the discovery, Fowler left university having published her discovery in three academic papers.</p><p>Fowler was born in Suffolk in 1926, and excelled in maths and science as a child but found writing a challenge. She was the only girl in her year to go to university.</p><p>She became one of the first women to be awarded a first in physics, and her three children went on to study science.</p><p>Her daughter, Mary Fowler, studied maths and then geophysics at Cambridge and had an academic career in Switzerland, Canada, London and finally Cambridge, where she was the master of Darwin College from 2012-20.</p></div></div>]]></description>

This number has </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/the-missing-men/488858/" rel="">more than doubled</a><span> since the 1970s. </span></p><p><span>Over the past half-century, the number of men per capita behind bars has</span><a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/correctional-populations-united-states-2013" rel=""> more than quadrupled</a><span>.</span></p><p>Among white American males in the bottom 30 percent of socioeconomic status, the number of prison inmates per capita has quintupled since 1975. For those in the top 20 percent of socioeconomic status, the rate has remained virtually unchanged.</p><p>From Edin and Kefalas:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Most social scientists who study poor families assume financial troubles are the cause of these breakups. After all, these young people grow up in a context of extreme disadvantage, at least by American standards, and they come of age with little education, few skills, and not many future prospects. Lack of money is certainly a contributing cause, as we will see, but rarely the only factor. It is usually the young father’s criminal behavior, the spells of incarceration that so often follow, a pattern of intimate violence, his chronic infidelity, and an inability to leave drugs and alcohol alone that cause relationships to falter and die.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Poor behavior from young males is an important and often overlooked reason why rates of fatherless homes have increased. &nbsp;</p><p>More from the book:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Money is seldom the primary reason mothers give to explain why they and their children’s fathers are no longer together. Although a lazy or spendthrift boyfriend is certainly an aggravation…the mother usually points to far more serious offenses as the prime forces that pull young families apart. It is the drug and alcohol abuse, the criminal behavior and subsequent incarceration, the repeated infidelity…”</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>The authors continue:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Conflicts over money do not usually erupt simply because the man cannot find a job or because he doesn’t earn as much as someone with better skills or more education. Money usually becomes an issue because he seems unwilling to keep at a job for any length of time, usually because of issues related to respect. Some of the jobs he can get don’t pay enough to give him the self-respect he feels he needs, and others require him to get along with unpleasant customers and coworkers, and to maintain a submissive attitude toward the boss.”</em></p></blockquote><p>It used to be high-status to hold a job and take care of your family. Not so much anymore.</p><p>Those who sit at or near the apex of the social ladder (who decide what behaviors are prestigious) have decided that family stability is unimportant.</p><p><span>In a fascinating </span><a href="https://publica.org.au/marriage-beliefs-un/" rel="">article</a><span>, Patrick Parkinson, a law professor at the University of Queensland, recounted his experiences at an international expert group gathered to discuss family policy at the UN headquarters in New York.</span></p><p>At the event, Parkinson stressed the importance of stability and two-parent families for children.</p><p>Many members of the group, comprised of academic elites, took exception.</p><p>But privately, some of them whispered agreement.</p><p>Parkinson writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>“I was surprised then, when one of the members of the Expert Group who was most insistent that two-parent families were just an ideal, said to me quietly, as we were packing up, that she agreed that family stability mattered. She described the strict and ordered regime in her own home (one with two biological, albeit unmarried parents). Her young children had routine, and clear boundaries. She restricted their television usage. It was a reward, not a staple of their entertainment diet. Yes, she agreed, stability does matter to children; but having made that enormous concession to my point of view, she suggested jokingly that I had better leave now. It was not a concession she would make openly, and nor could she have articulated it in the course of the meeting. In her public professional world, marriage is most unfashionable, and stability is not important if that is somehow to be contrasted with adults’ pursuit of their own happiness.”</em></p></blockquote><p>This highly educated and affluent person prioritized stability for her own children. But refused to publicly endorse this value so that less fortunate children could also benefit from family stability.</p><p>If you come from poverty and chaos, you are up against 3 enemies:</p><p>1.

Yet they borrow their notions of commitment from the broader culture, and most middle-class couples who are still in the dating phase, even those who cohabit, believe that as long as they are not married, it is acceptable for either partner to walk away at any time, and for virtually any reason. Of course, middle-class couples who date or cohabit only rarely have children together.”</em></p></blockquote><p>And they go on:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Unmarried parents borrow from the norms most close-at-hand. On the one hand, they adopt expectations of financial responsibility and, as we shall see, sexual fidelity, as couples in marriage do. But on the other, walking away from a nonmarital union is not viewed as a betrayal of a vow, and it is more or less okay to hold oneself open to a better option, should one come along.”</em></p></blockquote><p>The educated class decides cohabiting partnerships are just as valid and important as marriage. And they also believe it’s okay to walk away at a moment’s notice from a cohabiting relationship.</p><p>Poor and working-class people follow suit. To the detriment of themselves and their children.</p><p>They are more likely to have children out of wedlock. And then enter into a string of relationships with various partners. They spend time investing in new relationships, diverting attention away from their children.</p><p><span>Among new parents who are unmarried—usually poor or working-class—</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/how-to-save-marriage-in-america/283732/" rel="">half</a><span> enter a new relationship by the time their children are five years old.</span></p><p>At a time when their children need attentive care, these parents are then engaged in the intense emotional work of building a new romantic relationship. This is an overlooked reason why kids in low-income families are more likely to experience neglect.</p><p><a href="https://robkhenderson.substack.com/p/status-symbols-and-the-struggle-for" rel="">Luxury beliefs</a><span> are ideas and opinions that confer status on the upper class while often inflicting costs on the lower classes.</span></p><p>Edin and Kefalas describe the behavior of young males in low-income neighborhoods:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Chanel, a white thirty-three-year-old with three children, ages fifteen, nine, and three, broke up with her youngest child’s father just after we met her for the first time. When we ask about him later, she says dismissively, ‘He’s not around no more. I got rid of him…He was only here to sleep—didn’t want to pay no bills, didn’t want to do nothing. When he was here all he did was fight and argue and drink. I had to get rid of [him].’ She purses her lips in disgust as she tells us such men are unworthy of the children they father.”</em></p></blockquote><p>More:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Young mothers regularly rail against young fathers who squander too much of their earnings on alcohol, marijuana, new stereo components, computer accessories, expensive footwear, or new clothing, while the needs of the family are, in their view, not adequately met. Amy, a white thirty-year-old mother of three, ages six, five, and three, had a boyfriend who worked steadily but insisted on spending on selfish pursuits. This is what eventually broke the young couple up. ‘He wouldn’t spend money for the kids’ food. I had to send my kids across the street to my mom’s to feed them and stuff. That’s what I got fed up with. I shouldn’t have to live like that…I said it’s time for him to support these kids instead of [me] being on [assistance], and he didn’t like it.’”</em></p></blockquote><p>Absent fathers and broken family units are major factors for many social ills. It’s obvious but no one wants to talk about it.</p><p>I am well aware of the behavior genetics research, twin studies, and so on indicating little effect of home environment on personality, propensity for crime, addiction, and so on. These studies are inapplicable for kids living in extreme dysfunction.</p><p><span>Behavior geneticists investigate the </span><em>relative</em><span> role of genetic and environmental variation </span><em>within the sampled population</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Behavioral genetics studies report findings from </span><em>within the environmental variation in their samples</em><span>,</span><em> </em><span>not in all conceivable environments.</span></p><p>For example, there are many studies on identical twins separated at birth who are adopted by different families.</p><p>Researchers find little difference between these twins when they are adults. Their personalities, IQ, preferences, and so on are very similar.</p><p>But twins are usually adopted by intact middle-class families.</p><p>They are typically taken in by married parents with the means to jump through the hoops to qualify for adoption. Additionally, adoptive parents are the kind of people who would adopt, which introduces another layer of similarity.</p><p>I’ve yet to see any twin studies with one set of identical twins raised in extremely bad environments and another in good ones.</p><p><span>The intelligence researcher Russell T. Warne has </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/in-the-know/C52D8F22C0B337C520F8F6BC4182D492" rel="">written</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“A problem with heritability study samples is that they tend to consist of more middle and upper-class individuals than a representative sample would have…results of behavioral genetics studies will indicate genes are important—if a person already lives in an industrialized nation in a home where basic needs are met...it is not clear how well these results apply to individuals in highly unfavorable environments.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>In a chapter titled </span><em>Genes and the Mind</em><span>, the psychologist David Lykken </span><a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780203763551-11/genes-mind-david-lykken" rel="">states</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“If twins were separated as infants and placed, one with a middle-class Minnesota family and the other with an 18-year-old unmarried mother living on AFDC in the South Bronx, the twins will surely differ 30 years later.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Yes, genes are responsible for human traits and behavior. But these traits are responsive to social norms and other environmental factors too.</p><p>Height is 90 percent heritable. But it is still malleable by the environment. Before Korea was divided, Northerners were taller than Southerners. Today, North Koreans are 6 inches shorter, on average, than South Koreans. Did their genes change?

		<p><a href="https://opencollective.com/jellyfin/updates/were-good-seriously" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This message was posted to our OpenCollective here.</a> However, their page layout leaves a lot to be desired, with the post being very far down the page. So it is reproduced here for posterity.</p><hr>
<p>
We have quite a budget collected over the last 5 years, and while we're really happy to see so many in the Jellyfin community contribute to us, we want to ask you to stop!</p><p>

No, really. We don't actually need your money. At least, not here and now.</p><p>

We have over $24,000 in the bank, and with average monthly expenses of only ~$600, that's over 40 months (3.3 years) of runway! So, we have plenty of money for the near future.</p><p>

Thus, at this time, we want you to seriously consider donating to the authors of Clients you use, instead of (or in addition to) the main project. Client support is the hardest part of the Jellyfin ecosystem to keep going, and most of them are maintained by only a single person or very small team. With the API changes in 10.9.0 and the upcoming 10.10.0 releases, they're going to be very busy trying to keep up, and thus could really use your support in a way that the core project here doesn't right now.</p><p>

So, if there's a client you use every day and that you love, consider <a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-meta/blob/master/jellyfin-team.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding it's author in our list of official clients</a>, and sending them a little something instead (or too).</p><p>

No, this doesn't violate our policy of "no paid development", because donations are just that - donations. We will still not honour bug bounties or similar, and still not use our collective finance here for paid development. So don't feel like you're doing something wrong, you're not!</p><p>

I'll leave this notice up until we drop to ~1 year (12 months) of remaining runway, at which time we can re-evaluate where we're at.</p><p>

Happy watching!

		I see the list of clients provided in this post does not have the people working on the WebOS version. Is it because it is too closely linked to Jellyfin Web? I just want to know so I could directly support those who work on it since I use the WebOS client as my main.

<p>A US court ruled that Booking.com violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by accessing part of Ryanair's website without permission, court documents showed, a ruling the airline said would help end unauthorised screen scraping by booking sites.</p> <p>The airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, has in recent years launched a series of legal actions against third-party booking platforms that resell its tickets without permission.</p> <p>It says the companies, which use screen-scraping software to find and resell tickets, add additional charges and make it difficult for the airline to contact passengers.</p> <p>A jury in the District Court of Delaware unanimously found that Booking.com violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse act and that it had induced a third party to access parts of Ryanair's website without authorisation "with an intent to defraud," the verdict said.</p> <p>The court also rejected counterclaims by Booking.com that Ryanair had defamed the booking platform and that the airline was engaged in unfair competition.</p> <p>In a statement, Booking.com said it was disappointed with the decision, with which its disagrees.</p> <p>"We maintain that allowing customers to access and compare fares across the travel industry promotes consumer choice, and plan to appeal," it added.</p> <p>"We expect that this ruling will end the internet piracy and overcharging perpetrated on both airlines and other travel companies and consumers by the unlawful activity of OTA (online travel agent) Pirates," Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said.</p> <p>He said he hoped the ruling would force consumer agencies across Britain and Europe to take action to outlaw illegal screen scraping and overcharging of consumers for flights and ancillary services.</p> <p>Ryanair has in recent months signed deals with a number of online travel agents for the authorised resale of the airline's tickets.</p>

I was working on bioinformatics a few years ago and was amazed by those single-word bash commands which are much faster than my dull scripts, time saved through learning command-line shortcuts and scripting. Recent years I am working on cloud computing and I keep recording those useful commands here. Not all of them is oneliner, but i put effort on making them brief and swift. I am mainly using Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, RedHat, Linux Mint, Mac and CentOS, sorry if the commands don't work on your system.</p>
<p dir="auto">This blog will focus on simple bash commands for parsing data and Linux system maintenance that i acquired from work and LPIC exam. I apologize that there are no detailed citation for all the commands, but they are probably from dear Google and Stack Overflow.</p>
<p dir="auto">English and bash are not my first language, please correct me anytime, thank you.
If you know other cool commands, please teach me!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><article><header></header><p>Historically, I’ve struggled to find a concise, simple way to explain what it means to practice type-driven design. Too often, when someone asks me “How did you come up with this approach?” I find I can’t give them a satisfying answer. I know it didn’t just come to me in a vision—I have an iterative design process that doesn’t require plucking the “right” approach out of thin air—yet I haven’t been very successful in communicating that process to others.</p><p>However, about a month ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/lexi_lambda/status/1182242561655746560">I was reflecting on Twitter</a> about the differences I experienced parsing JSON in statically- and dynamically-typed languages, and finally, I realized what I was looking for. Now I have a single, snappy slogan that encapsulates what type-driven design means to me, and better yet, it’s only three words long:</p><p><strong>Parse, don’t validate.</strong></p><h2><a name="the-essence-of-type-driven-design"></a>The essence of type-driven design</h2><p>Alright, I’ll confess: unless you already know what type-driven design is, my catchy slogan probably doesn’t mean all that much to you. Fortunately, that’s what the remainder of this blog post is for. I’m going to explain precisely what I mean in gory detail—but first, we need to practice a little wishful thinking.</p><h3><a name="the-realm-of-possibility"></a>The realm of possibility</h3><p>One of the wonderful things about static type systems is that they can make it possible, and sometimes even easy, to answer questions like “is it possible to write this function?” For an extreme example, consider the following Haskell type signature:</p><pre><code><span>foo</span> <span>::</span> <span>Integer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Void</span></code></pre><p>Is it possible to implement <code>foo</code>? Trivially, the answer is <em>no</em>, as <code>Void</code> is a type that contains no values, so it’s impossible for <em>any</em> function to produce a value of type <code>Void</code>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1-1">1</a></sup> That example is pretty boring, but the question gets much more interesting if we choose a more realistic example:</p><pre><code><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span></code></pre><p>This function returns the first element from a list. Is it possible to implement? It certainly doesn’t sound like it does anything very complicated, but if we attempt to implement it, the compiler won’t be satisfied:</p><pre><code><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span></code></pre><pre><code>warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns]
    Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
    In an equation for ‘head’: Patterns not matched: []
</code></pre><p>This message is helpfully pointing out that our function is <em>partial</em>, which is to say it is not defined for all possible inputs. Specifically, it is not defined when the input is <code>[]</code>, the empty list. This makes sense, as it isn’t possible to return the first element of a list if the list is empty—there’s no element to return! So, remarkably, we learn this function isn’t possible to implement, either.</p><h3><a name="turning-partial-functions-total"></a>Turning partial functions total</h3><p>To someone coming from a dynamically-typed background, this might seem perplexing. If we have a list, we might very well want to get the first element in it. And indeed, the operation of “getting the first element of a list” isn’t impossible in Haskell, it just requires a little extra ceremony. There are two different ways to fix the <code>head</code> function, and we’ll start with the simplest one.</p><h4><a name="managing-expectations"></a>Managing expectations</h4><p>As established, <code>head</code> is partial because there is no element to return if the list is empty: we’ve made a promise we cannot possibly fulfill. Fortunately, there’s an easy solution to that dilemma: we can weaken our promise. Since we cannot guarantee the caller an element of the list, we’ll have to practice a little expectation management: we’ll do our best return an element if we can, but we reserve the right to return nothing at all. In Haskell, we express this possibility using the <code>Maybe</code> type:</p><pre><code><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span></code></pre><p>This buys us the freedom we need to implement <code>head</code>—it allows us to return <code>Nothing</code> when we discover we can’t produce a value of type <code>a</code> after all:</p><pre><code><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>x</span>
<span>head</span> <span>[]</span>    <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span></code></pre><p>Problem solved, right? For the moment, yes… but this solution has a hidden cost.</p><p>Returning <code>Maybe</code> is undoubtably convenient when we’re <em>implementing</em>  <code>head</code>. However, it becomes significantly less convenient when we want to actually use it! Since <code>head</code> always has the potential to return <code>Nothing</code>, the burden falls upon its callers to handle that possibility, and sometimes that passing of the buck can be incredibly frustrating. To see why, consider the following code:</p><pre><code><span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>[</span><span>FilePath</span><span>]</span>
<span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirsString</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getEnv</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS"</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>configDirsList</span> <span>=</span> <span>split</span> <span>','</span> <span>configDirsString</span>
  <span>when</span> <span>(</span><span>null</span> <span>configDirsList</span><span>)</span> <span>$</span>
    <span>throwIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>userError</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS cannot be empty"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>configDirsList</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirs</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getConfigurationDirectories</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>head</span> <span>configDirs</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Just</span> <span>cacheDir</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>initializeCache</span> <span>cacheDir</span>
    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>error</span> <span>"should never happen; already checked configDirs is non-empty"</span></code></pre><p>When <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> retrieves a list of file paths from the environment, it proactively checks that the list is non-empty. However, when we use <code>head</code> in <code>main</code> to get the first element of the list, the <code>Maybe FilePath</code> result still requires us to handle a <code>Nothing</code> case that we know will never happen! This is terribly bad for several reasons:</p><ol><li><p>First, it’s just annoying. We already checked that the list is non-empty, why do we have to clutter our code with another redundant check?</p></li><li><p>Second, it has a potential performance cost. Although the cost of the redundant check is trivial in this particular example, one could imagine a more complex scenario where the redundant checks could add up, such as if they were happening in a tight loop.</p></li><li><p>Finally, and worst of all, this code is a bug waiting to happen! What if <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> were modified to stop checking that the list is empty, intentionally or unintentionally? The programmer might not remember to update <code>main</code>, and suddenly the “impossible” error becomes not only possible, but probable.</p></li></ol><p>The need for this redundant check has essentially forced us to punch a hole in our type system. If we could statically <em>prove</em> the <code>Nothing</code> case impossible, then a modification to <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> that stopped checking if the list was empty would invalidate the proof and trigger a compile-time failure. However, as-written, we’re forced to rely on a test suite or manual inspection to catch the bug.</p><h4><a name="paying-it-forward"></a>Paying it forward</h4><p>Clearly, our modified version of <code>head</code> leaves some things to be desired. Somehow, we’d like it to be smarter: if we already checked that the list was non-empty, <code>head</code> should unconditionally return the first element without forcing us to handle the case we know is impossible. How can we do that?</p><p>Let’s look at the original (partial) type signature for <code>head</code> again:</p><pre><code><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span></code></pre><p>The previous section illustrated that we can turn that partial type signature into a total one by weakening the promise made in the return type. However, since we don’t want to do that, there’s only one thing left that can be changed: the argument type (in this case, <code>[a]</code>). Instead of weakening the return type, we can <em>strengthen</em> the argument type, eliminating the possibility of <code>head</code> ever being called on an empty list in the first place.</p><p>To do this, we need a type that represents non-empty lists. Fortunately, the existing <code>NonEmpty</code> type from <code>Data.List.NonEmpty</code> is exactly that. It has the following definition:</p><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>:|</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>Note that <code>NonEmpty a</code> is really just a tuple of an <code>a</code> and an ordinary, possibly-empty <code>[a]</code>. This conveniently models a non-empty list by storing the first element of the list separately from the list’s tail: even if the <code>[a]</code> component is <code>[]</code>, the <code>a</code> component must always be present. This makes <code>head</code> completely trivial to implement:<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2-1">2</a></sup></p><pre><code><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:|</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span></code></pre><p>Unlike before, GHC accepts this definition without complaint—this definition is <em>total</em>, not partial. We can update our program to use the new implementation:</p><pre><code><span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>FilePath</span><span>)</span>
<span>getConfigurationDirectories</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirsString</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getEnv</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS"</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>configDirsList</span> <span>=</span> <span>split</span> <span>','</span> <span>configDirsString</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>nonEmpty</span> <span>configDirsList</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Just</span> <span>nonEmptyConfigDirsList</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>pure</span> <span>nonEmptyConfigDirsList</span>
    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>throwIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>userError</span> <span>"CONFIG_DIRS cannot be empty"</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>configDirs</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getConfigurationDirectories</span>
  <span>initializeCache</span> <span>(</span><span>head</span> <span>configDirs</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Note that the redundant check in <code>main</code> is now completely gone! Instead, we perform the check exactly once, in <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code>. It constructs a <code>NonEmpty a</code> from a <code>[a]</code> using the <code>nonEmpty</code> function from <code>Data.List.NonEmpty</code>, which has the following type:</p><pre><code><span>nonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>The <code>Maybe</code> is still there, but this time, we handle the <code>Nothing</code> case very early in our program: right in the same place we were already doing the input validation. Once that check has passed, we now have a <code>NonEmpty FilePath</code> value, which preserves (in the type system!) the knowledge that the list really is non-empty. Put another way, you can think of a value of type <code>NonEmpty a</code> as being like a value of type <code>[a]</code>, plus a <em>proof</em> that the list is non-empty.</p><p>By strengthening the type of the argument to <code>head</code> instead of weakening the type of its result, we’ve completely eliminated all the problems from the previous section:</p><ul><li><p>The code has no redundant checks, so there can’t be any performance overhead.</p></li><li><p>Furthermore, if <code>getConfigurationDirectories</code> changes to stop checking that the list is non-empty, its return type must change, too. Consequently, <code>main</code> will fail to typecheck, alerting us to the problem before we even run the program!</p></li></ul><p>What’s more, it’s trivial to recover the old behavior of <code>head</code> from the new one by composing <code>head</code> with <code>nonEmpty</code>:</p><pre><code><span>head'</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head'</span> <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>head</span> <span>.</span> <span>nonEmpty</span></code></pre><p>Note that the inverse is <em>not</em> true: there is no way to obtain the new version of <code>head</code> from the old one. All in all, the second approach is superior on all axes.</p><h3><a name="the-power-of-parsing"></a>The power of parsing</h3><p>You may be wondering what the above example has to do with the title of this blog post. After all, we only examined two different ways to validate that a list was non-empty—no parsing in sight. That interpretation isn’t wrong, but I’d like to propose another perspective: in my mind, the difference between validation and parsing lies almost entirely in how information is preserved. Consider the following pair of functions:</p><pre><code><span>validateNonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>validateNonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>:</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>pure</span> <span>()</span>
<span>validateNonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>throwIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>userError</span> <span>"list cannot be empty"</span>

<span>parseNonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>parseNonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>pure</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:|</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span>
<span>parseNonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>throwIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>userError</span> <span>"list cannot be empty"</span></code></pre><p>These two functions are nearly identical: they check if the provided list is empty, and if it is, they abort the program with an error message. The difference lies entirely in the return type: <code>validateNonEmpty</code> always returns <code>()</code>, the type that contains no information, but <code>parseNonEmpty</code> returns <code>NonEmpty a</code>, a refinement of the input type that preserves the knowledge gained in the type system. Both of these functions check the same thing, but <code>parseNonEmpty</code> gives the caller access to the information it learned, while <code>validateNonEmpty</code> just throws it away.</p><p>These two functions elegantly illustrate two different perspectives on the role of a static type system: <code>validateNonEmpty</code> obeys the typechecker well enough, but only <code>parseNonEmpty</code> takes full advantage of it. If you see why <code>parseNonEmpty</code> is preferable, you understand what I mean by the mantra “parse, don’t validate.” Still, perhaps you are skeptical of <code>parseNonEmpty</code>’s name. Is it really <em>parsing</em> anything, or is it merely validating its input and returning a result? While the precise definition of what it means to parse or validate something is debatable, I believe <code>parseNonEmpty</code> is a bona-fide parser (albeit a particularly simple one).</p><p>Consider: what is a parser? Really, a parser is just a function that consumes less-structured input and produces more-structured output. By its very nature, a parser is a partial function—some values in the domain do not correspond to any value in the range—so all parsers must have some notion of failure. Often, the input to a parser is text, but this is by no means a requirement, and <code>parseNonEmpty</code> is a perfectly cromulent parser: it parses lists into non-empty lists, signaling failure by terminating the program with an error message.</p><p>Under this flexible definition, parsers are an incredibly powerful tool: they allow discharging checks on input up-front, right on the boundary between a program and the outside world, and once those checks have been performed, they never need to be checked again! Haskellers are well-aware of this power, and they use many different types of parsers on a regular basis:</p><ul><li><p>The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson">aeson</a> library provides a <code>Parser</code> type that can be used to parse JSON data into domain types.</p></li><li><p>Likewise, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a> provides a set of parser combinators for parsing command-line arguments.</p></li><li><p>Database libraries like <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent">persistent</a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple">postgresql-simple</a> have a mechanism for parsing values held in an external data store.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant">servant</a> ecosystem is built around parsing Haskell datatypes from path components, query parameters, HTTP headers, and more.</p></li></ul><p>The common theme between all these libraries is that they sit on the boundary between your Haskell application and the external world. That world doesn’t speak in product and sum types, but in streams of bytes, so there’s no getting around a need to do some parsing. Doing that parsing up front, before acting on the data, can go a long way toward avoiding many classes of bugs, some of which might even be security vulnerabilities.</p><p>One drawback to this approach of parsing everything up front is that it sometimes requires values be parsed long before they are actually used. In a dynamically-typed language, this can make keeping the parsing and processing logic in sync a little tricky without extensive test coverage, much of which can be laborious to maintain. However, with a static type system, the problem becomes marvelously simple, as demonstrated by the <code>NonEmpty</code> example above: if the parsing and processing logic go out of sync, the program will fail to even compile.</p><h3><a name="the-danger-of-validation"></a>The danger of validation</h3><p>Hopefully, by this point, you are at least somewhat sold on the idea that parsing is preferable to validation, but you may have lingering doubts. Is validation really so bad if the type system is going to force you to do the necessary checks eventually anyway? Maybe the error reporting will be a little bit worse, but a bit of redundant checking can’t hurt, right?</p><p>Unfortunately, it isn’t so simple. Ad-hoc validation leads to a phenomenon that the <a href="http://langsec.org/">language-theoretic security</a> field calls <em>shotgun parsing</em>. In the 2016 paper, <a href="http://langsec.org/papers/langsec-cwes-secdev2016.pdf">The Seven Turrets of Babel: A Taxonomy of LangSec Errors and How to Expunge Them</a>, its authors provide the following definition:</p><blockquote><p>Shotgun parsing is a programming antipattern whereby parsing and input-validating code is mixed with and spread across processing code—throwing a cloud of checks at the input, and hoping, without any systematic justification, that one or another would catch all the “bad” cases.</p></blockquote><p>They go on to explain the problems inherent to such validation techniques:</p><blockquote><p>Shotgun parsing necessarily deprives the program of the ability to reject invalid input instead of processing it. Late-discovered errors in an input stream will result in some portion of invalid input having been processed, with the consequence that program state is difficult to accurately predict.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, a program that does not parse all of its input up front runs the risk of acting upon a valid portion of the input, discovering a different portion is invalid, and suddenly needing to roll back whatever modifications it already executed in order to maintain consistency. Sometimes this is possible—such as rolling back a transaction in an RDBMS—but in general it may not be.</p><p>It may not be immediately apparent what shotgun parsing has to do with validation—after all, if you do all your validation up front, you mitigate the risk of shotgun parsing. The problem is that validation-based approaches make it extremely difficult or impossible to determine if everything was actually validated up front or if some of those so-called “impossible” cases might actually happen. The entire program must assume that raising an exception anywhere is not only possible, it’s regularly necessary.</p><p>Parsing avoids this problem by stratifying the program into two phases—parsing and execution—where failure due to invalid input can only happen in the first phase. The set of remaining failure modes during execution is minimal by comparison, and they can be handled with the tender care they require.</p><h2><a name="parsing-not-validating-in-practice"></a>Parsing, not validating, in practice</h2><p>So far, this blog post has been something of a sales pitch. “You, dear reader, ought to be parsing!” it says, and if I’ve done my job properly, at least some of you are sold. However, even if you understand the “what” and the “why,” you might not feel especially confident about the “how.”</p><p>My advice: focus on the datatypes.</p><p>Suppose you are writing a function that accepts a list of tuples representing key-value pairs, and you suddenly realize you aren’t sure what to do if the list has duplicate keys. One solution would be to write a function that asserts there aren’t any duplicates in the list:</p><pre><code><span>checkNoDuplicateKeys</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>MonadError</span> <span>AppError</span> <span>m</span><span>,</span> <span>Eq</span> <span>k</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[(</span><span>k</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>)]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>m</span> <span>()</span></code></pre><p>However, this check is fragile: it’s extremely easy to forget. Because its return value is unused, it can always be omitted, and the code that needs it would still typecheck. A better solution is to choose a data structure that disallows duplicate keys by construction, such as a <code>Map</code>. Adjust your function’s type signature to accept a <code>Map</code> instead of a list of tuples, and implement it as you normally would.</p><p>Once you’ve done that, the call site of your new function will likely fail to typecheck, since it is still being passed a list of tuples. If the caller was given the value via one of its arguments, or if it received it from the result of some other function, you can continue updating the type from list to <code>Map</code>, all the way up the call chain. Eventually, you will either reach the location the value is created, or you’ll find a place where duplicates actually ought to be allowed. At that point, you can insert a call to a modified version of <code>checkNoDuplicateKeys</code>:</p><pre><code><span>checkNoDuplicateKeys</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>MonadError</span> <span>AppError</span> <span>m</span><span>,</span> <span>Eq</span> <span>k</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[(</span><span>k</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>)]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>m</span> <span>(</span><span>Map</span> <span>k</span> <span>v</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Now the check <em>cannot</em> be omitted, since its result is actually necessary for the program to proceed!</p><p>This hypothetical scenario highlights two simple ideas:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Use a data structure that makes illegal states unrepresentable.</strong> Model your data using the most precise data structure you reasonably can. If ruling out a particular possibility is too hard using the encoding you are currently using, consider alternate encodings that can express the property you care about more easily. Don’t be afraid to refactor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Push the burden of proof upward as far as possible, but no further.</strong> Get your data into the most precise representation you need as quickly as you can. Ideally, this should happen at the boundary of your system, before <em>any</em> of the data is acted upon.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3-1">3</a></sup></p><p>If one particular code branch eventually requires a more precise representation of a piece of data, parse the data into the more precise representation as soon as the branch is selected. Use sum types judiciously to allow your datatypes to reflect and adapt to control flow.</p></li></ol><p>In other words, write functions on the data representation you <em>wish</em> you had, not the data representation you are given. The design process then becomes an exercise in bridging the gap, often by working from both ends until they meet somewhere in the middle. Don’t be afraid to iteratively adjust parts of the design as you go, since you may learn something new during the refactoring process!</p><p>Here are a handful of additional points of advice, arranged in no particular order:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Let your datatypes inform your code, don’t let your code control your datatypes.</strong> Avoid the temptation to just stick a <code>Bool</code> in a record somewhere because it’s needed by the function you’re currently writing. Don’t be afraid to refactor code to use the right data representation—the type system will ensure you’ve covered all the places that need changing, and it will likely save you a headache later.</p></li><li><p><strong>Treat functions that return <code>m ()</code> with deep suspicion.</strong> Sometimes these are genuinely necessary, as they may perform an imperative effect with no meaningful result, but if the primary purpose of that effect is raising an error, it’s likely there’s a better way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t be afraid to parse data in multiple passes.</strong> Avoiding shotgun parsing just means you shouldn’t act on the input data before it’s fully parsed, not that you can’t use some of the input data to decide how to parse other input data. Plenty of useful parsers are context-sensitive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid denormalized representations of data, <em>especially</em> if it’s mutable.</strong> Duplicating the same data in multiple places introduces a trivially representable illegal state: the places getting out of sync. Strive for a single source of truth.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Keep denormalized representations of data behind abstraction boundaries.</strong> If denormalization is absolutely necessary, use encapsulation to ensure a small, trusted module holds sole responsibility for keeping the representations in sync.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Use abstract datatypes to make validators “look like” parsers.</strong> Sometimes, making an illegal state truly unrepresentable is just plain impractical given the tools Haskell provides, such as ensuring an integer is in a particular range. In that case, use an abstract <code>newtype</code> with a smart constructor to “fake” a parser from a validator.</p></li></ul><p>As always, use your best judgement. It probably isn’t worth breaking out <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons">singletons</a> and refactoring your entire application just to get rid of a single <code>error "impossible"</code> call somewhere—just make sure to treat those situations like the radioactive substance they are, and handle them with the appropriate care. If all else fails, at least leave a comment to document the invariant for whoever needs to modify the code next.</p><h2><a name="recap-reflection-and-related-reading"></a>Recap, reflection, and related reading</h2><p>That’s all, really. Hopefully this blog post proves that taking advantage of the Haskell type system doesn’t require a PhD, and it doesn’t even require using the latest and greatest of GHC’s shiny new language extensions—though they can certainly sometimes help! Sometimes the biggest obstacle to using Haskell to its fullest is simply being aware what options are available, and unfortunately, one downside of Haskell’s small community is a relative dearth of resources that document design patterns and techniques that have become tribal knowledge.</p><p>None of the ideas in this blog post are new. In fact, the core idea—“write total functions”—is conceptually quite simple. Despite that, I find it remarkably challenging to communicate actionable, practicable details about the way I write Haskell code. It’s easy to spend lots of time talking about abstract concepts—many of which are quite valuable!—without communicating anything useful about <em>process</em>. My hope is that this is a small step in that direction.</p><p>Sadly, I don’t know very many other resources on this particular topic, but I do know of one: I never hesitate to recommend Matt Parson’s fantastic blog post <a href="https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2017/10/11/type_safety_back_and_forth.html">Type Safety Back and Forth</a>. If you want another accessible perspective on these ideas, including another worked example, I’d highly encourage giving it a read. For a significantly more advanced take on many of these ideas, I can also recommend Matt Noonan’s 2018 paper <a href="https://kataskeue.com/gdp.pdf">Ghosts of Departed Proofs</a>, which outlines a handful of techniques for capturing more complex invariants in the type system than I have described here.</p><p>As a closing note, I want to say that doing the kind of refactoring described in this blog post is not always easy. The examples I’ve given are simple, but real life is often much less straightforward. Even for those experienced in type-driven design, it can be genuinely difficult to capture certain invariants in the type system, so do not consider it a personal failing if you cannot solve something the way you’d like! Consider the principles in this blog post ideals to strive for, not strict requirements to meet. All that matters is to try.</p><ol><li id="footnote-1"><p>Technically, in Haskell, this ignores “bottoms,” constructions that can inhabit <em>any</em> value. These aren’t “real” values (unlike <code>null</code> in some other languages)—they’re things like infinite loops or computations that raise exceptions—and in idiomatic Haskell, we usually try to avoid them, so reasoning that pretends they don’t exist still has value. But don’t take my word for it—I’ll let Danielsson et al. convince you that <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/fast+loose.pdf">Fast and Loose Reasoning is Morally Correct</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-1-1">↩</a></p></li><li id="footnote-2"><p>In fact, <code>Data.List.NonEmpty</code> already provides a <code>head</code> function with this type, but just for the sake of illustration, we’ll reimplement it ourselves. <a href="#footnote-ref-2-1">↩</a></p></li><li id="footnote-3"><p>Sometimes it is necessary to perform some kind of authorization before parsing user input to avoid denial of service attacks, but that’s okay: authorization should have a relatively small surface area, and it shouldn’t cause any significant modifications to the state of your system. <a href="#footnote-ref-3-1">↩</a></p></li></ol></article></div></div>]]></description>

The sleep restriction protocol consists of an adaptation day, two baseline days (BL), five sleep restriction days (CSR), and a recovery day (REC). The clock times of this protocol could be shifted according to the participant’s habitual bedtime, while the presented schedule is based on an 8&nbsp;am–12&nbsp;am wake-sleep schedule. On the nights of adaptation and the first BL days, participants had a full 8&nbsp;h sleep (in blue shade). Starting from the second BL day throughout the first four CSR days, the bedtime was delayed by 3&nbsp;h (i.e. 5-h time in bed). During the waking time (in while shade), participants were in constant luminance (~ 100&nbsp;lx) during wakefulness. The coffee mug icons indicated the time when 19 participants received caffeine-containing coffee (CAFF group) and 17 received decaffeinated coffee (DECAF group). To monitor the caffeine levels, saliva samples were collected throughout the BL, CSR, and REC days (indicated by water drop icons). Three MRI scans took place in the afternoon of the second BL Day, the 5th CSR Day (average 7.0 ± 0.8&nbsp;h after the last caffeine intake), and the REC Day (average 29.8 ± 4.3&nbsp;h after the last caffeine intake), while for [<sup>18</sup>F]-CPFPX PET, we focused only on the baseline level measured on the second BL day.</p></div><p><a data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-61421-8/figures/1" data-track-dest="link:Figure1 Full size image" aria-label="Full size image figure 1" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span></a></p></figure></div><p>All participants followed a one-week sleep satiation protocol (9&nbsp;h in bed between 22:00 and 07:00 or between 23:00 and 08:00) prior to the start of the study.

Among the 36 subjects, one T1-weighted and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) images from the BL scan of a CAFF group subject were lost due to a technical reason on the scan day. In addition, during a CSR scan of another CAFF group subject as well as the REC scan of a DECAF group subject, the ASL images failed to be acquired.</p><p>In a series of stepwise analyses, we first identified the cortical changes in response to the main effect of CSR and the interaction between Caffeine and CSR. We conducted whole-brain multimodal voxel-wise morphometry (VBM) with linear mixed models, which allowed regressing out the variance of CBF voxel-to-voxel with ASL images. Next, we conducted a whole-brain exploratory&nbsp;analysis on ASL images to determine the main effect of CSR and the interaction effect between Caffeine and CSR on CBF. Lastly, we extracted the mean intensity of GM and mean CBF of the identified regions, as well as the binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) of A<sub>1</sub>R in cortical and subcortical regions from all time points (i.e. baseline, CSR Day, and REC Day), respectively.

For the preprocessing of T1-weighted images, we used the “Segment Longitudinal Data” pipeline provided by CAT12 toolbox on SPM12 (University College London, London, UK), which enabled a co-registration with the mean of the three volumes collected from the three timepoints (i.e. BL, CSR, and REC) of each participant and was suitable for repeated measurements. Affine registration was conducted using the tissue probability map in SPM12, followed by the segmentation of brain tissues into grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, as well as total intracranial volume. The procedure continues with the Jacobian-modulated normalization using an MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University)-defined standard brain.

In addition to CBF, we used age, sex, and total intracranial volume as regressors of no interests in the model. The statistical significance of the coefficients was acquired with permutation tests (5000 times) and defined by a threshold at cluster-level p<sub>FDR</sub> &lt; 0.001). To validate the novel toolbox VoxelStats and its voxel-to-voxel approach in tackling the bias of perfusion on morphometry, we compared the outcomes between controlling for voxel-wise CBF variances with VoxelStats and for global CBF variances with FMRIB Software Library (FSL 5.0; Oxford Center for Functional MRI of the Brain, United Kingdom) in the VBM analyses on T1-weighted images. Corresponding to the setup in Voxelstats, we used the “<i>randomise</i>” function (number of permutations = 5000) in FSL, and we used age, sex, and total intracranial volume as regressors as covariates. We present the statistical maps from VoxelStats and FSL in Supplementary method, Fig <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-61421-8#MOESM1">S1</a>. In summary, the influence of CBF variances on the voxel and global level of the T1-weighted VBM analysis were strongly comparable. We believed that either (1) there was no significant contribution of CBF variances to the condition-driven GM changes (i.e. under caffeine or CSR) in general, or that (2) the within-subject comparison provided a good sensitivity to the condition-driven CBF variances and therefore well preserved the global variance to be reliably characterized on the voxel level. In any case, based on this precondition, we eventually decided to go for a voxel-wise approach as it could further take potential contributions of the regional CBF variances to the GM measurement into account, if any.</p><p>For the regions identified to be responsive to the interaction between caffeine and CSR, we further conducted a post-hoc analysis to determine the exact GM changes in each group in response to CSR using region-of-interest-based approach on R (R core team, Vienna, Austria). We first created masks of the responsive regions identified in the whole-brain analyses. Accordingly, we extracted mean signal intensity of these regions from all time points (BL, CSR, and REC) using FSL <i>fslmeants</i>, followed by a post-hoc analysis to determine the directions of GM responses in each group.</p><h4 id="Sec8">Cerebral blood flow</h4><p>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by the sequence ASL (5 × 5 × 5&nbsp;mm<sup>3</sup>, TR = 3500&nbsp;ms, TE = 11&nbsp;ms). For the preprocessing of ASL images, we used the standard pipeline on FSL. We used the first volume for the reference of motion correction as well as for the M0 calibration. We calculated the relative CBF maps with the acquired 40 tag-control pairs, followed by the quantification of absolute CBF using white matter as the reference tissue. Lastly, the absolute CBF maps were co-registered onto the T1-weighted images and MNI space.</p><p>Next, we conducted the whole-brain analysis on the absolute CBF maps with a GM mask using 2-way mixed effect ANOVA. Similar to the analysis on T1-weighted images, we also used nonparametric threshold-free cluster enhancement (number of permutations = 5000, cluster-level threshold p<sub>FDR</sub> &lt; 0.01) with the “<i>randomise</i>” function.

First, although we preselected participants based on the <i>ADORA2A</i> polymorphism, the lack of A<sub>2A</sub>R availability data as derived from PET precludes a broader understanding of the receptor’s role in sleep loss induced GM changes. This limitation warrants more adenosine and A<sub>2A</sub>R-focusing studies on the effects of CSR and daily caffeine intake to be conducted. Second, it might be argued that the estimation of GM by MRI T1-weighted image can be potentially impacted by caffeine-induced changes in perfusion<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Ge, Q. et al. Short-term apparent brain tissue changes are contributed by cerebral blood flow alterations.

However, our study included both structural imaging and CBF measurement, and we did not observe associations between the two, including the pattern of changes across regions. An earlier study further suggests that the covariance between T1-weighted measurement and CBF rather occurs on a global instead of regional level<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="Lin, Y.-S. et al. Daily caffeine intake induces concentration-dependent medial temporal plasticity in humans: A multimodal double-blind randomized controlled trial. Cereb. Cortex 31(6), 3096–3106 (2021)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-61421-8#ref-CR9" id="ref-link-section-d693675374e3116">9</a></sup>. Lastly, the caffeine and decaffeinated treatments in the current study were delivered as identically brewed coffee only different in the caffeine content, which indeed guaranteed the precision of caffeine administration. However, with other ingredients contained in brewed coffee, the observed outcomes could not be fully attributed to the effects of caffeine alone, but it could also be an effect from the interaction between caffeine and other biochemicals. Nevertheless, using brewed coffee is preferred given that it provides a better generalizability to a real-life coffee intake.</p><p>In summary, this study revealed reversible cortical plasticity in frontal, temporal-occipital, and thalamic GM in response to CSR. This plastic response, however, can be suppressed or reversed by concomitant caffeine intake. The individual baseline subcortical A<sub>1</sub>R availability may play a role in the caffeine-associated GM response. More studies are warranted to further investigate the role of A<sub>2A</sub>R in these GM changes.</p></div></div>

<p dir="auto"><strong>eza</strong> is a modern, maintained replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program <code>ls</code> that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And it’s <strong>small</strong>, <strong>fast</strong>, and just <strong>one single binary</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">By deliberately making some decisions differently, eza attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of <code>ls</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>eza</strong> features not in exa (non-exhaustive):</p>

<p dir="auto">Jiff is a datetime library for Rust that encourages you to jump into the
pit of success. The focus of this library is providing high level datetime
primitives that are difficult to misuse and have reasonable performance. Jiff
supports automatic and seamless integration with the Time Zone Database, DST
aware arithmetic and rounding, formatting and parsing zone aware datetimes
losslessly, opt-in Serde support and a whole lot more.</p>
<p dir="auto">Jiff takes enormous inspiration from <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/index.html" rel="nofollow">Temporal</a>, which is a <a href="https://tc39.es/" rel="nofollow">TC39</a> proposal to
improve datetime handling in JavaScript.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are many more examples in the <a href="https://docs.rs/jiff" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h3><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Jiff is <a href="https://crates.io/crates/jiff" rel="nofollow">on crates.io</a> and can be
used by adding <code>jiff</code> to your dependencies in your project's <code>Cargo.toml</code>.
Or more simply, just run <code>cargo add jiff</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is a complete example that creates a new Rust project, adds a dependency
on <code>jiff</code>, creates the source code for a simple datetime program and then runs
it.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, create the project in a new directory:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mkdir jiff-example
$ cd jiff-example
$ cargo init"><pre lang="text"><code>$ mkdir jiff-example
$ cd jiff-example
$ cargo init
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Second, add a dependency on <code>jiff</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">Third, edit <code>src/main.rs</code>. Delete what's there and replace it with this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="use jiff::{Unit, Zoned};

fn main() -> Result<(), jiff::Error> {
    let now = Zoned::now().round(Unit::Second)?;
    println!(&quot;{now}&quot;);
    Ok(())
}"><pre><span>use</span> jiff<span>::</span><span>{</span><span>Unit</span><span>,</span> <span>Zoned</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> jiff<span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> now = <span>Zoned</span><span>::</span><span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>round</span><span>(</span><span>Unit</span><span>::</span><span>Second</span><span>)</span>?<span>;</span>
    <span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{now}"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Fourth, run it with <code>cargo run</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cargo run
   Compiling jiff v0.1.0 (/home/andrew/rust/jiff)
   Compiling jiff-play v0.1.0 (/home/andrew/tmp/scratch/rust/jiff-play)

     Running `target/debug/jiff-play`
2024-07-10T19:54:20-04:00[America/New_York]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The first time you run the program will show more output like above. But
subsequent runs shouldn't have to re-compile the dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Crate features</h3><a id="user-content-crate-features" aria-label="Permalink: Crate features" href="#crate-features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Jiff has several crate features for customizing support for Rust's standard
library, <code>serde</code> support and whether to embed a copy of the Time Zone Database
into your binary.</p>
<p dir="auto">The "<a href="https://docs.rs/jiff/#crate-features" rel="nofollow">crate features</a>" section of the
documentation lists the full set of supported features.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Future plans</h3><a id="user-content-future-plans" aria-label="Permalink: Future plans" href="#future-plans"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">My plan is to iterate on the Jiff API and make occasional breaking change
releases over the next ~year. Assuming API breaking changes have settled down
after about one year's time, my plan will be to release Jiff 1.0 and commit to
the API for a long period of time. (Measured, at least, in years.)</p>
<p dir="auto">The purpose of this plan is to get Jiff to a 1.0 stable state as quickly as
possible. The reason is so that others feel comfortable relying on Jiff as
a public dependency that won't cause ecosystem churn.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h3><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The most important design goal of Jiff is to be a high level datetime library
that makes it hard to do the wrong thing. Second to that is performance. Jiff
should have reasonable performance, but there are likely areas in which it
could improve. See the <code>bench</code> directory for benchmarks.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Platform support</h3><a id="user-content-platform-support" aria-label="Permalink: Platform support" href="#platform-support"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The question of platform support in the context of datetime libraries comes up
primarily in relation to time zone support. Specifically:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>How should Jiff determine the time zone transitions for an IANA time zone
identifier like <code>Antarctica/Troll</code>?</li>
<li>How should Jiff determine the default time zone for the current system?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Both of these require some level of platform interaction.</p>
<p dir="auto">For discovering time zone transition data, Jiff relies on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database" rel="nofollow">IANA Time Zone Database</a>. On Unix systems, this is usually found at
<code>/usr/share/zoneinfo</code>, although it can be configured via the <code>TZDIR</code>
environment variable (which Jiff respects). On Windows, Jiff will automatically
embed a copy of the time zone database into the compiled library.</p>
<p dir="auto">For discovering the system time zone, Jiff reads <code>/etc/localtime</code> on Unix. On
Windows, Jiff reads the Windows-specific time zone identifier via
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/timezoneapi/nf-timezoneapi-getdynamictimezoneinformation" rel="nofollow"><code>GetDynamicTimeZoneInformation</code></a> and then maps it to an IANA time zone
identifier via Unicode's <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/raw/main/common/supplemental/windowsZones.xml">CLDR XML data</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">I expect Jiff to grow more support for other platforms over time. Please file
issues, although I will likely be reliant on contributor pull requests for more
obscure platforms that aren't easy for me to test.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h3><a id="user-content-dependencies" aria-label="Permalink: Dependencies" href="#dependencies"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">At time of writing, it is no accident that Jiff has zero dependencies on Unix.
In general, my philosophy on adding new dependencies in an ecosystem crate like
Jiff is very conservative. I consider there to be two primary use cases for
adding new dependencies:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>When a dependency is <em>practically</em> required in order to interact with a
platform. For example, <code>windows-sys</code> for discovering the system time zone on
Windows.</li>
<li>When a dependency is necessary for inter-operability. For example, <code>serde</code>.
But even here, I expect to be conservative, where I'm generally only willing
to depend on things that have fewer breaking change releases than Jiff.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">A secondary use case for new dependencies is if Jiff gets split into multiple
crates. I did a similar thing for the <code>regex</code> crate for very compelling
reasons. It is possible that will happen with Jiff as well, although there are
no plans for that. And in general, I expect the number of crates to stay small,
if only to make keep maintenance lightweight. (Managing lots of semver API
boundaries has a lot of overhead in my experience.)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Minimum Rust version policy</h3><a id="user-content-minimum-rust-version-policy" aria-label="Permalink: Minimum Rust version policy" href="#minimum-rust-version-policy"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This crate's minimum supported <code>rustc</code> version is <code>1.70.0</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The policy is that the minimum Rust version required to use this crate can be
increased in minor version updates. For example, if jiff 1.0 requires Rust
1.20.0, then jiff 1.0.z for all values of <code>z</code> will also require Rust 1.20.0 or
newer. However, jiff 1.y for <code>y &gt; 0</code> may require a newer minimum version of
Rust.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="ltr" external_links="" id="main-content">

<p>The process of becoming an ICANN-accredited registrar includes several steps. The following summary of these steps is intended to guide you through this process.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Review the Qualification Criteria described in the <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/accreditation/policy-statement#IIA">Statement of Registrar Accreditation Policy</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Review the <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/accreditation/financials">Financial Considerations</a> that apply to become an ICANN-accredited registrar.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Review the <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/governing-policies">Governing Agreements and Policies</a> that apply to every ICANN-accredited registrar.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Apply for Registrar Accreditation. To apply, you must complete an ICANN <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/accreditation/application-form.docx">application form</a>. To assist us in processing your application as quickly as possible, please submit very specific, thorough answers and all necessary supporting documents. The main reasons for delays in the processing of an application include missing supporting documents and incomplete or vague answers to application questions. Questions you may have concerning your application should be addressed to <a href="mailto:accredit@icann.org">accredit@icann.org</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>After completing its review of your application and conducting any necessary follow-up inquiries and research, ICANN will inform you by e-mail of its decision on your accreditation application.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>If your accreditation application is approved, the following additional steps must be completed:</p>
<ol start="6">
	<li>
		<p>Sign a Registrar Accreditation Agreement with ICANN and pay the accreditation fee. The <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/registrars/registrars-en">current version of the agreement</a> is a standard document that all registrars sign with ICANN. An ICANN accreditation is currently granted for a term of 5 years. (ICANN will generate and send your Agreement, along with an invoice for the annual fixed portion of the accreditation fee).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Sign a <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/registrar-data-escrow-2015-12-01-en">Registrar Data Escrow</a> (RDE) Agreement with an ICANN-Designated Registrar Data Escrow Agent, or select an ICANN-Approved Registrar Data Escrow Agent (at your own cost). As stated in paragraph 3.6 of the RAA, all ICANN-accredited registrars are required to deposit certain gTLD registration information. Executing both the RAA and RDE Agreement with ICANN are the last steps in the ICANN registrar accreditation process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Once you return the signed RAA and RDE Agreement and pay your accreditation fee, ICANN will notify the applicable registries of your accreditation and add you to the list of registrars at <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/accredited-registrars">https://www.icann.org/en/accredited-registrars</a>. You should work out the contract, financial, and technical details with the registry operators.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Complete the preparation of your registration agreement for Registered Name Holders. The ICANN Registrar Accreditation Agreement requires that certain specific provisions be included in this registration agreement. In addition, ICANN adopted a <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp">Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy</a>, which all accredited registrars are required to follow. You may also wish to implement a <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/accreditation/model-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> to comply with the requirements of your accreditation agreement.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Inaugurate your service. After the above steps have been completed, you should be able to begin offering services to the public as soon as you pass the testing process and become operational with the respective registries for which you have been accredited.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Help in the Registrar Accreditation Application Process</strong></p>

</div><div><p>Domain Name System</p><p>Internationalized Domain Name ,IDN,"IDNs are domain names that include characters used in the local representation of languages that are not written with the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet ""a-z"". An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a name consisting exclusively of LDH labels, such as""icann.org"" is not an IDN."</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 02:22:12 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/21/crowdstrike_linux_crashes_restoration_tools/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/21/crowdstrike_linux_crashes_restoration_tools/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41030352">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>CrowdStrike's now-infamous Falcon Sensor software, which last week led to widespread outages of Windows-powered computers, has also caused crashes of Linux machines.</p>
<p>Red Hat in June <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7068083">warned</a> its customers of a problem it described as "Kernel panic observed after booting 5.14.0-427.13.1.el9_4.x86_64 by falcon-sensor process" that impacted some users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 after (as the warning suggests) booting on kernel version 5.14.0-427.13.1.el9_4.x86_64.</p>
<p>A <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7068083">second issue</a> titled "System crashed at cshook_network_ops_inet6_sockraw_release+0x171a9" advised users "for assistance with troubleshooting potential issues with the <code>falcon_lsm_serviceable</code> kernel module provided from the CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor/Agent security software suite." Red Hat also advised that "disabling the CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor/Agent software suite … will mitigate the crashes and provide temporary stability to the system in question while the issue is investigated." The issue was "Observed but not limited to release 6 and 7."</p>

    

<p>We've also spotted reports of CrowdStrike being suspected of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41005936">causing problems</a> in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2024/04/msg00202.html">Debian</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/crowdstrike-freezing-rockylinux-after-9-4-upgrade/14041">Rocky Linux</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>Linux Kernel panics and Windows Blue Screens of Death are broadly comparable. The occurrence of kernel panics mere weeks before CrowdStrike broke many Windows implementations therefore hints at wider issues at the security vendor.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> has asked CrowdStrike to comment on the issues identified by Red Hat, and will update this story if we receive substantial information.</p>

<h3>Rapid restore tool on the way</h3>
<p>CrowdStrike on Sunday <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crowdstrike_falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-activity-7220896892623220737-lq8Y/">teased</a> a rapid recovery tool for the mess it made.</p>
<p>"Together with customers, we tested a new technique to accelerate impacted system remediation," the security vendor stated on LinkedIn, adding "We're in the process of operationalizing an opt-in to this technique. We're making progress by the minute."</p>

        

<p>That progress will likely be of great interest, as Microsoft veep for enterprise and OS security David Weston on Saturday <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/">estimated</a> that 8.5 million Windows machines had been laid low by the problem. That's less than one percent of all Windows devices in operation, though a lot of the ones affected obviously were in critical environments.</p>
<p>Microsoft also created a repair tool that runs from a bootable USB storage device and can be found <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-recovery-tool-to-help-with-crowdstrike-issue-impacting/ba-p/4196959">here</a>, along with instructions for use. Those instructions were modified on Sunday to require a full wipe of the USB device "so it doesn't error out when used in the recovery process."</p>
<p>CrowdStrike <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-update-for-windows-hosts-technical-details/">published</a> technical details of the incident. It has also offered <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/">guidance</a> on how to recover Windows machines encrypted with BitLocker.</p>

        

<p>Former Microsoft operating system developer David Plummer has shared his dissection of the flawed CrowdStrike update <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAzEJxOo1ts">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Up in the air</h3>
<p>The extent of disruption caused by CrowdStrike remains uncertain, but we've read accounts of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://simpleflying.com/6855-flights-canceled-it-outage/">over 6,800</a> flights cancelled last Friday alone, and of some airlines only restoring systems <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.jetstar.com/au/en/travel-alerts#Update%20on%20global%20software%20issue">on Sunday evening</a>.</p>
<p>The British Medical Association has <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bma.org.uk/bma-media-centre/gps-will-take-time-to-recover-from-crowdstrike-outage-says-bma">warned</a> that "normal service cannot be resumed immediately" by UK doctors, at least, due to the backlog caused by the outage.</p>
<p>Australia's home affairs minister Claire O'Neill has warned that remediation could take weeks.</p>
<p>This remains a developing story: <em>The Register</em> will update this item, or write others, as further info emerges. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The <code>Pin</code> type (and the concept of <em>pinning</em> in general) is a foundational building block on which
the rest of the the Rust async ecosystem stands. Unfortunately, it has also been one of the least
accessible and most misunderstood elements of async Rust. This post is meant to explain what <code>Pin</code>
achieves, how it came to be, and what the current problem with <code>Pin</code> is.</p><p>There was an interesting <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-vs-rust-is-mojo-faster-than-rust">post</a> a few months ago on the blog of the company Modular, which is
developing a new language called Mojo. In a brief section discussing <code>Pin</code> in Rust, I found that it
very succinctly captured the zeitgeist of the public discussion of the subject:</p><blockquote><p>In Rust, there is no concept of value identity. For a self-referential struct pointing to its own
member, that data can become invalid if the object moves, as it’ll be pointing to the old location
in memory. This creates a complexity spike, particularly in parts of async Rust where futures need
to be self-referential and store state, so you must wrap Self with Pin to guarantee it’s not going
to move. In Mojo, objects have an identity so referring to self.foo will always return the correct
location in memory, without any additional complexity required for the programmer.</p></blockquote><p>Some aspects of these remarks confuse me. The term “value identity” is not defined anywhere in this
post, nor can I find it elsewhere in Mojo’s documentation, so I’m not clear on how Modular claims
that Mojo solves the problem that <code>Pin</code> is meant to solve. Despite this, I do think the criticism of
<code>Pin</code>’s usability is well stated: there is indeed a “complexity spike” when a user is forced to
interact with it. The phrase I would use is actually a “complexity cliff,” as in the user suddenly
finds themself thrown off a cliff into a sea of complex, unidiomatic APIs they don’t understand.
This is a problem and it would be very valuable to Rust users if the problem were solved.</p><p>As it happens, this little corner of Rust is my mess; adding <code>Pin</code> to Rust to support
self-referential types was my idea. I have ideas of how this complexity spike could be resolved,
which I will elaborate in a subsequent post. Before I can get there though I need to first try to
explain, as efficiently as I know how, what <code>Pin</code> accomplishes, how it came to exist, and why it is
currently difficult to use.</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>To explain why <code>Pin</code> exists, we need to step back to the original development of async/await. The
problem we were trying to solve was that in order to support references in async functions, we
needed to be able to store those references inside of a <code>Future</code>. The problem was that those
references might be <em>self-references</em>, meaning they point to other fields of the same object.</p><p>Consider this toy example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>z</span>: <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span><span> </span><span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>..</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>z</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>z</span><span>).</span><span>await</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>z</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Both of these functions evaluate to an anonymous future type; the future type that an async function
evaluates to has a state for each possible step at which it could pause: when it starts, every await
point, and when it finishes.</p><p>For the purposes of our example, we will call the anonymous future that <code>foo</code> evaluates to
<code>Foo&lt;'a&gt;</code> (the <code>'a</code> being the lifetime of the <code>z</code> argument) and the anonymous future that <code>bar</code>
evaluates to <code>Bar</code>. Let’s ask ourselves, what would the internal states of <code>Bar</code> be? Something like
this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>enum</span> <span>Bar</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>// When it starts, it contains only its arguments
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>    </span><span>Start</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span> <span>},</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>// At the first await, it must contain `z` and the `Foo` future
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>    </span><span>// that references `z`
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>    </span><span>FirstAwait</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>z</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>foo</span>: <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'</span><span>?&gt;</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>// When its finished it needs no data
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>    </span><span>Complete</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note the <code>'?</code> in for the lifetime of the <code>Foo&lt;'_&gt;</code> future: what lifetime could that be? It isn’t a
lifetime that outlives <code>Bar</code>, <code>Bar</code> has no lifetimes. The <code>Foo</code> object instead borrows the <code>z</code> field
of <code>Bar</code>, which is stored along side it in the same struct. This is why these future types are said
to be “self-referential:” they contain fields which reference other fields in themselves.</p><p>Here we must make a clarifying distinction: the goal of <code>Pin</code> is <em>not</em> to allow users to define
their own self-referential type in safe Rust. Today, if you tried to define <code>Bar</code> by hand, there
is really no safe way to construct its <code>FirstAwait</code> variant. Making this possible would be a worthy
objective, but it is orthogonal to the goal of <code>Pin</code>. The goal of <code>Pin</code> is to make it safe to
<em>manipulate</em> self-referential types generated by the compiler from an async function or implemented
with unsafe code in a runtime like tokio.</p><p>However a self-referential type has been defined, once it exists it presents a problem. Imagine that
<code>Bar</code> has been put into the <code>FirstAwait</code> state, so it contains references to its own <code>z</code> field. If
you were to move <code>Bar</code>, those references would now dangle and point to dead memory, which may be
re-used for a different value. Therefore, it is essential that once Bar could be put into the
<code>FirstAwait</code> state, it is not moved again. Prior to the development of <code>Pin</code>, any object in Rust
could be moved if you had ownership of it, or even if you had a mutable reference to it. So this was
the problem that we needed to solve: we needed to express the requirement that from a certain point
an object cannot be moved.</p><h2 id="non-solutions-move-constructors-and-offset-pointers">Non-solutions: move constructors and offset pointers</h2><p>Before we continue, I want to spend a moment to discuss two solutions to the problem which are
often proposed but don’t work (at least in Rust). These both take a rather different approach from
the approach taken by <code>Pin</code>: instead of saying the value cannot be moved again, they try to make it
so that self-referential values can be moved after all.</p><p>The first of these is the move constructor. The idea is that you would run some code whenever a
value is moved, similar to the destructor that is run when the value is dropped. This code could
then “fix-up” any self-referential pointers so that they now point to the new location. I’ve
discussed this in the past in my <a href="https://without.boats/blog/why-async-rust">post</a> about the history of async Rust, but this is
not a viable solution because in Rust, those pointers could exist anywhere, not just “inside” the
value being moved. For example, you could instead have a vector of pointers into your own state, and
so the move constructor would need to be able to trace into that vector. It ultimately requires the
same kind of runtime memory management as garbage collection, which wasn’t viable for Rust.</p><p>The other reason move constructors don’t work is that Rust very early on affirmed that it would
never have move constructors, and a lot of unsafe code exists which assumes it is possible to move
values by just copying their memory. Adding move constructors would be a breaking change for Rust.</p><p>The other non-solution that is sometimes proposed is the offset pointer. The idea in this case is
that rather than compile self-references to normal references, they are compiled to offsets relative
to the address of the self-referential object that contains them. This does not work because it is
not possible to determine at compile time if a reference will be a self-reference or not: its
possible for the same value to be both in different branches. For example, here’s a modified version

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>By the time you call <code>foo</code>, <code>z</code> may be a pointer into the same object or it may be a pointer
elsewhere. Its not possible to determine at compile time. You would need to compile references to
some sort of enum of offset and reference; this was deemed unrealistic when we were working on
async/await.</p><h2 id="the-pinned-typestate">The “pinned typestate”</h2><p>Having eliminated any option to make these objects movable, we therefore have a requirement that
the object be <em>immovable</em>. But we need to clarify exactly what the requirements are, because people
often make the wrong assumption about what is required.</p><p>Most importantly, these objects are not meant to be <em>always immovable</em>. Instead, they are meant to
be freely moved for a certain period of their lifecycle, and at a certain point they should stop
being moved from then on. That way, you can move a self-referential future around as you compose it
with other futures until eventually you put it into the place it will live for as long as you poll
it. So we needed a way to express that an object is no longer allowed to be moved; in other words,
that it is “pinned in place.”</p><p>While we were experimenting with APIs for expressing this requirement, Ralf Jung was kind enough to
formalize the idea. In Ralf’s model, even before the work on async/await, objects could be in one of
two “typestates”: they are “owned,” in which state they can be moved freely, or they are “shared,”
in which state they cannot be moved for some lifetime (because they have references pointing to
them). To support self-referential future types, Ralf’s model gained a third typestate, which is
called “pinned.”</p><p>Once an object enters the pinned typestate, it can never be moved again. More specifically, its
memory cannot be invalidated without first executing its destructor. This definition also includes
some other edge cases, like freeing memory without running the destructor, but the main way you
invalidate an object’s memory without the destructor running is by moving the object to a new
location. The easiest way to understand the pinned typestate is to think of it as requiring that the
object never is moved again.</p><p>Another fact about the pinned typestate is that for most types it is completely irrelevant. If the
value of type can never contain any self-references, pinning it is useless. So for most types of
objects, one would want types to be able to opt out of ever entering the pinned typestate so that
you <em>can</em> move them again if you want.</p><p>There is a more detailed description of the pinned typestate in the formal model of Rust on Ralf’s
<a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/04/05/a-formal-look-at-pinning.html">blog</a> for people who are interested. But having understood the requirements of pinning (first
informally, and then formally by Ralf), we had the problem of finding the best way to represent an
object entering the pinned typestate in the surface language of Rust. Ralf’s model describes the
semantics of the language, but doesn’t specify a user-facing API or syntax. The solution that we
ended up with was the <code>Pin</code> type, but it wasn’t the first solution we tried.</p><h2 id="move"><code>?Move</code></h2><p>Before we tried <code>Pin</code>, we tried a solution based on a new trait which we called <code>Move</code>. The idea was
that most types would implement <code>Move</code>, and nothing about them would change, but any type that could
contain self-references would not implement <code>Move</code>. For these types which don’t implement <code>Move</code>,
whenever you take a reference to a value of that type, that value enters the pinned typestate and no
longer can be moved.</p><p>This definition is at the same time somewhat complex - people often assume <code>Move</code> controls moving at
all, which wasn’t the original proposal - and also in other ways somewhat intuitive - you can’t
possible store a self-reference in a value without taking a reference to that value to store, so
tying the transition to the pinned typestate to the taking of a reference provides a straightforward
guarantee of safety. And the check for this could be implemented automatically in the compiler: for
types that don’t implement <code>Move</code>, disallow moving values of those types after they’ve been
referenced in the same way you disallow moving values of non-<code>Copy</code> types after they’ve been moved.
This behavior was even implemented in a branch.</p><p>The design has one fundamental limitation, which is that sometimes you want to take a reference to
a value that will later be self-referential without pinning it in place. For example, maybe you want
to store it briefly in an <code>Option</code> and then use <code>Option::take</code> to take it away. This would probably
be the most significant problem with this original <code>Move</code> trait, but we didn’t even get to the point
of really identifying that problem, because we discovered early on that adding <code>Move</code> would not be a
backward compatible change.</p><p>I’ve written about this <a href="https://without.boats/blog/changing-the-rules-of-rust">before</a>, but let me reiterate. There are two kinds of
automatically implemented “marker traits” in Rust:</p><ol><li><strong>Auto traits:</strong> these are automatically implemented for types if all their fields implement
them. Major examples include <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>.</li><li><strong>?Traits:</strong> these are automatically implemented for types if all their fields implement them,
and generic parameters are assumed to implement them as well unless they explicitly opt out. The
only example of this is <code>?Sized</code>.</li></ol><p>We knew all along that we couldn’t make <code>Move</code> an auto trait, because there are stable APIs that
depend on the fact that you can always move out of a mutable reference. The classic example of this
is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.swap.html">mem::swap</a>, which swaps the location of two values of the same type. You can’t allow
swapping types that don’t implement <code>Move</code>, but there’s no <code>Move</code> bound on that API, and adding a
new bound to it would be a breaking change.</p><p>Our assumption, therefore, was that we would need to add <code>Move</code> as a ?Trait: <code>?Move</code>. By default,
all generics would be assumed to be <code>Move</code>, but if an API doesn’t require the ability to move the
parameter it can add a <code>T: ?Move</code> bound to the API. This was already not very appealing: a lot of
APIs don’t need the value to be movable and would presumably gain a <code>?Move</code> bound, making Rust
documentation harder to understand across the board. But the whole plan went down with the fact that
adding <code>Move</code> as a ?Trait was <em>also</em> not backward compatible.</p><p>The problem is with associated types: the place to add ?Trait bounds to associated types is at the
trait’s definition site. If the associated type of a trait does not have a ?Trait bound, all code
which uses that trait is allowed to assume that the associated type implements that trait. Moreover,
relaxing that bound on an existing trait would be a breaking change, because code is allowed to
exist which relies on that bound</p><p>Here is an example using <code>IntoFuture</code>, which assumes that the associated future type has the
behavior of a type that implements <code>Move</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>swap_into_future</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span>: <span>IntoFuture</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>into_f1</span>: <span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>into_f2</span>: <span>T</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>// This would become an error if you add
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>    </span><span>// `type IntoFuture: ?Move` to the trait:

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This problem is widespread, because many fundamental operators involve associated types. For
example, you could not even have a mutable reference to a <code>?Move</code> type implement <code>DerefMut</code>, because
the target of a pointer is an associated type:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>swap_derefs</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span>: <span>DerefMut</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Target</span>: <span>Sized</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>r1</span>: <span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>r2</span>: <span>T</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>// This would become an error if you add
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>    </span><span>// `type Target: ?Move` to the trait:
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>    </span><span>mem</span>::<span>swap</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>r1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>r2</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The same is true of the return type of a function, the item of an iterator, the value returned by
the index operators, by the arithmetic operators, and so on. It is simply not backward compatible to
add another new ?Trait, and an edition cannot be easily used to solve the problem, because it is
necessary that the interfaces of traits remain the same so that two crates in different editions can
be composed together.</p><h2 id="pin"><code>Pin</code></h2><p>Given that limitation, we set out to solve the problem in a completely different direction. Instead
of making the pinned typestate a property of the object’s type which it enters whenever it is
referenced, we designed a new category of reference which puts the object into the pinned typestate
when the reference is created. This is represented with the <code>Pin</code> type.</p><p><code>Pin</code> is a wrapper type that can wrap any kind of pointer (both the built-in reference types and
library-defined “smart pointers” like <code>Box</code>). It means that that pointer puts its target into the
pinned typestate so it must never be moved again. To make the changes necessary as minimal as
possible, we implemented this as a library API, rather than having immovability enforced by the
compiler. This means that when code actually needs to mutate the object that is pinned, it must use
an unsafe API get access to it and guarantee that the object is not moved through that ordinary
mutable reference.</p><p>Since most types don’t have a meaningful difference between the pinned typestate and normal, the
<code>Unpin</code> auto trait was added. This allows getting a mutable reference from a pinned pointer without
unsafe code if the type can’t be self-referential. It’s perfectly safe to move the object out of a
<code>Pin</code> if it implements <code>Unpin</code>. This is a lot like <code>Move</code>, but by tying this behavior only to pinned
pointers, we avoid the issue of backward compatibility as well as the original problem that you
couldn’t reference a <code>?Move</code> object without pinning it in place. Because pinning only applies to
pinned pointers, ordinary unpinned references still work just fine with types that are not <code>Unpin</code>.</p><p>There are more details in the documentation for the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html">Pin</a> type and for the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html">pin</a> module, which over the years have grown into a comprehensive and clear
explanation of pinning as it exists in Rust today.</p><p>Of course, the biggest advantage of the <code>Pin</code> interface was that it was backward compatible to add.
Because all of the APIs that can move referenced data like <code>swap</code> require a mutable reference, once
you pin a object with <code>Pin</code> you can’t call them on that object anymore. But because the new pinned
typestate only applies to special pinned references, it doesn’t require breaking changes to the
rest of the Rust language. This is why we went forward with this design: it was possible to add
without breaking any existing code and violating Rust’s backward compatibility guarantees.</p><h2 id="the-problems-with-pin">The problems with <code>Pin</code></h2><p>Despite meeting our requirements in a backward compatible way, <code>Pin</code> has proven to have several
problems in terms of usability. It is indeed a “complexity spike” when users have to deal with
<code>Pin</code>. But what is the cause of this complexity?</p><p>One theory would be that the problem is that whereas the <code>Move</code> trait was to be enforced by the
compiler, the <code>Pin</code> trait requires unsafe code to mutate objects while they’re pinned. With the
<code>Move</code> trait, this was automatically enabled by marking mutating APIs which don’t move the object
<code>?Move</code>. To some extent this is true, but we should be careful not to exaggerate it. For example,
you can already assign to a pinned object using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html#method.set">Pin::set</a>, which is totally safe. And
code which actually needs to mutate pinned objects is actually rare: in general, that’s code
generated by the compiler when it lowers your async function to a future, not code you write
yourself.</p><p>Another theory (advanced by Yosh Wuyts <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/n2cpfi/ergonomic_self_referential_types_for#c_q2erme">here</a>) is that the reason <code>Pin</code> is difficult
to use is that its “conditional.” This also does not strike me as the problem. Plenty of things in
Rust and programming are “conditional” but are lauded as making programmers’ lives easier. For
example, non-lexical lifetimes were all about making lifetimes end at different point in different
branches of <em>a conditional</em>, and everyone sees this as making Rust easier to understand. Maybe there
was some naming issue that has made it hard to understand the relationship between <code>Pin</code> (a type)
and <code>Unpin</code> (a trait), but I don’t think this is the heart of the problem.</p><p>In my opinion, the problem with <code>Pin</code> is that it was implemented as a pure library type, whereas the
ordinary reference types have plenty of syntactic sugar and support as built-in types that are part
of the language. A lot of nice features that references have disappear when you are dealing with
pinned references. This makes the experience much worse, and more importantly breaks many users'
mental models, because they’ve built up an understanding of how references behave based on what the
compiler accepts, and similar code stops being accepted once you are dealing with pinned references.</p><p>A very prominent example is the notion of “reborrowing,” which normal mutable references have but
pinned references do not. Consider this: <code>&amp;mut T</code> does not implement <code>Copy</code>, and yet its perfectly
permissible to pass it as an argument multiple times in a row, like so:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>incr</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+=</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>incr_twice</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>incr</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>incr</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>It never occurs to most users to ask why this is allowed, but in fact it violates a basic rule of
Rust: types which don’t implement <code>Copy</code> can’t be moved more than once. The reason is that there is
an implicit coercion in the compiler called “reborrowing,” in which when mutable references are
used, it will functionally insert a “reborrow” (as if you wrote <code>&amp;mut *x</code> instead of <code>x</code>), to borrow
the reference again, instead of moving it.</p><p><code>Pin</code> does not have this affordance, because it is a normal library type that doesn’t implement
<code>Copy</code>. This means that when you use a <code>Pin&lt;&amp;mut T&gt;</code> more than once, you get an error about using
the value after a move or sometimes an even more inscrutable error about lifetimes. Instead, you
have to explicitly reborrow <code>Pin</code> using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html#method.as_mut">Pin::as_mut</a> function. This difference is
the cause of a lot of confusion when users try to use <code>Pin</code>.</p><p>I could go on and on. Consider the example of <code>set</code> mentioned above: that its safe to assign to
<code>Pin</code>, but you need to use the <code>set</code> method. You can just assign to a mutable reference using a
dereference and the assignment operator. But this is not true of <code>Pin</code>, you need to learn the
special API. Many such special cases exist, and they are because <code>Pin</code> is a library type with no
support in the language’s syntax.</p><p>Undoubtedly the worst of problem in this category is the problem of “pinned projections.” A
“projection” is the fancy programming language term for a field access: “projecting” from an
object to a field of that object (I guess in the same sense that an awning might project out of a
wall). The problem of pinned projections is that it is challenging to take a pinned reference to an
object and get a pinned reference to a field of that object. There are third party crates like
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/pin-project-lite">pin-project-lite</a> to solve this problem, but they require learning a complex new
API involving macros, emphasizing the way that pinned references are much harder to use than
ordinary references because they are a library type.</p><p>The worst part of this is a very unfortunate interaction between pinned projections and the <code>Drop</code>
trait. The problem arises because <code>Drop::drop</code> takes a normal mutable reference. Consider this
possibility: you have a type which has a field that is a self-referential field. You pin project to
that field and poll it. Then, in the destructor, you move out of that field (because you now have
an unpinned mutable reference), pin that future to the stack, and poll it there. You’ve just
violated the pinning guarantees.</p><p>The solution that crates like pin-project-lite use is to restrict your ability to define a
destructor. This works alright in practice, but this very fact is additional complexity that has to
be documented when explaining what precisely the pinning guarantees are. Unfortunately, <code>Drop</code> was
stable before <code>Pin</code>, so we had to work around it.</p><h2 id="in-my-next-post">In my next post…</h2><p>Despite these problems of usability, <code>Pin</code> is my proudest accomplishment of my work on Rust. We
enabled users to compile async functions which contain arbitrary references safely into
self-referential objects; without this async/await would not have been nearly as usable a feature
as it has been, because references are a fundamental part of how users write Rust. And we did so in
a manner which was entirely backward compatible with the language that already existed. <code>Pin</code> is now
a fundamental component of a thriving ecosystem for high-performance network services and other use
cases of asynchronous programming.</p><p>But I do agree with the critics: <code>Pin</code> represents a complexity cliff and working with a pinned
reference is much harder than working with an ordinary reference. That’s why in a few days I will
turn to the subject of how <code>Pin</code> could be improved. The key concept is the notion of <em>pinned
places</em>.</p></section></div>]]></description>

“He had been playing EndeavorRx for probably a couple of weeks, and one of the first things his
teacher said to us during our parent-teacher conference was, I don’t know what’s changed over the
last three weeks, but <strong>he’s like a different student academically.</strong>”

<h2>EndeavorRx: </h2>
<h2>Indications, Safety and Cautions</h2>
<p><strong><mark>Indications:</mark></strong><br>EndeavorRx is a digital therapeutic indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8-17 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. Patients who engage with EndeavorRx demonstrate improvements in a digitally assessed measure, Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®), of sustained and selective attention and may not display benefits in typical behavioral symptoms, such as hyperactivity. EndeavorRx should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include clinician-directed therapy, medication, and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder.</p>
<p><strong><mark>Safety:</mark></strong><br>No serious adverse events were reported. Of 342 participants who received AKL-T01 in the two clinical trials supporting EndeavorRx authorization for age ranges 8-17, 17 participants (4.97%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE) (possible, probable, likely). TE-ADEs reported at greater than 1% across the studies include: frustration tolerance decreased (2.34%) and headache (1.17%). Other adverse events occurred less than 1% and included dizziness, emotional disorder, nausea, and aggression. All adverse events were transient and no events led to device discontinuation. Across other studies in children and adolescents with ADHD, rates of adverse events were similarly low (&lt;10%) and no Serious Adverse Events have been reported. All reported adverse events across all clinical trials resolved at the end of treatment. Users should consider the totality of evidence presented along with their health care provider when considering incorporating AKL-T01 into their treatment plan.</p>
<p><strong><mark>Cautions:</mark></strong><br>Rx only: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a licensed health care provider.&nbsp;EndeavorRx should only be used by the patient for whom the prescription was written. For medical questions, please contact your child’s healthcare provider. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please dial 911. EndeavorRx is not intended to be used as a stand-alone therapeutic and is not a substitution for your child’s medication.</p>
<p>If your child experiences frustration, emotional reaction, dizziness, nausea, headache, eye-strain, or joint pain while playing EndeavorRx pause the treatment. If the problem persists contact your child’s healthcare provider. If your child experiences a seizure stop the treatment and contact your child’s healthcare provider.</p>
<p>EndeavorRx may not be appropriate for patients with photo-sensitive epilepsy, color blindness, or physical limitations that restrict use of a mobile device; parents should consult with their child’s healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Please follow all of your mobile device manufacturer’s instructions for the safe operation of your mobile device. For example, this may include appropriate volume settings, proper battery charging, not operating the device if damaged, and proper device disposal. Contact your mobile device manufacturer for any questions or concerns that pertain to your device.</p>
