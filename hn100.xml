<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="anchor-1bc85f">Zohran Mamdani has won New York’s mayoral race, NBC News projects, after the 34-year-old democratic socialist energized progressives in the city and across the country while generating intense backlash from President Donald Trump and Republicans, as well as some Democratic moderates.</p><p id="anchor-54393e">Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, on Tuesday handily defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who ran as a third-party candidate after having lost the Democratic primary — and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. Mayor Eric Adams, who mounted a third-party campaign for re-election after he won as a Democrat in 2021, dropped out of the race in September and endorsed Cuomo last month.</p><p id="anchor-2b7649"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/live-blog/election-day-2025-nyc-mayor-governor-race-live-updates-rcna241592" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow the election live here</strong></em></a></p><p id="anchor-031319">The victory caps a meteoric rise through New York politics for Mamdani since he launched his campaign roughly one year ago, transforming him from a virtually unknown state assemblyman who barely registered in polling to the incoming leader of America’s largest city. </p><p id="anchor-c4feca">Along the way, he pushed aside the heir to one of New York’s most iconic political dynasties not once but twice within five months.</p><p id="anchor-d59229">Now a nationally known political figure, Mamdani will attempt to enact the sweeping policy platform that inspired his supporters while managing an enormous municipal bureaucracy — and influencing national politics, as one of the most prominent democratic socialists and Democrats in the country. Among other goals, Mamdani wants to freeze rent on rent-stabilized units, enact universal child care, create a free bus program and launch city-run grocery stores.</p><p id="anchor-165e09">“It is tempting to believe that this moment was always destined,” Mamdani said before thousands at a rally in Queens late last month, before he noted that when he started his campaign, “there was not a single television camera there to cover it.”</p><p id="anchor-e54466">“Four months later and as recently as this February, our support had reached eye-watering heights of 1%,” Mamdani continued. “We were tied with noted candidate ‘someone else.’”</p><p id="anchor-7f8818">Mamdani’s victory is sure to reverberate not just throughout New York City but around the nation.</p><p id="anchor-8b107e">In New York, Mamdani’s next challenge will be the tall task of uniting leaders in Albany and on the City Council — many of whom were not eager to line up behind him — to advance his ambitious agenda.</p><p id="anchor-106b97">Nationally, many Democrats will examine his rise from obscurity, his successful messaging on social media and his focus on affordability for clues about how to navigate their own races.</p><p id="anchor-e2060e">Meanwhile, Republicans are eager to turn Mamdani’s left-wing platform into a wedge issue in competitive races far beyond New York City’s borders.</p><figure id="anchor-8edf15"><picture data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1667" data-original-width="2500"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251031-election-zohran-mamdani-ew-530p-558899.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251031-election-zohran-mamdani-ew-530p-558899.jpg 1x"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251031-election-zohran-mamdani-ew-530p-558899.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251031-election-zohran-mamdani-ew-530p-558899.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251031-election-zohran-mamdani-ew-530p-558899.jpg" alt="Zohran Mamdani speaking at his campaign office on Oct. 30, 2025 in New York." height="1667" width="2500"></picture><figcaption data-testid="caption"><span data-testid="caption__container">Zohran Mamdani speaking at his campaign office on Oct. 30, 2025 in New York.</span><span data-testid="caption__source">Laurel Golio for NBC News</span></figcaption></figure><p id="anchor-7c0f40">NBC News exit polling found that Mamdani won across racial demographics — with white, Black, Latino, Asian and voters of other races all backing his candidacy over Cuomo’s and Sliwa’s.</p><p id="anchor-59815a">Younger voters overwhelmingly backed Mamdani, with NBC News exit polling showing that voters under 45 years old favored him over Cuomo by 43 points. Voters over 45, meanwhile, backed Cuomo by a 10-point margin.</p><p id="anchor-5d083c">Education played a big role, too, the exit polling showed. And <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/new-york-city-divide-shaping-contentious-mayoral-race-rcna233912" target="_blank">one of the biggest divides</a> in the election was between New Yorkers who were born in the city and those who had moved to New York within the last 10 years.</p><p id="anchor-037249">Meanwhile, with Mamdani’s pro-Palestinian activism having become a key issue in the race, NBC News exit polling found that Jewish voters favored Cuomo over Mamdani by 29 points, 60% to 31%.</p><p id="anchor-50e30c">The closing weeks of the race turned into a brawl between Mamdani and Cuomo, the onetime front-runner who spent the general election trying to play catch-up. The two had heated debates in recent weeks, with Cuomo calling Mamdani a “divisive force in New York” while Mamdani painted Cuomo as Trump’s “puppet.”</p><p id="anchor-2e99c4">Trump made a late jump into the race Monday night, endorsing Cuomo on social media and saying a vote for Sliwa, the Republican nominee, was essentially a vote for Mamdani in the split general election field.</p><p id="anchor-746b05">Interestingly, exit polling showed self-identified Republicans favored Cuomo over Sliwa, with 61% of Republicans him while just 35% backed Sliwa.</p><p id="anchor-cbec83">Late last month, Mamdani delivered an emotional address condemning what he slammed as “racist, baseless” attacks he has faced for his Muslim faith. He will be the first Muslim mayor in New York City history. His unapologetically pro-Palestinian stance energized progressives who oppose Israel’s war in Gaza, as pro-Israel Democrats and donors grew anxious about his rise.</p><p id="anchor-8e888e">At a rally alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., days later, Mamdani said Cuomo, Adams and Sliwa possess only “the playbook of the past.”</p><p id="anchor-1fd5a1">“They have sought to make this election a referendum not on the affordability crisis that consumes New Yorkers’ lives,” he said, “but on the faith I belong to and the hatred they seem to normalize.”</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/allan-smith-ncpn925861" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture" data-flavor="focal" data-original-height="48" data-original-width="48"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2024_26/3653035/190618-allan-smith.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_26/3653035/190618-allan-smith.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_26/3653035/190618-allan-smith.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p>Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In September, Tidmarsh went after Tang’s Aurinia and its drug voclosporin that treats lupus nephritis, a disease in which the immune system attacks the kidneys. In a startling post on his LinkedIn account, Tidmarsh claimed that the FDA-approved drug had not been shown to provide “hard” clinical benefit and that the drugmaker had not performed necessary trials.</p>
<p>Such a post from the FDA’s top drugmaker turned heads. Aurinia claims its share price fell 20 percent in a matter of hours, dropping $350 million in market value.</p>
<h2>“Embarrassing”</h2>
<p>Aurinia pushed back in the lawsuit, saying that the drug had undergone a full FDA approval process—not an abbreviated one—and been assessed based on a validated surrogate endpoint that is known to predict clinical outcomes. Further, the drug has been approved for use in 36 other countries in addition to the US.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Tidmarsh offered his resignation, but on Monday, pharmaceutical industry publication <a href="https://endpoints.news/day-after-resigning-tidmarsh-now-says-hell-fight-exit-from-fda/">Endpoints News reported</a> that Tidmarsh had notified FDA staff that he planned to fight the investigation and was reconsidering his decision to resign.</p>
<p>If the allegations in Aurinia’s lawsuit are true, Tidmarsh’s behavior would be egregious for a federal regulator. But already, the claims and other scandals have outsiders concerned that the high-stakes “soap opera” is destroying the agency’s credibility, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/04/fda-in-disarray-expert-analysis-george-tidmarsh-scandal/">as Stat reported Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>“We are witnessing nothing less than a clown show at FDA right now,” one venture capital investor told the outlet. “For the sake of patients, we need a stable and consistent FDA!”</p>
<p>“What’s happening at the top of the FDA is embarrassing,” a portfolio manager at a large biotech fund added. “How am I supposed to convince people, other investors, that this sector is doing important work when the leaders of the FDA are acting this way?”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>If you're filing an immigration form - or helping someone who is - the Feds may soon want to look in your eyes, swab your cheek, and scan your face. The US Department of Homeland Security wants to greatly expand biometric data collection for immigration applications, covering immigrants and even some US citizens tied to those cases.</p>
<p>DHS, through its component agency US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Monday <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/11/03/2025-19747/collection-and-use-of-biometrics-by-us-citizenship-and-immigration-services" rel="nofollow">proposed</a> a sweeping expansion of the agency's collection of biometric data. While ostensibly about verifying identities and preventing fraud in <a href="https://www.nilc.org/resources/table_ovrw_fedprogs/" rel="nofollow">immigration benefit</a> applications, the proposed rule goes much further than simply ensuring applicants are who they claim to be.</p>
<p>First off, the rule proposes expanding when DHS can collect biometric data from immigration benefit applicants, as "submission of biometrics is currently only mandatory for certain benefit requests and enforcement actions." DHS wants to change that, including by requiring practically everyone an immigrant is associated with to submit their biometric data.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>"DHS proposes in this rule that any applicant, petitioner, sponsor, supporter, derivative, dependent, beneficiary, or individual filing or associated with a benefit request or other request or collection of information, including U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals and lawful permanent residents, and without regard to age, must submit biometrics unless DHS otherwise exempts the requirement," the rule proposal said.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>DHS also wants to require the collection of biometric data from "any alien apprehended, arrested or encountered by DHS."&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not explicitly stated in the rule proposal why US citizens associated with immigrants who are applying for benefits would have to have their biometric data collected. DHS didn't answer questions to that end, though the rule stated that US citizens would also be required to submit biometric data "when they submit a family-based visa petition."&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Give me your voice, your eye print, your DNA samples</h3>
<p>In addition to expanded collection, the proposed rule also changes the definition of what DHS considers to be valid biometric data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Government agencies have grouped together identifying features and actions, such as fingerprints, photographs, and signatures under the broad term, biometrics," the proposal states. "DHS proposes to define the term 'biometrics' to mean 'measurable biological (anatomical, physiological or molecular structure) or behavioral characteristics of an individual,'" thus giving DHS broad leeway to begin collecting new types of biometric data as new technologies are developed.</p>

        

<p>The proposal mentions several new biometric technologies DHS wants the option to use, including ocular imagery, voice prints and DNA, all on the table per the new rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The rule proposes to grant DHS express authority to require, request, or accept raw DNA or DNA test results," DHS said, including "to prove or disprove … biological sex" in situations where that can affect benefit eligibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DHS wants to use all that data for identity enrollment, verification and management of the immigration lifecycle, national security and criminal history checks, "the production of secure identity documents," to prove familial relationships, and to perform other administrative functions, the rule states.</p>

</ul>
<p>As we noted in our story last week about DHS' <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/us_foreigner_facial_scans/">new rule</a> expanding biometric data collection on&nbsp;entry into and exit from the US, biometric technology - especially the often-used facial recognition scan - is ripe for misuse and prone to errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This new proposed rule goes far beyond subjecting immigrants to algorithmic identification tech prone to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/30/remote_identity_verification_biased/">misidentifying non-white individuals</a>, however, and reaches a new level of surveillance, with DHS seeking to collect and keep DNA test results - including partial profiles - from immigrants and some US citizens to verify family ties or biological sex when relevant. It's not much more assuring that DHS also wants to collect new forms of biometric data like voice records, which are <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/10/ai_voice_cloning_safeguards/">increasingly easy to spoof</a> with AI.</p>

        

<p>When we asked DHS questions about its biometric expansion proposal, it only sent us a statement identical to the one it sent last week when we inquired about the new entry/exit biometric requirements. The agency didn't respond when we asked for a statement pertaining to this latest proposed rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DHS is taking comments on the proposal until January 2; so far the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/USCIS-2025-0205-0002/comment" rel="nofollow">submissions</a> are nearly entirely negative, with posters decrying the plan as government overreach, comparing the proposal to communist China, and calling it a violation of Constitutional guarantees against unreasonable search and seizure.&nbsp;®</p>

                    Popular shadow library Anna's Archive has become a top target for copyright holders. In just three years, publishers and authors have prompted Google to remove 749 million of the site's URLs from its search results. Despite this immense takedown campaign, which accounts for 5% of all URLs reported to Google on copyright grounds, the site itself remains easily discoverable through the search engine.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive">Anna’s Archive</a> is a meta-search engine for shadow libraries that allows users to find pirated books and other related sources.</p>
<p>The site launched in <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-opens-the-door-to-z-library-and-other-pirate-libraries-221118/">the fall of 2022</a>, just days after Z-Library was targeted in a U.S. criminal crackdown, to ensure continued availability of ‘free’ books and articles to the broader public. </p>
<p>In the three years since then, Anna’s Archive has built up quite the track record. The site has been <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/german-pirate-site-blockades-target-annas-archive-fitgirl-and-rpg-only/">blocked</a> in various countries, was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/lawsuit-accuses-annas-archive-of-hacking-worldcat-stealing-2-2-tb-data-240207/">sued in the U.S.</a> after it scraped WorldCat, and actively <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-urges-ai-copyright-overhaul-to-protect-national-security-250201/">provides assistance to AI researchers</a> who want to use its library for model training. </p>
<p>Despite legal pressure, Annas-archive.org and the related .li and .se domains remain operational. This is a thorn in the side of publishers who are actively trying to take the site down. In the absence of options to target the site directly, they ask third-party intermediaries such as Google to lend a hand. </p>
<h2>749 Million URLs</h2>
<p>Google and other major search engines allow rightsholders to request removal of allegedly infringing URLs. The aim is to ensure that pirate sites no longer show up in search results when people search for books, movies, music, or other copyrighted content. </p>
<p>The Pirate Bay, for example, has been a popular target; Google has removed more than 4.2 million thepiratebay.org URLs over the years in response to copyright holder complaints. While this sounds like a sizable number, it pales in comparison to the volume of takedowns targeting Anna’s Archive.</p>
<p>Google’s <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/overview">transparency report</a> reveals that rightsholders asked Google to remove 784 million URLs, divided over the three main Anna’s Archive domains. A small number were rejected, mainly because Google didn’t index the reported links, resulting in 749 million confirmed removals. </p>
<p>The comparison to sites such as The Pirate Bay isn’t fair, as Anna’s Archive has many more pages in its archive and uses multiple country-specific subdomains. This means that there’s simply more content to take down. That said, in terms of takedown activity, the site’s three domain names clearly dwarf all pirate competition. </p>
<center><em>Top targeted domains (Google)</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">

</center>
<h2>5% of All Google Takedowns, Ever</h2>
<p>Since Google published its first transparency report in May 2012, rightsholders have flagged 15.1 billion allegedly infringing URLs. That’s a staggering number, but the fact that 5% of the total targeted Anna’s Archive URLs is remarkable.</p>
<p>Penguin Random House and John Wiley &amp; Sons are the most active publishers targeting the site, but they are certainly not alone. According to Google data, more than 1,000 authors or publishers have sent DMCA notices targeting Anna’s Archive domains.</p>
<p>Yet, there appears to be no end in sight. Rightsholders are reporting roughly 10 million new URLs per week for the popular piracy library, so there is no shortage of content to report. </p>
<p>With these DMCA takedown notices, publishers are aiming to make it as difficult as possible for people to find books on the site using Google. This works, as many URLs are now delisted while others are actively being demoted by the search engine for book-related queries.</p>
<p>That said, the Anna’s Archive website is certainly not unfindable. Searching for the site’s name in Google still shows the main domain as the top search result. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>For as long as I have published my books, one of my overarching goals was to give credit to those who actually invented the hardware and software that we use. </p><p>I have spent 10,000+ hours to create an&nbsp;accurate record of their work but I'm not complaining. The 'as-close-to-possible' truth of invention by individuals or teams meant identifying the work, educating myself, writing questions, and sending emails. And after that process, I set up a chat because it all gets down to talking to someone on the other side of the world, about something that happened 30 or 40 years ago. </p><p>If the invention involves a team, I try to interview more than one person, so I can cross-check the facts. Not to call anyone out, it’s just that, given time, we all forget the facts. And everyone adds their personal take. It’s because of that, for example, that I know the English musician Peter Gabriel really did visit Apple's research labs as they tested the Apple Sound Chip, and gave the team his personal approval to use the song 'Red Rain' for the Macintosh II launch. Wil Oxford, Steve Perlman, Mike Potel, Mark Lentczner and Steve Milne told me so.</p><p>As I was wrapping up Version 2.3 of <a href="https://books.by/john-buck/inventing-the-future?ref=inventingthefuture.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Inventing the Future</a>, I spoke with Steve M and Mark about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Interchange_File_Format?ref=inventingthefuture.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">AIFF</a> (Audio Interchange File Format) audio standard that they built around the same time as their VIP visit. They did so as professional programmers, amateur musicians and electronic music experts. Milne and Lentczner knew users needed a standard file format to make their work lives easier and to fend off confusion in the nascent MIDI marketplace. But it didn't exist. So Steve and Mark consulted with users and manufacturers in the Apple cafeteria after hours. This work is interesting on its own but it also underpinned other research. The AIFF, Apple Sound Chip, and MIDI Manager work scaffolded QuickTime and its extensible video formats and programs in 1991. Senior engineer Toby Farrand told me:</p><p><em>Audio drove the development of QuickTime more than anything.</em></p><p>So who or what drove the development of AIFF?</p><p>Steve and Mark referred me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_File_Format?ref=inventingthefuture.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">IFF</a> (Interchange File Format&nbsp;(IFF) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF?ref=inventingthefuture.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">TIFF</a> (Tag Image File Format) that were built before AIFF, in 1985 and 1986 respectively. These file formats were the benchmark for open media standards. My search pivoted, as it always does, to understand those inventions. I expected to be able to find the engineer or engineers names, track them down and interview them. It has worked around 100 times before. </p><p>Jerry Morrison created IFF while working at Electronic Arts and then went to Apple, where he liaised with the AIFF team. I could easily background his work.</p><figure><img src="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-at-10.56.52---am-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1760" height="472" srcset="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-at-10.56.52---am-1.png 600w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-at-10.56.52---am-1.png 1000w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-at-10.56.52---am-1.png 1600w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-at-10.56.52---am-1.png 1760w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So I turned my attention to TIFF, built initially as an image standard for desktop publishing. TIFF was able to store monochrome, grayscale, and color images, alongside metadata such as size, compression algorithms, and color space information. In many ways, it was a lot like AIFF so I was keen to know more. But I couldn't find a TIFF creator. No matter how I enquired, Aldus created TIFF. </p><p>To be clear, while a search for AIFF will offer up a company (Apple) not a person, I was able to&nbsp;find Milne and Lentczner in part because of their unique names and because Apple publicised the AIFF work and those publications are archived. </p><p>All I had was Aldus, an American company that created desktop publishing with the help of Apple and Adobe. In fact, Paul Brainerd, the cofounder of Aldus coined the term 'desktop publishing' to quickly explain the technicality of what they were doing to potential investors. But Aldus and their seminal product, PageMaker, are long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/16/business/company-news-adobe-and-aldus-plan-a-500-million-merger.html?ref=inventingthefuture.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">gone</a>, and there were no breadcrumbs for TIFF's creation.  </p><p>Finally, after a day-long trawl through MacWeek back issues, I found Steve Carlson. (below)</p><figure><img src="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/carslonmacweek.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="663" srcset="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/carslonmacweek.png 600w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/carslonmacweek.png 1000w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/carslonmacweek.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Then I ran a similar length search through the Computer History Museum’s amazing Oral Histories transcriptions.&nbsp;Brainerd mentioned Carlson's name in an interview. (below)</p><figure><img src="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/carslonchm.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1096" height="314" srcset="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/carslonchm.png 600w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/carslonchm.png 1000w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/carslonchm.png 1096w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>But it was too brief an explanation so I kept looking. Then the trail went cold. </p><p>And that was because, folks had misspelt his name when quoting&nbsp;him and then that was copied into magazines, and reviews and so forth.&nbsp;Brainerd's CHM interview transcript was wrong. But I didn’t know that. </p><p>I just kept looking for Steve Carlson. </p><p>I found other inventors because they had unique middle or last names or by random methods such as searching glider pilot licences in the Napa Valley after a tip from a former colleague that 'so and so' was a pilot in retirement. I had no tips, no links, nothing.</p><p>Why couldn’t I find Steve Carlson? </p><p>All the while, the answer was right under my nose. I had downloaded the final Aldus TIFF specifications document, hoping to find the author’s name. However, the name is seemingly written in white text on white paper - making it invisible. What? </p><p>See below where I have highlighted the region with a blue block over the text.</p><figure><img src="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/TIFF-blue.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="948" height="1234" srcset="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/TIFF-blue.png 600w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/TIFF-blue.png 948w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>For a reason I can’t recall, I downloaded a plain text version and typed in Carlson to see if he was mentioned, but I must have paused at ‘Carls...' and the search functionality automatically filled in the rest. Suddenly I was staring at:</p><p><em>Author/Editor/Arbitrator: Steve Carlsen.</em></p><p>‘Carls-EN’</p><p>A quick trip to Google patents, and a search for <em>Steve Carlsen, Stephen Carlsen.</em>  Bingo! Stephen E. Carlsen’s patents at Aldus (and Adobe) in Issaquah, WA.</p><figure><img src="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-5.08.25---pm.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1066" height="542" srcset="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-5.08.25---pm.png 600w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-5.08.25---pm.png 1000w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-5.08.25---pm.png 1066w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I checked the geography, as most folks of a certain age do not stray far from the addresses filed in their patents, and typed Stephen’s correctly spelled surname into the online US White Pages for Washington State. There was ‘a’ Stephen Carlsen listed in a retirement&nbsp;village in WA. His age matched, but there were no public facing email addresses. </p><p>I searched bulletin boards on the topic of TIFF, as I had found a former Apple engineer that way. Don had picked an abbreviation of his initials and numbers to post on BBS in his college days and then carried that same combination into adulthood. Many of us did. I took a punt pasting his unique prefix into hotmail, gmail etc. and found Don and interviewed him, but - Stephen Carlsen did not show up in a BBS. So, no email to try.</p><p>My ‘last straw' method for finding someone is a stamped envelope. I wrote, printed and mailed a one-page letter to Stephen's listed address, and crossed my fingers.&nbsp;Four months later he popped up in my email. </p><p>It was a surprise and a relief. We swapped a few emails, and he confirmed the TIFF catalyst story. For Stephen it was 'no big deal'. Once he had built the initial TIFF, Aldus needed to convince 3rd party developers and scanner manufacturers to agree to TIFF as a standard.</p><p><em>“We had to define and promote an industry standard for storing and processing scanned images,&nbsp;so that we wouldn't have to write import filters for every model of every scanner that would soon&nbsp;be entering the budding desktop scanner market."</em></p><p>Stephen himself did much of the evangelizing as Paul Brainerd later pointed out:</p><p><em>“(Steve) developed the standard, and then we went out and promoted it in a series of meetings with specific companies - as well as some workshops we ran in Seattle and the Bay Area during the Seybold shows and the MacWorld shows.”</em> </p><p>I sent Stephen a draft of what I had written and he sent a prompt reply saying -&nbsp;<em>‘Looks good’.</em></p><p>I followed up asking him how he ended up at a tiny startup in Seattle called Aldus. </p><p><em>At that time, I was interviewing for a graphics position at Boeing Computer Services in Seattle, and noticed a small wanted ad that sounded really interesting, and seemed to be an excellent match for my background and interests. I interviewed with Paul and the 5-person mostly-ex-Atex engineering team, and I was hired.</em></p><p>Out of curiosity I put Stephen's email address, now that I knew it, into a Duck Duck search and found him helping people online with TIFF queries long after Aldus had been acquired by Adobe. He also contributed to a Google Group called tiffcentral. </p><p>Having interviewed so many people across more than a decade, I’ve got pretty good at judging those who would like to talk or type, those who are verbose and those that are not. I knew Stephen had said what he was going to say. I added his pioneering work on TIFF to the AIFF story and moved on. </p><p>Two years had flown by when I received an email yesterday.&nbsp;His ex-wife Peggy found my paper letter and wrote to me. Stephen passed away earlier this year.</p><p><em>Thank you for your interest in and support of Stephen’s brilliant work creating TIFF. I’m not surprised Stephen didn’t finish corresponding with you, as he had begun to struggle with using his&nbsp;computer and phone. Some days were better than others for him, but he began to lose touch with people&nbsp;during those months you were reaching out to him. He was a humble man, and I guess never pushed to be recognized, although I believe those who worked&nbsp;with him knew the truth.&nbsp;His last week was in my home, where he was never left alone.</em></p><p>Peggy finished the email with,&nbsp;<em>‘I called him Mr TIFF up to his last moment.'</em></p><p>The 10,000+ hours of book research disappeared in an instant. As sad as it was, I could see clearly that all of my work was worth it. Every single second. Because of this email. </p><p>Mr TIFF.</p><p>Last night, as everyone in my house went to sleep, I took a deep breath and edited the Wikipedia page for TIFF, the Tag Image File Format.&nbsp;</p><p>It no longer reads&nbsp;<em>‘created by Aldus’</em>, it reads&nbsp;<em>‘…created by Stephen Carlsen, an engineer at Aldus'</em></p><figure><img src="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/TIFF-Fixed.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1228" srcset="https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/TIFF-Fixed.png 600w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/TIFF-Fixed.png 1000w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/TIFF-Fixed.png 1600w, https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/content/images/2025/10/TIFF-Fixed.png 2004w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

<p>I recently took all my projects off the cloud, saving 10x in monthly AWS costs and thousands of dollars:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I FINALLY got everything off the cloud</p><p>I’m now paying 10x LESS money for BETTER infrastructure</p><p>My AWS bill was ~$1,400/mo</p><p>I got it down to less than $120/mo for literally better, beefier servers</p><p>Fear of managing servers has a price: 10x your monthly infra bill <a href="https://t.co/X8ezjo0CV1">pic.twitter.com/X8ezjo0CV1</a></p></div>— rameerez (@rameerez) <a href="https://twitter.com/rameerez/status/1841451179609370748?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2024</a></blockquote>  
</div>

<p>This tweet got viral, and I found out <strong>two things</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>One</strong> – many developers were tempted to do the same, and therefore curious on how I did it myself, so I wrote a blogpost explaining exactly <a href="https://rameerez.com/how-i-exited-the-cloud/">how I exited the cloud</a>.</p>
<p><strong>And two</strong> – the most important one: the majority of people commenting were not only <strong>not tempted</strong> by the idea, but <strong>highly confrontational</strong> about it.</p>
<p>Interesting behavior –I thought– because I genuinely believe I did something <em>good</em> from both a technical and business point of view: I managed to decrease costs 10x <a href="https://x.com/rameerez/status/1841457055686656511">while getting a 2x performance speedup</a> for free, and freeing myself from vendor lock-in – who wouldn’t want that for their business?</p>
<p>I have more money in my pocket, I’m more free, and I managed to do so while providing a better service for my users. </p>
<p>Well, turns out many people had strong opinions about it.</p>
<h2>I’m sorry, but you’ve been scammed</h2>
<p>You’ve been scammed, likely not out of your own money, but your employer’s money – and that’s why you don’t give a crap.</p>
<p>See, I noticed something interesting. Most people complaining about what I did happen to have “devops”, “cloud engineer”, “serverless guy”, “AWS certified”, or something similar in their bio.</p>
<p>None of these people have any skin in the game.</p>
<p>They don’t run their own projects in the cloud, they don’t pay a single dollar of the cloud bill at the end of the month, and they couldn’t care less about their employer’s AWS bill. They don’t <em>feel</em> the <strong>pain</strong> of being scammed out of thousands and thousands of dollars by cloud providers month after month. With someone else’s money, everyone’s brave.</p>
<p>To them, it’s way too convenient to be on AWS: not only it solves their problem, but it’s also a shiny object. It’s technically complex, it makes them look smart in front of other devs, it creates dependencies and lock-in effects so they’re not easily replaceable as employees, and most importantly – being on the cloud yields them a fat paycheck at the end of the month. They don’t have any incentive to make the most efficient decision for the business they work for, on the contrary – they depend on the business’ infrastructure being as complex and convoluted as possible, or they’ll be out of a job.</p>
<p>So don’t count on any of them telling you the truth – the truth that <strong>servers are not actually expensive</strong>.</p>
<h2>You can just rent servers for cheap</h2>
<p>I made my move from AWS to a company called Hetzner. I don’t get paid by them or have any affiliation to them, they just happen to offer cheap servers. I’ve used Digital Ocean in the past, loved them and considered them this time, but Hetzner prices are just better.</p>
<p>How good are the prices? Well, let’s take a look:</p>

<p>You can rent bare-metal servers with 80 cores for under $190 a month. I repeat: <strong>eighty cores for one-hundred-ninety dollars a month</strong>.</p>
<p>For comparison, compute-heavy instances in AWS of the C5-C6 families with comparable number of vCPUs cost between $2,500 and $3,500 a month – which is between 13x and 18x more expensive. Sure, you can get reserved instances, and that brings the price down to ~$1,300/mo, which is still 7x more expensive, plus you’d need to pay $46k upfront and be locked to a 3-year contract. I don’t know, Rick…</p>
<p>Say you don’t need such a big server. You don’t need, or you don’t want, to pay for the 79EUR one-time setup fee. It’s understandable, you only want to run your little projects, or you want a bit more flexibility. Let’s look at the VPS options:</p>

<p>You still can get a 48-vCPU machine for around $300/mo, without setup fees, without 3-year contracts, and with full flexibility to scale it down if needed.</p>
<p>Or a more-than-enough 8-core, 32GB RAM machine for around $50 a month that will probably be able to run <strong>all</strong> your projects at once, as long as they’re not getting literal millions of requests per day.</p>
<h2>You can buy servers for even cheaper</h2>
<p>But say this is still not cheap enough for you.</p>
<p>You’re not worried about monthly costs, you’re looking to save <em>for the long run</em>. Well, turns out buying your own servers is even cheaper in a long enough time frame:</p>

<p>You can buy a decent rack-mounted server, with 44 CPUs, 256GB RAM, 2TB NVMe SSD and a bunch of other features for under $1k. Think about it. You could probably run your app for <em>years</em> – for less than what you probably pay a month in cloud services.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you can buy the server but you still to account for the electricity costs, internet costs, cooling costs, rack costs, etc. I’m not going to get to that level of detail. The bottom line is that good servers are <em>cheap</em>.</p>
<p>You can also choose to rent rack space in a datacenter, and they’ll provide you with reliable electricity, internet, cooling, security, etc. You can look for datacenters in your area using websites like <a href="https://www.datacentermap.com/">DatacenterMap</a>:</p>

<p>The way it works is: you call the datacenter and they provide you with either shared space or a whole secure room for your servers, called datacenter cage, like this one:</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://rameerez.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9-1024x768.png" alt="" width="637" height="478" srcset="https://rameerez.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9-1024x768.png 1024w, https://rameerez.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9-300x225.png 300w, https://rameerez.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9-768x576.png 768w, https://rameerez.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px"></figure></div>
<p>And then you buy and ship your racks, and switches, and cables, and servers to the datacenter, load all the boxes in a little warehouse cart, transport everything into your cage and start building the racks and putting your servers in them:</p>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://rameerez.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-10.png" alt="" width="407" height="611" srcset="https://rameerez.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-10.png 600w, https://rameerez.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-10-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px"></figure></div>
<p>BUT – all of this is WAY too complex for small developers. You’d probably need to hire an engineer to help you set everything right, you’d need to be in sales calls with the datacenter to negotiate the price and all that – it’s way too cumbersome. Not worth it.</p>
<p>I’m just documenting it so you get a notion of how things actually work. I’ve never done this myself, it’s usually aimed at medium-to-big companies and enterprises that want to build their own infrastructure, and it’s pretty unusual that small teams do this.</p>
<p>Datacenter operations are quite interesting, I recommend you go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVubvo6H8Oc">watch some videos</a> to get a better understanding of how the internet actually works. This is literally how AWS works under the hood. It’s all datacenters. The whole internet is just cold, noisy rooms filled with metal boxes. Always has been.</p>
<p>Now, instead of renting an entire datacenter cage, you can just rent some available rack space in a shared rack, and then place your server there.</p>
<p>But you’d still need to physically go and install your server – and the end result is in practice THE SAME as just renting an already mounted server off a company like Hetzner, as I already described. And Hetzner takes care of replacing server parts when they go faulty, and they take all that hardware weight off your shoulders, quite literally.</p>
<h2>bUt ISn’T tHat sTilL tHe clOUD</h2>
<p>One of the most common critiques I got while I was trying to make the points above was something along the lines of: “but isn’t that still the cloud?”, “you didn’t actually exit the cloud, you just changed cloud providers”</p>

<p>Look, first of all, you’re as unique as the other 1000 peanut gallery enjoyers that have made the same astute observation before you. Congratulations. But you’re absolutely missing the point.</p>
<p>The point here is that there’s value in managing your own servers VS just accepting the cloud as a given truth. The point is you can start paying 10x-100x less money by running a little Linux machine instead of using managed AWS services. The point is most developers are scared of servers, and they just need a little push and encouragement to realize they can just set up their own servers for cheap to replace money-burners like RDS. The point is almost no one in the real world needs the cloud’s expensive managed services, and can do just fine with regular software running on a couple Linux boxes.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the only hard truth is whether you managed to keep more dollars in your pocket or you gave them away to Amazon’s stockholders’ pockets.</p>
<p>The whole debate of “is this still the cloud or not” is nonsense to me. You’re just getting lost in naming conventions. VPS, bare metal, on-prem, colo, who cares what you call it. You need to put your servers <em>somewhere</em>. Sure, have a computer running in your mom’s basement if that makes you feel like you’re <em>exiting the cloud more</em>, I’ll have mine in a datacenter and both will be happy.</p>
<p>I don’t care if the server is physically in my building. I don’t need to touch it, I need to <code>ssh</code> into it. In fact, if I had bought a physical server instead of renting one off Hetzner, I would still need to rent rack space to host it. At which point, you’re just doing the exact same thing as renting a server off Hetzner, only more expensive and less convenient if you’re a small developer.</p>
<p>It seems to me that people pushing for the “this is still the cloud” mindset are essentially gatekeepers. “You’re not doing it correctly, you need to purchase your own switches, build your own rack, hook the ethernet cable yourself…” – boss, how far do you wanna take this argument? Do you etch your own circuits too? This whole thing is like saying “I’m the only one who knows how to do it right and you’re not puritan enough to belong in this exclusive club”. It’s not only toxic, but it’s also the most lazy argumentation one could make. It’s choosing to get nuclear over a superficial nuance, instead of trying to refute the central argument.</p>
<p>The central argument is servers are not actually expensive, and whoever is telling you otherwise is probably trying to sell you a cloud managed service.</p>
<p>Companies like AWS or Vercel are charging you a 10x to 100x markup.</p>
<h2>You’re not using the cloud wrong, it’s just expensive</h2>
<p>They will try to gaslight you.</p>
<p>They will not only try to convince you you’re not exiting the cloud, but they’ll go as far as gaslighting you. They will make you believe you were not smart enough to <em>get</em> the cloud.</p>
<p>“You’re using the cloud wrong”, “It’s expensive because you’re doing it poorly”, “You just need to know how to use the cloud”.</p>
<p>You will hear a bunch of crap from people that have literally never tried the alternative. People with no real hands-on experience managing servers for their own projects for any sustained period of time. People trying to offer expert-level advice but that end up just spewing out generic, bland, off-the-shelve clichés and vague notions about how they think the cloud should work. People not only without skin in the game, but whose first job was straight into the cloud. People that go literally silent when you ask them: “so, what have you personally built lately, how many users does it serve, and how much are you paying for it?” They just don’t know better, and they’ll try to save face by defending themselves like a cat with its back against the wall – even if that means gaslighting you.</p>
<p>I’m definitely not an expert but I know my way around AWS. Hell, I’ve even studied AWS certs. I made sure my infra was not overprovisioned. I made sure I was not paying for services I was not using in regions I might have used only once or twice. I had already spent countless hours optimizing AWS costs, and even had some success in doing so (I even managed to cut my monthly AWS bill in more than half last year – it was north of $5k/mo before!)</p>
<p>I already did all that. I do know about serverless computing. I do know about reserved instances. I had reserved instances, in fact. (Don’t purchase reserved instances, they only make the problem worse: they create vendor lock-in, and they essentially go against everything I’ve been trying to argue. The least thing you want when you’re considering getting off the cloud because it keeps getting more and more expensive is to lock yourself into it with a 3-year contract. Yes, I also do know you can resell RIs, thanks, my argument still stands).</p>
<p>I tried all that, I tried as hard as I could, and the only conclusion I arrived to after many, many frustrations was that the cloud is simply way too expensive.</p>
<p>You can try yourself, by all means be my guest and try to prove me wrong, but I’ve already been there, done that, and I’m pretty sure of what I’m saying. So I’d suggest you just don’t listen to the fearmongering cloud cult folks that keep repeating gaslighting mantras like a broken record.</p>
<h2>You won’t make friends proposing all this</h2>
<p>All this backlash was interesting. Why do all these people care if I save more money or not?</p>
<p>I arrived at two main conclusions: 1) their livelihood depends on it; and 2) because of this fear, the conversation turns irrational.</p>
<p><strong>One – their livelihoods depend on it</strong>.</p>
<p>If they’re wrong, and if I and more people like me manage to convince enough people that they’re wrong, they may be out of a job soon.</p>
<p>It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>We come from a decade-long trend where the cool thing was to build things in the cloud, which in turn created thousands if not millions of “devops” and “cloud engineers”; and we’re now switching to a trend where the cool thing is to keep things off the cloud, which may terminate the careers of many cloud experts. It’s just another cycle, but people get understandably very defensive about it.</p>
<p>I’m sure many developers secretly know the cloud is not as good as they initially promised, and they hold that conflicting thought in their head day in and day out as they go about their job. There’s just no way those bright engineers look at their employer’s AWS spending realizing it’s 10x what it should be and go like: “ah, this is fine”.</p>
<p>But no one wants to do the work, and risk getting their managers upset and getting thrown under the bus. They don’t want to risk the political cost of not being in the same page as the most vocal person in the team. Or they just don’t know better. Many entered the industry after the cloud was already mainstream. People used to run their own servers, it used to be absolutely normal and just the thing to do, but Amazon’s marketing team managed to flip the market, so newcomers haven’t touched anything but cloud in their entire careers – and AWS evangelists convinced whoever seniors were left.</p>
<p><strong>Two – it’s not a rational discussion</strong>. As a result, developers that are currently balls deep into this whole cloud thing have developed some sort of Stockholm syndrome about the cloud. It’s essentially sunk cost fallacy, but it turns them into very irrational creatures.</p>
<p>AWS has a strong cult-like following. They teach you the doctrine via certifications where they make you memorize actual sales pages and product offerings, they have literal <em>evangelists</em>, they instruct you to stop listening to the rational voices around you that push for pragmatism instead of dogmatism, they instill fear of the outside world in you (servers are dangerous! things don’t scale!), they make you adopt “cloud engineer” as your whole new identity, they make it really easy to get in but really difficult to get out, etc. I’m not saying it’s an <em>actual</em> cult, of course, just that things get irrational pretty quick. More so when people’s livelihoods are on the line.</p>
<p>The end result is AWS followers, whenever confronted, get caught up in dogma and just start throwing irrational arguments left and right, repeating the AWS sales landing pages’ talking points one by one, and don’t even stop to think about what they really need or if those things are even of use to them. They got tricked into believing something, and once you touch upon belief systems, people get irrational.</p>
<p>I could never win this irrational discussion with rational arguments. It doesn’t matter how good my optimizations were. I could have cut costs 100x instead of just 10x – or I could have claimed something outrageous like I got to run all my infrastructure for just $1. It just doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>These people would still be ranting and arguing that I’m doomed because now I don’t have things like “infinite scalability capabilities” or “automated failovers with automated replica recovery”. These are things that I’ve never needed or used, things that I’m sure 99% of people in the thread never needed or used either, but that they throw at you in a vain attempt to build an argument.</p>
<p>When people are cornered, arguments quickly turn into dogma – and fear:</p>
<p>Hackers will break in. Your servers will get full of malware. Your hardware will fail and you won’t be able to restore it. Your switches will break and your customers will leave while your server is down. You will need to pay someone to maintain and upgrade your server, there’s no way around it! And you need a plethora of busywork to “do it properly”: failure scenarios! Recovery plans! Managing availability! Infosec! Monsters, spiders and zombies! All of them, coming for you! Be afraid, very afraid! How dare you not be afraid of all this scary stuff!</p>
<p>Well, either the last 15 years of my life –and the lives of most <em>webmasters</em> on the internet– have been a lie, or you don’t actually need any of that to run a server online.</p>
<h2>How did we get here?</h2>
<p>The majority of devs are clueless, or have forgotten, about how we got here.</p>
<p>Everyone used to run their own servers. Either VPSs, or hosting services, or bare metal in datacenters, or in a dark room in their companies, or at home. Everyone was familiar and comfortable <code>ssh</code>ing into machines.</p>
<p>I remember very clearly how the cloud marketing psyops campaign started in the early 2010s. It was a deliberate move by companies to try to shill their enterprise technology to early-stage startups, trying to get them locked in as early as possible so they could milk them as they raised rounds.</p>
<p>I remember when AWS started to give out credits specifically for startups only. They would literally make the rounds, going from startup accelerator to startup accelerator, trying to get everyone on board.</p>
<p>The trick is easy: you make it extremely cheap (free!) for startups to build on your infrastructure, then make everything extremely expensive as they grow, and enjoy the show because they’re so locked in most will struggle to escape the ecosystem by them.</p>
<p>AWS was not the only one. I remember attending an IBM cloud event in 2014. I was the CTO of a small startup at the time. They were very specifically targeting startups; in fact, we got the invitation via our startup accelerator.</p>
<p>We ran everything on Heroku at the time, and it worked just fine. I remember thinking: “what the hell is all this cloud stuff and how do I use it?” I vividly remember feeling like they were trying to sell us something that was not designed for us. I spent some time looking into it and just couldn’t wrap my head around this whole cloud thing. All of it sounded so alien to us.</p>
<p>But all these companies poured literal millions upon millions of dollars into this cloud shilling campaign over the following years, tricking early startups into adopting enterprise technology.</p>
<p>They ended up being successful at it – and the aftermath is the current state of web development in 2024. Zero interest rates through most of the last decade definitely helped in getting us here.</p>
<p>There is now a counterculture movement, mainly led by <a href="https://x.com/dhh">@dhh</a> and the Rails community, and this feels like something fundamentally fresh, right, and aligned with the reality of MOST software businesses on Earth.</p>
<h2>You don’t need the cloud</h2>
<p>Some people are absolutely out of touch with what most software businesses look like in the real world.</p>
<p>They think in terms of Fortune 500; they truly believe enterprise is the norm. They think the average business needs all the bells and whistles the cloud has to offer: high availability, multi-zone replication, automatic failovers, distributed Kubernetes clusters…</p>
<p>The reality is only a teeny tiny fraction of all software businesses need something like this.</p>
<p>Most businesses are and will always be small, by a simple rule of power law.</p>

<figcaption>Representation of a power law distribution. Actual phenomenon depicted is mostly unrelated, but it shows what a power law is: a very small number of companies are actually big – while the vast majority of companies in the long tail are small. In the United States, small businesses account for 99.9% of all businesses. In the European Union, SMEs (defined as having fewer than 250 employees) represent 99% of all businesses. Similar patterns are observed in many other countries around the world. Your little app is (most probably) not part of that 0.1%.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Most business are small, and the ones that need actual computing power can do incredibly well without the cloud up until a very high point. Scaling vertically can get you very, very far nowadays.</p>
<p>Most devs wildly overestimate scaling requirements. They have such a low bar for what “high traffic” means.</p>
<p>Here’s a reference point: my current two-server setup serves millions of requests a day for millions of monthly visitors. So is the case for many other indie makers, like <a href="https://x.com/levelsio/">@levelsio</a>, who even managed to get everything down to one single server. Most devs have never tried running a project of their own, with actual users and actual production traffic, on a single server – and it shows.</p>
<p>Devs also wildly overestimate other technical requirements. Again, only a tiny fraction of software businesses need the bells and whistles. Of course they exist, but they’re rare, and they usually have very good reasons for their technical decisions.</p>
<p>Like Netflix, needing to transcode and stream enormous amounts of video to customers all over the world. That’s where you need distributed systems, CDNs, edge computing, all of that stuff. Your little app with one thousand users that just sends some JSON objects around does definitely not need that.</p>
<p>I feel like most devs have this magical notion in their heads that their project is something like Netflix. It’s wishful thinking, and I get it – you want to be as successful as Netflix. But it makes you make the wrong technical decisions, and all of a sudden they think they need to have distributed servers all over the world because their users will somehow notice a few milliseconds difference in latency when they tap a button. It’s wild.</p>
<p>I remember a random conversation I had with a young entrepreneur a couple years ago. He ran a mobile app. I don’t remember what exactly it did, but it was of the “upload things and follow people” category of apps. I asked: “what’s the biggest challenge your facing in your startup?”, and he replied: “well, that’d be estimating monthly AWS costs. They’re high and unpredictable”. I held my breath and took a step back, as one does when someone makes a claim bold enough to make you reconsider if you might be in front of a billionaire or a super-successful entrepreneur you’ve never heard about, and respectfully asked: “how many users does your app have?”. “Oh, about a thousand now” – he replied.</p>
<p>Bro, just get a server. You don’t need the cloud.</p>
<h2>Your servers are going to be okay</h2>
<p>Something I discovered is that a lot of people have magical ideas about how datacenters actually work.</p>
<p>They think servers in datacenters are fragile and volatile. Like things that can just vanish into thin air.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/rameerez/status/1841602037949026585">Someone even thought a lightning strike can take down an entire datacenter</a> and nuke your business out of existence.</p>
<p>The reality is modern datacenters already account for all these problems and are equipped with many protections: not only against things as mundane as lightning, but against pretty much anything that can compromise uptime.</p>
<p>They have plenty of redundant systems: redundant power sources, redundant cooling, redundant internet connections, redundant fire suppresion systems, redundant security sustems and tons of physical security… Everything in a datacenter is designed with resiliency and redundancy in mind (N+1 redundancy at minimum, sometimes 2N) to guarantee uptime.</p>
<p>These are mostly fear-driven opinions, the result of a successful cloud marketing and psyops campaign. Where do you think AWS stores their machines, in a magical place under the rainbow? And how exactly would AWS machines be the only ones magically protected against problems that other datacenters also have?</p>
<p>Disasters can happen (<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/ovhcloud-fire-france-data-center/">OVH 2021</a>), sure, and you should have backups to recover from them – but in my experience of ~15 years running servers I think they’re rare, and I’ve never had any downtime of more than a few minutes.</p>
<p>Your server is probably going to be okay.</p>
<h2>You won’t have to spend your days managing servers</h2>
<p>Anyone who has managed servers for long enough knows you spend most time in the initial setup; then servers tend to be relatively stable.</p>
<p>Hardware failures are relatively rare, and once a server is up and running it usually runs flawlessly for years without much intervention.</p>
<p>Managing your own servers is not a full-time job.</p>
<p>You don’t need to employ a 5-person devops team. You don’t even need to hire a server guy: you can just do things yourself! It’s not that difficult.</p>
<p>Claude and ChatGPT usually have a good understanding of Linux systems and how to manage them, ask them for help.</p>
<p>When I posted the tweet, people thought this was my first time running servers and claimed I was overly optimistic in what running a server actually means.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to say these things without coming across as arrogant, but I’ve been managing servers since 2006.</p>
<p>I started, as many did, editing PHP scripts and uploading them to my FTP server. I first had to learn how to install WordPress, then ventured a bit and started editing WP templates, then everything else followed.</p>
<p>It was an invaluable experience for me. It taught me the basics.</p>
<p>It taught me what Linux was, how to navigate it, and by 2007 I was requesting Canonical for Ubuntu CD-ROMs that would arrive in the mail and that I would use to install in a partition in my parents’ computer to learn more about Linux.</p>
<p>Those early experiences taught me the basics of web development; everything else is built on top of it. Which leads me to my next point:</p>
<h2>You will learn how to use Linux, and that’s a good thing</h2>
<p>I think the new generations of devs (genz devs, alpha devs, etc.) are absolutely out of touch with the hardware that runs their software.</p>
<p>They lack these kinds of foundational experiences.</p>
<p>They were born in an era where a random guy on Youtube shilled them one specific vendor and taught them to run one very specific command that magically solved all their infrastructure problems. It’s only reasonable they have magical assumptions about what servers are and how they work.</p>
<p>They rant and rant about how you can just do things “serverless” without realizing they’re just running their code in many different boxes. Of course, many of them go on to learn more about Linux and servers, but the average bootcamp grad, let’s say, lacks the hands-on Linux experience that FTP hackers would have had 20 years ago.</p>
<p>I’m not making moral judgements about this: I’m not arguing it’s good or bad – it is what it is. The current state of web dev.</p>
<p>But the result is companies like Vercel are making literal millions of dollars by capitalizing on this new generation of developers that generally don’t know what they’re doing and have never ran a server of their own in their life.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Vercel pricing is absolutely insane, it blows my mind</p><p>Data transfer starts at $150/TB with 1TB included</p><p>Hetzner gives 20TB free, and then it’s €1.19/TB</p><p>So 20TB on Vercel is $2850, on Hetzner it’s free (included with VPS)</p><p>And then you have to pay extra per request?</p><p>Perhaps…</p></div>— Daniel Lockyer (@DanielLockyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielLockyer/status/1841920964164026635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2024</a></blockquote> 
</div>

<p>Ignorance has a double price: being ignorant in itself; and the price you pay for people exploiting that ignorance of yours. Not knowing how things work will actually cost you money.</p>
<h2>You’ll be fine</h2>
<p>Even if you’ve never managed your own server and you’re scared of everything that smells of backend, you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>there has never been a better time to get good at servers</strong>. Claude and ChatGPT are both extremely knowledgeable about Linux, and can guide your steps like it’s never been possible before in the history of technology. Not only to set things up and understand how they work, but whenever you need to make a change you can just ask them, and follow the steps without needing to hire anyone. It’s not as scary as it seems, and you won’t have to do it that often.</p>
<p>Plus, in the time of AI where code generation is the norm and code might even become a commodity, knowing how to put that code in cheap production servers, and make it actually useful to end users might be a key differentiator for you as a developer.</p>
<p>You will now need to worry about things like security, sure. Don’t listen to those arguing that running your own server is somehow less secure than running AWS’s servers, as if EC2 instances were magically protected against hackers or something.</p>
<p>The reality is it’s not that difficult to set things up right, just follow <a href="https://gist.github.com/rameerez/7771f4f949eddd8b0832c4652429c1ff">my guide and setup scripts</a> for example. There are many devs, more experienced than you, doing things in production way worse than what you could do when equiped with AI. Ask ChatGPT how to harden your Linux server and follow best security practices (like: don’t use password auth, only strong ssh keys) and you’re 90<em>% </em>there. Just take the plunge and go for it.</p>
<p>Something like Cloudflare can get you really far, too.</p>
<p>After locking your Linux box you can run Cloudflare on top of everything for an extra layer of protection: proxy the IP of your server on their DNS so you don’t expose it and you’re golden. And you get DDoS protection, edge caching, and a top-tier DNS for essentially free.</p>
<p>You’ll be fine.</p>

If your workflow still depends on tools that are not ready for the next decade, your tools are holding you back.</p><p><strong>Today, we’re announcing that Deepnote is going open source.</strong></p><p>We’re doing this as a way to share our learnings over past 7 years of working to power the worfklows of 500,000 data professionals and over 21% of Fortune 500.</p><p>We’re also doing this because the center of gravity has moved: from single‑player JSON scrolls to <strong>reactive, AI‑ready projects</strong> that humans and agents can co‑author, review, and deploy. We’re opening the format and the building blocks so the community has a standard that is purpose-built for AI.</p><h2>First principles: we still love notebooks</h2><p>We are big believers in notebooks — full stop. They are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Perfect for data exploration</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Perfect for collaborating with AI agents</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Perfect for bringing technical and non‑technical users together</strong></p></li></ul><p>In other words, they are the <strong>universal computational medium</strong> we’ve been all looking for.</p><h2>Why companies are leaving Jupyter</h2><p>You already know the papercuts because you live with them: <strong>no native integrations, confusing UX, shaky collaboration and versioning, brittle reproducibility, spotty visualization support, and no first‑class AI</strong>. On a small project you can squint; at team scale, those are blockers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <strong>market is voting with its feet</strong>. Across the Fortune 1000, job postings that mention and require Jupyter knowledge are down sharply; the most recent month was deep in the red YTD.</p><img src="https://us-west-2.graphassets.com/AaDC4FvhQQq2MDrtSUqtMz/cmhkgffun5yx809lq24yqut8d" alt="Nov 4 Screenshot from Blogpost.png" title="Nov 4 Screenshot from Blogpost.png" width="1252" height="1100"><p>On the other side, there’s slow activity in core Jupyter repos. If look at the contributions graph, you’ll see low commit velocity and very few unique contributors, including multi‑month holidays with no commits.<br></p><img src="https://us-west-2.graphassets.com/AaDC4FvhQQq2MDrtSUqtMz/cmhkggpdh5zea09lqgsnoyh2o" alt="Blogpost Image (3).png" title="Blogpost Image (3).png" width="1784" height="710"><h2>What’s wrong with the old notebooks</h2><p>Let’s start with the expensive elephant: <strong>internal data platforms built on top of Jupyter</strong>.&nbsp;The <strong>single‑player notebook model turns you into a platform vendor</strong>. That’s not your job. Lots of teams did the sensible thing in 2019–2023: stand up JupyterHub, glue on extensions, wire auth, deploy it on a k8s cluster, and call it a “platform.” It worked - until it didn’t. We see this in the wild. The <strong>total cost of ownership</strong> is now eating the roadmap for those teams, making them less nimble in the age where speed is everything. Rather than using cutting-edge software, the users are stuck with a platform that didn’t change since 2019.</p><p><strong>Where the cost hides (and compounds):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>People tax</strong>: Platform/SRE/Sec/DS‑ops spend cycles maintaining JupyterHub, kernels,</p></li><li><p><strong>Productivity stall</strong>: Teams are still using pre‑AI, single‑player tooling, so output doesn’t compound year‑over‑year; you can't even slap AI and call it a day - agether data nor the rest of collaboration infra is AI-ready.</p></li><li><p><strong>People tax</strong>: Platform/SRE/Sec/DS‑ops spend cycles maintaining JupyterHub, kernels, proxies, extensions, images, and brittle auth. Every upgrade is a change‑freeze prayer circle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connector upkeep</strong>: Building data connectors, rotating and sharing creds, chase schema drift, and re‑testing pipelines on every vendor change.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaboration debt</strong>: No first‑class versioning/comments/reviews; unreadable diffs; flaky reproducibility; ghost kernel state. “Run All” becomes ceremony—and a source of incidents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compliance drag</strong>: Audit trails, RBAC, data residency, PII egress checks, and access reviews get bolted on per team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compute waste</strong>: Idle kernels and full‑notebook re‑runs burn budgets; without a reactive dependency graph, every tweak reheats the whole pipeline.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI bolt‑ons</strong>: Chat helpers that can’t see state, can’t run tools, and can’t re‑run downstream safely; you end up owning fragile agent plumbing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Opportunity cost</strong>: Your best engineers ship platform fixes instead of features. The backlog grows while competitors move.</p></li></ul><h3>Real‑world TCO snapshots</h3><p><strong>Fintech, 50‑person data org (self‑hosted JupyterHub)</strong></p><ul><li><p>Platform: ~3 FTE (platform/SRE/security/enablement) ≈ <strong>$2.0M</strong> fully‑loaded over 3 years.</p></li><li><p>Glue: 14 custom extensions + 9 connectors maintained across repos; ~6 hrs/week/analyst on environment drift and re‑runs.</p></li><li><p>Incidents: 4 auth/secret‑rotation breakages per year; 2 post‑mortems tied to stale kernel state.</p></li><li><p>After adopting Deepnote format + reactive execution: <strong>35–45%</strong> fewer re‑runs; <strong>1.5 FTE</strong> reallocated to product work; <strong>~$180k/year</strong> infra savings from fewer idle kernels.</p></li></ul><p>This is also where skeptics usually jump in:</p><ul><li><p><strong>“But Jupyter is the standard.”</strong> <em>It was.</em> Standards stay standards only if they keep TCO low while meeting reality: mixed‑skill teams, CI, governance, and agents that lint, refactor, and re‑run.</p></li><li><p><strong>“Is this a marketing gimmick?”</strong><br>Hold us to the implementation: an <strong>open, human‑readable project</strong> you can diff and automate, <strong>round‑trippable</strong> with <code>.ipynb</code>, shaped in public by a very large community. That’s the opposite of lock‑in.</p></li><li><p><strong>“AI assistants don’t belong in notebooks.”</strong><br>They already work there—badly—when the substrate is wrong. With reactive blocks and explicit structure, agents become safe and useful instead of noisy.</p></li></ul><p>Your next data project shouldn’t start by typing “import numpy as np…”. It should start with the description of the problem and AI scaffolding the project for you.</p><img src="https://us-west-2.graphassets.com/AaDC4FvhQQq2MDrtSUqtMz/cmhkgikkc5kpq07n1v2yadaec" alt="Blogpost Image (2).png" title="Blogpost Image (2).png" width="3380" height="2308"><h2>What you get (at a glance)</h2><ul><li><p><strong>AI agents</strong> (single‑player authoring coming soon)</p></li><li><p><strong>One workspace</strong> for technical and non‑technical users together</p></li><li><p><strong>Seamless collaboration</strong>: native versioning, comments, reviews; <strong>human‑readable projects</strong> with clean diffs</p></li><li><p><strong>Blocks that go beyond code</strong>: SQL queries, Python/R code blocks, charts, tables, inputs (text/number/select/slider/date), file upload, buttons/actions, layout/app pages, reusable modules</p></li><li><p><strong>Beautiful apps:</strong> deploy your notebooks as interactive dashboards or data apps in a single click</p></li><li><p><strong>100+ native integrations</strong> with governed secrets</p></li><li><p><strong>Reactive execution</strong> so downstream blocks update automatically</p></li></ul><p>All of this is open and designed to work across your stack. While the best experience is in Deepnote, we’re backporting key pieces so you can use them in Jupyter, VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf.</p><img src="https://us-west-2.graphassets.com/AaDC4FvhQQq2MDrtSUqtMz/cmhkgk19n5lro07n1pqd0y136" alt="Blogpost Image (1).png" title="Blogpost Image (1).png" width="3380" height="2308"><p><strong>Why it matters (no fluff):</strong></p><ul><li><p>Spend engineering time on product — not platform plumbing. Deepnote gives you the core out of the box.</p></li><li><p>Fewer re‑runs and less compute waste (reactive graph)</p></li><li><p>Less glue code and secret sprawl (native integrations)</p></li><li><p>Faster reviews and cleaner audits (diff‑able projects, governed workspaces)</p></li><li><p>No lock‑in (open standard; export as <code>.ipynb</code> where and if you need it)</p></li><li><p>Pure developer experience and happiness. Having data workspace you're looking forward to open could be a night and day in dev productivity.</p></li></ul><h2>What we opened — in English, not a changelog</h2><p><strong>A notebook format ready for the next decade.</strong><br>Goodbye messy JSON with random metadata. Deepnote projects use a  human‑and AI-readable text file you can review in Git and automate in CI. It’s <strong>extensible for blocks of the future</strong> — not just code and markdown, but SQL, headings, bullet lists, charts, inputs, KPIs, and more. It’s also <strong>AI‑readable</strong>: explicit structure and dependencies so agents can safely reason, edit, and re‑run. And when you need it, <strong>portability</strong> is built in — round‑trip to <code>.ipynb</code> without lock‑in.</p><p><strong>A format without a lock-in</strong><br>You can move between <code>.ipynb</code> and the Deepnote format as needed. Keep your pipelines. Keep your habits. Keep your exit. We’re allergic to lock‑in because standards outlast companies.</p><p><strong>Reactive by default.</strong><br>Change a parameter, and downstream blocks update — like spreadsheets, except it’s your real analysis, not a shadow model. No more "Run All" and pray. This is how notebooks become apps, not demos.</p><p><strong>AI that understands your work, not just your prompt.</strong><br>Copilot helps you write SQL and Python <em>in context</em>. The next step is inevitable: <strong>a single‑player Agent</strong> that goes from a prompt to a whole notebook — code, queries, charts, inputs — then iterates as you nudge.</p><p>With open-sourcing Deepnote, we’re doing the responsible thing: <strong>supporting the community</strong> while opening the path forward. If you’re all‑in on classic notebooks, keep them — you can convert anytime for want sleeker UI, data integrations,&nbsp;and AI, SQL, and collaboration as first-class citizens. If you’re ready to move, you can bring your team with one simple command.</p><img src="https://us-west-2.graphassets.com/AaDC4FvhQQq2MDrtSUqtMz/cmhkgo8pe631k09lqe2ss3bty" alt="Blogpost Image.png" title="Blogpost Image.png" width="3380" height="2308"><h2>An open invitation</h2><p>With gratitude to Jupyter, we've built the Jupyter notebook for the AI era, and the enterprise context. In this spirit, we're building the open standard for AI notebooks, data dashboards and apps.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-post__body"> <blockquote><em>“Your code is your understanding of the problem you’re exploring. So it’s <strong>only when you have your code in your head</strong> that you really understand the problem.”</em> — <a href="https://paulgraham.com/head.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Paul Graham</a></blockquote><p>Software development only becomes <em>engineering</em> with <strong>understanding</strong>. Your ability to reason through your most challenging coding tasks is constrained by your mental model of how things work — in other words, how quickly and how well you <strong>onboard</strong> to any codebase for solving any problem. However most AI vibe coding tools are aimed at relieving you of that burden by reading → thinking → writing the code for you, <strong>increasing the separation from you and your code</strong>. This is fine for low value, commodity tasks, but absolutely unacceptable for the hard, sensitive, and high value work that defines real engineering.</p><p><strong>We all need more AI that turns your brain ON, not OFF.</strong></p><p>Today we are announcing <strong>Windsurf Codemaps</strong>, which are first-of-its-kind AI-annotated structured maps of your code, powered by <a href="https://cognition.ai/blog/swe-1-5">SWE-1.5</a> and Claude Sonnet 4.5. Building on our popular work from <a href="https://cognition.ai/blog/deepwiki">DeepWiki</a> and <a href="https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/ask-devin">Ask Devin</a>, Codemaps is the next step in hyper-contextualized codebase understanding, grounded in precise code navigation.</p><p><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/d1d8909494354ce8236620e1e57781ed2782a594-2232x1230.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/d1d8909494354ce8236620e1e57781ed2782a594-2232x1230.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><h2>Why Codemaps?</h2><p>Every engineering task — debugging, refactors, new features — starts with <em>understanding</em>. Great engineers aren’t just good at writing code; they’re good at <em>reading</em> it, building mental models that span files, layers, and systems.</p><p>But modern codebases are sprawling: hundreds of files, multiple services, dense abstractions. Based on own experience and deep conversations with our customers across the Fortune 500, even top engineers spend much of their deep-work time <em>finding</em> and <em>remembering</em> what matters.</p><p>It’s a huge tax on productivity:</p><ul><li>New engineers take <strong>3–9 months</strong> to fully ramp (<a href="https://hackernoon.com/engineer-onboarding-the-ugly-truth-about-ramp-up-time-7e323t9j?utm_source=chatgpt.com">estimates</a>) </li><li>Senior engineers lose <strong>5+ hours per week</strong> onboarding others (<a href="https://decode.agency/article/hidden-costs-hiring-in-house-developers/">source</a>) </li><li>Stripe found legacy maintenance to be the #1 drag on productivity on their customers (<a href="https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com#page=6.66">source</a>)</li></ul><p><strong>This is the frontier that AI coding tools haven’t yet solved.</strong> Onboarding isn’t even a onetime cost, you pay it every time you switch context and codebases. The faster and better you understand your codebase, the faster and better you’ll be able to fix it yourself, or prompt agents to do it.</p><p><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/aebd2028ee20ba20f3a43fdb70885f0a02178276-1345x905.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/aebd2028ee20ba20f3a43fdb70885f0a02178276-1345x905.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Until today, the standard approach by Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, and even Windsurf Cascade, was to have you ask questions of a generalist agent with access to your code in a typical chat experience. But those solutions don’t solve focused onboarding and strongly grounded navigation to onboard, debug, and better context engineer for your codebase.</p><p>At Cognition, we’ve been investing far more deeply in understanding:</p><ul><li><strong>Ask Devin</strong> <a href="https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/ask-devin">introduced</a> focused agents that reason through real codebases. </li><li><strong>DeepWiki</strong> <a href="https://cognition.ai/blog/deepwiki">made that reasoning transparent</a>, turning your repos into browsable, linked documentation.</li><li><strong>Windsurf</strong> <a href="https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/deepwiki">brought</a> these capabilities into the IDE.</li></ul><p>Codemaps is our next investment in tooling that makes engineers the best versions of themselves.</p><h2>Our solution: Just-in-Time mapping for any problem</h2><p>When you first open Codemaps (click the new maps icon or <strong>Cmd+Shift+C</strong> in Windsurf) with a codebase opened in Windsurf, you can enter in a prompt for the task you are trying to do, or take one of the automatic suggestions. You can choose a <strong>Fast</strong> (SWE-1.5) or <strong>Smart</strong> (Sonnet 4.5) model to generate your Codemap. Every Codemap is snapshots your code and respects ZDR.</p><p><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/8cbebdcf68b3099afbd2c9ea0196fcfc37ed339a-1080x510.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/8cbebdcf68b3099afbd2c9ea0196fcfc37ed339a-1080x510.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Based on our demos to customers, you will experience Codemaps best on your own codebase and asking a question about how or where some functionality works. In our dogfooding, we find particular effectiveness tracing through client-server problems or a data pipeline or debugging auth/security issues:</p><p><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/cbdd13ef52a6237d08d69d598ee8fbedcf7c7183-1116x2090.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/cbdd13ef52a6237d08d69d598ee8fbedcf7c7183-1116x2090.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>If all you wanted was to quickly jump through grouped and nested parts of your code that related to your question, this is already an improvement compared to asking the same question in Cascade, where answers are not as densely linked to the exact lines of code.</p><p>You can also toggle over to a visually drawn Codemap, which performs the same functions when you click on individual nodes: they send you to the exact part of the codebase you clicked on.</p><p><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/a10c9f829feb0566341b024f1bf6d26c4825a6b5-2848x2046.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/a10c9f829feb0566341b024f1bf6d26c4825a6b5-2848x2046.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>However, if you want a little more context, then you can hit “See more” in any section to expand our “trace guide” that gives a more descriptive explanation of what groups the discovered lines together.</p><p><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/57fa1bc99ab9afd5ac160c59576261c6217b1097-2536x1560.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/57fa1bc99ab9afd5ac160c59576261c6217b1097-2536x1560.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Finally, inside Cascade you can also reference a codemap for the agent with <code>@{codemap}</code> (all of it, or a particular subsection) in your prompt to provide more specific context and dramatically improve the performance of your agent for your task.</p><p><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/2558ea0c9dafe8c93810fc7ea2f2cf04f5a7dc8d-1594x2006.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/2558ea0c9dafe8c93810fc7ea2f2cf04f5a7dc8d-1594x2006.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><h2>Fight back against Vibeslop</h2><p>We feel that the popular usage of “vibe coding” has strayed far from the original intent, into a blanket endorsement of plowing through any and all AI generated code slop. If you look at the difference between the most productive vs the problematic AI-assisted coders, the productive ones can surf the vibes of code that they understand well, whereas <strong>people get into trouble when the code they generate and maintain starts to outstrip their ability to understand it</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/a0bfa8a930936a0bdadd1c771d46b4ec7df099db-1712x634.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2mc9cv2v/production/a0bfa8a930936a0bdadd1c771d46b4ec7df099db-1712x634.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p><strong>To understand is to be accountable.</strong> As AI takes on more of the easy work, the hard problems left to humans are the ones that demand real comprehension: debugging complex systems, refactoring legacy code, making architecture decisions. In this new era, <strong>the engineer’s role shifts from <em>authoring</em> to <em>accountability</em> — you might not write every line, but you’re still responsible for what ships.</strong> That accountability depends on understanding what the AI produced, why it changed, and whether it’s safe. Codemaps closes that gap by giving both the human and the AI a <em>shared picture</em> of the system: how it’s structured, how data flows, where dependencies live. Codemaps is our latest Fast Agent, but as we discussed in <a href="https://cognition.ai/blog/swe-grep#fast-context-as-the-first-step-to-fast-agents">the Semi-Async Valley of Death</a>, our goal isn't just about speed, it is to help your human engineers stay in flow, stay on top of their code, and to move faster and more confidently on the hardest problems, never shipping slop that they don't understand.</p><p><strong>Augment engineers for high value work, relieve them of low value work</strong>. The other local minima that the coding agent industry has gotten stuck in is in the general messaging of replacing engineers for low value work and not having any solutions for the hardest tasks apart from “pls ultrathink high, no mistakes”, which only gives autonomy to the agent, at the expense of the engineer. The long history of human-machine collaboration teaches us that we can always do more with the synergy rather than humans-alone or AI-alone. Our view is that the AI product that engineers will love most is the one that makes them better at their job, not the one that tries to replace them with a sloppy facsimile of themselves.</p><h2>What’s Next</h2><p>With Codemaps, we are now exposing to humans some of the indexing and analysis we do inside of our coding agents. These artifacts are sharable today across teams for learning and discussion, but we have yet to benchmark how much better they can make our coding agents like Devin and Cascade in solving challenging tasks on their own. We also see opportunities for connecting and annotating codemaps, as well as defining an open <code>.codemap</code> protocol that can be used by other code agents and custom tooling built by you. Complementing our <strong>Fast Context feature</strong>, this is an advancement in human-readable <strong>automatic context engineering</strong>.</p><p>You can try Codemaps on the latest versions of Windsurf, or DeepWiki!</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nest Thermostat Firmware Setup</h2><a id="user-content-nest-thermostat-firmware-setup" aria-label="Permalink: Nest Thermostat Firmware Setup" href="#nest-thermostat-firmware-setup"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This project is currently in the <strong>experimental/testing phase</strong>. Do NOT use this firmware on any thermostat that is critical for your heating or cooling needs. Flashing this firmware may brick your device or cause unexpected behavior. Only proceed if you have a backup thermostat or can afford to have your device non-functional during testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This directory contains the tools and firmware needed to flash custom firmware to Nest Thermostat devices using the OMAP DFU (Device Firmware Update) interface.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This firmware loader uses the OMAP bootloader interface to flash custom bootloader and kernel images to Nest Thermostat devices. The device must be put into DFU mode to accept new firmware.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Important:</strong> After flashing this firmware, your device will no longer contact Nest/Google servers. It will operate independently and connect to the NoLongerEvil platform instead, giving you complete control over your thermostat.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The custom firmware flashes the device with modified bootloader and kernel components that redirect all network traffic from the original Nest/Google servers to a server we specify. This server hosts a reverse-engineered replica of their API, allowing the thermostat to function independently while giving you complete control over your device data and settings.</p>
<p dir="auto">By intercepting the communication layer, the thermostat believes it's communicating with the official Nest infrastructure, but instead connects to the NoLongerEvil platform. This approach ensures full compatibility with the device's existing software while breaking free from Google's cloud dependency.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/11/04/youtube-ai-error-terminates-enderman-channel/">https://piunikaweb.com/2025/11/04/youtube-ai-error-terminates-enderman-channel/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45812901">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>A popular tech YouTuber with over 350,000 subscribers has lost his channel after YouTube’s automated systems flagged him for an alleged connection to a completely unrelated Japanese channel that received copyright strikes. Enderman, known for his Windows customization and tech experiment videos, says he has no association with the channel in question.</p>
<p>The termination email, <a href="https://x.com/endermanch/status/1985362817491623960" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared by Enderman on X</a>, stated that his secondary channel <em>“Andrew”</em> was permanently removed because it was <em>“linked to a channel that was terminated for having three or more Copyright strikes.”</em> The linked channel name appears in Japanese characters, which Enderman maintains he has zero connection to. The email went further, warning that his main channel would also face permanent termination unless the linked channel is reinstated.</p>
<p><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/youtube-enderman-channel-termination-notice.webp"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/youtube-enderman-channel-termination-notice.webp" alt="youtube-enderman-channel-termination-notice" width="600" height="1215" srcset="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/youtube-enderman-channel-termination-notice.webp 600w, https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/youtube-enderman-channel-termination-notice-148x300.webp 148w, https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/youtube-enderman-channel-termination-notice-506x1024.webp 506w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p><em>“This is the end of the line,”</em> Enderman said in a farewell video posted shortly before his main channel vanished entirely. <em>“My channel is soon to be terminated because my first channel is linked to my secondary channel.”</em> That video, originally posted to YouTube, has since disappeared along with his entire account. A backup remains on Odysee, an alternative video platform.</p>

<p>To no one’s surprise, this situation has got a lot of fans talking. One commenter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TechNope/comments/1onrd41/comment/nmzok5u/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">noted</a> they were literally watching Enderman’s video about the termination when his channel got banned mid-viewing. Others pointed out the irony of YouTube’s heavy reliance on AI moderation while simultaneously failing to address actual problems like scams and spam that plague the platform daily.</p>
<p>This isn’t Enderman’s first brush with YouTube’s moderation systems. Since 2021, he’s had <a href="https://archive.org/details/infinity-lock-ransomware-no-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple videos removed</a>, including tutorials on Windows activation and interactions with AI tools. However, this termination appears different in both scope and consequence.</p>
<p>YouTube’s appeal process involves submitting a form, but many creators report poor success rates with reinstatement requests. The platform <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13304829?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims</a> to use <em>“a combination of automated systems and human reviews”</em> for content decisions, though the balance seems heavily tilted toward automation.</p>
<p>Rival platform Odysee has already <a href="https://x.com/OdyseeHelp/status/1985379702475788482" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached out</a>, offering Enderman a home for his content.</p>
<p><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/odysee-enderman-post.webp"><img decoding="async" src="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/odysee-enderman-post.webp" alt="odysee-enderman-post" width="600" height="1082" srcset="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/odysee-enderman-post.webp 600w, https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/odysee-enderman-post-166x300.webp 166w, https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/odysee-enderman-post-568x1024.webp 568w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>Whether YouTube will reverse this decision remains uncertain, but the incident highlights growing concerns about algorithmic enforcement actions that can destroy creator livelihoods with little recourse.</p>
<p>That said, given the channel’s popularity and what appears to be a clear mix-up on YouTube’s part, it’s likely that the channel will be reinstated. We’ll post an update if and when there are any further developments.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>pg_lake</code> integrates Iceberg and data lake files into Postgres. With the <code>pg_lake</code> extensions, you can use Postgres as a stand-alone lakehouse system that supports transactions and fast queries on Iceberg tables, and can directly work with raw data files in object stores like S3.</p>
<p dir="auto">At a high level, <code>pg_lake</code> lets you:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Create and modify <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Iceberg</strong></a> tables directly from PostgreSQL, with full transactional guarantees and query them from other engines</li>
<li>Query and import data from <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Parquet</strong></a>, <strong>CSV</strong>, <strong>JSON</strong>, and <strong>Iceberg</strong> files stored in S3 or other compatible object stores</li>
<li>Export query results back to S3 in <strong>Parquet</strong>, <strong>CSV</strong>, or <strong>JSON</strong> formats using COPY commands</li>
<li>Read <strong>geospatial formats</strong> supported by GDAL, such as <strong>GeoJSON</strong> and <strong>Shapefiles</strong></li>
<li>Use compression transparently with <strong>.gz</strong> and <strong>.zst</strong></li>
<li>Use the built-in <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/pg_lake/blob/main/pg_map/README.md"><strong>map</strong> type</a> for semi-structured or key–value data</li>
<li>Combine <strong>heap</strong>, <strong>Iceberg</strong>, and external <strong>Parquet/CSV/JSON</strong> files in the same SQL queries and modifications — all with full transactional guarantees and no SQL limitations</li>
<li><strong>Infer table columns and types</strong> from external data sources such as <strong>Iceberg</strong>, <strong>Parquet</strong>, <strong>JSON</strong>, and <strong>CSV</strong> files</li>
<li><strong>Leverage DuckDB’s query engine</strong> underneath for fast execution without leaving Postgres</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Using Docker</strong>, for an easy, ready-to-run test environment.</li>
<li><strong>Building from source</strong>, for a manual setup or development use.</li>

<p dir="auto"><code>pgduck_server</code> is a standalone process that implements the Postgres wire-protocol (locally), and underneath uses <code>DuckDB</code> to execute queries.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you run <code>pgduck_server</code> it starts listening to port <code>5332</code> on unix domain socket:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgduck_server

<p dir="auto">As <code>pgduck_server</code> implements Postgres wire protocol, you can access it via <code>psql</code> on port <code>5332</code> and host <code>/tmp</code> and run commands via DuckDB.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, you can get the DuckDB version:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="psql -p 5332 -h /tmp

<li><code>--memory_limit</code>: Optionally specify the maximum memory of pgduck_server similar to DuckDB's memory_limit, the default is 80 percent of the system memory</li>
<li><code>--init_file_path &lt;path&gt;</code>: Execute all statements in this file on start-up</li>
<li><code>--cache_dir</code>: Specify the directory to use to cache remote files (from S3)</li>

<p dir="auto"><code>pgduck_server</code> relies on the DuckDB <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/configuration/secrets_manager" rel="nofollow">secrets manager</a> for credentials and it follows the credentials chain by default for AWS and GCP. Make sure your cloud credentials are configured properly — for example, by setting them in ~/.aws/credentials.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you set up the credential chain, you should set the <code>pg_lake_iceberg.default_location_prefix</code>. This is the location where Iceberg tables are stored:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h2><a id="user-content-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Architecture" href="#architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A <code>pg_lake</code> instance consists of two main components: <strong>PostgreSQL with the pg_lake extensions</strong> and <strong>pgduck_server</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Users connect to PostgreSQL to run SQL queries, and the <code>pg_lake</code> extensions integrate with Postgres’s hooks to handle query planning, transaction boundaries, and overall orchestration of execution.</p>
<p dir="auto">Behind the scenes, <em>parts</em> of query execution are delegated to DuckDB through pgduck_server, a separate multi-threaded process that implements the PostgreSQL wire protocol (locally).  This process runs DuckDB together with our <strong>duckdb_pglake</strong> extension, which adds PostgreSQL-compatible functions and behavior.</p>
<p dir="auto">Users typically don’t need to be aware of <code>pgduck_server</code>; it operates transparently to improve performance. When appropriate, <code>pg_lake</code> delegates scanning of the data and the computation to DuckDB’s highly parallel, column-oriented execution engine.</p>
<p dir="auto">This separation also avoids the threading and memory-safety limitations that would arise from embedding DuckDB directly inside the Postgres process, which is designed around process isolation rather than multi-threaded execution. Moreover, it lets us interact with the query engine directly by connecting to it using standard Postgres clients.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/pg_lake/blob/main/pglake-arch.png"><img src="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/pg_lake/raw/main/pglake-arch.png" alt="pg_lake Architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Components</h3><a id="user-content-components" aria-label="Permalink: Components" href="#components"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The team behind pg_lake has a lot of experience building Postgres extensions (e.g. Citus, pg_cron, pg_documentdb). Over time, we’ve learned that large, monolithic PostgreSQL extensions are harder to evolve and maintain.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>pg_lake</code> follows a modular design built around a <strong>set of interoperating components</strong> — mostly implemented as PostgreSQL extensions, others as supporting services or libraries.<br>
Each part focuses on a well-defined layer, such as table and metadata management, catalog and object store integration, query execution, or data format handling.  This approach makes it easier to extend, test, and evolve the system, while keeping it familiar to anyone with a PostgreSQL background.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current set of components are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>pg_lake_iceberg</strong>: a PostgreSQL extension that implements the <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Iceberg specification</a></li>
<li><strong>pg_lake_table</strong>: a PostgreSQL extension that implements a foreign data wrapper to query files in object storage</li>
<li><strong>pg_lake_copy</strong>: a PostgreSQL extension that implements COPY to/from your data lake</li>
<li><strong>pg_lake_engine</strong>: a common module for different pg_lake extensions</li>
<li><strong>pg_extension_base</strong>: A foundational building block for other extensions</li>
<li><strong>pg_extension_updater</strong>: An extension for updating all extensions on start-up. See <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/pg_lake/blob/main/pg_extension_updater/README.md">README.md</a>.</li>
<li><strong>pg_lake_benchmark</strong>: a PostgreSQL extension that performs various benchmarks on lake tables. See <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/pg_lake/blob/main/pg_lake_benchmark/README.md">README.md</a>.</li>
<li><strong>pg_map</strong>: A generic map type generator</li>
<li><strong>pgduck_server</strong>: a stand-alone server that loads DuckDB into the same server machine and exposes DuckDB via the PostgreSQL protocol</li>
<li><strong>duckdb_pglake</strong>: a DuckDB extension that adds missing PostgreSQL functions to DuckDB</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto"><code>pg_lake</code> development started in early 2024 at <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/" rel="nofollow">Crunchy Data</a> with the goal of bringing Iceberg to PostgreSQL. The first few months were focused on building a robust integration of an external query engine (DuckDB). To get to market early, we made the query/import/export features available to <a href="https://docs.crunchybridge.com/" rel="nofollow">Crunchy Bridge</a> customers as <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/crunchy-bridge-for-analytics-your-data-lake-in-postgresql" rel="nofollow">Crunchy Bridge for Analytics</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Next, we started building a comprehensive implementation of the Iceberg (v2) protocol with support for transactions and almost all PostgreSQL features. In November 2024, we relaunched Crunchy Bridge for Analytics as Crunchy Data Warehouse available on Crunchy Bridge and on-premises.</p>
<p dir="auto">In June 2025, <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/crunchy-data-joins-snowflake" rel="nofollow">Crunchy Data was acquired by Snowflake</a>. Following the acquisition, Snowflake decided to open source the project as <code>pg_lake</code> in November 2025. The initial version is 3.0 because of the two prior generations. If you’re currently a Crunchy Data Warehouse user there will be an automatic upgrade path, though some names will change.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://512kb.club/">https://512kb.club/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45812499">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>The internet has become a <b>bloated mess</b>. Huge JavaScript libraries, countless client-side queries and overly complex frontend frameworks are par for the course these days.</p>

<p>When popular website like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a> are <strong><a href="https://512kb.club/assets/images/nytimes-report.pdf">multiple MB in size</a></strong> (nearly 50% of which is JavaScript!), you know there’s a problem. Why does any site need to be that huge? It’s crazy.</p>

<p>But we can make a difference - all it takes is some optimisation. Do you really need that extra piece of JavaScript? Does your WordPress site need a theme that adds lots of functionality you’re never going to use? Are those huge custom fonts really needed? Are your images optimised for the web?</p>

<p><strong>The 512KB Club</strong> is a collection of performance-focused web pages from across the Internet. To qualify your website must satisfy <strong>both</strong> of the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It must be an actual site that contains a reasonable amount of information, not just a couple of links on a page (<a href="https://512kb.club/faq/#lightweight-notice">more info here</a>).</li>
  <li>Your total UNCOMPRESSED web resources must not exceed 512KB.</li>
</ol>

<div>
    <p><b><span>Help support the 512KB Club</span></b></p><p>
    It takes a lot of work to run the 512KB Club. We rely on the kind work of a couple of great volunteers. If you want to support the 512KB Club, please do think about <a target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/kevquirk">buying us a coffee</a>.

<p id="982d30c8-920e-44c9-a5e7-28a993d36e27">The DRAM supply chain is choking, and server memory is taking the first hit. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20251028PD216/dram-chip-shortage-price-market-demand.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20251028PD216/dram-chip-shortage-price-market-demand.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>, major U.S. and Chinese hyperscalers are now receiving just 70% of the server DRAM they order. That’s despite agreeing to contract price increases of up to 50% for Q4, well above the 30% hike many buyers had budgeted for earlier this year.</p><p>Naturally, AI sits at the core of all this. While it’s HBM that gets the headlines, demand for conventional DDR5 RDIMMs is also outpacing supply, particularly at advanced nodes where Samsung and SK hynix have diverted capacity toward parts bound for AI acceleration. Samsung’s recent pricing adjustments confirm the reprioritization, with the company having raised server SSD prices by up to 35% and RDIMM contract rates by as much as 50%, citing sustained demand from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise">enterprise</a> and cloud customers.</p><p>Micron warned of this in its most recent earnings call, telling investors that DRAM is a “tight industry” and that bit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/perfect-storm-of-demand-and-supply-driving-up-storage-costs" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/perfect-storm-of-demand-and-supply-driving-up-storage-costs">supply growth will lag demand</a> through the end of next year. <em>TrendForce </em>also flagged a potential quote freeze across certain modules, as suppliers shift to day-to-day pricing in China and avoid locking themselves into bad deals.</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" id="4254532c-686f-4524-9710-3244ed52d8ba" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

<p id="ec895d5d-0681-4898-8327-d4968aee804c">This week in 1988, Cornell graduate student Robert Tappan Morris unleashed his eponymous worm upon the Internet. The wave of infections grew to 10% of the entire Internet within 24 hours, causing astronomically expensive damage for the time. However, the pioneering Morris worm malware wasn’t made with malice, says an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/morris-worm-30-years-since-first-major-attack-on-internet-110218" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/morris-worm-30-years-since-first-major-attack-on-internet-110218" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">FBI retrospective</a> on the “programming error.” It was designed to gauge the size of the Internet, resulting in a classic case of unintended consequences.</p><h2 id="morris-worm-dissection-3">Morris worm dissection</h2><p id="12016e19-4b04-4b61-ac13-8efec758e3b0">Known to be something of a prankster, Morris must have felt some foreboding about releasing his ‘innocent’ program into the wild. Evidence of this comes from his release method. “He released it by hacking into an MIT computer from his Cornell terminal in Ithaca, New York,” according to the FBI.</p><p id="12016e19-4b04-4b61-ac13-8efec758e3b0-1">The Morris worm was written in C and targeted BSD <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-3d-linux,225-7.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-3d-linux,225-7.html">UNIX </a>systems, like VAX and Sun-3 machines. Specifically, the FBI writes, it “exploited a backdoor in the Internet’s electronic mail system and a bug in the ‘finger’ program that identified network users.” In contrast to computer viruses, the worm Morris had devised had no need of a host program, but could self-replicate and spread autonomously.</p><p>Thankfully, the Morris worm wasn’t written to cause damage to files. Due to those unintended consequences, though, it precipitated massive slowdowns, and messaging delays and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/new-windows-11-feature-aims-to-diagnose-crashes-will-check-ram-after-bsods-to-look-for-problems" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/new-windows-11-feature-aims-to-diagnose-crashes-will-check-ram-after-bsods-to-look-for-problems">system crashes</a> were common symptoms. It became a computer news sensation in the worst possible way. Just to get rid of the worm in a timely fashion, some institutions ended up wiping complete systems and unplugging networks for as long as a week.</p><p>Among the Morris worm's casualties were prestigious institutions such as Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nasa-hacks-its-supercomputing-way-through-intel-amd-parts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nasa-hacks-its-supercomputing-way-through-intel-amd-parts">NASA</a>, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="1b3180a3-57e9-44f6-8c4e-4d96673113ba"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

He was indicted under the rather freshly inked Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. After a court appearance for his misdemeanors in 1989, Morris ended up not with jail time, but with a fine, probation, and 400 hours of community service to complete.</p><h2 id="computer-worms-have-been-around-longer-than-the-world-wide-web-3">Computer worms have been around longer than the World Wide Web</h2><p id="a036e5b8-24ac-4c61-af88-984e6dfdd24c">Back in November 1988, the Internet bore little resemblance to what it is today. For example, the World Wide Web (WWW) wasn’t even a thing. Though the WWW would soon form the core experience for the first tide of surfers in the 90s.</p><p>At the time, the Internet’s backbone was the NSFNET, the recent successor to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/this-week-in-1969-the-internet-was-born-and-immediately-glitched-only-two-of-the-five-letters-in-the-first-computer-to-computer-message-were-received" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/this-week-in-1969-the-internet-was-born-and-immediately-glitched-only-two-of-the-five-letters-in-the-first-computer-to-computer-message-were-received">ARPANET</a>. Its purpose was mostly to expand the prior backbone’s reach beyond military and defense institutions, and it more broadly embraced academia. While we are here, it is worth mentioning that NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, and succeeded by the commercial Internet, which emerged in the 1990s off the back of private ISPs and commercial backbones.</p><p>So, when we talk about 10% of the Internet being paralyzed by the Morris Worm, contemporary estimates are that about 6,000 of the approximately 60,000 connected systems were infected and impacted. Moreover, when we highlighted the potentially massive costs of this first worm propagating, estimates range from $100,000 to millions of dollars.</p><p>Computer worms have remained a scary phenomenon in recent times. For example, we reported on the first-generation AI worm, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/ai-worm-infects-users-via-ai-enabled-email-clients-morris-ii-generative-ai-worm-steals-confidential-data-as-it-spreads" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/ai-worm-infects-users-via-ai-enabled-email-clients-morris-ii-generative-ai-worm-steals-confidential-data-as-it-spreads">Morris II generative AI worm,</a> last year.</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" id="4f48f12a-aa58-40dc-96ac-eb5433a4af6b" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The founder of a service that manages SSL certificates says Google Cloud has suspended his account three times, without good reason, and recommended not using the G-Cloud for serious workloads.</p>
<p>In a Monday <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again">post</a>, Andrew Ayer, founder of SSLMate, explains that his company uses Google Cloud for “testing and experimentation,” but mostly “to enable integrations with our customers' Google Cloud accounts so that we can publish certificate validation DNS records and discover domain names to monitor on their behalf.”</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2021/05/25/shutterstock_fail.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="team fail"></p><h2 title="That pesky 'previously unknown software bug' strikes again">Google Cloud blunder sinks Australian fund for a week</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/08/google_cloud_misconfiguration_takes_australian/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>“We create a service account for each customer under our Google Cloud project, and ask the customer to authorize this service account to access Cloud DNS and Cloud Domains,” Ayer wrote. “When SSLMate needs to access a customer's Google Cloud account, it impersonates the corresponding service account.”</p>
<p>Ayer said he developed this system based on a suggestion in Google Cloud’s own <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13463817?sjid=3625613075585023337-NA#zippy=%2Chow-can-i-access-data-from-my-users-google-cloud-project-using-cloud-apis">documentation</a> on how to use cloud APIs. He says it “works really well” and is “both very easy for the customer to configure, and secure: there are no long-lived credentials or confused deputy vulnerabilities.”</p>
<p>When it works.</p>

    

<p>The first time it broke was in May 2024, when Ayer tried to log in and saw a message stating he had used Google Cloud in a way that violated the company’s policies. His post explains the “super frustrating” effort required to restore access, as Google asked him to provide information that was only accessible if he logged in – while the web giant prevented him from logging in.</p>

        


        

<p>Ayer managed to partially restore access, but was then told Google had again restricted his account – this time for a different reason.</p>
<p>Google later restored access.</p>

        

<p>“I was never told why our account was suspended or what could be done to prevent it from happening again,” he wrote, adding that Google never sent emails notifying him of the suspension. He therefore wrote a health check to warn him if SSLMate’s customer integrations failed.</p>

</ul>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, in late October, that health check failed because all customer integrations were down as Google had again flagged them as violating its policies. This time, restoration was swift, helped by the fact Ayer had access to information he knew Google support would require to act on his complaints.</p>
<p>Last Friday, Google suspended SSLMate’s account again. Ayer says Google offered a new reason for its actions: A terms of service violation.</p>
<p>He appealed and two days later received “an automated email stating that SSLMate's access to Google Cloud was now <i>completely</i> suspended.” He shared his story on social media, and Google restored his services.</p>
<p>It gets weirder, because the suspensions didn’t impact all of SSLMate’s customer integrations.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I cannot rely on having a Google account for production use cases</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Incredibly, we have one lucky customer whose integration has continued to work during every suspension, even though it uses a service account in the same suspended project as all the other customer integrations,” Ayer wrote.</p>
<p>He now thinks SSLMate needs to ditch Google Cloud.</p>

        

<p>“Clearly, I cannot rely on having a Google account for production use cases,” he wrote. “Google has built a complex, unreliable system in which some or all of the following can be suspended: an entire Google account, a Google Cloud Platform account, or individual Google Cloud projects.”</p>
<p>His post outlines a potential workaround for his Google problem by using OpenID Connect (OIDC), but feels the web giant has made that fix “unnecessarily difficult.”</p>
<p>Ayer is frustrated.</p>
<p>“I find this state of affairs unacceptable, because it's really, really important to move away from long-lived credentials and Google ought to be doing everything possible to encourage more secure alternatives,” he wrote. “Sadly, SSLMate's current solution of provider-created service accounts is susceptible to arbitrary account suspensions, and OIDC is hampered by an unnecessarily complicated setup process.” ®</p>

A running example in the paper is to define a graph with a relation named </span><code>edge</code><span>:</span></p><pre><code>Edge(0, 1)
Edge(1, 3)
Edge(0, 2)</code></pre><p><span>A relation can also be implicitly defined with a set of rules.  The paper uses the </span><code>Same Generation (SG)</code><span> relation as an example:</span></p><pre><code>1: SG(x, y) &lt;- Edge(p, x), Edge(p, y), x != y
2: SG(x, y) &lt;- Edge(a, x), SG(a, b), Edge(b, y), x != y</code></pre><p><span>Rule 1 states that two vertices (</span><code>x</code><span> and </span><code>y</code><span>) are part of the same generation if they both share a common ancestor (</span><code>p</code><span>), and they are not actually the same vertex (</span><code>x != y</code><span>).  </span></p><p><span>Rule 2 states that two vertices (</span><code>x</code><span> and </span><code>y</code><span>) are part of the same generation if they have ancestors (</span><code>a</code><span> and </span><code>b</code><span>) from the same generation.</span></p><p>“Running a Datalog program” entails evaluating all rules until a fixed point is reached (no more tuples are added).</p><p><span>One key idea to internalize is that evaluating a Datalog rule is equivalent to performing a SQL join.  For example, rule 1 is equivalent to joining the </span><code>Edge</code><span> relation with itself, using </span><code>p</code><span> as the join key, and </span><code>(x != y)</code><span> as a filter.</span></p><p><em>Semi-naïve Evaluation</em><span> is an algorithm for performing these joins until convergence, while not wasting too much effort on redundant work.  The tuples in a relation are put into three buckets:</span></p><ol><li><p><code>new</code><span>: holds tuples that were discovered on the current iteration</span></p></li><li><p><code>delta:</code><span> holds tuples which were added in the previous iteration</span></p></li><li><p><code>full</code><span>: holds all tuples that have been found in any iteration</span></p></li></ol><p><span>For a join involving two relations (</span><code>A</code><span> and </span><code>B</code><span>), </span><code>new</code><span> is computed as the union of the result of 3 joins:</span></p><ol><li><p><code>delta(A)</code><span> joined with </span><code>full(B)</code></p></li><li><p><code>full(A)</code><span> joined with </span><code>delta(B)</code></p></li><li><p><code>delta(A)</code><span> joined with </span><code>delta(B)</code></p></li></ol><p><span>The key fact for performance is that </span><code>full(A)</code><span> is never joined with </span><code>full(B)</code><span>.</span></p><p><span>More details on Semi-naïve Evaluation can be found in </span><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~paris/cs838-s16/lecture-notes/lecture8.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">these notes</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>This paper introduces the </span><em>hash-indexed sorted array</em><span> for storing relations while executing Semi-naïve Evaluation on a GPU.  It seems to me like this data structure would work well on other chips too.  Fig. 2 illustrates the data structure (join keys are in red):</span></p><p><span>The </span><em>data array</em><span> holds the actual tuple data.  It is densely packed in row-major order.</span></p><p><span>The </span><em>sorted index array</em><span> holds pointers into the data array (one pointer per tuple).  These pointers are lexicographically sorted (join keys take higher priority in the sort).</span></p><p><span>The </span><em>hash table</em><span> is an open-addressed hash table which maps a hash of the join keys to the first element in the sorted index array that contains those join keys.</span></p><p><span>A join of relations A and </span><code>B</code><span>, can be implemented with the following pseudo-code:</span></p><pre><code>for each tuple 'a' in the sorted index array of A:

  lookup (hash table) the first tuple in B which has matching join keys to 'a'

  iterate over all tuples in the sorted index array of B with matching keys</code></pre><p>Memory accesses when probing through the sorted index array are coherent.  Memory accesses when accessing the data array are coherent up to the number of elements in a tuple.</p><p><span>Table 3 compares the results from this paper (GPULog) against a state-of-the-art CPU implementation (Soufflé).  HIP represents GPULog ported to AMD’s </span><a href="https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/tree/develop/projects/hip" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">HIP</a><span> runtime and then run on the same Nvidia GPU.</span></p><p>The data structure and algorithms described by this paper seem generic, it would be interesting to see them run on other chips (FPGA, DPU, CPU, HPC cluster).  </p><p>I would guess most of GPULog is bound by memory bandwidth, not compute.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div>  <p>October is in the bag, and we merged 217 PRs from 43 contributors. Let’s look at some highlights!</p>

<p>Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we’re excited to welcome the following new sponsors:</p>
<ul> 
<li> <a href="https://axept.io/">Axeptio</a> with $10,000 (<a href="https://www.axept.io/blog/ladybird-open-web">their announcement</a>) </li>
<li> <a href="https://gravwell.io/">Gravwell</a> with $5,000 </li>
 </ul>
<p>We’re incredibly grateful for their support. If you’re interested in sponsoring the project, please <a href="mailto:contact@ladybird.org">contact us</a>.</p>
<h3 id="web-platform-tests-wpt"> Web Platform Tests (WPT) </h3>
<p>We’ve continued to make solid progress on <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">WPT</a> this month. There has been a significant
increase in passing subtests, with <strong> 111,431 </strong> new passing subtests bringing our total to <strong> 1,964,649 </strong>.</p>
<p>The majority of this increase comes from a large update to the test suite itself, with <strong> 100,751 </strong> subtests being added -
mainly due to the Wasm core tests being updated to Wasm 3.0.</p>
<p>This bump has seen us pass over 90% of all WPT subtests for the first time! An important milestone, as this is one of
the criteria Apple uses to determine eligibility for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines/">alternative browser engines on iOS</a>.</p>
<p>For context, here are the current top 6 browser engines and their WPT scores today vs. one month ago.</p>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-wpt.gif" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="http-disk-cache"> HTTP disk cache </h3>
<p>Last month, we enabled our in-memory HTTP cache. This cache lives in a single WebContent process, and does not persist
across browser restarts.</p>
<p>We’ve now begun work on a persistent disk cache! (PRs <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6435">#6435</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6487">#6487</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6579">#6579</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6645">#6645</a>). This provides a second layer of caching, which will
make visits to the same websites much faster.</p>
<h3 id="performance-work"> Performance work </h3>
<p>We’ve made a number of performance improvements this month. Some examples:</p>
<ul> 
<li> JS string performance optimizations (PRs <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6396">#6396</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6400">#6400</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6401">#6401</a>) </li>
<li> JS object property assignment optimization (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6413">#6413</a>) </li>
<li> Inline caching for JS object property access in C++ (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6474">#6474</a>) </li>
<li> Faster add/subtract/multiply of two Int32 values when result overflows (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6414">#6414</a>) </li>
<li> Ignore repaints inside iframes with <code>visibility: hidden</code> (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6555">#6555</a>) </li>
<li> Discard heavy UTF-32 buffers after parsing HTML (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6561">#6561</a>) </li>
 </ul>
<h3 id="trusted-types-in-the-dom"> Trusted Types in the DOM </h3>
<p>Continuing work from previous months, Trusted Types support was added to several DOM APIs:</p>
<ul> 
<li> <code>HTMLIFrameElement</code>: <code>srcdoc</code> </li>
<li> <code>Element</code>: <code>setAttribute</code>, <code>setAttributeNS</code>, <code>setHTMLUnsafe</code>, <code>innerHTML</code>, <code>outerHTML</code>, and <code>insertAdjacentHTML</code> </li>
<li> <code>Document</code>: <code>write</code>, <code>writeln</code>, and <code>parseHTMLUnsafe</code> </li>
<li> <code>ShadowRoot</code>: <code>setHTMLUnsafe</code> and <code>innerHTML</code> </li>
<li> <code>DOMParser</code>: <code>parseFromString</code> </li>
<li> <code>Range</code>: <code>createContextualFragment</code> </li>
<li> <code>Worker</code>, <code>SharedWorker</code>, and <code>ServiceWorker</code> constructors </li>
 </ul>
<p>(PRs <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6057">#6057</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6424">#6424</a>)</p>
<h3 id="initial-support-for-xpath-evaluations"> Initial support for XPath evaluations </h3>
<p>Some basic support for <code>XPathEvaluator</code>, <code>XPathExpression</code>, <code>XPathResult</code>, <code>XPathNSResolver</code>, and <code>Document.evaluate</code> was added this month.</p>
<p>It uses <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2">libxml2</a> under the hood to run XPath evaluations on an XML tree compatible with the library that is created from our parsed XML tree. (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6342">#6342</a>)</p>
<p>This is a short-term solution to bring initial support to these classes, because there are differences between the DOM and XML implementations of XPath that are not possible to work around with libxml2.</p>
<p>This enables the <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> library to work in Ladybird:</p>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-xpath-htmx.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="audiovideo-synchronization-multi-track-support"> Audio/Video synchronization, multi-track support </h3>
<p>Previously, our media playback implementation relied on separate, unrelated audio and video playback systems to play media files where both are present. This meant that it was possible for audio and video to desynchronize very easily, especially when their seeking behavior was inconsistent.</p>
<p>That implementation has now been replaced with a single new system that controls audio and video playback together, ensuring they remain in sync at all times. (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6410">#6410</a>)</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-av-playback.mp4"></video>
<p>As part of this reimplementation, several aspects of playback have improved:</p>
<ul> 
<li> Seeking is done asynchronously, and can therefore complete much faster. Scrubbing the timeline now previews the new playback position instantly, instead of waiting for the mouse button to be released. </li>
<li> Media elements now support the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/audioTracks">audioTracks</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/videoTracks">videoTracks</a> properties, which allow scripts to interact with multiple audio or video tracks in a file, toggling them at will. The playback system mixes any enabled audio tracks into one output. </li>
<li> The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/fastSeek">fastSeek()</a> function now follows spec with regard to seeking forward when the target is later than the current position. </li>
 </ul>
<h3 id="pinch-to-zoom-support"> Pinch-to-zoom support </h3>
<p>Ladybird now supports pinch-to-zoom on macOS (AppKit UI). The <code>VisualViewport</code> API exposes the zoom transform.</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-pinch-to-zoom.mp4"></video>
<h3 id="accessibility-devtools"> Accessibility DevTools </h3>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-a11y-devtools.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Since switching away from our own inspector to using Firefox’s developer tools, we’ve been missing a few features. This month we reimplemented inspection of the accessibility tree - a structure parallel to the usual
element tree that represents how tools like screen readers see the page. We don’t yet support such tools, but being able
to examine what’s going on inside Ladybird will make that easier. (PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6462">#6462</a>)</p>
<h3 id="css-typed-om-progress"> CSS Typed OM progress </h3>
<p>Continuing from last month, we’re still working on the CSS Typed OM API, which allows authors to get and set style
properties using objects instead of strings. Ladybird now supports setting style with most types of <code>CSSStyleValue</code>.
(PRs <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6370">#6370</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6378">#6378</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6440">#6440</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6466">#6466</a>)</p>
<h3 id="sibling-count-and-sibling-index"> <code>sibling-count()</code> and <code>sibling-index()</code> </h3>
<p>These are relatively new CSS functions that enable authors to style or animate elements differently depending on how
many siblings they have and where they appear in that list.
This month we implemented support for these. (PRs <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6426">#6426</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6526">#6526</a>)</p>
<h3 id="css-and-svg-gradients"> CSS and SVG gradients </h3>
<p>This month we’ve improved support for both CSS repeating linear gradients and SVG gradients with coordinates expressed
in <code>objectBoundingBox</code> units. This results in many such gradients looking crisper and more correct! (PRs
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6533">6533</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6592">6592</a>)</p>
<h3 id="canvaspattern"> CanvasPattern </h3>
<p>We had preliminary support in place for <code>CanvasPattern</code>, a way to create an image pattern based on an arbitrary image
source such as a canvas, an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or even a video frame. We did not actually use this pattern in drawing commands
though, causing some significant graphical artifacts. We do now, which causes the background on
<a href="https://slither.io/">slither.io</a> to finally render correctly!
(PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6548">#6548</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-slither-io.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="improved-webgl2-buffer-support"> Improved WebGL2 buffer support </h3>
<p>We’ve improved support for the WebGL2 <code>.readPixels()</code> method and implemented the <code>.getBufferSubData()</code> method, which
are used to transfer pixel data between arbitrary buffers by libraries such as <a href="https://sparkjs.dev/">SparkJS</a>. (PR
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6637">#6637</a>)</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-sparkjs.mp4"></video>
<h3 id="improved-offscreen-webgl-framebuffer-support"> Improved offscreen WebGL framebuffer support </h3>
<p>An issue with offscreen framebuffers being cleared after frame presentation caused the demo on the <a href="https://pixijs.com/">PixiJS homepage</a> not to display the masked/warped image of stars/nebulae. This has been fixed, so the demo appears correctly now:</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-pixijs-home.mp4"></video>
<h3 id="webgl-progress-on-google-maps"> WebGL progress on Google Maps </h3>
<p>There were some targeted WebGL fixes for Google Maps Globe View, including:</p>
<ul> 
<li> Respecting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/pixelStorei">UNPACK_FLIP_Y_WEBGL</a> </li>
<li> Returning null for missing uniforms instead of -1 </li>
<li> Calculating the correct pitch for 16-bit textures </li>
 </ul>
<p>This resulted in far fewer visual issues in Globe View; the sky still does not render and remains the biggest outstanding issue.</p>

<p>(PR <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6558">#6558</a>)</p>
<h3 id="progress-on-windows-support"> Progress on Windows support </h3>
<p>While Windows support is not the focus for the alpha release in 2026, the community has continued to improve it.</p>
<p>This month, Ladybird ran on Windows for the first time:</p>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-windows-https-request.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here’s the Gamepad API working on Windows as well:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Standing in the middle of a field, we can easily forget that we live on a round planet. We’re so small in comparison to the Earth that from our point of view, it looks flat.</p>
<p>The world is full of such shapes — ones that look flat to an ant living on them, even though they might have a more complicated global structure. Mathematicians call these shapes manifolds. Introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-19th century, manifolds transformed how mathematicians think about space. It was no longer just a physical setting for other mathematical objects, but rather an abstract, well-defined object worth studying in its own right.</p>
<p>This new perspective allowed mathematicians to rigorously explore higher-dimensional spaces — leading to the birth of modern topology, a field dedicated to the study of mathematical spaces like manifolds. Manifolds have also come to occupy a central role in fields such as geometry, dynamical systems, data analysis and physics.</p>
<p>Today, they give mathematicians a common vocabulary for solving all sorts of problems. They’re as fundamental to mathematics as the alphabet is to language. “If I know Cyrillic, do I know Russian?” said <a href="https://people.cs.dm.unipi.it/bianchi/">Fabrizio Bianchi</a>, a mathematician at the University of Pisa in Italy. “No. But try to learn Russian without learning Cyrillic.”</p>
<p>So what are manifolds, and what kind of vocabulary do they provide?</p>
<h2><strong>Ideas Taking Shape</strong></h2>
<p>For millennia, geometry meant the study of objects in Euclidean space, the flat space we see around us. “Until the 1800s, ‘space’ meant ‘physical space,’” said José Ferreirós, a philosopher of science at the University of Seville in Spain — the analogue of a line in one dimension, or a flat plane in two dimensions.</p>
<p>In Euclidean space, things behave as expected: The shortest distance between any two points is a straight line. A triangle’s angles add up to 180 degrees. The tools of calculus are reliable and well defined.</p>
<p>But by the early 19th century, some mathematicians had started exploring other kinds of geometric spaces — ones that aren’t flat but rather curved like a sphere or saddle. In these spaces, parallel lines might eventually intersect. A triangle’s angles might add up to more or less than 180 degrees. And doing calculus can become a lot less straightforward.</p>
<p>The mathematical community struggled to accept (or even understand) this shift in geometric thinking.</p>
<p>But some mathematicians wanted to push these ideas even further. One of them was Bernhard Riemann, a shy young man who had originally planned to study theology — his father was a pastor — before being drawn to mathematics. In 1849, he decided to pursue his doctorate under the tutelage of Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had been studying the intrinsic properties of curves and surfaces, independent of the space surrounding them.</p>

<p>In 1854, Riemann was required to deliver a lecture to secure a teaching position at the University of Göttingen. His assigned topic: the foundations of geometry. On June 10, despite a fear of public speaking, he described a new theory in which he generalized Gauss’ ideas about the geometry of surfaces to an arbitrary number of dimensions (and even to infinite dimensions).</p>
<p>Gauss was immediately impressed with the lecture, which involved not just math but also philosophy and physics. But most mathematicians found Riemann’s ideas too vague and abstract to be of much use. “Many scientists and philosophers were saying, ‘This is nonsense,’” Ferreirós said. And so, for decades, the work was largely ignored. Riemann’s lecture didn’t appear in print until 1868, two years after his death.</p>
<p>But by the end of the 19th century, mathematical greats like Henri Poincaré had recognized the importance of Riemann’s ideas. And in 1915, Albert Einstein used them in his general theory of relativity, bringing them out of the realm of philosophical abstraction and into the real world. By the middle of the 20th century, they had become a mathematical staple.</p>
<p>Riemann had introduced a concept that could encompass all possible geometries, in any number of dimensions. A concept that would change how mathematicians view space.</p>
<p>A manifold.</p>
<h2><strong>Charted Territory</strong></h2>
<p>The term “manifold” comes from Riemann’s <em>Mannigfaltigkeit</em>, which is German for “variety” or “multiplicity.”</p>
<p>A manifold is a space that looks Euclidean when you zoom in on any one of its points. For instance, a circle is a one-dimensional manifold. Zoom in anywhere on it, and it will look like a straight line. An ant living on the circle will never know that it’s actually round. But zoom in on a figure eight, right at the point where it crosses itself, and it will never look like a straight line. The ant will realize at that intersection point that it’s not in a Euclidean space. A figure eight is therefore not a manifold.</p>
<p>Similarly, in two dimensions, the surface of the Earth is a manifold; zoom in far enough anywhere on it, and it’ll look like a flat 2D plane. But the surface of a double cone — a shape consisting of two cones connected at their tips — is not a manifold.</p>

<p>Manifolds address a problem that mathematicians would otherwise have to deal with: A shape’s properties can change depending on the nature and dimension of the space it lives in (and how it sits in that space). For instance, lay a piece of string on a table, and connect its ends without lifting it. You’ll get a simple loop. Now hold the string in the air and tie its ends together. By considering the string in three dimensions, you can pass it over and under itself before you connect the ends, creating all sorts of knots beyond the simple loop. They all represent the same one-dimensional manifold — the looped string — but they have different properties when considered in two versus three dimensions.</p>
<p>Mathematicians avoid such ambiguities by focusing on the manifold’s intrinsic properties. The defining property of manifolds — that at any point, they look Euclidean — is immensely helpful on that front. Because it’s possible to think about any small patch of the manifold in terms of Euclidean space, mathematicians can use traditional calculus techniques to, say, compute its area or volume, or describe movement on it.</p>

<p>To do this, mathematicians divide a given manifold into several overlapping patches and represent each with a “chart” — a set of some number of coordinates (equal to the manifold’s dimension) that tell you where you are on the manifold. Crucially, you also need to write down rules that describe how the coordinates of overlapping charts relate to one another. The collection of all these charts is called an atlas.</p>
<p>You can then use this atlas — whose charts translate smaller regions of your potentially complicated manifold into familiar Euclidean space — to measure and explore the manifold one patch at a time. If you want to understand how a function behaves on a manifold, or get a sense of its global structure, you can break the problem up into pieces, solve each piece on a different chart, in Euclidean space, and then stitch together the results from all the charts in the atlas to get the full answer you’re seeking.</p>
<p>Today, this approach is ubiquitous throughout math and physics.</p>
<h2><strong>Manifold Uses</strong></h2>
<p>Manifolds are crucial to our understanding of the universe, for one. In his general theory of relativity, Einstein described space-time as a four-dimensional manifold, and gravity as that manifold’s curvature. And the three-dimensional space we see around us is also a manifold — one that, as manifolds do, appears Euclidean to those of us living within it, even though we’re <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-the-geometry-of-the-universe-20200316/">still trying to figure out</a> its global shape.</p>
<p>Even in cases where manifolds don’t seem to be present, mathematicians and physicists try to rewrite their problems in the language of manifolds to make use of their helpful properties. “So much of physics comes down to understanding geometry,” said <a href="https://gravity.princeton.edu/people/jonathan-sorce">Jonathan Sorce</a>, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University. “And often in surprising ways.”</p>
        
        
<p>Consider a double pendulum, which consists of one pendulum hanging from the end of another. Small changes in the double pendulum’s initial conditions lead it to carve out very different trajectories through space, making its behavior hard to predict and understand. But if you represent the configuration of the pendulum with just two angles (one describing the position of each of its arms), then the space of all possible configurations looks like a doughnut, or torus — a manifold. Each point on this torus represents one possible state of the pendulum; paths on the torus represent the trajectories the pendulum might follow through space. This allows researchers to translate their physical questions about the pendulum into geometric ones, making them more intuitive and easier to solve. This is also how they study the movements of fluids, robots, quantum particles and more.</p>
<p>Similarly, mathematicians often view the solutions to complicated algebraic equations as a manifold to better understand their properties. And they analyze high-dimensional datasets — such as those recording the activity of thousands of neurons in the brain — by looking at how those data points might sit on a lower-dimensional manifold.</p>
<p>Asking how scientists use manifolds is akin to asking how they use numbers, Sorce said. “They are at the foundation of everything.”</p>
