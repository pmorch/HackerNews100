            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2022/01/06/memcached-interview/">https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2022/01/06/memcached-interview/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39813067">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It’s been a while since I was on the receiving end of a software engineering
interview. But I still remember my favorite interview question. It was at MemSQL circa 2013.
(They <a href="https://www.singlestore.com/blog/revolution/">haven’t even kept their name</a>,
so I assume they’re not still relying on this specific interview question.
I don’t feel bad for revealing it. It’s a great story that I tell people a lot;
I’ve just never blogged it before.)</p>

<p>Okay, so this isn’t a “question” per se; it’s a programming challenge.
I forget how much time they gave for it. Let’s say three hours, counting
the time to explain the problem.</p>

<p>Since MemSQL was a database company, this is a database challenge.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-memcached">Introducing memcached</h2>

<p>You know about <code>memcached</code>? No? Well, it’s an in-memory key-value store.
(<a href="https://memcached.org/about">Read its About page here.</a>) Let’s download
its code and build it so I can show you what it does.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may need to <code>brew install libevent</code> and maybe some other
stuff in order to build memcached successfully. It won’t be too
difficult to figure out; but anyway, wrangling with your environment
wasn’t part of the test. You can assume interviewees were given
access to a Linux box with all the right dependencies in place already.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the authentic 2013 experience, let’s bypass the <a href="https://github.com/memcached/memcached">GitHub repo</a>
and untar a contemporary source distribution:</p>

<div><pre><code>curl -O https://memcached.org/files/memcached-1.4.15.tar.gz
tar zxvf memcached-1.4.15.tar.gz
cd memcached-1.4.15
./configure
make
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we’ve built the <code>memcached</code> executable. Let’s start it running:</p>



<p>We can talk to the server via the default memcached port, port 11211.
Its protocol is basically plain text, so we can use plain old <code>telnet</code>
to talk to it. (If you don’t have <code>telnet</code> anymore, substitute the
words <a href="https://www.unixfu.ch/use-netcat-instead-of-telnet/"><code>nc -c</code></a> for <code>telnet</code>.)</p>

<div><pre><code>$ telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="playing-with-memcached">Playing with memcached</h2>

<p>memcached is a key-value store. That means we can tell it to remember
something (an association between a key and a value), and then later ask for
that key again, and it’ll tell us the value it remembered. In memcached,
keys are always ASCII strings and values are always arbitrary byte streams
(which means you must specify their length manually). For example,
type this into your telnet session:</p>

<div><pre><code>set fullname 0 3600 10
John Smith
</code></pre></div>

<p>This tells memcached to remember an association between the string key <code>fullname</code>
and the 10-byte value <code>John Smith</code>. The other numbers on that line are a “flags” value
(<code>0</code>) to remember alongside the byte-stream value; and an expiry timeout (<code>3600</code>)
measured in seconds, after which memcached will forget this association.
Anyway, after you type these two lines, memcached will respond:</p>



<p>Now you can retrieve the value of <code>fullname</code> by typing into the same telnet
session:</p>



<p>memcached will respond:</p>

<div><pre><code>VALUE fullname 0 10
John Smith
END
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can overwrite the value associated with <code>fullname</code> by issuing another
<code>set fullname</code> command. You can also ask memcached to modify the value in certain
ways; for example, there are special dedicated commands for <code>append</code> and <code>prepend</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code>append fullname 0 3600 6
-Jones
STORED
get fullname
VALUE fullname 0 16
John Smith-Jones
END
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course if you wanted to append <code>-Jones</code> to <code>fullname</code> from within a client program,
you <em>could</em> do something like this:</p>

<div><pre><code># pip install python-memcached
import memcache
mc = memcache.Client(['127.0.0.1:11211'])
v = mc.get('fullname')    # get the old value from memcached
v += '-Jones'             # append -Jones
mc.set('fullname', v)     # set the new value into memcached
</code></pre></div>

<p>But the advantage of memcached’s dedicated <code>append</code> command is that it’s guaranteed
to execute <em>atomically</em>. If you have multiple clients connected to the same memcached
server, and they’re all trying to append to the same key at the same time, the
<code>get/set</code> version might cause some of those updates to be lost, whereas with <code>append</code>
you’re assured they’ll all be accounted for.</p>

<p>Another dedicated command that executes atomically is <code>incr</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>set age 0 3600 2
37
STORED
incr age 1
</code></pre></div>

<p>memcached responds with the postincremented value:</p>



<p>This response is useful because of the multiple clients thing. If you issued a separate
<code>get age</code> command, you might see the new value only after several other clients had
done their own updates. If you’re intending to use the value as a serial number,
or a SQL primary key, or something like that, then it’s very good that there’s a
way to see the incremented value <em>atomically</em>.</p>

<p>memcached remembers the incremented value too, of course:</p>

<div><pre><code>get age
VALUE age 0 2
38
END
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice that <code>37</code> and <code>38</code> are still being stored and returned as byte-strings;
they’re decoded from ASCII into integers and back as part of the atomic operation.
If you try to <code>incr</code> a non-integer value, you get an error:</p>

<div><pre><code>incr fullname 1
CLIENT_ERROR cannot increment or decrement non-numeric value
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, note that <code>incr</code> is a full-fledged addition operation: you can increment
(or <code>decr</code>) by any positive value, not just by <code>1</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code>incr age 10
48
decr age 10
38
incr age -1
CLIENT_ERROR invalid numeric delta argument
</code></pre></div>

<p>By the way, when you’re done talking to memcached and want to kill the connection,
you can type the memcached command <code>quit</code>. (If you’re using <code>nc -c</code>, Ctrl+D also
works. Or, just go to the terminal window where the <code>memcached</code> server is running
and Ctrl+C to bring it down.)</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge-modifying-memcached">The challenge: Modifying memcached</h2>

<p>Via its <code>incr</code> and <code>decr</code> commands, memcached provides a built-in way to
atomically add \(k\) to a number. But it doesn’t provide other arithmetic
operations; in particular, there is no “atomic multiply by \(k\)” operation.</p>

<p>Your programming challenge: <b>Add a <code>mult</code> command to memcached.</b></p>

<p>When you’re done, I should be able to telnet to your memcached client
and run commands like</p>



<p>You have three hours. Go!</p>

            <link>https://notgull.net/why-not-threads/</link>
            <guid>39812969</guid>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://notgull.net/why-not-threads/">https://notgull.net/why-not-threads/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39812969">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A common refrain is that threads can do everything that <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> can, but
simpler. So why would anyone choose <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>?</p>

<p>This is a common question that I’ve seen a lot in the Rust community. Frankly, I completely understand
where it’s coming from.</p>

<p>Rust is a low-level language that doesn’t hide the
complexity of coroutines from you. This is in opposition to languages like Go,
where <code>async</code> happens by default, without the programmer needing to even
consider it.</p>

<p>Smart programmers try to avoid complexity. So, they see the extra complexity in
<code>async</code>/<code>await</code> and question why it is needed. This question is especially
pertinent when considering that a reasonable alternative exists in OS threads.</p>

<p>Let’s take a mind-journey through <code>async</code> and see how it stacks up.</p>

<h2 id="background-blitz">Background Blitz</h2>

<p>Rust is a low-level language. Normally, code is linear; one thing runs after
another. It looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>();</span>
    <span>bar</span><span>();</span>
    <span>baz</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Nice and simple, right?</p>

<p>However, sometimes you will want to run many things at once. The canonical
example for this is a web server. Consider the following written in linear
code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>io</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>socket</span> <span>=</span> <span>TcpListener</span><span>::</span><span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>"0.0.0.0:80"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>client</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>.accept</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>handle_client</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Imagine if <code>handle_client</code> takes a few milliseconds, and two clients try to
connect to your webserver at the same time. You’ll run into a serious
problem!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Client #1 connects to the webserver, and is accepted by the <code>accept()</code>
function. It starts running <code>handle_client()</code>.</li>
  <li>Client #2 connects to the webserver. However, since <code>accept()</code> is not
currently running, we have to wait for <code>handle_client()</code> for Client #1 to
finish running.</li>
  <li>After waiting a few milliseconds, we get back to <code>accept()</code>. Client #2 can
connect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now imagine that instead of two clients, there are two million simultaneous
clients. At the end of the queue, you’ll have to wait several minutes
before the web server can help you. It becomes un-scalable very quickly.</p>

<p>Obviously, the embryonic web tried to solve this problem. The original solution was to introduce threading. By saving
the value of some registers and the program’s stack into memory, the operating
system can stop a program, run another program in its place, then resume running
that program later. Essentially, it allows for multiple routines (or “threads”,
or “processes”) to run on the same CPU.</p>

<p>Using threads, we can rewrite the above code as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>io</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>socket</span> <span>=</span> <span>TcpListener</span><span>::</span><span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>"0.0.0.0:80"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>client</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>.accept</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>handle_client</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>));</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, the client is being handled by a separate thread than the one handling
waiting for new connections. Great! This avoids the problem by allowing concurrent
thread access.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Client #1 is <code>accept</code>ed by the server. The server spawns a thread that calls
<code>handle_client</code>.</li>
  <li>Client #2 tries to connect to the server.</li>
  <li>Eventually, <code>handle_client</code> blocks on something. The OS saves the thread
handling Client #1 and brings back the main thread.</li>
  <li>The main thread <code>accept</code>s Client #2. It spawns a separate thread to handle
Client #2. With only a few microseconds of delay, Client #1 and Client #2
are run in parallel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Threads work especially well when you consider that production-grade web servers
have dozens of CPU cores. It’s not just that the OS can give the <em>illusion</em> that
all of these threads run at the same time; it’s that the OS can <em>actually</em> make
them all run at once.</p>

<p>Eventually, for reasons I’ll elaborate later, programmers wanted to bring this
concurrency out of the OS space and into the user space. There are many
different models for userspace concurrency. There is event-driven programming,
actors, and coroutines. The one Rust settled on is <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>To oversimplify, you compile the program as a grab-bag of state machines that
can all be run independently of another. Rust itself provides a mechanism for
creating state machines; the mechanism of <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>. The above program in terms of <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> would
look like this, written using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/smol"><code>smol</code></a>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#[apply(smol_macros::main</span><span>!</span><span>)]</span>
<span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>ex</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>smol</span><span>::</span><span>Executor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>io</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>socket</span> <span>=</span> <span>TcpListener</span><span>::</span><span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>"0.0.0.0:80"</span><span>)</span><span>.await</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>client</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>.accept</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>ex</span><span>.spawn</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>move</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>handle_client</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>)</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
        <span>})</span><span>.detach</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>The main function is preceded with the <code>async</code> keyword. This means that it is
not a traditional function, but one that returns a state machine. Roughly, the
function’s contents correspond to that state machine.</li>
  <li><code>await</code> includes another state machine as a part of the currently running
state machine. For <code>accept()</code>, it means that the state machine will include it
as a step.</li>
  <li>Eventually, one of the inner functions will <em>yield</em>, or give up control. For
example, when <code>accept()</code> waits
for a new connection. At this point the entire state machine will yield its execution to
the higher-level executor. For us, that is <code>smol::Executor</code>.</li>
  <li>Once execution is yielded, the <code>Executor</code> will replace the current state
machine with another one that is running concurrently, spawned through the
<code>spawn</code> function.</li>
  <li>We pass an <code>async</code> block to the <code>spawn</code> function. This block represents an entire new state
machine, independent of the one created by the <code>main</code> function. All this state
machine does is run the <code>handle_client</code> function.</li>
  <li>Once <code>main</code> yields, one of the clients is selected to run in its place. Once that
client yields, the cycle repeats.</li>
  <li>You can now handle millions of simultaneous clients.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, user-space concurrency like this introduces an uptick in
complexity. When you’re using threads, you don’t have to deal with executors
and tasks and state machines and all.</p>

<p>If you’re a reasonable person, you might be asking “why do we need to do all of
this? Threads work well; for 99% of programs, we don’t need to involve any kind
of user-space concurrency. Introducing new complexity is technical debt, and
technical debt costs us time and money.</p>

<p>“So why wouldn’t we use threads?”</p>

<h2 id="timeout-trouble">Timeout Trouble</h2>

<p>Perhaps one of Rust’s biggest strengths is <em>composability</em>. It provides a set of
abstractions that can be nested, built upon, put together, and expanded upon.</p>

<p>I recall that <em>the</em> thing that made me stick with Rust is the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html"><code>Iterator</code></a>
trait. It blew my mind that you could make something an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html"><code>Iterator</code></a>, apply
a handful of different combinators, then pass the resulting <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html"><code>Iterator</code></a> into
any function that took an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html"><code>Iterator</code></a>.</p>

<p>It continues to impress me how powerful it is. Let’s say you want to receive a list of
integers from another thread, only take the ones that are immediately available,
discard any integers that aren’t even, add one to all of them, then push them
onto a new list.</p>

<p>That would be fifty lines and a helper function in some other languages. In Rust
it can be done in five:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>send</span><span>,</span> <span>recv</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>mpsc</span><span>::</span><span>channel</span><span>();</span>
<span>my_list</span><span>.extend</span><span>(</span>
    <span>recv</span><span>.try_iter</span><span>()</span>
        <span>.filter</span><span>(|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span> <span>x</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>1</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The best thing about <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> is that it lets you apply this composability
to I/O-bound functions. Let’s say you have a new client requirement; you want to add a timeout to your above
function. Assume that our <code>handle_client</code> above function looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>handle_client</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>:</span> <span>TcpStream</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>io</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[];</span>
    <span>client</span><span>.read_to_end</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>data</span><span>)</span><span>.await</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>let</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>do_something_with_data</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span><span>.await</span><span>?</span>
    <span>client</span><span>.write_all</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>response</span><span>)</span><span>.await</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

    <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we want to add, say, a three-second timeout, we can combine two combinators
to do that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://docs.rs/smol/latest/smol/future/fn.race.html"><code>race</code></a> function takes two futures and runs them at the same time.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://docs.rs/smol/latest/smol/struct.Timer.html"><code>Timer</code></a> future waits for some time before returning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what the final code looks like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>handle_client</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>:</span> <span>TcpStream</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>io</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>I find this to be a very easy process. All you have to do is wrap your existing
code in an <code>async</code> block and race it against another future.</p>

<p>An added bonus of this approach is that it works with any kind of stream. Here,
we use a <code>TcpStream</code>. However we can easily replace it with anything that
implements <code>impl AsyncRead + AsyncWrite</code>. It could be a GZIP stream on top of
the normal stream, or a Unix socket, or a file. <code>async</code> just slides into
whatever pattern you need from it.</p>

<h2 id="thematic-threads">Thematic Threads</h2>

<p>What if we wanted to implement this in our threaded example above?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>handle_client</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>:</span> <span>TcpStream</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>io</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>

<p>Well, it’s not easy. Generally, you can’t interrupt the <code>read</code> or <code>write</code>
system calls in blocking code, without doing something catastrophic like
closing the file descriptor (which can’t be done in Rust).</p>

<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html"><code>TcpStream</code></a> has two functions <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html#method.set_read_timeout"><code>set_read_timeout</code></a> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html#method.set_write_timeout"><code>set_write_timeout</code></a> that can be used to set the timeouts for reading and
writing, respectively. However, we can’t just use it naively. Imagine a client
that sends one byte every 2.9 seconds, just to reset the timeout.</p>

<p>So we have to program a little defensively here. Due to the power of Rust combinators, we can write our own
type wrapping around the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html"><code>TcpStream</code></a> to program the timeout.</p>

<p>On one hand, it could be argued that this is elegant. We used Rust’s
capabilities to solve the problem with a relatively simple combinator. I’m sure
it would work well enough.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it’s definitely hacky.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We’ve locked ourselves into using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html"><code>TcpStream</code></a>. There’s no trait in Rust to
abstract over using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html#method.set_read_timeout"><code>set_read_timeout</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html#method.set_write_timeout"><code>set_write_timeout</code></a> types.
So it would take a lot of additional work to make it use any kind of writer.</li>
  <li>It involves an extra system call for setting the timeout.</li>
  <li>I imagine this type is much more unwieldy to use for the kinds of actual logic
that web servers demand.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I saw this code in production, I would ask the author why they avoided using
<code>async</code>/<code>await</code> to solve this problem. This is the phenomenon I was describing
in my post “<a href="https://notgull.net/why-you-want-async/">Why you might actually want async in your project</a>”.
Quite frequently I encounter a pattern where synchronous code can’t be used
without contortion, so I have to rewrite it in <code>async</code>.</p>

<h2 id="async-success-stories">Async Success Stories</h2>

<p>There’s a reason why the HTTP ecosystem has adopted <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> as its
primary runtime mechanism, even for clients. You can take any function that
makes an HTTP call, and make it fit whatever hole or use case you want it to.</p>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/tower"><code>tower</code></a> is probably the best example of this phenomenon I can think of, and
it’s really <em>the</em> thing that made me realize how powerful <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> can
be. If you implement your service as an <code>async</code> function, you get timeouts,
rate limiting, load balancing, <a href="https://docs.rs/tower/0.4.13/tower/hedge/index.html">hedging</a>
and back-pressure handling. All of that for free.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter what runtime you used, or what you’re actually doing in your
service. You can throw <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tower"><code>tower</code></a> at it to make it more robust.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/macroquad"><code>macroquad</code></a> is a miniature Rust game engine that aims to make game development
as easy as possible. Its main function uses <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> in order to run its
engine. This is because <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> is really the best way in Rust to
express a linear function that needs to be stopped in order to wait for
something else.</p>

<p>In practice, this can be extremely powerful. Imagine simultaneously polling
a network connection to your game server and your GUI framework, on the same
thread. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<h2 id="improving-asyncs-image">Improving Async’s Image</h2>

<p>I don’t think the issue is that some people think threads are better than
<code>async</code>. I think the issue is that the benefits of <code>async</code> aren’t widely
broadcast. This leads some people to be misinformed about the benefits of
<code>async</code>.</p>

<p>If this is an educational problem, I think it’s worth taking a look at the
educational material. Here’s what the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/02_why_async.html">Rust Async Book</a> says when comparing
<code>async</code>/<code>await</code> to operating system threads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>OS threads</strong> don’t require any changes to the programming model, which makes it very easy to express concurrency. However, synchronizing between threads can be difficult, and the performance overhead is large. Thread pools can mitigate some of these costs, but not enough to support massive IO-bound workloads.</p>

  <p><em>- <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/02_why_async.html">Rust Async Book</a>, various authors</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is a consistent problem throughout the <code>async</code> community. When
someone asks the question of “why do we want to use this over OS threads”,
people have a tendency to kind of wave their hand and say “<code>async</code> has less
overhead. Other than that, everything’s the same.”</p>

<p>This is the reason why web server authors switched to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. It’s how
they solved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">C10k problem</a>. But, it’s not going to be the reason why
everyone else switches to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Performance gains are
fickle and can disappear in the wrong circumstances. There are plenty of cases
where a threaded workflow can be faster than an equivalent <code>async</code> workflow
(mostly, in the case of CPU bound tasks). I think that we, as a community, have
over-emphasized the ephemeral performance benefits of <code>async</code> Rust while
downplaying its semantic benefits.</p>

<p>In the worst case, it leads to people shrugging off <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> as
“<a href="https://shnatsel.medium.com/smoke-testing-rust-http-clients-b8f2ee5db4e6">a weird thing that you resort to for niche use cases</a>”. It should be seen as
a powerful programming model that lets you succinctly express patterns that
can’t be expressed in synchronous Rust without dozens of threads and channels.</p>

<p>I also think there’s a tendency to try to make <code>async</code> Rust “just like sync
Rust” in a way that encourages negative comparison. By “tendency”, I mean that
it’s <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2022/02/03/async-in-2022.html">the stated roadmap for the Rust project</a>,
saying that “that writing async Rust code should be as easy as writing sync code, apart from the occasional <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keyword.”.</p>

<p>I reject this framing because it’s fundamentally impossible. It’s like trying to
host a pizza party on a ski slope. Sure, you can probably get 99% of the way
there, especially if you’re really talented. But there are differences that the
average bear <em>will</em> notice, no matter how good you are.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t be trying to force our model into unfriendly idioms to
appease programmers who refuse to adopt another type of pattern. We should be
trying to highlight the strengths of Rust’s <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> ecosystem; its
composability and its power. We should be trying to make it so <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>
is the <em>default</em> choice whenever a programmer reaches for concurrency. Rather
than trying to make sync Rust and <code>async</code> Rust the same, we should embrace the
differences.</p>

<p>In short, we shouldn’t be using technical reasons to argue for a semantic model.
We should be using semantic reasons.</p>

</p><p><strong>Created: 6 Sep 2023</strong> | <strong>Updated: 6 Sep 2023</strong></p>
<br> In this video, we explore real-time traffic analysis using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack to detect and track vehicles on aerial images. Harnessing the power of Python and Supervision, we delve deep into assigning cars to specific entry zones and understanding their direction of movement. By visualizing their paths, we gain insights into traffic flow across bustling roundabouts...

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two years ago, in a project called the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615">Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark</a>, or BIG-bench, 450 researchers compiled a list of 204 tasks designed to test the capabilities of large language models, which power chatbots like ChatGPT. On most tasks, performance improved predictably and smoothly as the models scaled up — the larger the model, the better it got. But with other tasks, the jump in ability wasn’t smooth. The performance remained near zero for a while, then performance jumped. Other studies found similar leaps in ability.</p>
<p>The authors described this as “breakthrough” behavior; other researchers have likened it to a phase transition in physics, like when liquid water freezes into ice. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682">a paper</a> published in August 2022, researchers noted that these behaviors are not only surprising but unpredictable, and that they should inform the evolving conversations around AI safety, potential and risk. They called the abilities “<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unpredictable-abilities-emerging-from-large-ai-models-20230316/">emergent</a>,” a word that describes collective behaviors that only appear once a system reaches a high level of complexity.</p>
<p>But things may not be so simple. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.15004">A new paper</a> by a trio of researchers at Stanford University posits that the sudden appearance of these abilities is just a consequence of the way researchers measure the LLM’s performance. The abilities, they argue, are neither unpredictable nor sudden. “The transition is much more predictable than people give it credit for,” said <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/">Sanmi Koyejo</a>, a computer scientist at Stanford and the paper’s senior author. “Strong claims of emergence have as much to do with the way we choose to measure as they do with what the models are doing.”</p>

<p>We’re only now seeing and studying this behavior because of how large these models have become. Large language models train by analyzing enormous <a href="https://openai.com/research/language-unsupervised">datasets of text</a> — words from online sources including books, web searches and Wikipedia — and finding links between words that often appear together. The size is measured in terms of parameters, roughly analogous to all the ways that words can be connected. The more parameters, the more connections an LLM can find. GPT-2 had 1.5 billion parameters, while GPT-3.5, the LLM that powers ChatGPT, uses 350 billion. GPT-4, which debuted in March 2023 and now underlies Microsoft Copilot, reportedly uses 1.75 trillion.</p>
<p>That rapid growth has brought an astonishing surge in performance and efficacy, and no one is disputing that large enough LLMs can complete tasks that smaller models can’t, including ones for which they weren’t trained. The trio at Stanford who cast emergence as a “mirage” recognize that LLMs become more effective as they scale up; in fact, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-suggests-chatbots-can-understand-text-20240122/">the added complexity</a> of larger models should make it possible to get better at more difficult and diverse problems. But they argue that whether this improvement looks smooth and predictable or jagged and sharp results from the choice of metric — or even a paucity of test examples — rather than the model’s inner workings.</p>

<p>Three-digit addition offers an example. In the 2022 BIG-bench study, researchers reported that with fewer parameters, both GPT-3 and another LLM named LAMDA failed to accurately complete addition problems. However, when GPT-3 trained using 13 billion parameters, its ability changed as if with the flip of a switch. Suddenly, it could add — and LAMDA could, too, at 68 billion parameters. This suggests that the ability to add emerges at a certain threshold.</p>
<p>But the Stanford researchers point out that the LLMs were judged only on accuracy: Either they could do it perfectly, or they couldn’t. So even if an LLM predicted most of the digits correctly, it failed. That didn’t seem right. If you’re calculating 100 plus 278, then 376 seems like a much more accurate answer than, say, −9.34.</p>
<p>So instead, Koyejo and his collaborators tested the same task using a metric that awards partial credit. “We can ask: How well does it predict the first digit? Then the second? Then the third?” he said.</p>
<p>Koyejo credits the idea for the new work to his graduate student Rylan Schaeffer, who he said noticed that an LLM’s performance seems to change with how its ability is measured. Together with Brando Miranda, another Stanford graduate student, they chose new metrics showing that as parameters increased, the LLMs predicted an increasingly correct sequence of digits in addition problems. This suggests that the ability to add isn’t emergent — meaning that it undergoes a sudden, unpredictable jump — but gradual and predictable. They find that with a different measuring stick, emergence vanishes.</p>

<p dir="auto">A data hoarder’s dream come true: bundle any web page into a single HTML file. You can finally replace that gazillion of open tabs with a gazillion of .html files stored somewhere on your precious little drive.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike the conventional “Save page as”, <code>monolith</code> not only saves the target document, it embeds CSS, image, and JavaScript assets <strong>all at once</strong>, producing a single HTML5 document that is a joy to store and share.</p>
<p dir="auto">If compared to saving websites with <code>wget -mpk</code>, this tool embeds all assets as data URLs and therefore lets browsers render the saved page exactly the way it was on the Internet, even when no network connection is available.</p>

									<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p>One day in 1997, psychology professor Jennifer Mather answered her phone to hear the excited voice of Roland Anderson, her collaborator in a rather unusual study of animal behavior. “She’s bouncing the ball!” He was speaking in figurative terms, but ones he knew Mather would understand. The “she” was an octopus perhaps two or three years old, swimming in a tank at the Seattle Aquarium. The “ball” was an Extra Strength Tylenol bottle weighted to float just beneath the surface. And the “bouncing” wasn’t exactly bouncing.</p>
<p>Octopuses have an exhalant funnel, a siphon near the side of the head, through which they can jet water. The octopus had held the bottle with her arms and let it go; she then aimed her funnel at it and released a jet of water in its direction, sending it to the other end of the aquarium, where the water flow returned it to her. She was doing it again and again. After Anderson had seen her perform the feat sixteen times, he decided it was time to call Mather.</p>
<span>Real, empirical evidence of octopus play would be a finding of some consequence.</span>
<p>Jennifer Mather is a preeminent researcher on octopus behavior, and a peripatetic academic, having done research in many places. During a dive in the waters off Bermuda, she noticed an interesting behavior of the common Atlantic octopus known as <em>Octopus vulgaris</em>. It found a small rock, tucked it under its arms, and placed it near its den. The octopus then retrieved another rock. And another and another.</p>
<p>It slid into the den and pulled all the rocks behind it, effectively barring the entrance from intruders before going to sleep. Octopuses had been known to demonstrate rudimentary intelligence, but Mather recognized this as something far more sophisticated. Since the octopus was not reacting to any existing threat, but rather in anticipation of one, it had demonstrated foresight and planning.</p>
<p>Like Mather, Roland Anderson was a scuba diver. His preferred environs were the rather colder waters of Puget Sound, where he was known to dive even at night and in the rain, once just to look for small <em>Octopus rubescens</em> that had found homes in beer bottles resting on the ocean floor. Anderson’s vocation and avocation were happily one. Professionally, he was a marine biologist employed at the Seattle Aquarium, where his specialties included the natural history and behavior of octopuses.</p>
<p>While performing his rounds one morning, Anderson discovered that one of the aquarium’s giant Pacific octopuses had dug up the gravel from the bottom of its tank, bitten through the nylon cable ties that attached the filter to the tank, and torn the filter into small pieces. Anderson did not understand the octopus’s motivation for destroying the filter, but he did know that its actions, like those of Mather’s octopus, were methodical, requiring both foresight and planning.</p>
<p>Mather and Anderson first met at a conference and found they shared a fascination for a certain order of cephalopod mollusk as well as a suspicion that there was more going on in their minds than many believed. They wondered whether octopuses played. The creatures had a penchant for manipulating objects, which indicated both intelligence and curiosity. The step from manipulating objects to playing with them might seem small, and in the terms of behavior, it would be. But in terms of taxonomy, it would be a giant step—or rather a leap—across whole phyla. Mammals and birds, long recognized as playful, are members of the phylum Chordata. But octopuses are cephalopods, of the phylum Mollusca.</p>
<p>Early in the third century CE, Roman natural historian Claudius Aelianus wrote, “Mischief and craft are plainly seen to be the characteristics of this creature.” In the years since, they’ve become no less mischievous and crafty, as attested by researchers whose instruments they are known to take apart. When marine biologist Jean Boal and her colleagues noted octopuses’ “relative intractability as experimental subjects,” they might have been speaking for many a weary cephalopod researcher.</p>
<p>Octopus behavior certainly seems playful. Yet no one had attempted to demonstrate that it <em>was</em> play or to prove, under experimental controls, that octopuses played. Real, empirical evidence of octopus play would be a finding of some consequence. It would mean that the behavior had evolved in two phyla that had diverged 670 million years ago.</p>
<p>In the 1990s many experiments gauged octopus intelligence and curiosity. Most had been of the rudimentary, stimulus-response sort. An object, say a mussel shell, would be dropped into an octopus’s tank. An octopus seeking food would explore the shell, use its arms to push, prod, and turn it over. When it found no food and nothing more worth investigating, the octopus would lose interest in the shell and leave it alone.</p>
<p>If the same experiment was performed with an especially curious octopus, the response might be different. When the shell first appeared, the octopus would explore it. The feel of striations on the shell’s surface might stimulate further exploration, and eventually the octopus would find the shell’s inner concavity. Its smooth surface, an especially intriguing contrast to the striations, might stimulate more study. So it would go, a recurring cycle of stimulus and investigation, with each stimulus prompting further investigation and each investigation uncovering another stimulus. The cycle would greatly extend the period of investigation, with a curious octopus taking far longer to explore the shell before losing interest.</p>
<span>Since the octopus was not reacting to any existing threat, but rather in anticipation of one, it had demonstrated foresight and planning.</span>
<p>Mather and Anderson thought that in that slide from exploration to habituation some behavior might justifiably be called play. To distinguish play from exploration would be difficult, but they designed an experiment that they hoped might accomplish just that. They chose as their test subject the giant Pacific octopus (<em>Enteroctopus dofleini</em>), a species well adapted to the cold, oxygen-rich water of the coastal North Pacific. It’s the largest octopus species; an adult may weigh more than 110 pounds and live for four or five years. The individuals to be tested, five males and three females, were somewhat lighter and younger— “subadults” two to three years old that weighed between two and twenty pounds.</p>
<p>Mather and Anderson knew that they might prompt play by giving the octopuses something interesting to investigate. They decided upon four plastic pill bottles weighted to just above neutral buoyancy. Octopuses have limited color vision but good vision for light intensity, so two bottles were painted white and two painted black. And since octopuses are sensitive to texture, one white and one black bottle were given smooth surfaces, the other two rough ones. Each octopus was allowed ten opportunities or “trials” lasting thirty minutes, which Mather and Anderson deemed sufficient time for the octopuses either to engage with the bottles or to demonstrate no interest in them.</p>
<p>All eight octopuses made contact with the bottles in some fashion, either by pressing a sucker against a bottle, curling an arm around it, or using an arm to press the bottle against its mouth. Mather and Anderson judged these actions to be investigation. Two octopuses, though, engaged with the bottles in a manner that looked like play. Octopus 8 used its funnel to create a jet of water that pushed a bottle to the wall of the aquarium and back. Octopus 7 issued a water jet that caused the bottle to travel “in a circular path…around the aquarium periphery,” prompting Anderson’s phone call.</p>
<p>Octopuses had been known to use exhalant funnels to propel themselves, to clean detritus at the mouth of their dens, and to push away irritations such as scavenging fish and stinging sea anemones. In captivity, octopuses often use the funnels to repel a food they regard with some contempt—say frozen shrimp. But as far as anyone knew, they had never been used like this. Octopuses 7 and 8 were not pushing the bottle away; on the contrary, they had found an interesting way to make it return.</p>
<p>Mather has addressed all manner of audiences—from professional animal behaviorists to schoolchildren—hundreds of times, but she speaks with such deliberation that you might think that as she voices each word, she considers it anew. When she later adopted Anderson’s metaphor, she was careful to explain it. “That’s just exactly the kind of thing we do when we bounce a ball,” she told an interviewer. “When you bounce a ball, you are not trying to get rid of the ball, you are trying to figure out what you can do with the ball.”</p>

<p>Not for the first time, Microsoft has struck upon a winning formula for irritating the hell out of Windows users: pop-up ads in your browser! The latest Windows update was released several days ago, though I only got around to it today, and after installation inserts pop-up adverts into Google Chrome.</p><p>I couldn't believe what I was seeing: a little box comes up in the bottom right corner of the browser, advertising the Bing search engine and BingAI. My first thought was that I'd downloaded something malicious, perhaps while fiddling with mods, because the pop-up didn't exactly look classy, more like the kind of thing you see on suspicious websites. But I set off a quick antivirus scan and googled the issue (in Chrome naturally), and quickly found plenty of folk complaining about the same thing.</p><p>So first of all: Really, Microsoft? Most of us rely on Windows, it has an absolute stranglehold on the OS market, and is therefore able to intrude on our PC experience like few other companies (outside perhaps Google itself). This particular pop-up will, if you click "yes" to its prompt, set Bing as the default search engine within Chrome.</p><p>It did this last year, too, adding pop-ups to Windows 10 and 11 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851902/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-malware" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851902/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-malware"><u>appeared over the top of other apps</u></a> suggesting Microsoft-made alternatives, before removing them due to "unintended behaviour."</p><p>Microsoft has confirmed the pop-ups are genuine Microsoft adverts, and says they should only appear once. Well, I've seen at least two, and frankly don't trust Redmond on this, because it's just always coming up with new ways to taint the Windows experience.</p><p>"This is a one-time notification giving people the choice to set Bing as their default search engine on Chrome," Microsoft comms director <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101887/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-google-chrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101887/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-google-chrome"><u>Caitlin Roulston told The Verge</u></a>. Almost unbelievably she frames this as a perk for users, who get some Copilot bonuses if they accept the BingAI prompt, then ends with this magnificently brazen claim: "We value providing our customers with choice, so there is an option to dismiss the notification."</p><p>What really annoys me about Windows is that it doesn't respect my choices over time, but seems to override them on a whim in certain updates and make my machine start doing things Microsoft wants but I don't want. I wouldn't be so bothered about Microsoft's various attempts to fool me into using Bing if I could just say "no thanks" at some point and have that respected over multiple updates.&nbsp;</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hbKqpcu45pavAoR4UREVqD"><section><p>Sign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.</p></section></div><p>When Windows is annoying, Windows has failed.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>That virus likely came from a single employee who happened to be shedding an enormous quantity of a very weird variant. The researchers would desperately like to find that person. <strong>But what if that person doesn’t want to be found?</strong></p>  <p>A few years ago, Marc Johnson, a virologist at the University of Missouri, became obsessed with weird covid variants he was seeing in wastewater samples. The ones that caught his eye were odd in a couple of different ways: they didn’t match any of the common variants, and they didn’t circulate. They would pop up in a single location, persist for some length of time, and then often disappear—a blip. Johnson found his first blip in Missouri. <strong>“It drove me nuts,” he says. “I was like, ‘What the hell was going on here?’”&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p>Then he teamed up with colleagues in New York, and they found a few more.</p>  <p>Hoping to pin down even more lineages, Johnson put a call out on Twitter (now X) for wastewater. In January 2022, he got another hit in a wastewater sample shipped from a Wisconsin treatment plant. He and David O’Connor, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin, started working with state health officials to track the signal—from the treatment plant to a pumping station and then to the outskirts of the city, “one manhole at a time,” Johnson says. “Every time there was a branch in the road, we would check which branch [the signal] was coming from.”</p> 
 <p>They chased some questionable leads. The researchers were suspicious the virus might be coming from an animal. At one point O’Connor took people from his lab to a dog park to ask dog owners for poop samples. “There were so many red herrings,” Johnson says.</p>  <p>Finally, after sampling about 50 manholes, the researchers found <em>the</em> manhole, the last one on the branch that had the variant. They got lucky. “The only source was this company,” Johnson says. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(23)00372-5/fulltext">Their results</a><em> </em>came out in March in<em> Lancet Microbe</em>.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Wastewater surveillance might seem like a relatively new phenomenon, born of the pandemic, but it goes back decades.</strong> A team of Canadian researchers outlines several historical examples <a href="https://theconversation.com/targeted-wastewater-surveillance-has-a-history-of-social-and-ethical-concerns-183570">in this story</a>. In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/146642405107100109">one example</a>, a public health official traced a 1946 typhoid outbreak to the wife of a man who sold ice cream at the beach. Even then, the researcher expressed some hesitation. The study didn’t name the wife or the town, and he cautioned that infections probably shouldn’t be traced back to an individual “except in the presence of an outbreak.”</p>  <p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1830615/">a similar study published in 1959</a>, scientists traced another typhoid epidemic to one woman, who was then banned from food service and eventually talked into having her gallbladder removed to eliminate the infection. Such publicity can have a “devastating effect on the carrier,” they remarked in their write-up of the case. “From being a quiet and respected citizen, she becomes a social pariah.”</p> </div><div> <p>When Johnson and O’Connor traced the virus to that last manhole, things got sticky. Until that point, the researchers had suspected these cryptic lineages were coming from animals. Johnson had even developed a theory involving organic fertilizer from a source further upstream. Now they were down to a single building housing a company with about 30 employees. They didn’t want to stigmatize anyone or invade their privacy. But someone at the company was shedding an awful lot of virus. “Is it ethical to not tell them at that point?” Johnson wondered.</p>  <p>O’Connor and Johnson had been working with state health officials from the very beginning. They decided the best path forward would be to approach the company, explain the situation, and ask if they could offer voluntary testing. The decision wasn’t easy. “We didn’t want to cause panic and say there’s a dangerous new variant lurking in our community,” Ryan Westergaard, the state epidemiologist for communicable diseases at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, told <em>Nature</em>. But they also wanted to try to help the person who was infected.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>The company agreed to testing, and 19 of its 30 employees turned up for nasal swabs. They were all negative.</strong></p>  <p>That may mean one of the people who didn’t test was carrying the infection. Or could it mean that the massive covid infection in the gut didn’t show up on a nasal swab? “This is where I would use the shrug emoji if we were doing this over email,” O’Connor says.</p> 

 <p>At the time, the researchers had the ability to test stool samples for the virus, but they didn’t have approval. Now they do, and they’re hoping stool will lead them to an individual infected with one of these strange viruses who can help answer some of their questions. Johnson has identified about 50 of these cryptic covid variants in wastewater. “The more I study these lineages, the more I am convinced that they are replicating in the GI tract,” Johnson says. “It wouldn’t surprise me at all if that’s the only place they were replicating.”&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>But how far should they go to find these people? That’s still an open question. </strong>O’Connor can imagine a dizzying array of problems that might arise if they did identify an individual shedding one of these rare variants. The most plausible hypothesis is that the lineages arise in individuals who have immune disorders that make it difficult for them to eliminate the infection. That raises a whole host of other thorny questions: what if that person had a compromised immune system due to HIV in addition to the strange covid variant? What if that person didn’t know they were HIV positive, or didn’t want to divulge their HIV status? What if the researchers told them about the infection, but the person couldn’t access treatment? “If you imagine what the worst-case scenarios are, they’re pretty bad,” O’Connor says.</p>  <p>On the other hand, O’Connor says, they think there are a lot of these people around the country and the world. <strong>“Isn't there also an ethical obligation to try to learn what we can so that we can try to help people who are harboring these viruses?” he asks.</strong></p>  <hr>  <h2>Now read the rest of The Checkup</h2>  <h3><strong>More from MIT Technology Review</strong></h3>  <p>Longevity specialists aim to help people live longer and healthier lives.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This sentiment gets stronger every day I follow the web development scene. Surely there are many ( in absolute numbers ) that require complex infra but majority of websites and apps get &lt;10 rps and 50 on a busy day. </p>

<p>Obviously latency is lower if there are endpoints around the world but the data still needs to be accessed. What's the point of being 20ms away from client if the db is 200ms away from that endpoint? And yes, someone has to pay for all that infrastructure.</p>

<p>Obviously caching is useful but that's something you get with a cdn or just plain http caching. Often the whole thing can live on cdn, just push the new files after updates. Maybe a few api endpoints are needed for some dynamic functionality but that can be handled for example with JavaScript. </p>

<p>Most projects might as well run in container on $5 vps. That would likely be faster as well, at least it's running and probably with a local db.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>China has introduced guidelines to phase out US microprocessors from Intel and AMD from government personal computers and servers, the Financial Times reported on Sunday (Mar 24).</p>

<p>The procurement guidance also seeks to sideline Microsoft's Windows operating system and foreign-made database software in favour of domestic options, the report said.</p>

<p>Government agencies above the township level have been told to include criteria requiring "safe and reliable" processors and operating systems when making purchases, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>China's industry ministry in late December issued a statement with three separate lists of CPUs, operating systems and centralised database deemed "safe and reliable" for three years after the publication date, all from Chinese companies, Reuters checks showed.</p>

<p>The State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for the council, China's Cabinet, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.</p>

<p>Intel and AMD did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.</p>

<p>The US has been aiming to boost domestic semiconductor output and reduce reliance on China and Taiwan with the Biden administration's 2022 CHIPS and Science Act.</p>

<p>It is designed to bolster US semiconductors and contains financial aid for domestic production with subsidies for production of advanced chips.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p id="9c3e">I implemented search and filtering for entities on our product at epilot. The users were heavily using the feature, however, a unique issue surfaced: difficulties in filtering file names containing diacritical marks like umlauts (<code>Äpfel</code>,&nbsp;<code>über</code>,&nbsp;<code>schön</code>, etc.).</p>



<p id="b54a">Intrigued, I delved into the logic to investigate. Initially, everything seemed in order. For instance, a file named “blöb” was saved precisely as “blöb” — no bizarre encoding alterations were apparent.</p>



<p id="0f99">Can you spot any difference between “blöb” and “blöb”?</p>



<p id="9a66">This time instead of typing the word in the search bar, I copied it from the uploaded and saved filename, and and voilà, the search functioned perfectly! 🤯. This definitely meant the file name was subtly altered upon upload, hinting at a background encoding transformation.</p>



<p id="49f9">So, as anyone would, I employed the power of&nbsp;<code>encodeURIComponent</code>&nbsp;to see for myself what really was different.</p>



<p>There it was! The different types of encoding forms that led to this. Now you might be wondering (<em>I was wondering too!</em>):</p>



<p><em>As if worrying about encoding wasn’t enough, now we’ve got to stress over its different types too 🤦‍♀ and wait, its 2024, and we are still grappling with Unicode character encoding problems?</em></p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="536" height="260" src="https://unravelweb.dev/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://unravelweb.dev/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image.png 536w, https://unravelweb.dev/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px"></figure>



<p>The culprits in this case were these two contrasting encoding types:&nbsp;<code><strong>%C3%BC</strong></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><strong>%CC%88</strong></code>, leading to the search malfunction. This is a well-known issue with NFD/NFC encoding forms.<br>There is a detailed explanation&nbsp;<a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Norm_Forms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://unravelweb.dev/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/10kVUt4jpUmk_aS0qk0riPA.png" alt=""></figure>



<div><p><em>Now imagine explaining this technical jargon that to a user!&nbsp;</em>😃</p><p>To fix it, I aligned the encoding type of the searched filename with that of the saved filename.<br>On <strong>MacOS</strong>, the encoding was NFD (for ö: 111 + 776), whereas on <strong>Linux</strong>, it switched to NFC (ö: 246).</p><p><strong>The solution?</strong></p><p>– Post-upload, before saving the file as an entity, I applied&nbsp;<code>.normalize()</code>&nbsp;to the filename, ensuring it was uniformly searchable.</p><p>– Additionally, as a cleanup step — to write a migration script to normalize the names of all existing files with non-ASCII characters.</p><p>A simple string normalise proved effective in this case. ✅<br>Read more about&nbsp;<code>String.prototype.normalize()</code>&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize#canonical_equivalence_normalization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. There is also a specific normalization option to pass to ensure canonically equivalent normalization — for example:&nbsp;<code>string.normalize("NFC")</code></p><p>Here’s a visual representation of the problem with the solution output:</p></div>

<p><b>Case Study: What Happens When a Fifteen Year Old Pumps and Dumps,
Obtaining a Net Profit of Nearly $800,000?<span>�
</span>The SEC Settles for $285,000.<o:p></o:p></b></p>



<p>Jonathan Lebed and
two of his friends came in fourth place in a stock-picking contest sponsored by
CNBC when he was just twelve years old.<span>�
</span>They had managed to turn an imaginary $10,000 into $240,000 during the
first round of the competition.<span>� </span>From
there, Lebed was able to convince his parents to invest money in the stock
market on his behalf.<span>� </span>His parents first
opened an Ameritrade account for him, and upon his mother�s decision to close
that account, his father opened an E*Trade account for him.<span>� </span>During two years of trading, Lebed made a
minimum of 27 trades, and netted nearly $800,000.<span>� </span>The SEC later investigated these 27 trades and eventually
declared eleven of them as illegal trades and forced to Lebed to pay
approximately $272,000 in fines and over $12,000 in interest.<span>� </span>In particular, these eleven trades occurred
during the five and a half month period between August 23, 1999, and February
4, 2000.<span>� </span>While Lebed never admitted or
denied the findings by the SEC, he consented to entry of the findings and the
imposition of sanctions.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[1]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a></p>

<p>The SEC findings
asserted that Lebed would purchase large blocks of thinly traded microcap
stocks, post between 200 and 300 messages on the Yahoo! Finance message boards,
hyping the stocks he had just purchased, and then sell all of the stocks he had
purchased, usually within twenty-four hours of said purchase.<span>� </span>The messages that Lebed posted would predict
marked increases in the stocks value, i.e. he would post comments that this
stock would be the �next stock to gain 1,000%� or that a stock currently
trading at just over a dollar would be trading at more than $20 per share �very
soon.�<span>� </span>In response to Lebed�s messages,
trading volume of these stocks would soar on average from 60,000 shares per day
to over a million shares on the days he posted his messages.<span>�� </span>For the eleven trades that the SEC declared
its findings, Lebed realized a net profit of $272,826.<span>� </span>The individual gross profits ranged from
over $11,000 per trade to nearly $74,000.<span>�
</span>Lebed professes that he did nothing wrong � he did nothing different
from Wall Street analysts.<span>� </span>He states
that he learned how people react to the stock market and acted on that
knowledge.<span>� </span>According to Lebed�s
friends, even Lebed�s teachers would follow his advice regarding the stock
market.<span>� </span>While one of Lebed�s friends
lost a significant amount of money on one of the trades Lebed pushed, he states
�[i]n the stock market, you go in knowing you can lose.<span>� </span>We were just doing what Jon was doing, but not
doing as good a job at it.�<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[2]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a></p>

<p>Depending on who
you talk to, Lebed was either viewed as a person who knowingly abused the
system and broke the law, or someone who acted no differently than Wall Street
analysts acted and was able to use the system to his advantage, actually
performing no wrong-doing.<span>� </span>Lebed�s own
father stated on 60 Minutes that he was proud of his son and that he hadn�t
done anything wrong.<span>� </span>This belief can
also be evinced by the fact that after Lebed�s first meeting with the SEC,
while his mother closed the Ameritrade account, Lebed�s father opened an
E*Trade account so that Lebed could continue to trade stocks.<span>� </span>The SEC, however, stated that Lebed violated
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the
Exchange Act.<span>� </span>These Acts �prohibit
acts, transactions, practices or course of business that operate as a fraud or
deceit in connection with the offer, purchase or sale of securities, including
misrepresentation and omissions of material fact.�<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[3]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a><span>� </span>The SEC therefore ordered Lebed pay his fine
and to �cease and desist� from causing any further violation of Section 17(a).</p>

<p>Even the news
articles that covered Lebed�s actions appear split on whether he had done
anything wrong.<span>� </span>While an article
written by Peter Carbonara for Money Magazine<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[4]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
appears to favor the SEC decision (albeit wondering why the SEC let Lebed keep
the remaining $500,000 of profit), Michael Lewis, writing for New York Times
Magazine,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[5]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
acknowledges that there were victims who suffered from Lebed�s actions, yet asserts
that the SEC only settled because they believed they would not be able to win
in court, and that its evidence was not as strong as it had alleged. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     
    <p> An 18-year-old from near Ottawa has become what appears to be the first Canadian, and among the youngest people in the world, to have a rare but extraordinary super memory.</p> <p> Emily Nash learned she has highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM) after being tested by researchers in the U.S.</p> <p> She now jokingly calls it her “superpower,” relieved to learn that the trait she tried to hide was actually a verifiable phenomenon.</p> <p> “I just felt so much relief knowing that I'm not alone, that it's not something I made up. It's something that actually exists,” she told CTV W5 in an exclusive interview.</p> <ul>  <li> <strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/w5">Watch the latest W5 investigations</a></strong></li> </ul> <p> Emily is a straight-A student. In her last year of high school, she is decidedly composed and modest about her skill. But she now joins a small and unique tribe of about 100 people confirmed with HSAM around the world.</p> <p> For most of us, memories fade with time.</p> <p> Ask anyone to tell you what happened on Oct. 21, 2021 and you will usually be met with a lengthy pause as they struggle to recall events of that day.</p> <p> But ask Emily and the response comes within seconds, with precision. “October 21, 2021? Oh, the Alec Baldwin ‘Rust’ shooting. That was a Thursday,” she quickly responded.</p> <p> March 4, 2019? “Luke Perry died,” she stated, noting she never watched the actor’s show, but rather just heard about his passing. “ My mom took me home for lunch, and I remember in the car we had the radio on and they said Luke Perry passed away.” That is all it took for her to remember this detail four-and-a-half years later.</p> <p> <img src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/3/23/emily-nash--ctv-w5-1-6819460-1711199260433.jpeg" alt=""><span>Emily Nash said her memories are filed in a mental calendar, in video form (CTV W5) </span></p> <p> Emily said her memories are filed in a mental calendar, in video form. “Each day kind of represents a little movie, where I can rewind and fast forward and replay various points throughout my day,” she said.</p> <p> Her parents, Jason Nash and Julie Farnworth, said they spotted Emily’s uncanny recall as a young child.</p> <p> Her father, Jason, said he would show Emily a series of coloured bowling pins for about 10 seconds and then spin her around, asking her to name the order they were in.</p> <p> “She would knock them off right away in terms of identifying every pin, in terms of, you know, red, yellow, green, blue,” he said.</p> <p> Her mother, Julie, discovered Emily -- at age five -- could watch a Peanuts cartoon and then recall and repeat the dialogue from any point in the episode.</p> <p> “We knew that at that point in time there was something going on with her memory, but we couldn't quite pinpoint what it was like. So we thought we should just let it develop a little more naturally on its own to try and figure out what it is,” Julie said.</p> <p> They finally figured it out, coincidentally, on Remembrance Day 2021.</p> <ul>  <li> <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/app"><strong>The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App</strong></a></li> </ul> <ul>  <li> <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters"><strong>Sign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips</strong></a></li> </ul> <p> As Julie was designing a tombstone for her parents, she was asked by the headstone designer for specific dates of their births and marriage. Julie joked that she would contact “Wikipedia” -- the family pet name for Emily -- who rapidly texted back all the correct dates.</p> <p> That’s when the headstone designer suggested Emily might have the same sort of unusual memory first documented in a "60 Minutes" program from 2010, featuring American actress Marilu Henner. The Broadway star and main character of the 1970s sitcom “Taxi” revealed she has a super autobiographical memory for dates and events.</p> <p> “It was a jaw-dropping moment when I realized the similarities," said Julie, after watching the documentary program. That's when the pointed questions to their daughter began.</p> <p> “We said, ‘well, can you name the day of the week? Can you go back, you know, a year and tell us exactly what you did on that date? You know, what were you wearing? What did you eat?’ She was able to explain all those things,” said Jason. For Emily, it was validation that she wasn’t, as she puts, it “weird.”</p> <p> “Knowing that other people have it in the world, I just felt so much relief knowing that I'm not alone,” she said.</p> <p> <img src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/3/23/emily-nash-was-formally-tested-by-scientists-1-6819462-1711199410329.jpg" alt=""><span>Emily Nash was formally tested by scientists at Northwestern University in Chicago, and by Carmen Westerberg, a psychology and sleep researcher at Texas State University (CTV W5).</span></p> <p> Emily was then formally tested by scientists at Northwestern University in Chicago, and by Carmen Westerberg, a psychology and sleep researcher at Texas State University. The test usually involves giving someone random dates, asking them to specify the day of the week, personal experiences, along with verifiable events around that time.</p> <p> But because Emily is among the youngest the team had assessed, they had to adjust the screening questions to adapt to the life experiences of a teen.</p> <p> “That was one thing that stuck out," said Westerberg. Any time we asked her a pop culture question, she was all over it, but she didn't have as much knowledge about world events.”</p> <p> CTV W5 was able to film a sample test, where Emily was asked about a variety of dates, starting with Nov. 26, 2021.</p> <p> “That was a Friday,” said Emily.</p> <p> “Do you recall a verifiable event from around that time?” asked Westerberg.</p> <p> “Let's see,” said Emily, who then amazingly rattled off a comprehensive list.</p> <p> “A Netflix film called ‘Tick, Tick Boom’ was released on Nov. 10th, 2021.</p> <p> “’The House of Gucci,’ released Nov. 24th, 2021.</p> <p> “’West Side Story’ -- that came in theaters Dec. 3rd, I'm pretty sure, 2021,” she said.</p> <p> She was 100 percent correct.</p> <p> When Emily was asked if she wanted researchers to help understand HSAM to see if it might unlock clues to help those with memory loss, she didn’t hesitate. She lives with the memory of watching two of her grandparents suffer because of dementia. “ I want to help in the best way possible with my memory,” said Emily.</p> <h2> Super memory as a way of tackling memory loss</h2> <p> Scientists only began studying HSAM in 2006. They have confirmed it’s not related to IQ and that those with superior memory don’t use tricks to remember. It is found more often in people with obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), though in Emily’s case her mother confirms her only obsession is her school work.</p> <p> The most intriguing discovery of people with HSAM, say scientists, is that their memories don’t decay like the vast majority of people. “They're not really taking in more information. It's just that they are not forgetting it like most people do.” said Westerberg.</p> <p> In a world where there are an estimated 10 million people a year developing memory loss linked to dementia and Alzheimers, HSAM is a “juicy phenomenon,” according to Giuliana Mazzoni, a researcher at the University of Rome.</p> <p> Mazzoni is studying the phenomenon in a group of Italians with HSAM because of the intriguing lessons they may hold. Westerberg agrees, saying, “If we can figure out what's going right with memory, maybe we can help with what's going wrong.”</p> <p> Mazzoni is among a group of scientists who are trying to identify the regions of the brain that appear more active in those with highly superior autobiographical memory. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945219300887?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Her early work </a>suggested more grey matter in parts of the brain along with a higher emphasis on visual recording of daily events.</p> <p> There are also tests starting to apply what’s being learned. A group of patients with early Alzheimer’s disease are receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation, targeting the circuit identified in HSAM as part of a trial at the University of Perugia and University of Trento. The question: will the signals improve patients memory?</p> <p> <img src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/3/23/the-experiment-is-led-by-prof--costanza-papagno-1-6819455-1711198823110.jpeg" alt=""><span>The experiment is led by Prof. Costanza Papagno, professor of neurology at the University of Trento (Photo courtesy of Costanza Papagno)</span></p> <h2> Emily’s sleep</h2> <p> The study that Emily has signed up for has her putting on her pajamas.</p> <p> In a sleep laboratory in the basement of a building on the campus of Texas State University, in Austin, a technician glues sensors to her head and chest for an overnight sleep study. It’s all in the name of dementia research.</p> <p> Sleep is where scientists believe memories are cemented into the brain.</p> <p> Westerberg and colleagues at Northwestern University in Chicago have been probing how sleep might help those with superior autobiographical memory. The team is about halfway through a study comparing 12 adults with HSAM against 24 normal controls. Emily is patient number nine.</p> <p> Both groups, says Westerberg, sleep about the same total time. But those with HSAM differ in one important area -- sleep spindles.</p> <ul>  <li> <strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech">Top science and technology headlines, all in one place</a></strong></li> </ul> <p> On an electroencephalogram (EEG), the test used to track brain waves during sleep, spindles look like random, tiny, jagged lines along the otherwise smooth brain signals of early sleep. But this pattern is how some scientists think our brains synchronize memories and deposit them for future use.</p> <p> As Westerberg compares the results, she says she is finding people with HSAM have more sleep spindles, almost double, than people with normal memory, along with an unusual pattern with the early slow ways of sleep. She calls it “exciting.”</p> <p> “This is suggesting that maybe they are consolidating their memories of what happened to them during the day more strongly or more efficiently than other people, which could help explain why they're not forgetting as much,” Westerberg said.</p> <p> Her study will be completed later in 2024, but it does raise some tantalizing possibilities.</p> <p> People with cognitive decline and dementia have often troubled sleep and, interestingly, disrupted or abnormal <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32853916/" target="_blank">sleep spindles</a> and slow wave phase sleep patterns. So could helping restore normal sleep and those spindles improve their memories? Westerberg points to studies that show some sleep medications have been shown to increase spindles, and slow wave sleep.</p> <p> “By getting better sleep and, in particular, you know, these slow oscillations linked with the sleep spindles…maybe that could improve memory,” she said.</p> <h2> The road forward for a girl who can’t forget</h2> <p> As soon as Emily returned from testing in Austin, she began to receive acceptance from every university program to which she applied. Her plan is a career in scientific research.</p> <p> “I'm thinking either like biomedical science, biotechnology,” she said.</p> <p> Emily has another shorter term goal. That is to meet others with this “gift.” While HSAM has its benefits, there is a serious drawback. Those with superior memory remember the good, but they will also never forget the bad. They feel the pain as if it were today. Some with HSAM struggle with anxiety and depression as a result.</p> <p> While Emily hasn’t yet suffered much rejection or loss, she’s felt the sting of the past hurts. “It's like I just re-lived them 5 minutes ago. So it can be difficult for me to push through,” said Emily.</p> <p> That’s why Julie, a psychiatric nurse, is putting great effort into coaching her daughter on how to manage that burden.</p> <p> “I've tried to teach her that everybody has heartbreak. That is part of life,” said Julie. “There will be breakups, and she has to expect that, and it's part of our growth.”</p> <p> But it worries Julie. “I won't lie. Sometimes it does keep me up at night thinking,....how will it be for her? I don't think any of us can quite conceptualize what it will be like for her” she said.</p> <ul>  <li> <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters"><strong>5 Things to Know newsletter: Sign up to start your day with the top stories</strong></a></li> </ul> <p> Markie Pasternak said she can understand Emily’s situation, perfectly.</p> <p> The 29-year-old from Minneapolis discovered she had HSAM while sitting in a university class, discussing the power of memory and posting blogs on her website, <a href="https://livingwithtotalrecall.home.blog/" target="_blank">Living with Total Recall</a>.</p> <p> Pasternak has met three others with HSAM. Emily is her fourth.</p> <p> “I think it's courageous. I think it's courageous to take that step, to admit that you have this,” said Pasternak of Emily’s decision to go public. They chatted for about half-an-hour by Zoom as Emily, clearly happy to meet someone from her unusual tribe, asked a raft of questions.</p> <p> “How does your memory work? Like, mine's like a calendar,” she said.</p> <p> Markie described hers as more of a board game. “Each day is different, like square and like, they're different colors, and it kind of zig zags around. It's almost like I can go forward and backwards,” she said.</p> <p> “Do you let people know that you have HSAM or do you wait until it's brought up?” asked Emily.</p> <p> “With friendships and acquaintances and stuff or work, even, I just wait until it comes up, and it usually does,” responded Markie, warning that there is a vulnerability to allowing people to ask her to pull up memories. Some may bring happiness, others, sharp pain.</p> <p> “It’s like my most precious gem, my like, most … sacred thing to me,” said Markie, describing her memories. “And I'm going to open up to you and you can ask me any day in my life and I'm going to tell you what I did that day.”</p> <p> Another question: “Does your brain ever stop thinking? Or is your brain just flying with memories like 24-7?” asked Emily.</p> <p> “My default was always just reminiscing, nostalgia,” said Markie, who added she copes by journaling. “I've learned to compartmentalize (and) have worked on my own mental health, too, and my own personal boundaries with that,” she said.</p> <p> The most important advice she offered Emily is that if you can’t forget, you need to cultivate forgiveness.</p> <p> “Everyone gets hurt by other people at some point because we're all human. And most people, again, they have their forgetfulness to kind of ease that and move on,” said Markie. “We don't have that. And so we have to rely so hard on the virtue of forgiveness and recognizing that people are human and they make mistakes.”</p> <h2> Think you have HSAM? Test it out</h2> <p> While there are only about 100-200 verified cases of HSAM in the world, scientists suspect there are many more.</p> <p> Prof. Valerio Santangelo, a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Perugia in Italy, has calculated that theoretically 0.01 per cent of the population could have a highly superior autobiographical memory. That could mean 700,000 people around the world who fit the criteria but have not been formally tested.</p> <p> Part of this may be because there have been few scientists studying this form of memory, and has to be culturally and age appropriate. In Emily’s case, researchers at Northwestern University and The University of Texas, Austin, had to make questions appropriate for an 18-year-old who prefers movies and music to world affairs.</p> <p> While there is no online screening tool, Dr. James McGaugh, a now retired professor emeritus at the <a href="https://cnlm.uci.edu/" target="_blank">Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory</a> at the University of California, Irvine, who helped discover HSAM, told CTV’s W5 that people can start with their own screening test.</p> <p> They begin by selecting well-known events and asking the person for the date and the day of the week when the event occurred.</p> <p> They can also randomly select a day or date, and ask for verifiable events around that date.</p> <p> He added that “it is critically important to emphasize that HSAM is a strong ability to recall autobiographical experiences, along with the day and dates.” In creating questions, the advice is to use events that are noteworthy and that occurred after the test subject was about 15 years old.</p> <p> <strong>For example: </strong></p> <p> <em>Day and Date of Super Bowl in 2015?</em></p> <p> Answer: Feb. 1.</p> <p> <em>Day and Date of Canadian Thanksgiving in 2017?</em></p> <p> Answer: Monday, Oct. 9, 2017.</p> <p> Or you can ask, <em>what event occurred Feb 1, 2015? </em></p> <p> Answer: The Superbowl.</p> <p> Researchers use something called the "10 Date Quiz," using randomly selected dates, picked by an <a href="https://www.random.org/calendar-dates/" target="_blank">online calculator like this one</a>.</p> <p> Test subjects get a point for identifying the event, the day of the week, the month and the year.</p> <p> Individuals were asked to provide three different categories of information for each of the 10 dates generated:</p> <p> (1) the day of the week;</p> <p> (2) a description of a verifiable event that could be confirmed via an online search</p> <p> (3) a description of a personal autobiographical event the individual participated in.</p> <p> That’s a maximum of three possible points per date and 30 total. The percentage scored for each category (date/day/event) as well as the total score, the average of all three categories, was calculated.</p> <p> A total score of 65 per cent indicates that a person is likely to have HSAM and would merit further testing by researchers at a center studying this autobiographical memory.</p> <p> <em>Watch W5's documentary 'Total Recall' in our video player at the top of this article</em></p> <p> <em>With files from producers&nbsp;</em><em>Maya Hamovitch and&nbsp;</em><em>Kevin O'Keefe</em></p>

<p><span><em><span>Background notes about the satellites</span></em></span></p>
<p>The 2024 TSE could be a meteorological challenge.&nbsp; While the <em>Eclipsophile</em> climate studies are useful for long-range planning, they becomes less and less helpful when eclipse day is less than a week away. By late March, 2024, eclipse-day tactics should turn to the regular long- and short-range forecasts available from a number of agencies. On the day before the eclipse, numerical forecasts have lost much of their value and should be augmented by satellite and radar data and by reports from surface weather stations.</p>
<p>Satellites maintain a continuous watch across North America and the satellite of choice for this event is <em>GOES East</em>, located over the equator and streaming images at 5-minute intervals. There are many public and commercial web sites that can do proper justice to the resolution of GOES E imagery, but you will probably appreciate those that show full-colour images.</p>

Note that night has fallen over the Atlantic and eastern seaboard where cloud depictions have a different appearance.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This eclipse comes in the middle of the day for the most part and so satellite images in visible wavelengths will be available for a few hours before the shadow reaches Mazatlán and for the whole day by the time it reaches Bonavista, Newfoundland. Even so, if you anticipate a long trip to clear skies, you will have to make use of the infrared images, which work at night.</p>
<p>The raw satellite data arrive at receiving stations as gray-scale images in many different wavelengths. Among those wavelengths, the current mix of geostationary satellites collect scenes in red, green, and blue frequencies during the daytime—a mixture that can be combined into a colour image as long as the Sun is up. When the Sun is down, a “pseudo-colour” image can be assembled from a mix of infrared wavelengths that mimics the appearance of daytime clouds (Figure 1). The day and night images merge well together—almost seamlessly—and now many sites offer the combination (GEOCOLOR) on their web sites.</p>
<p>Images from single wavebands are also commonly available, and you may wish to look at some of these, most likely at night if you are confronted by a difficult situation such as overnight fog.</p>
<p>For the most part, images from one Internet site are similar to those from another, but they differ in their interfaces and ability to zoom. The capability to put highways and station reports on top of the satellite image in the College of Dupage site could be valuable in a difficult, fast-changing situation.</p>
<p><em><span>A short primer on numerical models</span></em></p>
<p>Satellite photos are OK for what is happening now, but they are pretty limited in predicting what the weather will do two days in the future.&nbsp; For that information, we need to use computer forecasts (usually referred to as numerical forecasts or model forecasts). There are many types of numerical forecasts,&nbsp; way more than a dozen if you go looking. They are usually models run by countries for their own interests, but they share the code used in the models, so they are not completely independent of each other.</p>
<p><span>Types of models</span></p>
<p>There are two types of models: global long-range ones and regional short-range forecasts. In the U.S., the main long-range model is the GFS (15 days); short-range models are the NAM (84 hours), the RAP (21 hours), and the HRRR (18 hours). Canada contributes the GDPS for long range (15 days), and the RDPS (84 hours).&nbsp; The most commonly used European long-range model is the ECMWF, generally regarded as the most reliable, but it’s a commercial product and you have to look around to get the parts of it you’d like, but it’s readily available on windy.com. There are many more, especially if you chase eclipses somewhere other than North America.</p>
<p>For the most part (but changing rapidly), long-range models have lower resolution than short-range versions. Windy.com displays the model resolutions on their menu page: ECMWF, 9 km; GFS, 22 km; ICON, 13 km; NAM, 5 km; HRRR, 3 km. High resolution doesn’t necessarily mean better, but high-resolution models do update more frequently, essentially updating the forecast. The differences between the models are embedded in the code that runs the models, and so are not visible to you. The internal bits include such things as how cloud cover and precipitation are calculated, so you must expect some substantial differences between models. With luck (?), they will converge on the correct answer as eclipse day approaches.</p>
<p>A special type of numerical forecast is a type called an ensemble model. These show an average of many different model calculations (runs), each one slightly varying the starting parameters. There are several of them available at Pivotal Weather, but only the American GEFS and Canada’s CMCE show cloud cover. The CFS climate model available on Pivotal Weather goes out for 32 days, well past eclipse time, but the day-to-day forecasts are so erratic that they can’t be used for planning. It is designed for long-range climate predictions.</p>
<p>Almost all of the commonly available forecast outputs in North America are models maintained by NOAA’s modelling arm, including those that are presented in your evening news broadcast. Only a few of the largest private companies maintain their own models. For the most part, large commercial companies don’t give you much choice on satellite images or numerical models, but they’ll probably focus on where to watch the eclipse on the days ahead and that professional opinion could be invaluable.</p>
<p><span>How do you handle all of this?</span></p>
<p>Pick two long-range and two short-range models and run with them. I guarantee total confusion if you use more—they are just too variable unless eclipse day is nearby.</p>
<p>Commercial sites usually only show you “their” model, as they don’t want to imply that there is some uncertainty in the future they foresee. In many cases, their model is the National Weather Service model with some fancy graphics attached.</p>
<p><span>Don’t rely on models until eclipse day is around the corner</span></p>
<p>A word of caution: models aren’t really very good until about a week ahead of an event, and should improve steadily as the moment approaches. You might use the NAM and the RDPS for the two-three days ahead of the eclipse and the long-range models before. Once the models start to look like each other, with similar cloud patterns and precipitation amounts and when successive model runs keep the same forecast, you can begin to trust them. There will always be differences between them, but even that will tell you where things are uncertain and help you decide whether you might want to move to a spot where they all agree about good weather.</p>
<p>When eclipse day arrives and the weather at your site is looking iffy, the local weather channel or a satellite image may be all that you need. For the most part, it concentrates on what’s happening now and what will happen in the next few hours. That may be all you need. In the end, preparation and mobility will be important contributors to your success.</p>
<p>Good luck on eclipse day. Don’t forget to watch the shadow go by in the satellite images afterward.</p>
