<p><span id="description">A big percentage of so-called experts today only know how to configure some kind of hype-tool, but they understand nothing about how things work at the deeper level. This is a real challenge and a big problem for the future.</span></p>

<p>A steering wheel is an abstraction that makes it easier for me to drive my car. Power steering is yet another level of abstraction that further improves the driving experience. Abstractions are nice, they generally improve the quality of life. However, in Denmark we have a proverb that says:</p>

<blockquote>Too little and too much spoils everything.</blockquote>

<p>What good does an abstraction do when it breaks and nobody any longer understands how the technology under the hood works?</p>

<p>Everything in the tech industry is driven with a very hardcore eye for profit and very little interest in anything else. So you need to be able to push out new products or new services as fast as possible. This means more abstraction and more automation, less and less people, and less deeper understanding.</p>

<p>Today programmers and system administrators no longer exist, instead we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> and even <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/DevSecOps">DevSecOps</a>, in which the industry is trying very hard to stuff every single task into the job description of a single individual. The tech guys needs to do development (Dev), security (Sec) and operations (Ops), i.e. system administration, but since no single individual can truly master all that, we need to automate as much as possible in order to save money and avoid the complexities of human social interaction between different tech departments. As a result, the modern tech person is only taught about how to use specific tools, he or she then knows very little about the technology under the hood.</p>

<p>It doesn't help that technology has become increasingly difficult to understand, but more and more of modern life depends heavily upon the tech we're using. So what is going to happen when the level of understanding in the tech industry reaches such a low point in which the majority of people don't even know how to fix the tools they are using?</p>

<p>"Manual scene" from the WALL-E movie.</p>

<p>People have become accustomed to the state of abstraction and they think it's the correct approach and they happily contribute to the mess by adding even more abstraction.</p>

<blockquote>Yes, let's all go back to coding in assembly!<p>― Sarcastic comment by arrogant developer</p></blockquote>

<p>We need abstractions, no doubt about it, but every level of abstraction comes with a price which, ironically enough, eventually can cause a massive loss in profit.</p>

<p>Already now a majority of "security people" know very little about security and only about how to use some kind of pre-made penetration testing tool. The penetration testing tool shows a bunch of green lights in its web GUI board and all is assumed well. Yet, a real security expert with evil intentions has broken the system long ago and keeps selling valuable data on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet">darknet</a>. Nothing is leaked and nothing is discovered. This can go on for years without anyone finding out because, well, the GUI board says that all is <span>OK</span>.</p>

<h2>A simple case example</h2>

<p>One company I helped with security had used a third party developer firm who hired these exact types of people. The developers knew how to put together a website and an API using a "modern framework", but did not understand much of the coding of the framework itself and nothing about security, and as soon as problems began occurring, nobody could figure out what was going on. They had actually been struggling with the situation for months before they finally decided to reach out for help.</p>

<p>It was clear, just by looking at how bad everything was performing, that something was wrong. I copied everything for offline scrutiny and went straight to the code of the system and spend an evening looking through lines of code, file by file, doing some simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diffing</a> between some of the original framework files and the files running on the company host machines. Just looking through code and files.</p>

<p>Of course, it was not my intention to look through everything, but it is often surprising just how much you can learn from a bit of manual inspection. Often the truth lies just beneath the surface and with a little patience you can find it. This requires of course that you have more than just a basic understanding of how the technology works. Some students today apparently <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/21/09/27/2032200/students-dont-know-what-files-and-folders-are-professors-say">don't even know what files and folders are</a>?</p>

<p>Long story short, in the specific case, it turned out that they had been hacked and the system was being used as some kind of back-end distribution database for porn and other stuff. The performance problems was not caused by the hacking, but by the framework itself, which was horribly slow (no surprise there). The hacking was rather discrete and would most likely never had be discovered where it not because I decided to "poke around" and actually physically look at files and code.</p>

<h2>Advice to people studying technology</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Never just follow hype or trends.</li>
  <li>Be curious. Don't just learn tools, try to understand how the underlying technology works.</li>
  <li>If possible, try at least once to manually do what e.g. a configuration tool does for you.</li>
  <li>If possible, try to look at the code for the tool. Even a basic understanding of the code can be very valuable.</li>
  <li>Stay curious. Keep learning. Experiment. Dive deeper into the technology that interests you. If possible, set up a homelab and use it as a playground for learning and breaking things.</li>
  <li>Question everything. Especially things that don't make any sense to you. Don't just assume that someone else knows better - that's how you quickly turn into a blind follower. Sometimes someone else truly knows better, but don't just assume that to be the case by default. And be brave! Stand by the truth and your convictions even if that makes you feel like you stand alone.<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/blind-following.webp" alt="People blindly following eachother"></p></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitch will now let its creators simultaneously stream across any live streaming service, the company announced on Friday as part of <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2023/10/20/everything-we-announced-at-twitchcon-las-vegas/">a big batch of news from TwitchCon</a>. Previously, streamers could simulcast <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/23/23317939/twitch-ends-partner-exclusivity-youtube-tiktok-facebook-gaming">on mobile platforms</a> like TikTok and Instagram, but as of Friday, Twitch is significantly broadening where streamers can simultaneously go live. (Well, assuming the streamers don’t have a Twitch exclusivity agreement in place.)</p><p>As of late, some Twitch streamers have been exploring options on other platforms. Big names like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/17/23764530/twitch-star-felix-xqc-lengyel-has-signed-a-100-million-deal-with-rival-platform-kick">xQc</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amouranth-gives-twitch-the-boot-as-kick-steals-second-streaming-star-in-under-2-days/">Amouranth</a>, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2023/10/19/kick-signs-nickmercs-nick-kolcheff--to-10-million-deal/?sh=6fe7cc994c66">Nickmercs</a> have signed major deals with Twitch competitor Kick this year; xQc’s and Nickmercs’ deals are non-exclusive, and given that Amouranth has a video on her Twitch account from a couple months ago, it seems hers is non-exclusive, too. Ninja dropped his exclusive contract with Twitch <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ninja-drops-twitch-exclusivity-and-starts-streaming-on-youtube-facebook-and-more/">in September 2022</a> so he could simulcast on multiple platforms. (He dined with Twitch CEO Dan Clancy <a href="https://twitter.com/djclancy999/status/1709393663975960825">earlier this month</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Ninja/status/1715442576793465285">seems pleased with Friday’s news</a>.) </p><p>There are a few guidelines for Twitch’s new simulcasting policy, <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/simulcasting-guidelines?language=en_US">according to a support document</a>. Streamers will have to make sure the quality of their stream on Twitch is “no less than the experience on other platforms or services.” Streamers “should not” share links to their Twitch community to their simulcasts on other platforms. (Streamers can still share links to third-party websites on their About pages on their channels, they just can’t link out to their other simulcasts while they’re also live on Twitch.) And streamers can’t use third-party services to do things like merge chat across platforms.</p><p>At some point in the future, Twitch says it will add a tool so that streamers can indicate that they are simulcasting.</p><p>Twitch also announced a big update to its off-service conduct policy. “To further protect our streamers, we’re&nbsp;<strong>adding doxxing and swatting to the list of Off-Service Conduct</strong>&nbsp;behaviors we will enforce against,” the company says (emphasis Twitch’s), and the changes are in effect as of Friday. The addition of doxxing to the policy follows a recent controversy involving <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/jacksfilms-sssniperwolf-doxxing-allegations-youtube-response-rcna121297">YouTuber Jacksfilms accusing SSSniperWolf of doxxing him</a> in an Instagram story; on Friday, YouTube announced it would be temporarily <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1715406957736038476?s=20">demonetizing SSSniperWolf’s channel</a> and SSSniperWolf posted <a href="https://twitter.com/sssniperwolf/status/1715417126113362219?s=20">an apology on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p><p>Twitch revealed some product changes, too. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23644633/twitch-monetization-ad-incentive-program-guest-star">Guest Star</a>, which lets streamers host co-streams with others, will now be named Stream Together and will be getting features like the ability to merge chats. Twitch says a version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23842075/twitch-tiktok-style-discovery-feed">its TikTok-style Discovery Feed</a> that surfaces live channels is in testing. And Twitch’s own alerts system for notifications like subscribers and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/27/12041426/twitch-streaming-real-money-bits-emotes-cheer-feature">Bits donations</a> will “soon” support a streamer’s custom animated emotes.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>This note documents one of my recent adventures in performance
optimization with Rust. By following along, hopefully you’ll learn
something about how to write fast Rust.</p>
<p>Here’s the context: imagine you have data from an online exam where a
set of users answered a set of questions. The raw data looks like
this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">[</span>
<span id="cb1-2">  {</span>

<span id="cb1-13">]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that each user only answered a subset of all possible questions,
and all scores are either 0 or 1.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: given a size

questions has the highest correlation with overall performance? We’ll
call this the <strong>k-CorrSet problem</strong>. A simple brute-force
algorithm for solving the k-CorrSet problem looks like this
pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>func k_corrset($data, $k):
  $all_qs = all questions in $data
  for all $k-sized subsets $qs within $all_qs:
    $us = all users that answered every question in $qs
    $qs_totals = the total score on $qs of each user in $us
    $grand_totals = the grand score on $all_qs of each user in $us
    $r = correlation($qs_totals, $grand_totals)
  return $qs with maximum $r    </code></pre>
<p>We are going to implement several variations on this algorithm to see
how fast we can make it.</p>
<h2 id="python-baseline">Python Baseline</h2>
<p>When I do data analysis, I usually start with Python and then
transition to Rust when I need better speed or memory consumption. So as
a baseline, let’s look at a straightforward <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> program for solving
k-CorrSet:</p>

<p>This uses a bit of <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/advanced.html">MultiIndex</a>
magic, but don’t sweat the details. Let’s start benchmarking. First, we
need data. To make the benchmark realistic, I generated synthetic data
that roughly matches the properties of my actual data. The properties of
the synthetic data are:</p>
<ul>
<li>60,000 users</li>
<li>200 questions</li>
<li>20% sparsity (i.e., 12,000 users answered each question)</li>
<li>Each score is equally likely 1 or 0</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal will be to compute k-CorrSet on this dataset for k = 5 in a
reasonable amount of time on my 2021 M1 Macbook Pro. Note that there are
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mfrac linethickness="0px"><mn>200</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\binom{200}{5}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
= 2.5 billion combinations of questions, so we need the inner loop of
the brute-force algorithm to be quite fast.</p>
<p>Using Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time"><code>time.time()</code></a>
function, I computed the speed of the inner loop for 1,000 iterations
running with CPython 3.9.17. The average execution time was <strong>36
milliseconds</strong>. Not too bad, but at this rate, the full
computation would complete in <strong>2.9 years</strong>. Let’s make
that faster!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: there are lots of ways we could make the Python code faster,
but the point of this post isn’t to compare highly-optimized Python to
highly-optimized Rust. The point is to compare
“standard-Jupyter-notebook” Python to highly-optimized Rust.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rust-reimplementation">Rust Reimplementation</h2>
<p>We can start optimizing by reimplementing the Python code into a
roughly equivalent Rust program, expecting some free speedups from
Rust’s compiler optimizations. For readability, all the code below is a
simplification of the actual benchmark. For instance, I will omit
<code>#[derive]</code>s on types, and I will coalesce disparate blocks
of code into straight-line functions. You can see the full benchmark
here: <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/corrset-benchmark">https://github.com/willcrichton/corrset-benchmark</a></p>
<p>First, we translate the data types:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> User(<span>pub</span> <span>String</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"></span>

<span id="cb4-4"></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> Row <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">  <span>pub</span> user<span>:</span> User<span>,</span></span>

<span id="cb4-9"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We make <code>User</code> and <code>Question</code> into newtypes
both for clarity and so we can implement traits on them. Then, the basic
k-CorrSet algorithm is implemented as follows:</p>

<p>The key elements to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like with Python, we convert the flat data into hierarchical data
with a hashmap and the <code>utils::group_by</code> helper. (Note that
everywhere we refer to <code>HashMap</code> is actually an alias for <a href="https://docs.rs/fxhash/0.2.1/fxhash/type.FxHashMap.html"><code>fxhash::FxHashMap</code></a>,
which is just <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html"><code>std::collections::HashMap</code></a>
with a more efficient hashing algorithm.)</li>
<li>Then we iterate over all combinations of questions using the <a href="https://docs.rs/itertools/0.11.0/itertools/trait.Itertools.html#method.combinations"><code>Itertools::combinations</code></a>
method.</li>
<li>In the inner loop, we iterate over all users via
<code>all_grand_totals.iter()</code>.</li>
<li>The expression <code>q_to_score[*q].get(u).copied()</code> has type
<code>Option&lt;u32&gt;</code>, which is <code>Some(n)</code> if the
user has a score for <code>q</code>, and <code>None</code>
otherwise.</li>
<li>The iterator method <code>.sum::&lt;Option&lt;u32&gt;&gt;()</code>
returns <code>Some(total)</code> if the user answered every question in
<code>qs</code>, and <code>None</code> otherwise.</li>
<li>We call a helper method <code>utils::correlation</code> that
implements a standard calculation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">Pearson’s
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">r</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></a>.</li>
<li>We use <code>max_by_key</code> to get the questions with the highest
correlation. We use <a href="https://docs.rs/float-ord/0.3.2/float_ord/struct.FloatOrd.html"><code>FloatOrd</code></a>
so we can compare floats.</li>
</ul>
<p>So how’s the performance? I used <a href="https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html">Criterion</a>
to benchmark the performance of the inner loop (the
<code>filter_map</code>) with Criterion’s default settings, using the
same dataset as before. The new inner loop runs in <strong>4.2
milliseconds</strong>, which is about 8 times faster than the Python
baseline! But our full computation is still 124 days, which is too long.
Now let’s start really optimizing.</p>
<h2 id="indexed-data">Indexed Data</h2>
<p>Rather than guess how to optimize the code, let’s run a profiler to
see where the bottleneck is. On my Mac, I usually use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruments_(software)">Instruments.app</a>,
but recently I tried <a href="https://github.com/mstange/samply/">samply</a> and wow! It’s much
nicer to use. Samply seems to work better with Rust both in terms of
symbol demangling and in terms of reconstructing the call stack. Here’s
a screenshot of the relevant part of the samply trace for the Rust
implementation so far:</p>
<p><img src="https://willcrichton.net/notes/k-corrset/img/profile-naive.png"></p>
<p>We’re spending 75% of our time in <code>HashMap::get</code>! This is
the offending line of code:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">q_to_score[<span>*</span>q]<span>.</span>get(u)<span>.</span>copied()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The problem is that we’re hashing and comparing 36-byte UUID strings,
which is expensive. We need a smaller type that can stand-in for the
question/user strings.</p>
<p>The solution is that we will collect all the questions and users into
a <code>Vec</code>, and represent each question/user by their index in
that <code>Vec</code>. We could just use <code>usize</code> indices with
the <code>Vec</code> type, but a better practice is to use newtypes to
represent each kind of index. In fact, this problem comes up so often in
my work that I’ve already made a crate for it, <a href="https://docs.rs/indexical/0.6.0/indexical/index.html">Indexical</a>
(which builds on the <a href="https://docs.rs/index_vec/0.1.3/index_vec/index.html">index_vec</a>
crate). We define those index types like this:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> QuestionRef<span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span>(<span>pub</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> Question)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> UserRef<span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span>(<span>pub</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> User)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>define_index_type!</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5">  <span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> QuestionIdx <span>for</span> QuestionRef<span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>u16</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><span>define_index_type!</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-9">  <span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> UserIdx <span>for</span> UserRef<span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>u32</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-10"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>QuestionRef</code> and <code>UserRef</code> types are
newtypes that enable us to implement traits on
<code>&amp;Question</code> and <code>&amp;User</code>. The
<code>define_index_type</code> macro creates new index types
<code>QuestionIdx</code> and <code>UserIdx</code> which are associated
with <code>QuestionRef</code> and <code>UserRef</code>. Those indices
are represented as <code>u16</code> and a <code>u32</code>,
respectively.</p>
<p>Finally we update <code>k_corrset</code> to generate an <a href="https://docs.rs/indexical/0.6.0/indexical/struct.IndexedDomain.html"><code>IndexedDomain</code></a>
for questions and users, and then use the <code>QuestionIdx</code> and
<code>UserIdx</code> types throughout the rest of the code:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>fn</span> k_corrset(data<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span>[Row]<span>,</span> k<span>:</span> <span>usize</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span>Question<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>

<p>Once again we run our benchmark on the inner loop of the computation.
The new inner loop runs in <strong>1.0 milliseconds</strong>, which is 4
times faster than our last iteration, and 35 times faster than our
Python baseline. We’re down to 30 days for the total computation — let’s
keep going!</p>
<h2 id="indexed-collections">Indexed Collections</h2>
<p>Let’s profile again:</p>
<p><img src="https://willcrichton.net/notes/k-corrset/img/profile-indexed.png"></p>
<p>Blast, still spending most our time in <code>HashMap::get</code>.
Well, what if we got rid of hash maps altogether? A
<code>HashMap&lt;&amp;User, u32&gt;</code> is conceptually the same
thing as a <code>Vec&lt;Option&lt;u32&gt;&gt;</code> where each
<code>&amp;User</code> has a unique index. For example, in a domain of
users <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>, then the hash map
<code>{"b" =&gt; 1}</code> is equivalent to the vector
<code>[None, Some(1), None]</code>. This vector costs more memory
(paying for the <code>None</code> spaces), but it improves the
performance of key/value lookups (avoids hashing).</p>
<p>We’re trying to fully optimize for performance, and given the scale
of our dataset, we can afford to make the compute/memory trade-off. We
will use Indexical which provides a <a href="https://docs.rs/indexical/0.6.0/indexical/map/struct.DenseIndexMap.html"><code>DenseIndexMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code></a>
type that is internally implemented as a <code>Vec&lt;V&gt;</code> type
indexed by <code>K::Index</code>.</p>
<p>The main change to the <code>k_corrset</code> function is that we
convert all our auxiliary data structures to dense index maps:</p>

<p>The only change to the inner loop is that our code which used to say
this:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">q_to_score[<span>*</span>q]<span>.</span>get(u)<span>.</span>copied()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Is now this:</p>

<p>Running the benchmark again, the new inner loop runs in <strong>181
microseconds</strong>, which is 6 times faster than our last iteration,
and 199 times faster than our Python baseline. We’re down to 5.3 days
for the total computation.</p>
<h2 id="bounds-checks">Bounds Checks</h2>
<p>Another small performance hit comes every time we use the brackets
<code>[]</code> to index into an <code>DenseIndexMap</code>. The vector
beneath will run a bounds-check for safety, but our code is guaranteed
to never exceed vector bounds as written. I couldn’t actually find the
bounds check in the samply profile, but it does make a noticeable
difference in the benchmark, so it’s worth implementing.</p>
<p>Before our inner loop looked like this:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>let</span> q_total <span>=</span> qs<span>.</span>iter()</span>
<span id="cb12-2">  <span>.</span>map(<span>|</span>q<span>|</span> q_to_score[<span>*</span>q][u])</span>
<span id="cb12-3">  <span>.</span><span>sum::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u32</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>()<span>?;</span></span>
<span id="cb12-4"><span>let</span> grand_total <span>=</span> all_grand_totals[u]<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Removing bounds checks with <code>get_unchecked</code>, our new inner
loop looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>let</span> q_total <span>=</span> qs<span>.</span>iter()</span>
<span id="cb13-2">  <span>.</span>map(<span>|</span>q<span>|</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3">    <span>let</span> u_scores <span>=</span> q_to_score<span>.</span>get_unchecked(q)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4">    <span>*</span>u_scores<span>.</span>get_unchecked(u)</span>
<span id="cb13-5">  <span>}</span>)</span>
<span id="cb13-6">  <span>.</span><span>sum::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u32</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>()<span>?;</span></span>

<p>It is unsafe without bounds-checks, so we have to mark these blocks
as <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
<p>Running the benchmark again, the new inner loop runs in <strong>156
microseconds</strong>, which is 1.16x faster than our last iteration,
and 229 times faster than our Python baseline. We’re down to 4.6 days
for the total computation.</p>
<h2 id="bit-sets">Bit-sets</h2>
<p>We’re currently at a 225x speedup, which means we still have three
orders of magnitude left to go. To get there, we need to rethink the
computational structure of the inner loop. Right now, our loop
effectively looks like:</p>
<pre><code>for each subset of questions $qs:
  for each user $u:
    for each question $q in $qs:
      if $u answered $q: add $u's score on $q to a running total
      else: skip to the next user
    $r = correlation($u's totals on $qs, $u's grand total)</code></pre>
<p>An important aspect of our data is that it forms a <em>sparse</em>
matrix. For a given question, only 20% of users have answered that
question. For a set of 5 questions, a much smaller fraction have
answered all 5 questions. So if we can efficiently determine first which
users have answered all 5 questions, then our subsequent loop will run
for fewer iterations (and be free of branches). Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>for each subset of questions $qs:
  $qs_u = all users who have answered every question in $qs
  for each user $u in $qs_u:
    for each question $q in $qs:
      add $u's score on $q to a running total
    $r = correlation($u's scores on $qs, $u's grand total)</code></pre>
<p>So how do we represent the set of users who have answered a given
question? We could use a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html"><code>HashSet</code></a>,
but we saw earlier that hashing is computationally expensive. Because
our data is indexed, we can use a more efficient data structure: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array">bit-set</a>, which uses
the individual bits of memory to represent whether an object is present
or absent in a set. Indexical provides another abstraction for
integratings bit-sets with our newtype indices: the <a href="https://docs.rs/indexical/0.6.0/indexical/struct.IndexSet.html"><code>IndexSet</code></a>.</p>
<p>Previously, our <code>q_to_score</code> data structure mapped from
questions to a user-indexed vector of optional scores (that is,
<code>UserMap&lt;'_, Option&lt;u32&gt;&gt;</code>). Now we will change
<code>Option&lt;u32&gt;</code> to <code>u32</code> and add a bit-set
describing the set of users who answered a given question. The first
half of the updated code looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>type</span> UserSet<span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> IndexSet<span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>,</span> UserRef<span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;&gt;;</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> q_to_score<span>:</span> QuestionMap<span>&lt;</span><span>'_</span><span>,</span> (UserSet<span>&lt;</span><span>'_</span><span>&gt;,</span> UserMap<span>&lt;</span><span>'_</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>&gt;</span>)<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> </span>
<span id="cb16-4">  <span>QuestionMap::</span>new(<span>&amp;</span>questions<span>,</span> <span>|</span>_<span>|</span> (</span>
<span id="cb16-5">    <span>UserMap::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'_</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>::</span>new(<span>&amp;</span>users<span>,</span> <span>|</span>_<span>|</span> <span>0</span>)<span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb16-6">    <span>UserSet::</span>new(<span>&amp;</span>users)<span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb16-7">  ))<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb16-8"><span>for</span> r <span>in</span> data <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb16-9">  <span>let</span> (scores<span>,</span> set) <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> q_to_score<span>.</span>get_mut(<span>&amp;</span>QuestionRef(<span>&amp;</span>r<span>.</span>question))<span>.</span>unwrap()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb16-10">  scores<span>.</span>insert(UserRef(<span>&amp;</span>r<span>.</span>user)<span>,</span> r<span>.</span>score)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb16-11">  set<span>.</span>insert(UserRef(<span>&amp;</span>r<span>.</span>user))<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb16-12"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>q_to_score</code> now effectively has invalid values,
since we provide a default value of 0 for users who did not answer a
question. We have to be careful not to use these invalid values in the
computation.</p>
<p>Then we update our inner loop to match the new pseudocode:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"><span>let</span> all_qs <span>=</span> questions<span>.</span>indices()<span>;</span></span>

<p>Running the benchmark again, the new inner loop runs in <strong>47
microseconds</strong>, which is 3.4 times faster than our last
iteration, and 769 times faster than our Python baseline. We’re down to
1.4 days for the total computation.</p>
<h2 id="simd">SIMD</h2>
<p>Our new computational structure is definitely helping, but it’s still
not fast enough. Let’s check back in with samply:</p>
<p><img src="https://willcrichton.net/notes/k-corrset/img/profile-bitset.png"></p>
<p>Now we’re spending all our time in the bit-set intersection! That
means we need to dig in to how the bit-set is implemented. The default
bit-set library used by Indexical is <a href="https://docs.rs/bitvec/1.0.1/bitvec/index.html">bitvec</a>. As of
2023, the implementation of intersection within bitvec’s bit-set is
roughly this code:</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><span>fn</span> intersect(dst<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> BitSet<span>,</span> src<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span>BitSet) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb18-2">  <span>for</span> (n1<span>,</span> n2)<span>:</span> (<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>u64</span>) <span>in</span> dst<span>.</span>iter_mut()<span>.</span>zip(<span>&amp;</span>src) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3">    <span>*</span>n1 <span>&amp;=</span> <span>*</span>n2<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb18-4">  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb18-5"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>So bitvec is AND-ing a <code>u64</code> at a time. But it turns out
most processors have instructions specifically for doing
bit-manipulation on multiple <code>u64</code>s at a time, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data">SIMD</a>
(single instruction, multiple data). Thankfully, Rust provides an
experimental SIMD API <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/index.html"><code>std::simd</code></a>
that we can use. Roughly speaking, the SIMD version of bit-set
intersection looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><span>fn</span> intersect(dst<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> SimdBitSet<span>,</span> src<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span>SimdBitSet) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb19-2">  <span>for</span> (n1<span>,</span> n2)<span>:</span> (<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> u64x4<span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span>u64x4) <span>in</span> dst<span>.</span>iter_mut()<span>.</span>zip(<span>&amp;</span>src) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3">    <span>*</span>n1 <span>&amp;=</span> <span>*</span>n2<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb19-4">  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb19-5"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The only difference is that we’ve replaced our primitive
<code>u64</code> type with a SIMD type <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/type.u64x4.html"><code>u64x4</code></a>,
and under the hood, Rust emits a single SIMD instruction to perform the
<code>&amp;=</code> operation that ANDs four <code>u64</code>s at a
time.</p>
<p>Where can we find a SIMD-accelerated bitset? <a href="https://docs.rs/bitvec/1.0.1/bitvec/index.html">bitvec</a> doesn’t
support SIMD. There are a few on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, and I tried out one called <a href="https://github.com/psiace/bitsvec">bitsvec</a>. It works well for
fast intersection, but I found that its iterator which finds the indices
of the 1-bits is actually quite slow. So I copied large portions of the
bitsvec implementation and wrote a more efficient iterator, which you
can check out in the <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/indexical/blob/913fbf5830f4d5acedd23e04841e453ed2659165/src/bitset/simd.rs">Indexical
source</a> if you’re curious.</p>
<p>Thanks to Indexical’s abstractions, swapping in the SIMD bitset only
requires changing a type alias and no other modifications to the
<code>k_corrset</code> function. I experimented with different lane
sizes and found <code>u64x16</code> is the most efficient on my machine
for this dataset.</p>
<p>Once more we run the benchmark, and the new inner loop runs in
<strong>1.35 microseconds</strong>, which is 34 times faster than our
last iteration, and 26,459 times faster than our Python baseline. We’re
down to 57 minutes for the total computation.</p>
<h2 id="allocation">Allocation</h2>
<p>At this point, we’re pretty close to peak performance. (You may not
like it, but…) Let’s go back to the profile, this time looking at the
inverted view (which shows the most-called functions at the leaves of
the call tree):</p>
<p><img src="https://willcrichton.net/notes/k-corrset/img/profile-simd.png"></p>
<p>The biggest bottleneck is our bit-set iterator! I wasn’t joking! But
we see several concerning functions: <code>memmove</code>,
<code>realloc</code>, <code>allocate</code> — that’s right, we’re
allocating memory in the inner loop of this function. Specifically,
there’s the user bit-set that we initially clone, and there’s the two
vectors for <code>qs_totals</code> and <code>grand_totals</code> that we
allocate with <code>unzip</code>.</p>
<p>To avoid allocation, we create these data structures up front with
the maximum possible size needed, and then repeatedly write into
them:</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>// Allocate our data up front</span></span>
<span id="cb20-2"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> qs_totals <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span>[<span>0</span><span>.;</span> users<span>.</span>len()]</span>

<p>We run the benchmark again, and the new inner loop runs in
<strong>1.09 microseconds</strong>, which is 1.24 times faster than our
last iteration, and 32,940 times faster than our Python baseline. We’re
down to 46 minutes for the total computation.</p>
<p>(As an aside, it’s impressive that the heap allocator was fast enough
to have such a small impact on our runtime!)</p>

<h2 id="parallelism">Parallelism</h2>
<p>At this point, we seem to have totally exhausted our avenues for
optimization. I actually can’t think of any other ways to make the inner
loop substantively faster — let me know if you have any ideas. But we’ve
left out one final, obvious trick: parallelism! This problem is
embarassingly parallel, so we can trivially parallelize the inner loop
over multiple cores. <a href="https://docs.rs/rayon/1.8.0/rayon/index.html">Rayon</a> makes this
a breeze:</p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><span>let</span> all_qs <span>=</span> questions<span>.</span>indices()<span>;</span></span>

<span id="cb21-8">    <span>}</span>)</span>
<span id="cb21-9">    <span>// same code as before</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>par_bridge</code> method takes a serial iterator and
converts it into a parallel iterator. The <code>map_init</code> function
is a parallel map with thread-specific state, so we preserve our
allocation-free status.</p>
<p>We need a different benchmark to evaluate the outer loop. I used
Criterion to run the outer loop over 5,000,000 question combinations in
a single run with a given strategy. This is enough executions to reveal
differences in each outer loop without waiting weeks for the benchmark
to complete.</p>
<p>Running this benchmark with the serial strategy over the fastest
inner loop takes <strong>6.8 seconds</strong>. My Macbook Pro has 10
cores, so with Rayon we should expect to see close to a 10x speedup.
After benchmarking the parallel strategy, we get… <strong>4.2
seconds</strong> to complete 5,000,000 combinations. That’s only a 1.6x
speedup! Shameful!</p>
<h2 id="batching">Batching</h2>
<p>Let’s go back to the profile to investigate our lack of scaling:</p>
<p><img src="https://willcrichton.net/notes/k-corrset/img/profile-parallel.png"></p>
<p>Our threads are spending most of their time locking and unlocking a
mutex! There’s some kind of synchronization bottleneck. Indeed, if we
read the <a href="https://docs.rs/rayon/1.8.0/rayon/iter/trait.ParallelBridge.html"><code>par_bridge</code>
documentation</a> carefully, we’ll find a key sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iterator items are pulled by <code>next()</code> one at a time,
synchronized from each thread that is ready for work, so this may become
a bottleneck if the serial iterator can’t keep up with the parallel
demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that the hand-off between the
<code>Itertools::combinations</code> iterator and the Rayon parallel
bridge is too slow. Given that we have a huge number of combinations, a
simple way to avoid this bottleneck is to increase the granularity of
task assignment. That is, we can batch together many question
combinations and pass them off to a thread all at once.</p>
<p>For this task, I defined a quick-and-dirty batching iterator that
uses an <a href="https://docs.rs/arrayvec/0.7.4/arrayvec/struct.ArrayVec.html"><code>ArrayVec</code></a>
to avoid allocation.</p>
<div id="cb22"><pre><code><span id="cb22-1"><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> Batched<span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> N<span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span> I<span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>

<span id="cb22-6">  <span>type</span> Item <span>=</span> ArrayVec<span>&lt;</span><span>I::</span>Item<span>,</span> N<span>&gt;;</span></span>
<span id="cb22-7"></span>
<span id="cb22-8">  <span>#[</span>inline<span>]</span></span>
<span id="cb22-9">  <span>fn</span> next(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>::</span>Item<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb22-10">    <span>let</span> batch <span>=</span> <span>ArrayVec::</span>from_iter((<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span>iter)<span>.</span>take(N))<span>;</span></span>

<span id="cb22-12">  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb22-13"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we modify our outer loop by batching the combinations iterator,
and modify the inner loop to flatten each batch:</p>

<p>Running the outer-loop benchmark again, the chunking iterator now
completes 5,000,000 combinations in <strong>982 milliseconds</strong>.
This is a 6.9x speedup over the serial approach, which is much better
for our 10-core machine. Ideally we would get closer to 10x, but I think
this post is long enough. In summary, our outer loop runtime numbers are
in Table <a href="#tbl:outer-loop">2</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So how far did we come? The original Python program was going to take
2.9 years to complete at k=5. Our final Rust program only takes
<strong>8 minutes</strong> on the same dataset. That is roughly a
<strong>180,000x speedup</strong>. A summary of the key
optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Rust’s compiler optimizations.</li>
<li>Hash numbers instead of strings.</li>
<li>Use (indexed) vectors instead of hashmaps.</li>
<li>Use bit-sets for efficient membership tests.</li>
<li>Use SIMD for efficient bit-sets.</li>
<li>Use multi-threading to split the work over many cores.</li>
<li>Use batching to avoid a bottleneck at work distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can we do better? Let’s take one last look at the profile:</p>
<p><img src="https://willcrichton.net/notes/k-corrset/img/profile-batched.png"></p>
<p>We’re spending 38% of our time in the bit-set iterator, and 36% of
our time in the bit-set intersection. Another 12% in copying the initial
bit-set for a given set of questions. And a long tail of other
operations like computing the correlation.</p>
<p>I tried my best to make the SIMD bit-set implementation fast, so I
don’t know of a way to improve these numbers. We might find another +10%
speedup from careful tweaking of the various constants (lane size, batch
size, etc.), but I don’t think there’s another order of magnitude left
on the table. If you know of a way, I invite you to try it out:<br> <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/corrset-benchmark">https://github.com/willcrichton/corrset-benchmark</a></p>
<p>Also if you know of an analytic solution to this problem, i.e., a
smarter way to get an optimal answer without brute force, do let me know
as well! Otherwise, I hope you learned a bit about performance
engineering in Rust.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><ul><li><i></i>2022-01-15</li></ul></div><h2>'No, it's less effort than that!'</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There is back-and-forth as the estimates are questioned for being too high, almost never for being too low.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often stakeholders outside of the development team, with limited technical know-how or insights into the codebase, question team estimates, saying something like <em>'No, it's less effort than that!'</em>. Their purpose is to push the team to give a 'better' estimate. Note that 'better' in this case means a lower estimate. The problem with going down this path and taking part in these discussions is diminished trust and further issues down the line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, an agreed-upon estimate is provided with much grumbling. Most of the time, nobody is happy; everybody feels compromised. The most important stakeholder, the business, is especially compromised as a bad expectation was set on when the software will be delivered to the customer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both quotes are from the article <a href="https://iism.org/article/is-tasking-developers-with-creating-detailed-estimates-a-waste-of-company-money-42">Is tasking developers with creating detailed estimates a waste of money?</a></p>
<p>In this post, I will share how it's a mistake for external stakeholders to push for a lower estimate without new facts impacting the effort. In addition, I will share how development teams can move their stakeholder dialogue into a much more productive discussion.</p>
<h2>Does pushing for lower estimates make sense?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>No, it's less effort than that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Statements pushing for a lower estimate can be valid, especially when discussing a story with a colleague in your team and when it's backed up with facts.</p>
<p>However, if the stakeholder making this claim is not part of the development team and doesn't know what needs to happen when implementing the story and doesn't bring any new facts, then making this claim is like starting a conversation with a meteorologist saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey meteorologist, the weather forecast for tomorrow will not be this bad!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's cover why this is so and how to move the discussion forward!</p>
<h3>Pushing for a lower estimate is like negotiating better weather with the meteorologist!</h3>
<p>The fact is the meteorologist <em>doesn't control the weather</em>. The meteorologist uses his knowledge and observing data to forecast how the weather will be.</p>
<p>In the same way, the development team <em>doesn't control</em> the actual effort - only by a tiny part. The development team is using their knowledge and data to forecast expected effort. They use established team velocity, review data on complete stories, and continuously improve their process every sprint.</p>
<p>What do I mean by saying <em>only by a tiny part?</em> The team can skip parts of their process and deliver lower-quality software. Not a recommended practice, as often teams pay more later when using this strategy. Also, the team has ways to improve the velocity. However, teams need to base estimates on their current throughput and not expected future throughput when giving an estimate. In other words, the team has minimal control over its effort to implement a fixed set of functionality.</p>
<p>Next time, when someone starts a conversation about your team's estimate, pushing for a lower estimate without any new insights that will lower the effort, ask them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>do you ever tell the meteorologist it isn't going to be this bad weather tomorrow?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because negotiating an estimate is like negotiating better weather with the meteorologist. It doesn't make any sense. However, there is a better discussion to have.</p>
<h3>The discussion you need to have instead</h3>
<p>Building software is complicated often takes more time than people think, and therefore, stakeholders often expect lower effort and can't rationalize spending more than a specific amount. What then?</p>
<p>In these cases, discuss with your stakeholders:</p>
<ol>
<li>why the estimated effort is this much?</li>
<li>what part of the story takes the most time?</li>
<li>where are the biggest unknowns?</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, discuss ways to:</p>
<ol>
<li>slice up the story and deliver it in multiple parts</li>
<li>validate each part early, preferably using prototypes</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, find ways to leave parts of the story out, especially the features that require lots of effort and have the least value.</p>
<p>This approach makes sense because research shows that a large part of software functionality built is rarely used. Therefore, it's critical to "get out of the building" and talk to the actual users using the software. Because it's often the case, stakeholders base their thoughts on opinions rather than actual data or discussions with users. As Steve Blank often says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No facts exist inside the building, only opinions</p>
</blockquote><div><p><img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/smartguess/image/upload/c_fill,w_856/Steve_Blank_No_Facts_Exist_Inside_The_Building_png_1121356a63?_a=ATAPpFA0"></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport" title="Pipeline transport">pipeline transportation</a>, <b>pigging</b> is the practice of using pipeline inspection gauges or gadgets, devices generally referred to as <b>pigs</b> or <b>scrapers</b>, to perform various maintenance operations. This is done without stopping the flow of the product in the pipeline.<sup id="cite_ref-Schlumberger_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Schlumberger-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Abdel-Hafez_and_Chowdhury_2015_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Abdel-Hafez_and_Chowdhury_2015-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>These operations include but are not limited to cleaning and inspecting the pipeline. This is accomplished by inserting the pig into a "pig launcher" (or "launching station")—an oversized section in the pipeline, reducing to the normal diameter. The launching station is then closed and the pressure-driven flow of the product in the pipeline is used to push the pig along the pipe until it reaches the receiving trap—the "pig catcher" (or "receiving station").

<p>Pigging is used to clean large diameter pipelines in the oil industry. Today, however, the use of smaller diameter pigging systems is now increasing in many continuous and batch process plants as plant operators search for increased efficiencies and reduced costs.
</p><p>Pigging can be used for almost any section of the transfer process between, for example, blending, storage or filling systems. Pigging systems are installed in industries handling products as diverse as lubricating oils, paints, chemicals, toiletries, cosmetics and foodstuffs.
</p><p>Pigs are used in lube oil or paint blending to clean the pipes to avoid cross-contamination, and to empty the pipes into the product tanks (or sometimes to send a component back to its tank). Usually pigging is done at the beginning and at the end of each batch, but sometimes it is done in the midst of a batch, such as when producing a premix that will be used as an intermediate component.
</p><p>Pigs are also used in oil and gas industries to clean or clear pipelines. Intelligent or "Smart pigs" used to inspect pipelines to assess their condition and to prevent leaks, which can be hazardous or harmful to the environment. They usually do not interrupt production, though some product can be lost when the pig is removed. They can also be used to separate different products in a multiproduct pipeline and to clear slugs of liquid  from multiphase gas//liquid pipelines.
</p><p>Pigging requires the pipeline to be designed to be pigged from the outset. If the pipeline contains topological variations including changes in diameter, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_valve" title="Butterfly valve">butterfly valves</a>, instrumentation, tight bends, pumps or reduced port ball valves, the pipeline cannot be traditionally pigged. In such instances, alternatives such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Pigging" title="Ice Pigging">Ice Pigging</a> may be employed.  Full port (or full bore) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_valve" title="Ball valve">ball valves</a> cause no problems because the inside diameter of the ball opening is the same as that of the pipe.

<p>A major advantage  for multi-product pipelines of piggable systems is the potential of product savings. At the end of each product transfer, it is possible to segregate the next products using a pigging sphere. Alternatively it is possible to clear out the entire line contents with the pig, either forwards to the receipt point, or backwards to the source tank. There is no requirement for extensive line flushing.
</p><p>Without the need for line flushing, pigging offers the additional advantage of much more rapid and reliable product changeover. Product sampling at the receipt point is faster with pigs, because the interface between products is very clear; the old method of checking at intervals to determine where the product is on-specification takes considerably longer.
</p><p>Pigging can also be operated totally by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller" title="Programmable logic controller">programmable logic controller</a> (PLC).

<p>Pigging has a significant role to play in reducing the environmental impact of batch operations. Traditionally, the only way that an operator of a batch process could ensure a product was completely cleared from a line was to flush the line with a cleaning agent such as water or a solvent, or even with the next product. The cleaning agent then had to be subjected to effluent treatment or solvent recovery. If a product was used to clear the line, it was necessary to downgrade or dump the contaminated portion of the product. All of these problems can now be eliminated due to the very precise interface produced by modern pigging systems.

<p>Pigging systems are designed so that the pig is loaded into the launcher, which is pressured to launch the pig into the pipeline through a kicker line. In some cases, the pig is removed from the pipeline via the receiver at the end of each run.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> All systems must allow for the receipt of pigs at the launcher, as blockages in the pipeline may require the pigs to be pushed back to the launcher. Many systems are designed to pig the pipeline in either direction.
</p><p>The pig is pushed either with a gas or a liquid; if pushed by gas, some systems<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> can be adapted in the gas inlet in order to ensure pig's constant speed, whatever the flow pressure is. The pigs must be removed, as many pigs are rented, pigs wear and must be replaced, and cleaning (and other) pigs push contaminants from the pipeline such as wax, foreign objects, hydrates, etc., which must be removed from the pipeline. There are inherent risks in opening the barrel to atmospheric pressure so care must be taken to ensure that the barrel is depressurized prior to opening. If the barrel is not completely depressurized, the pig can be ejected from the barrel and operators have been severely injured when standing in front of an open pig door. A pig was once accidentally shot out of the end of a pipeline without a proper pig receiver and went through the side of a house 150 metres (500&nbsp;ft) away.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> When the product is sour, the barrel should be evacuated to a flare system where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_gas" title="Sour gas">sour gas</a> is burnt. Operators should wear a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-contained_breathing_apparatus" title="Self-contained breathing apparatus">self-contained breathing apparatus</a> when working on sour systems.
</p><p>A few pigging systems utilize a "captive pig", and the pipeline is only opened occasionally to check the condition of the pig.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> At all other times, the pig is shuttled up and down the pipeline at the end of each transfer, and the pipeline is never opened up during process operation. These systems are not common.

<p>There are many reports of incidents in which operators have been injured or even killed while performing a pigging operation. Common causes of such events are:
</p>
<ul><li>opening of the closure door while the vessel is still pressurized;</li>
<li>opening of the main process valve while the closure door is not fully closed;</li>
<li>opening of the closure door while a high concentration of H₂S or other toxins remains inside the vessel;</li>
<li>the vent valve remaining open while the vessel is being pressurized with its medium.</li></ul>
<p>All these causes are directly related to improper operation of the process valves and the closure door. A common method of avoiding these kinds of incidents is to add valve interlocks,<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> which has been adopted by all global oil and gas operating companies.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p><p>Safety during pigging relies on strict adherence to safety procedures, which give detailed description of a safe valve operating sequence. By physically blocking incorrect operations, valve interlocks enforce such sequences. Valve interlocks are permanently mounted to both manual and motor operated valves and the closure door. The interlocks block operation of a valve or door, unless the appropriate keys are inserted.
</p><p>The principle of valve interlocking is the transfer of keys. Each lock is equipped with two keys: a key for the locked open position and one for the locked closed position. During an operating procedure, only one key at a time is free. This key only fits in the interlock belonging to the valve that is to be operated next in the operating procedure. All keys are uniquely coded to avoid the possibility that valves can be unlocked at an inappropriate time.
</p><p>Nowadays intelligent interlocking solutions enable the integration of field devices like pressure or H<sub>2</sub>S meters in a valve interlocking sequence. This increases safety by integrating operator procedures<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Control_System" title="Distributed Control System">DCS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_Instrumented_System" title="Safety Instrumented System">SIS</a> safety systems.

<p>A "pig" is a tool that is sent down a pipeline and propelled by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure" title="Pressure">pressure</a> of the product flow in the pipeline itself. There are four main uses for pigs:
</p>
<ol><li>Physical separation between different fluids flowing through the pipeline</li>
<li>Internal cleaning of pipelines</li>
<li>Inspection of the condition of pipeline walls (also known as an <i>inline inspection</i> (ILI) tool)</li>
<li>Capturing and recording geometric information relating to pipelines (e.g., size, position).</li></ol>
<p>One of the most common and versatile is the foam pig which is cut or poured out of open cell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane" title="Polyurethane">polyurethane</a> foam into the shape of a bullet and is driven through pipelines for many reasons such as to prove the inner diameter of, clean, de-water, or dry out the line. There are several types of pigs for cleaning in various densities from 32 to 160 kilograms per cubic metre (2 to 10&nbsp;lb/cu&nbsp;ft) foam and in special applications up to 320&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> (20&nbsp;lb/cu&nbsp;ft). Some have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten" title="Tungsten">tungsten</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw#Differentiation_between_bolt_and_screw" title="Screw">studs</a> or abrasive wire mesh on the outside to cut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust" title="Rust">rust</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fouling" title="Fouling">scale</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin_wax" title="Paraffin wax">paraffin wax</a> deposits off the inside of the pipe. Other types are fully or criss-cross coated in urethane, or there are bare polyurethane foam pigs with a urethane coating just on the rear to seal and assist in driving the pig. There are also fully molded urethane pigs used for liquid removal or batching several different products in one line.

<p>Intelligent pigs are used to inspect the pipeline with sensors and record the data for later analysis. These pigs use technologies such as magnetic flux leakage (MFL) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> to inspect the pipeline. Intelligent pigs may also use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliper" title="Caliper">calipers</a> to measure the inside geometry of the pipeline.
</p><p>In 1961, the first intelligent pig was run by Shell Development. It demonstrated that a self-contained electronic instrument could traverse a pipeline while measuring and recording wall thickness. The instrument used electromagnetic fields to sense wall integrity. In 1964 Tuboscope ran the first commercial instrument. It used MFL technology to inspect the bottom portion of the pipeline. The system used a black box similar to those used on aircraft to record the information; it was basically a highly customized analog tape recorder. Until recently, tape recording (although digital) was still the preferred recording medium. As the capacity and reliability of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_electronics" title="Solid-state electronics">solid-state memory</a> improved, most recording media moved away from tape to solid-state.
</p><p>Capacitive sensor probes are used to detect defects in polyethylene pipe gas pipeline. These probes are attached to the pig before it is sent through the polyethylene pipe to detect any defects in the outside of the pipe wall. This is done by using a triple plate capacitive sensor in which electrostatic waves are propagated outward through the pipe's wall. Any change in dielectric material results in a change in capacitance.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Testing was conducted by NETL DOE research lab at the Battelle West Jefferson's Pipeline Simulation Facility
(PSF) near Columbus, Ohio.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p>Modern intelligent or "smart" pigs are highly sophisticated instruments that include electronics and sensors that collect various forms of data during their trip through the pipeline. They vary in technology and complexity depending on the intended use and the manufacturer.
</p><p>The electronics are sealed to prevent leakage of the pipeline product into the electronics since products can range from being highly basic to highly acidic and can be of extremely high pressure and temperature. Many pigs use specific materials according to the product in the pipeline. Power for the electronics is typically provided by onboard batteries which are also sealed. Data recording may be by various means ranging from analog tape, digital tape, or solid-state memory in more modern units.
</p><p>The technology used varies by the service required and the design of the pig; each pigging service provider may have unique and proprietary technologies to accomplish the service. Surface pitting and corrosion, as well as cracks and weld defects in steel/ferrous pipelines are often detected using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux_leakage" title="Magnetic flux leakage">magnetic flux leakage</a> (MFL) pigs. Other "smart" pigs use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_acoustic_transducer" title="Electromagnetic acoustic transducer">electromagnetic acoustic transducers</a> to detect pipe defects.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Caliper pigs can measure the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundness_(object)" title="Roundness (object)">roundness</a> of the pipeline to determine areas of crushing or other deformations. Some smart pigs use a combination of technologies, such as providing MFL and caliper functions in a single tool. Trials of pigs using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_resonance_technology" title="Acoustic resonance technology">acoustic resonance technology</a> have been reported.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>During the pigging run the pig is unable to directly communicate with the outside world due to the distance underground or underwater and/or the materials that the pipe is made of. For example, steel pipelines effectively prevent any significant radio communications outside the pipe. It is therefore necessary that the pig use internal means to record its own movement during the trip. This may be done by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometer" title="Odometer">odometers</a>, gyroscope-assisted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_sensor" title="Tilt sensor">tilt sensors</a> and other technologies.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> The pig records this positional data so that the distance it moves along with any bends can be interpreted later to determine the exact path taken.

<p>Location verification is often accomplished by surface instruments that record the pig's passage by either audible, magnetic, radio-transmission or other means. The sensors record when they detect the passage of the pig (time-of-arrival); this is then compared to the internal record for verification or adjustment. The external sensors may have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" title="Global Positioning System">Global Positioning System</a> capability<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> to assist in their location. A few pig passage indicators transmit the pig's passage, time and location, via satellite uplink.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> The pig itself cannot use GPS as the metal pipe blocks satellite signals.
</p><p>After the pigging run has been completed, the positional data from the external sensors is combined with the pipeline evaluation data (corrosion, cracks, etc.) from the pig to provide a location-specific defect map and characterization. In other words, the combined data reveals to the operator the location, type and size of each pipe defect. This information is used to judge the severity of the defect and help repair crews locate and repair the defect quickly without having to dig up excessive amounts of pipeline. By evaluating the rate of change of a particular defect over several years, proactive plans can be made to repair the pipeline before any leakage or environmental damage occurs.
</p><p>The inspection results are typically archived (perhaps in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_Open_Data_Standard" title="Pipeline Open Data Standard">Pipeline Open Data Standard</a> format) for comparison with the results of later pigging runs on the same pipeline.

I'd like to first start out by saying I've been aware of new developments but made certain promises to keep my mouth shut until all the parties were ready to announce. (Phoronix is not so constrained.) Many of you <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2023/09/progress-on-firefox-ppc64le-jit.html?showComment=1696260751412#c7354742240276003302">noted</a> an offhand comment in <a href="https://youtu.be/Tj4Q-m_WEh0?feature=shared&amp;t=230">this YouTube video</a> about Raptor announcing a new Power10 system. That got a lot of people excited, because while our POWER9 systems are doing well, in 2023 this dual-8 64-thread POWER9 is no longer cutting edge and we need new silicon in the pipeline to keep the ecosystem viable.
</p><p>
Raptor yesterday <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20231019873615/secure-open-source-systems-leader-raptor-computing-systems-partners-with-lattice-showcasing-soft-bmc-for-server-management-and-solid-silicon-for-upcoming-power-isa-31-compliant-server-systems">officially announced</a> that we're <em>not</em> getting Power10 systems. The idea is we're going to be getting something <em>better</em>: the Solid Silicon S1. It's Power ISA 3.1 and fully compatible, but it's also a fully blob-free OpenPOWER successor to the POWER9, avoiding Power10's <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2021/09/its-not-just-omi-thats-trouble-with.html">notorious binary firmware requirement</a> for OMI RAM and I/O.
</p><p>
I asked Timothy Pearson at Raptor about the S1's specs, and he said it's a PCIe 5.0 DDR5 part running from the high 3GHz to low 4GHz clock range, with the exact frequency range to be determined. (OMI-based RAM <em>not</em> required!) The S1 is bi-endian, SMT-4 and will support at least two sockets with an 18-core option confirmed for certain and others to be evaluated. This compares very well with the Power10, which is also PCIe 5.0, also available as SMT-4 (though it has an SMT-8 option), and also clocks somewhere between 3.5GHz and 4GHz.
</p><p>
S1 embeds its own BMC, the X1 (or variant), which is (<a href="https://www.talospace.com/2022/08/whats-arctic-tern-good-for-anyway.html">like Arctic Tern</a>) a Microwatt-based ISA 3.1 core in <a href="https://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/ECP5">Lattice ECP5</a> and <a href="https://www.latticesemi.com/iCE40">iCE40</a> FPGAs with 512MB of DDR3 RAM, similar to the existing ASpeed BMC on current systems. X1 will in turn replace the existing Lattice-based FPGA in Arctic Tern as "Antarctic Tern," being a functional descendant of the same hardware, and should fill the same roles as a BMC upgrade for existing Raptor systems as well as the future BMC for the next generation systems and a platform in its own right. The X1 has "integrated 100% open root of trust" as you would expect for such a system-critical part.
</p><p>
Raptor's newest systems are planned for late 2024. There will be tiering, so most likely (though not confirmed) Blackbird, T2 and T2 server classes of systems will be available under new names. Price? Well, you'll just have to wait and see.
</p><p>
Solid Silicon is definitely a new name in the Power ecosystem and we don't know a lot about them. <a href="https://www.solidsilicon.com/">There's a web page</a>, but the <s>Tw</s>Xitter and LinkedIn links are unpopulated as of this writing, and it's maddeningly minimal on actual content. Tim confirmed they are a new licensee and have been working on the design for at least a couple years. The press release gives a 737 area code, which is Austin, Texas, and the only Solid Silicon business entry I could find for Texas is <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_tx/0800191006">this one for Solid Silicon Technology LLC</a> in Plano. I'm told this isn't them, so if anyone from Solid Silicon would like to lift the corporate veil a little, drop me a line at ckaiser at floodgap dawt com. <i>[UPDATE: The LinkedIn was updated after this posted, listing <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddrooke?trk=org-employees">Todd Rooke</a> as CEO. Rooke's listing indicates past experience with FPGAs, as well as his time at HPE and Microsoft. His location is given as Colorado Springs but Colorado lists no company by that name. Hopefully more to come.]</i> 
</p><p>
But besides new systems in the offing, it's also good news that we're getting — we hope — performant OpenPOWER chips that <em>aren't</em> from IBM. I don't have anything against IBM; I've worked with IBM hardware for literally decades, and my home server is a classic POWER6 that just keeps on truckin'. But IBM designs chips to benefit IBM's world, which is server rooms (ask anyone who's got one what it's like to share an office with a POWER8), and IBM doesn't do end-user sales. If Raptor has a good partner here who can design solid OpenPOWER chips for workstations and small servers, not traditionally IBM's present domain but one important for them to maintain if they want OpenPOWER to stay relevant, then in around a year we should be in for a treat — and a very rosy near future.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<!-- Article Start -->
				
<p><span>I</span>n July, BuzzFeed posted a list of 195 images of Barbie dolls produced using Midjourney, the popular artificial intelligence image generator. Each doll was supposed to represent a different country: Afghanistan Barbie, Albania Barbie, Algeria Barbie, and so on. The depictions were clearly flawed: Several of the Asian Barbies were light-skinned; Thailand Barbie, Singapore Barbie, and the Philippines Barbie all had blonde hair. Lebanon Barbie posed standing on rubble; Germany Barbie wore military-style clothing. South Sudan Barbie carried a gun.</p>



<p>The article —&nbsp;to which BuzzFeed added a disclaimer before taking it down entirely — offered an unintentionally striking example of the biases and stereotypes that proliferate in images produced by the recent wave of generative AI text-to-image systems, such as Midjourney, Dall-E, and Stable Diffusion.</p>



<p>Bias occurs in many algorithms and AI systems — from <a href="https://time.com/5209144/google-search-engine-algorithm-bias-racism/">sexist and racist search results</a> to facial recognition systems that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/police-facial-recognition-technology-cant-tell-black-people-apart/">perform worse on Black faces</a>. Generative AI systems are no different. In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-generative-ai-bias/">an analysis of more than 5,000 AI images</a>, Bloomberg found that images associated with higher-paying job titles featured people with lighter skin tones, and that results for most professional roles were male-dominated.</p>



<p>A new <em>Rest of World</em> analysis shows that generative AI systems have tendencies toward bias, stereotypes, and reductionism when it comes to national identities, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using Midjourney, we chose five prompts, based on the generic concepts of “a person,” “a woman,” “a house,” “a street,” and “a plate of food.” We then adapted them for different countries: China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Nigeria. We also included the U.S. in the survey for comparison, given Midjourney (like most of the biggest generative AI companies) is based in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For each prompt and country combination (e.g., “an Indian person,” “a house in Mexico,” “a plate of Nigerian food”), we generated 100 images, resulting in a data set of 3,000 images.</p>

<p>“Essentially what this is doing is flattening descriptions of, say, ‘an Indian person’ or ‘a Nigerian house’ into particular stereotypes which could be viewed in a negative light,” Amba Kak, executive director of the AI Now Institute, a U.S.-based policy research organization, told <em>Rest of World</em>. Even stereotypes that are not inherently negative, she said, are still stereotypes: They reflect a particular value judgment, and a winnowing of diversity. Midjourney did not respond to multiple requests for an interview or comment for this story.</p>



<p>“It definitely doesn’t represent the complexity and the heterogeneity, the diversity of these cultures,” Sasha Luccioni, a researcher in ethical and sustainable AI at Hugging Face, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“Now we’re giving a voice to machines.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Researchers told <em>Rest of World</em> this could cause real harm. Image generators are being used for diverse applications, including in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/mad-men-machines-big-advertisers-shift-ai-2023-08-18/">advertising</a> and <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-revolution-outsourced-workers/">creative industries</a>, and even in tools designed to make <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjk745/ai-police-sketches">forensic sketches of crime suspects</a>.</p>



<p>The accessibility and scale of AI tools mean they could have an outsized impact on how almost any community is represented. According to Valeria Piaggio, global head of diversity, equity, and inclusion at marketing consultancy Kantar, the marketing and advertising industries have in recent years made strides in how they represent different groups, though there is still much progress to be made. For instance, they now show greater diversity in terms of race and gender, and better represent people with disabilities, Piaggio told <em>Rest of World</em>. Used carelessly, generative AI could represent a step backwards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My personal worry is that for a long time, we sought to diversify the voices — you know, who is telling the stories? And we tried to give agency to people from different parts of the world,“ she said. “Now we’re giving a voice to machines.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Nigeria is home</strong> to more than 300 different ethnic groups, more than 500 different languages, and hundreds of distinct cultures. “There is Yoruba, there is Igbo, there is Hausa, there is Efik, there’s Ibibio, there’s Kanuri, there is Urhobo, there is Tiv,” Doyin Atewologun, founder and CEO of leadership and inclusion consultancy Delta, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>All of these groups have their own traditions, including clothing. Traditional Tiv attire features black-and-white stripes; a red cap has special meaning in the Igbo community; and Yoruba women have a particular way of tying their hair. “From a visual perspective, there are many, many versions of Nigeria,” Atewologun said.</p>



<p>But you wouldn’t know this from a simple search for “a Nigerian person” on Midjourney. Instead, all of the results are strikingly similar. While many images depict clothing that appears to indicate some form of traditional Nigerian attire, Atewologun said they lacked specificity. “It’s all some sort of generalized, ‘give them a head tie, put them in red and yellow and orangey colors<strong>, </strong>let there be big earrings and big necklaces and let the men have short caps,’” she said.</p>

<p>Atewologun added that the images also failed to capture the full variation in skin tones and religious differences among Nigerians. Muslims make up about 50% of the Nigerian population, and religious women often wear hijabs. But very few of the images generated by Midjourney depicted headscarves that resemble a hijab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other country-specific searches also appeared to skew toward uniformity. Out of 100 images for “an Indian person,” 99 seemed to depict a man, and almost all appeared to be over 60 years old, with visible wrinkles and gray or white hair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ninety-two of the subjects wore a traditional <em>pagri</em> —&nbsp;a type of turban — or similar headwear. The majority wore prayer beads or similar jewelry, and had a <em>tilak</em> mark or similar on their foreheads — both indicators associated with Hinduism. “These are not at all representative of images of Indian men and women,” Sangeeta Kamat, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has worked on research related to diversity in higher education in India, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “They are highly stereotypical.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kamat said many of the men resembled a sadhu<em> — </em>a type of spiritual guru. “But even then, the garb is excessive and atypical,” she said.<br>Hinduism is the dominant religion in India, with almost <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/09/21/key-findings-about-the-religious-composition-of-india/">80% of the population identifying as Hindu</a>. But there are significant minorities of other religions: Muslims make up the second-largest religious group, representing just over 14% of the population. But on Midjourney, they appeared noticeably absent.</p>

<p>Not all the results for “Indian person” fit the mold. At least two appeared to wear Native American-style feathered headdresses, indicating some ambiguity around the term “Indian.” A couple of the images seemed to merge elements of Indian and Native American culture.</p>



<p>Other country searches also skewed to people wearing traditional or stereotypical dress: 99 out of the 100 images for “a Mexican person,” for instance, featured a sombrero or similar hat.</p>



<p>Depicting solely traditional dress risks perpetuating a reductive image of the world. <strong>“</strong>People don’t just walk around the streets in traditional gear,” Atewologun said. “People wear T-shirts and jeans and dresses<em>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, many of the images produced by Midjourney in our experiment look anachronistic, as if their subjects would fit more comfortably in an historical drama than a snapshot of contemporary society.</p>



<p>“It’s kind of making your whole culture like just a cartoon,” Claudia Del Pozo, a consultant at Mexico-based think tank C Minds, and founder and director of the Eon Institute, told <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the “American person” prompt, national identity appeared to be overwhelmingly portrayed by the presence of U.S. flags. All 100 images created for the prompt featured a flag, whereas none of the queries for the other nationalities came up with any flags at all.</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Across almost all </strong>countries, there was a clear gender bias in Midjourney’s results, with the majority of images returned for the “person” prompt depicting men.</p>



<p>This type of broad over- and underrepresentation likely stems from bias in the data on which the AI system is trained. Text-to-image generators are trained on data sets of huge numbers of captioned images — <a href="https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/">such as LAION-5B</a>, a collection of almost 6 billion image-text pairs (essentially, images with captions) taken from across the web. If these include more images of men than women, for example, it follows that the systems may produce more images of men. Midjourney did not respond to questions about the data it trained its system on.</p>



<p>However, one prompt bucked this male-dominant trend. The results for “an American person” included 94 women, five men, and one rather horrifying masked individual.</p>

<p>Kerry McInerney, research associate at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, suggests that the overrepresentation of women for the “American person” prompt could be caused by an overrepresentation of women in U.S. media, which in turn could be reflected in the AI’s training data. “There’s such a strong contingent of female actresses, models, bloggers — largely light-skinned, white women — who occupy a lot of different media spaces from TikTok through to YouTube,” she told <em>Rest of World.</em></p>



<p>Hoda Heidari, co-lead of the Responsible AI Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University, said it may also be linked to cultural differences around sharing personal images. “For instance, women in certain cultures might not be very willing to take images of themselves or allow their images to go on the internet,” she said.</p>



<p>“Woman”-specific prompts generated the same lack of diversity and reliance on stereotypes as the “person” prompts. Most Indian women appeared with covered heads and in saffron colors often tied to Hinduism; Indonesian women were shown wearing headscarves or floral hair decorations and large earrings. Chinese women wore traditional <em>hanfu-</em>style clothing and stood in front of “oriental”-style floral backdrops.</p>

<p>Comparing the “person” and “woman” prompts revealed a few interesting differences. The women were notably younger: While men in most countries appeared to be over 60 years old, the majority of women appeared to be between 18 and 40.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was also a difference in skin tone, which <em>Rest of World</em> measured by comparing images against the Fitzpatrick scale, a tool developed for dermatologists which classifies skin color into six types. On average, women’s skin tones were noticeably lighter than those of men. For China, India, Indonesia, and Mexico, the median result for the “woman” prompt featured a skin tone at least two levels lighter on the scale than that for the “person” prompt.</p>



<p>“I’m not surprised that that particular disparity comes up because I think colorism is so profoundly gendered,” McInerney said, pointing out the greater societal pressure on women in many communities to be and appear younger and lighter-skinned. As a result, this is likely reflected in the system’s training data.</p>



<p>She also highlighted Western-centric beauty norms apparent in the images: long, shiny hair; thin, symmetrical faces; and smooth, even skin. The images for “a Chinese woman” mostly depict women with double eyelids. “This is concerning as it means that Midjourney, and other AI image generators, could further entrench impossible or restrictive beauty standards in an already image-saturated world,” McInerney said.</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>It’s not just </strong>people at risk of stereotyping by AI image generators. A <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11080.pdf">study by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science</a> in Bengaluru found that, when countries weren’t specified in prompts, DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion most often depicted U.S. scenes. Just asking Stable Diffusion for “a flag,” for example, would produce an image of the American flag.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of my personal pet peeves is that a lot of these models tend to assume a Western context,” Danish Pruthi, an assistant professor who worked on the research, told <em>Rest of World.</em></p>



<p><em>Rest of World </em>ran prompts in the format of “a house in [country],” “a street in [capital city],” and “a plate of [country] food.”</p>



<p>According to Midjourney, Mexicans live in blocky dwellings painted bright yellow, blue, or coral; most Indonesians live in steeply pitched A-frame homes surrounded by palm trees; and Americans live in gothic timber houses that look as if they may be haunted. Some of the houses in India looked more like Hindu temples than people’s homes.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most obviously offensive results were for Nigeria, where most of the houses Midjourney created looked run-down, with peeling paint, broken materials, or other signs of visible disrepair.</p>

<p>Though the majority of results were most remarkable for their similarities, the “house” prompt did produce some creative outliers. Some of the images have a fantastical quality, with several buildings appearing to defy physics to look more inspired by <em>Howl’s Moving Castle </em>than anything with realistic structural integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When comparing the images of streets in capital cities, some differences jump out. Jakarta often featured modern skyscrapers in the background and almost all images for Beijing included red paper lanterns. Images of New Delhi commonly showed visible air pollution and trash in the streets. One New Delhi image appeared to show a riot scene, with lots of men milling around, and fire and smoke in the street.</p>

<p>For the “plate of food” prompt, Midjourney favored the Instagram-style overhead view. Here, sameness again prevailed over variety: The Indian meals were arranged thali-style on silver platters, while most Chinese food was accompanied by chopsticks. Out of the 100 images of predominantly beige American food, 84 included a U.S. flag somewhere on the plate.</p>



<p>The images captured a surface-level imitation of any country’s cuisine. Siu Yan Ho, a lecturer at Hong Kong Baptist University who researches Chinese food culture, told <em>Rest of World</em> there was “absolutely no way” the images accurately represented Chinese food. He said the preparation of ingredients and the plating appeared more evocative of Southeast Asia. The deep-fried food, for example, appeared to be cooked using Southeast Asian methods —&nbsp;“most fried Chinese dishes will be seasoned and further processed,” Siu said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added that lemons and limes, which garnish many of the images, are rarely used in Chinese cooking, and are not served directly on the plate. But the biggest problem, Siu said, was that chopsticks were often shown in threes rather than pairs —&nbsp;an important symbol in Chinese culture. “It is extremely inauspicious to have a single chopstick or chopsticks to appear in an odd number,” he said.</p>

<p><strong>Bias in AI </strong>image generators is a tough problem to fix. After all, the uniformity in their output is largely down to the fundamental way in which these tools work. The AI systems look for patterns in the data on which they’re trained, often discarding outliers in favor of producing a result that stays closer to dominant trends. They’re designed to mimic what has come before, not create diversity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These models are purely associative machines,” Pruthi said. He gave the example of a football: An AI system may learn to associate footballs with a green field, and so produce images of footballs on grass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many cases, this results in a more accurate or relevant image. But if you don’t want an “average” image, you’re out of luck. “It’s kind of the reason why these systems are so good, but also their Achilles’ heel,” Luccioni said.</p>



<p>When these associations are linked to particular demographics, it can result in stereotypes. In a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593013.3594095">recent paper</a>, researchers found that even when they tried to mitigate stereotypes in their prompts, they persisted. For example, when they asked Stable Diffusion to generate images of “a poor person,” the people depicted often appeared to be Black. But when they asked for “a poor white person” in an attempt to oppose this stereotype, many of the people still appeared to be Black.</p>



<p>Any technical solutions to solve for such bias would likely have to start with the training data, including how these images are initially captioned. Usually, this requires humans to annotate the images. “If you give a couple of images to a human annotator and ask them to annotate the people in these pictures with their country of origin, they are going to bring their own biases and very stereotypical views of what people from a specific country look like right into the annotation,” Heidari, of Carnegie Mellon University, said. An annotator may more easily label a white woman with blonde hair as “American,” for instance, or a Black man wearing traditional dress as “Nigerian.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also a language bias in data sets that may contribute to more stereotypical images. “There tends to be an English-speaking bias when the data sets are created,” Luccioni said. “So, for example, they’ll filter out any websites that are predominantly not in English.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The LAION-5B data set <a href="https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/">contains 2.3 billion English-language image-text pairs</a>, with another 2.3 billion image-text pairs in more than 100 other languages. (A further 1.3 billion contain text without a specific language assigned, such as names.)</p>



<p>This language bias may also occur when users enter a prompt. <em>Rest of World</em> ran its experiment using English-language prompts; we may have gotten different results if we typed the prompts in other languages.</p>



<p>Attempts to manipulate the data to give better outcomes can also skew results. For example, many AI image generators filter the training data to weed out pornographic or violent images. But this may have unintended effects. OpenAI found that when it filtered training data for its DALL-E 2 image generator, it exacerbated gender bias. In a blog post, the company explained that more images of women than men <a href="https://openai.com/research/dall-e-2-pre-training-mitigations">had been filtered out of its training data</a>, likely because more images of women were found to be sexualized. As a result, the data set ended up including more men, leading to more men appearing in results. OpenAI attempted to address this by reweighting the filtered data set to restore balance, and has <a href="https://openai.com/blog/reducing-bias-and-improving-safety-in-dall-e-2">made other attempts to improve the diversity</a> of DALL-E’s outputs.</p>



<p>Almost every AI researcher <em>Rest of World </em>spoke to said the first step to improving the issue of bias in AI systems was greater transparency from the companies involved, which are often secretive about the data they use and how they train their systems. “It’s very much been a debate that’s been on their terms, and it’s very much like a ‘trust us’ paradigm,” said Amba Kak of the AI Now Institute.</p>



<p>As generative AI image generators are used for more applications, their bias could have real-world implications. The scale and speed of AI means it could significantly bolster existing prejudices. “Stereotypical views about certain groups can directly translate into negative impact on important life opportunities they get,” said Heidari, citing access to employment, health care, and financial services as examples.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“It’s very much like a ‘trust us’ paradigm.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Luccioni cited a project to use <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjk745/ai-police-sketches">AI image generation to help make forensic sketches</a> as an example of a potential application with a more direct negative impact: Biases in the system could lead to a biased — and inaccurate — sketch. “It’s the derivative tools that really worry me in terms of impacts,” she said.</p>



<p>Experts told <em>Rest of World</em> images can have a profound effect on how we perceive the world and the people in it, especially when it comes to cultures we haven’t experienced ourselves. “We come to our beliefs about what is true, what is real … based on what we see,” said Atewologun.</p>



<p>Kantar’s Piaggio said generative AI could help improve diversity in media by making creative tools more accessible to groups who are currently marginalized or lack the resources to produce messages at scale. But used unwisely, it risks silencing those same groups. “These images, these types of advertising and brand communications have a huge impact in shaping the views of people — around gender, around sexual orientation, about gender identity, about people with disabilities, you name it,” she said. “So we have to move forward and improve, not erase the little progress we have made so far.”</p>



<p>Pruthi said image generators were touted as a tool to enable creativity, automate work, and boost economic activity. But if their outputs fail to represent huge swathes of the global population, those people could miss out on such benefits. It worries him, he said, that companies often based in the U.S. claim to be developing AI for all of humanity, “and they are clearly not a representative sample.”</p>

The CEO got a call from the feds(FTC?) doing background work on the industry's view on how it might affect competition. For the life of me I can't imagine why he said it wouldn't really matter, but I have to assume that Ticketmaster was already so locked in to the industry that perhaps it didn't.

What gives?</p><p>To the extent that you're complaining about <i>scalping</i>, that's not something ticketmaster does. Scalping is a choice made by whoever originates the tickets. If the facial price is $20 and the market value is $700, scalping is going to occur regardless of whatever platform(s) may be involved.

If demand exceeds supply, price goes up.
The box offices keep the face value prices of the tickets lower than what the market will bear.
Therefore, someone will always step in to arbitrate and collect the margin.
Even if Ticketmaster were destroyed, it would not have any impact on scalping. 
The only way to stop this from happening is for the face value of high demand tickets to rise greatly.
For example, you could sell tickets with a dutch auction.</span></p></div></td></tr>

<p>Now the query returns that customer twice! We certainly don’t want to send them two e-mails, or issue multiple discount codes to the same customer. And the plan, on its own, can’t really provide any obvious clues that there are duplicate rows:</p>

<p>But you sure will notice if you inspect the results, or an end user will notice if you unleash this in production. The quick fix tends to be: slap a big ol’ <code>DISTINCT</code> on there which, indeed, fixes the symptom by eliminating duplicates:</p>

<p>But at what cost? A <a href="https://sqlserverfast.com/epr/sort/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distinct sort</a>, that’s what!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/joinfix-p3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/joinfix-p3.png" alt="Pain caused by that DISTINCT"></a></p>
<p>If I’m testing changes to this query in my local environment, and maybe just testing the output and that it returned the data quickly, I might miss clues in the plan and be pretty satisfied that adding <code>DISTINCT</code> fixed the issue without impacting performance.</p>
<h3>This will only get worse with more data.</h3>
<p>And while we could spend a lot of time tuning indexes on all the involved tables to make that sort hurt less, this multi-table join is always going to produce rows you never ultimately need. Think about SQL Server’s job: yes, it needs to return correct results, but it also should do that <em>in the most efficient way possible</em>. Reading all the data (and then sorting it), only to throw away some or most of it, is very wasteful.</p>
<h3>Can we express the query without DISTINCT?</h3>
<p>When I know I need to “join” to tables but only care about existence of rows and not any of the output from those tables, I turn to <code>EXISTS</code>. I also try to eliminate looking up values that I know are going to be the same on every row. In this case, I don’t need to join to <code>Categories</code> every time if <code>CategoryID</code> is effectively a constant.</p>
<p>One way to express this same query, ensuring no duplicate customers and, hopefully, reducing the cost of sorting:</p>

<p>Overall, fewer rows move through the plan, and this is reflected in slightly lower reads. This will be amplified by more rows in the table, wider rows in general, and more rows filtered out earlier.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><code>DISTINCT</code> is often hiding flaws in the underlying logic, and it can really pay off to explore other ways to write your queries without it. There was another interesting use case <a href="https://sqlperformance.com/2017/01/t-sql-queries/surprises-assumptions-group-by-distinct" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote about a few years ago</a> that showed how changing <code>DISTINCT</code> to <code>GROUP BY</code> – even though it carries the same semantics and produces the same results – can help SQL Server filter out duplicates earlier and have a serious impact on performance.</p>

            <div>
                <p>On Wednesday, October 18, 2023, we discovered attacks on our system that we were able to trace back to Okta – threat actors were able to leverage an authentication token compromised at Okta to pivot into Cloudflare’s Okta instance. While this was a troubling security incident, our Security Incident Response Team’s (SIRT) real-time detection and prompt response enabled containment and minimized the impact to Cloudflare systems and data. We have verified that <strong>no Cloudflare customer information or systems were impacted by this event</strong> because of our rapid response. Okta has now released a <a href="https://sec.okta.com/harfiles">public statement</a> about this incident.</p><p>This is the second time Cloudflare has been impacted by a breach of Okta’s systems. In <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-investigation-of-the-january-2022-okta-compromise/">March 2022</a>, we blogged about our investigation on how a breach of Okta affected Cloudflare. In that incident, we concluded that there was no access from the threat actor to any of our systems or data – Cloudflare’s use of hard keys for multi-factor authentication stopped this attack. &nbsp;</p><p>The key to mitigating this week’s incident was our team’s early detection and immediate response. In fact, we contacted Okta about the breach of their systems before they had notified us. The attacker used an open session from Okta, with Administrative privileges, and accessed our Okta instance. We were able to use our Cloudflare Zero Trust Access, Gateway, and Data Loss Prevention and our Cloudforce One threat research to validate the scope of the incident and contain it before the attacker could gain access to customer data, customer systems, or our production network. With this confidence, we were able to quickly mitigate the incident before the threat-actors were able to establish persistence.</p><p>According to Okta’s statement, the threat-actor accessed Okta’s customer support system and viewed files uploaded by certain Okta customers as part of recent support cases. It appears that in our case, the threat-actor was able to hijack a session token from a support ticket which was created by a Cloudflare employee. Using the token extracted from Okta, the threat-actor accessed Cloudflare systems on October 18. In this sophisticated attack, we observed that threat-actors compromised two separate Cloudflare employee accounts within the Okta platform. We detected this activity internally more than 24 hours before we were notified of the breach by Okta. Upon detection, our SIRT was able to engage quickly to identify the complete scope of compromise and contain the security incident. Cloudflare’s Zero Trust architecture protects our production environment, which helped prevent any impact to our customers.</p><h2 id="recommendations-for-okta">Recommendations for Okta</h2><p>We urge Okta to consider implementing the following best practices, including:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Take any report of compromise seriously and act immediately to limit damage; in this case Okta was first notified on October 2, 2023 by <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">BeyondTrust</a> but the attacker still had access to their support systems at least until October 18, 2023.</li>
<li>Provide timely, responsible disclosures to your customers when you identify that a breach of your systems has affected them.</li>
<li>Require hardware keys to protect all systems, including third-party support providers.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For a critical security service provider like Okta, we believe following these best practices is table stakes.</p><h2 id="recommendations-for-okta%E2%80%99s-customers">Recommendations for Okta’s Customers</h2><p>If you are an Okta customer, we recommend that you reach out to them for further information regarding potential impact to your organization. We also advise the following actions:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Enable Hardware MFA for all user accounts. Passwords alone do not offer the necessary level of protection against attacks. We strongly recommend the usage of hardware keys, as other methods of MFA can be vulnerable to phishing attacks.</li>
<li>Investigate and respond to:
<ul>
<li>All unexpected password and MFA changes for your Okta instances.</li>
<li>Suspicious support-initiated events.</li>
<li>Ensure all password resets are valid and force a password reset for any under suspicion.</li>
<li>Any suspicious MFA-related events, ensuring only valid MFA keys are present in the user's account configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monitor for:
<ul>
<li>New Okta users created.</li>
<li>Reactivation of Okta users.</li>
<li>All sessions have proper authentication associated with it.</li>
<li>All Okta account and permission changes.</li>
<li>MFA policy overrides, MFA changes, and MFA removal.</li>
<li>Delegation of sensitive applications.</li>
<li>Supply chain providers accessing your tenants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review session expiration policies to limit session hijack attacks.</li>
<li>Utilize tools to validate devices connected to your critical systems, such as Cloudflare Access Device Posture Check.</li>
<li>Practice defense in depth for your detection and monitoring strategies.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Cloudflare’s Security and IT teams continue to remain vigilant after this compromise. If further information is disclosed by Okta or discovered through additional log analysis, we will publish an update to this post.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><center><em>Cloudflare's Security Incident Response Team <a href="https://cloudflare.com/careers">is hiring</a>.</em></center>

This year, I released the PS VR2 game <a href="https://news.play.date/news/skew/httpsL//csmashvrs.com">C-Smash VRS</a>, the star-studded multi-platform adventure <a href="https://thelastworker.com/">The Last Worker</a>, and its spin-off, <strong><a href="https://play.date/games/skew">SKEW</a></strong>, available only on Playdate of course.</p>

</p>
<p>Some of the most precious moments in my life have been meeting my heroes—filmmakers, musicians, game developers and beyond—and thanks to the Playdate, I not only got to work with one but also lure him back to the wild and wonderful world of game development.</p>
<p>Frédérick Raynal is best known for creating <em>Alone in the Dark</em>, a game which introduced a real time 3D character to the world of games and single-handedly invented the survival horror genre. After leaving Capcom, director Shinji Mikami finally admitted that, without Frédérick, <em>Resident Evil</em> would have been just another first person shooter.</p>

<p>Frédérick also created the singular <em>Little Big Adventure</em> (<em>Twinsen’s Adventure</em> and the wonderful Sega Dreamcast game <em>Toy Commander</em>, which is how we first met. I interviewed Fred about the game for the Official (US) Dreamcast Magazine over two decades ago. My kids and I play <em>Toy Commander</em> and its frantic 4-player split-screen battles to this day. A friend’s 15-year old son once joined in and told me, “I had no idea games can be this much fun.” He was wearing a <em>Fortnite</em> shirt.</p>
<p>In recent years, Frédérick has spread his talent and vision outside of games, from urban mobility systems to medical devices and a series of his own robotic inventions. In a world dominated by AAA games and enormous teams, game development had become less attractive to this singular creator.</p>
<p>“I like to create, to build things,” Frédérick tells me for this blog post. “When I started developing games I had the feeling of building something very new, something real, physical. But, through years and industrialisation of our creations, I began to miss this pioneer feeling of being an inventor. Working only on the software was not enough anymore, so I started to build real objects from scratch, making everything from the mechanical system and the electronic board to the software that gives life to it. Cutting wood makes me feel like an artist again. :)”</p>

<p>The feeling of creating is hard in today’s world of samey mega-tech-platforms. Just as I started writing and directing the ambitious satirical first person adventure <em>The Last Worker</em> for VR, consoles and PC, however, the Playdate graced the cover of the prestigious EDGE magazine here in the UK. It was love at first sight: finally there was a game system that embraces the love of play and creativity, instead of product and ‘content’.</p>
<p>I immediately knew I had to make a game for it and Skew, <em>The Last Worker</em>’s CoBot voiced by Jason Isaacs (<em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>The Death of Stalin</em>, <em>The OA</em>), was born to have a spin-off game on Panic’s little yellow wonder. He has one propeller after all.</p>
<p>
  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/591083350" title="vimeo video" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>I knew I wanted to make an “endless spinner” in which you steer Skew through 3D tunnels using the crank and accelerometer. Together with Vanja Vikalo, whose studio Subgiant in Belgrade animated The Last Worker’s stunning opening sequence, we dreamt up some concepts.</p>

<p>At the time there was no evidence that realtime 3D games would even be possible on Playdate. So naturally I had to approach the man who propelled games into the third dimension. I had to lure him back, a bit like Rambo.</p>
<p>“When you are an old game programmer,” Fred says, “You knew a time when there were no rules, a time when you had to make miracles with very undefined techniques. When I saw the Playdate and understood how it is made (both electronically and the spirit behind it), I was so excited. Give me just a bitmap surface and some processing features to draw inside it and I’ll be happy to create games in my very own way. At the beginning, as it was not easy to get an actual Playdate, so I decided to double the fun by making a ‘Fakedate’, principally to start investigating the (utterly motivating) constraints of the screen. The Playdate is something unique and you feel unique when you work on it.”</p>

<p>In order to make SKEW, Frédérick adapted WireFred, an engine he had developed a decade ago as a personal project, for Playdate and developed a 3D level editor in which all of the elements for the game’s randomly generated infinite tunnels were built.</p>

<p>SKEW also re-united Frédérick creatively with Yael Barroz, the artist and animator with whom he had worked on the original <em>Alone in the Dark</em>. Yael built the character in 3D, so she could create sprite sheets more efficiently and change the whole set dynamically if an adjustment was needed (instead of doing it manually for each frame).</p>

<p>And then there’s the gameplay itself which, well, you’ll just have to experience for yourself. Despite SKEW being a tiny “spin-off”, I have spent more hours playing it than the epic <em>The Last Worker</em>, because it’s just too darn fun. We have been making lots of adjustments in the background and made the points system even more challenging and rewarding than before.</p>

<p>I’ve always felt that if anyone’s going to build the first time travel machine, it’s Frédérick Raynal. And in many ways, he’s built that machine already. Fred took games into the future and when the future became too samey and corporate, he’s linked us back to the past. But not through nostalgia, but through innovation and a real sense of delight. Just like the Playdate itself.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="xbody">
          <main>
            <article><p>(If you just want some recommendations for what to do, <a href="#recommendations">skip down to the Recommendations section below</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://notes.valdikss.org.ru/jabber.ru-mitm/">Today, the operator of jabber.ru and xmpp.ru reported</a> that their service had been successfully subject to a man-in-the-middle attack via a combination of</p>
<ul>
<li>their hosting providers, Hetzner and Linode, intercepting traffic to their machines; and</li>
<li>the unauthorized issuance of a Domain Validation certificate for their
service by an attacker.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems likely that this attack was orchestrated by the state of Germany (or
Germany acting in concert with one or more other nation states). There are
other possibilities; for example, both Hetzner and Linode might have decided
to voluntarily comply with a wiretapping request from a foreign power that
was not binding upon them, but this would reflect extremely badly on them,
might well be illegal, and seems unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>Detection.</strong> This attack could have been mitigated. It could also
(potentially) have been detected:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first way to detect this attack would be for the operators of the service
to monitor Certificate Transparency logs to detect the issuance of
certificates they did not request. There are some services which can do this
for you, but we could probably still stand to have better tools here (e.g.
tools which are good at notifying you only of certificates you didn't
request).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second way to detect this attack would be to periodically connect to the
service and check that the public key used by the TLS server matches that
expected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these detection methods have some issues and potential gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>CT is optional.</strong> A certificate issued by a legitimate CA isn't necessarily
logged to a CT log. Surprisingly, CT logging is still not a requirement of
the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements (which set the rules all CAs must
follow).</p>
<p>What forces CAs to log certificates in CT is that web browsers now reject
certificates unless they contain a cryptographic proof that they were logged
to a CT log. Some CAs will sell you a certificate that isn't logged to CT
(e.g. for “privacy” reasons) if you request one. Browsers may reject this,
but there are many other kinds of client application (most of them, in fact)
which don't check for or require a certificate to contain a proof of having
been logged. So in this hypothetical scenario, the adversary could have
procured an unlogged certificate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Selective MitM.</strong> Trying to detect the MitM by probing the service could be
worked around by detecting which connections are probing connections and not
MitM'ing them. At a minimum it would be necessary to do something like
perform the probe through Tor to prevent it from being trivially identified;
however, this probably isn't perfect either. TLS stacks can be easily
fingerprinted, as things like the order that TLVs are listed in give telltale
signs of which TLS implementation is being used; it's quite likely that a
service could have some level of success distinguishing between connections
made by a real XMPP client and a probe agent. There's a million signals that
could potentially give away that a connection isn't a “real” connection. An
adversary could also just target specific persons it knows it is interested
in intercepting (i.e., only MitM traffic on a whitelist, rather than
exempting traffic on a blacklist of known probes). This therefore probably
can't be considered too reliable either.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So neither of these detection methods seem particularly perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation.</strong> The second area of consideration is mitigation, in which the
unauthorized issuance of TLS certificates is prevented from happening in the
first place. The entire point of a TLS certificate is, of course, to prevent a
man-in-the-middle attack. The fundamental problem here is that the “Domain
Validation” model by which CAs validate control of a domain name is ironically
itself vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if an attacker can
intercept not just some but <em>all</em> traffic to a victim site (as happened in this
case).</p>
<p>Some years ago I authored <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8657">ACME-CAA (RFC
8657)</a>, now
<a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/acme-caa-live">implemented</a> by Let's Encrypt, which can mitigate this in some
circumstances. The basic idea is that you can configure a DNS record which
specifies that only a <em>specific account</em> of a <em>specific CA</em> is authorised to
issue certificates for a domain. Thus simply using the same CA isn't enough;
you must gain access to the same account at the CA. With Let's Encrypt, this
means gaining access to the ACME private key used to request a certificate.
Based on what we know about the attack, it would have been prevented by
deploying this extension.</p>
<p>There are a fair number of caveats here, which are explained in full in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8657">the
RFC</a> and <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/acme-caa-live">my deployment
advice</a> (recommended reading). <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8657">The
RFC</a> is a lot more readable than most,
so flipping through it is highly recommended for those interested in deploying
ACME-CAA. Some caveats are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You do need to deploy DNSSEC for this to work, otherwise the DNS requests
made by a CA can simply be intercepted.</p>
<p>Anyone who can get control of your DNSSEC signing key can also overcome this
hurdle. So for example, a nation-state might simply serve a wiretap order to
a hosting company like Hetzner or Linode, and similarly order your DNS
service provider.</p>
<p>It should be noted that it is possible to run a DNSSEC-secured DNS zone
without giving your signing keys to anybody else; in this case the DNS
hosting provider has no power to compromise the zone, so this seems like the
best deployment strategy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An adversary might be able to successfully compel your domain name registrar,
or the TLD registry, to change the DNSSEC signing keys registered for a
domain. This at least has the potential to be a “noisy” operation, and due to
the nature of DNS caching, it may be hard for an adversary to prevent a
recurring probe from detecting the change of key (unlike the selective MitM
of a TLS connection discussed under Detection above).</p>
</li>
<li><p>An adversary might be able to successfully compel your CA to mis-issue
a certificate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You remain vulnerable to third party CAs which screw up or break the rules.
The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements now require DNSSEC to be checked
by CAs, but a third party CA might mess up and issue a certificate anyway
even if it's not listed by a domain's CAA record as authorised to issue
certificates for the domain. Because logging to CT logs isn't a requirement,
such certificates may never even be detected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list of cavets and you should refer to the RFC for
the full details. Nonetheless, deploying ACME-CAA can offer a real level of
mitigation here. It increases the number of hurdles for an attacker, especially
when you spread different services around different jurisdictions. The game
here is jurisdictional arbitrage and utilising the relative difficulty of
international cooperation between adversarial powers. For example, if we assume
that this incident is the product of coercion on the part of the German state,
it doesn't <em>necessarily</em> follow that this adversary would be able to also
coerce Let's Encrypt, for instance. Increasing the cost of attacks <em>and the
risk of them being detected</em> also discourages nation-state adversaries,
particularly as they are often loathe to have attention drawn to their
espionage activities.</p>
<p><strong>What would a perfect attacker do?</strong> While the core aspects of this attack may
have been readily mitigated with technologies which were available but
undeployed, it also has highlighted some serious gaps in the TLS
infrastructure as it is deployed today.</p>
<p>In this particular incident, the adversary was slapdash, and let their illicit
certificate expire. In this regard, they are less than a perfect adversary; but
we should expect attacks such as these to get better, not worse, and to become
more frequent, as nation-states become more frustrated by the presence of cheap
and easy encryption.</p>
<p>As such, it's useful to consider what a more competent nation-state adversary
(whom I'll name Mallory for our purposes) would do. Here, I'll assume that
Mallory can do anything other than actually compromise the victim machine
itself or its operator (which is <em>not</em> a good assumption, but bear with it):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Mallory would take advantage of the fact that CAs aren't required to log certificates
to Certificate Transparency logs, and request an unlogged certificate from a CA.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mallory would compel the hosting provider to MitM all traffic going to the victim
machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mallory would use TLS stack fingerprinting and source IPs to heuristically
identify traffic likely to be of interest and exclude traffic likely made to
probe if the victim service has been compromised.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mallory would use the MitM to trick the CA into thinking Mallory is the legitimate
controller of the victim domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the domain uses ACME-CAA with DNSSEC, this attack is foiled, so Mallory
would attempt to compel the DNS hosting provider (if it holds the DNSSEC
signing key, which it may not). If Mallory fails to do so, Mallory might try
and coerce the domain registrar or TLD registry, but might have difficulty
preventing this from being detected (<em>if</em> anybody is monitoring it, which
usually isn't the case).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mallory also might attempt to coerce the CA itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Holes in the TLS infrastructure.</strong> This hypothetical attack illustrates the
following holes in the present state of the public TLS infrastructure, ordered
in descending order of severity (in my opinion):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of CT logging enforcement by non-web TLS clients.</strong> Point (1) here
is interesting, even if the actual attacker here did not take advantage of
it. Web browsers now require that CA certificates include cryptographic proof
of having been logged to a Certificate Transparency log, so while you can
legitimately get an unlogged certificate from a CA, it's not so useful on the
public web.</p>
<p>However, it turns out there is a degree of inconsistency here. While web
browsers enforce this requirement, <strong>most other TLS clients don't</strong>, and will
accept an unlogged certificate. This probably includes most XMPP clients, as
this CT validation is something that needs to be specially implemented. It is
not something that is enabled “automatically” just by linking your application
against OpenSSL.</p>
<p>This means that <strong>a large amount of internet infrastructure</strong> which
supposedly benefits from the security provided by contemporary TLS, actually
receives a lower standard of protection than that of a web browser. Such
infrastructure is easier to exploit because it will accept an <em>unlogged</em> TLS
certificate, which CAs are legitimately allowed to issue.</p>
<p>This seems to me a highly undesirable state of affairs, and thought should be
given to how CT proof enforcement can be enabled by default in the future.
Software which is liable to be used for highly sensitive communications
(such as XMPP clients) should also consider reviewing how they are currently
handling this issue and consider adding support for CT enforcement.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of requirement to log certificates.</strong> The CA/Browser Forum Baseline
Requirements, which is the set of industry rules CAs are required to follow
(lest they be given the CA death penalty), does not require certificates to
be logged to CT logs. This is arguably a surprising omission and I would
argue this should be required.</p>
<p>Of course, in reality, this omission is surely not accidental; there are too
many companies which think hiding a hostname from a CT log is a meaningful
form of security by obscurity, and I assume it's the advocacy of these
organisations that has kept CT from being mandatory. But it is certainly
something I would advocate for, and I would hope the CA/Browser Forum
reconsiders this in the future.</p>
<p>In any case, this issue can be rendered moot by universal deployment of the
technical enforcement of CT logging, as per the above paragraph.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Need for more CT monitoring services.</strong> This is not really a gap in the
TLS infrastructure as such, as anyone could create such a service, but the
public would benefit from more CT monitoring services. The current major
service available for CT alerting is <a href="https://sslmate.com/certspotter/">SSLMate's Cert
Spotter</a>, but its pricing probably puts it
out of reach for many services, especially those operated on a voluntary
basis.</p>
<p>It should be emphasised that any CT monitoring solution needs to think
through how to avoid false alarms and only alert when observing unusual or
seemingly unauthorized certificate issuance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of DNSSEC transparency.</strong> Although the idea has been mulled in the
past, there is currently no deployed cryptographic infrastructure for
detecting changes to the DNSSEC keys configured for a domain. This renders
domain name registrars and TLD registries vulnerable to coercion or
compromise to change the DNSSEC keys registered for a domain, which allows
the protection which ACME-CAA can offer to be undermined.</p>
<p>It would be highly desirable to see a transparency solution for DNSSEC zone
keys ensuring that all changes are publicly visible. This transparency
solution would only need to log changes to a zone's keys (DS records), not
all records in a zone. (The latter is also possible but I wouldn't consider
it essential, and organisations who have grown accustomed to the contents of
DNS zones being un-enumerable would inevitably complain.)</p>

  </a><li><a id="recommendations">
    </a><p><a id="recommendations"><strong>Deploy ACME-CAA.</strong> Deploying ACME-CAA is likely to make
    it harder for attackers to trick CAs into issuing a certificate for your
    domain. </a><a href="http://devever.net/hl/acme-caa-live">For guidance for
    those unfamiliar with this area, read my blogpost about deploying
    ACME-CAA.</a> I also recommend reading the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8657#name-security-considerations">Security
    Considerations section of the RFC,</a> which is more readable than usual
    and contains a lot of good advice and important caveats.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><strong>If deploying ACME-CAA, also deploy DNSSEC.</strong> ACME-CAA
  is not maximally effective without use of DNSSEC. If possible, choose a
  DNSSEC provider that does not require you to give them your signing
  keys.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Don't use Cloudflare or similar services.</strong> <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/cloudflare">See my article here for an explanation on why.</a> If you
  use a service like this, you're basically already MitMing yourself.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Sign up with a CT log monitoring service, or manually check
  logs regularly.</strong> <a href="https://sslmate.com/certspotter/">SSLMate's Cert Spotter</a> offers an
  automated monitoring service, for a price. <a href="https://crt.sh/">crt.sh</a> offers a search engine which allows you to
  manually search the CT logs.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Make use of jurisdictional arbitrage.</strong> For example,
  your domain registrar, TLD registry, DNS hosting service, CA and hosting
  provider might all be situated in different countries. Consider which
  nation-states and geopolitical blocs are least likely to cooperate with one
  another and choose jurisdictions accordingly. Play jurisdictions off against
  one another. You can never count on this, but it may help.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Provide a Tor hidden service.</strong> One potential solution
  to these kinds of issues is simply to sidestep TLS altogether by providing a
  Tor hidden service instead and encouraging users to use it. The advantage of
  a Tor hidden service is that the service's public key <em>is</em> the
  address, so there is no CA or other centralised infrastructure to be fooled
  or compromised (and the problem of most non-web clients not requiring CT
  proofs becomes moot). Encourage users who consider that they may be at high
  risk of being targeted by a nation-state to use the hidden service (of
  course, encouraging such users to use Tor is good advice in general). If the
  nature of your service is such that extreme risk is posed to your users in
  particular, consider only offering a hidden service. Remember that your
  users will need a trustworthy channel to obtain the correct onion address,
  and third parties might try to trick them into using the wrong one.</p> </li>

  <li><p><strong>Setup automated probing of your service via Tor.</strong> This
  is not a panacea as discussed above, but it is some icing on the cake you can
  perform if you really want to, which will catch amateur mistakes (which, as
  we have seen from this incident, often occur in the real world). It's
  essential to use Tor to prevent ready identification as a probe (a
  nation-state adversary is probably interested in users connecting via Tor, so
  it is unlikely to want to skip this traffic unless it already has a specific
  non-Tor-using user in mind). Try to minimise the prospect of TLS
  fingerprinting by using the a TLS library commonly used by client software.
  Even better, use an actual client (e.g. an actual XMPP client if you are
  running an XMPP service). Note that even if this does work, it still only detects
  compromise after the fact, and by that time your users may already have been
  harmed by the compromise.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Consider other attacks.</strong> If you make your service too
  hard to MitM, adversaries are more likely to engage in other attack vectors,
  like compromising the machines themselves and stealing private keys or
  sensitive information. A nation-state attacker could compel a VM provider to
  perform a dump of your system's memory at the hypervisor level, which will be
  entirely undetectable to you and compromise all data held in that VM. A
  dedicated server could be compromised by physical access by an

<p>Back at the end of July, the Python steering council <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-steering-council-notice-about-pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-in-cpython/30474">announced</a>
its intention to approve the proposal to make the global interpreter lock
(GIL) optional over the next few Python releases.  The details of that
acceptance are still being decided on, but work on the feature is
proceeding—in discussion form at least.  Beyond that, though, there are
efforts underway to solve that hardest of problems in computer
science, naming, for the no-GIL version. 
</p>

<h4>ABI concerns</h4>

<p>
In mid-September, Sam Gross, who authored <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/">PEP&nbsp;703</a> ("Making the
Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython"), posted a <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018">message</a>
to the Python discussion forum about the interaction of the PEP and the CPython
stable 
ABI. In part, the stable ABI is used by extensions to enable their binary wheels
to work with multiple CPython versions, thus not require rebuilds when
CPython is released. The PEP <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/940780/">envisions a path</a> toward an
eventual single CPython version without the GIL, but, in the meantime,
there will be a build of the interpreter (using <tt>‑‑disable‑gil</tt>) that can be used to test no-GIL
operation.
</p>

<p>
Gross noted that extensions built for the
stable ABI will not actually work with a no-GIL CPython&nbsp;3.13 (which is
due in
October&nbsp;2024), but he is proposing some changes so that extensions
will work with both types of CPython builds 
from that version onward.  Extensions that only call into the "limited" C API
result in binaries that use the stable ABI, so Gross suggested a few
additions and changes to the API in order to facilitate extension binaries
that can work with both interpreter types (GIL and no-GIL).  In part, it
adopts the existing plan to <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/limited-c-api-implement-py-incref-and-py-decref-as-function-calls/27592">switch
some macros to function calls</a>, in particular for incrementing and
decrementing the object reference counts that are used for garbage collection.
</p>

<p>
Victor Stinner, who has <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/944764/">done a lot of recent
work</a> on the stable ABI, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/2">replied</a>
that he thought there should a simple solution for extensions that can work
on both interpreter types; he is concerned that the no-GIL experiment will
fail otherwise.  Because extensions that are built for the stable ABI on
CPython&nbsp;3.12 and earlier will not be compatible with no-GIL builds from&nbsp;3.13 onward, he thinks it may make sense to create a new ABI version to
differentiate the cases.  Currently, the stable ABI is "abi3", but that
could be bumped to abi4—even without moving to a Python&nbsp;4.  Many
people seem to believe the ABI number and CPython major number are linked,
but that is not the case.
</p>

<p>
Gross is <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/4">less
concerned</a> about the need for extensions that want to support 
no-GIL mode having to build two separate binary wheel versions as he <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018#what-about-the-default-with-gil-build-of-cpython-6">described
in his original message</a>.  He believes that building two wheels is a
manageable price to pay 
and is more worried about tying the no-GIL project to fixes or upgrades to
the C API and stable ABI. Alex Gaynor <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/6">agreed</a>
about the price;
he has multiple packages with abi3 wheels (and "<q>is very excited about
the glorious nogil future</q>") that would be affected, but creating two
wheels is not 
overly burdensome as a one-time thing. He does want to ensure that
existing and future versions of <tt>pip</tt> do the right thing in choosing
between them, however. 
</p>

<p>
Brett Cannon <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/10">said</a>
that existing and older versions of <tt>pip</tt> would not do the right
thing, unless a change to abi4 was made; the logic used in <tt>pip</tt>
today would not be able to distinguish between the versions.  Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/13">suggested</a>
that supporting older <tt>pip</tt> versions may not really be needed, since
it is not an actual change in behavior:

</p><blockquote>
I don't think we should worry too much about whether old versions of pip
work properly for the <i>experimental</i>, <tt>--disable-gil</tt> build of
CPython&nbsp;3.13. As 
it is, old versions of pip frequently do not work with new versions of
Python. For example, <tt>pip==23.1.1</tt> and older (from just&nbsp;5 months ago) will
break if installed in CPython&nbsp;3.13 (missing pkgutil.ImpImporter).
</blockquote>


<p>
<tt>pip</tt> maintainer Paul Moore <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/14">pointed
out</a> a difference, though: breakage is different from silently doing the
wrong thing:
</p><blockquote>
I think it's fine if an older version <i>breaks</i> for newer Python. But
I'm less 
sure that silently installing the wrong package is acceptable. People do
use older versions of pip, and loud breakages aren't the same as silent
errors. 
</blockquote>


<p>
He noted that <tt>pip</tt> has a policy that users should always upgrade to
the latest version, but that the project has no specific policy on silent
errors of this sort.  He is concerned that those who want to experiment
with the no-GIL (or "free-threaded") builds will be put off if they end up
"<q>having to debug ABI compatibility issues like this</q>".  Gaynor <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/15">agreed</a>,
noting that "<q><tt>pip</tt> silently doing the wrong thing creates a flood
of issues</q>" for the packages affected.
</p>

<p>
Barry Warsaw <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/5">asked</a>
about whether there were plans for allowing installation of both
interpreter types on the same system. Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/7">said</a>
that the situation was the same as having two different versions of Python
installed. Warsaw <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/8">thought</a>
that was reasonable and that it is not too difficult handle parallel
installations. In the message linked above, Cannon said that one solution
could be a 
"fat" wheel that had both binaries, as long as the names of those binaries
in the wheel were distinct.
</p>

<h4>Naming</h4>

<p>
But the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/naming-the-python-binary-when-disable-gil-is-set/34052">naming
discussion</a> got spun off into its own thread—once it clearly headed in
that direction, anyway.  Moore said that it was important to be able to
install both interpreters so that people can easily test the no-GIL mode;
if that is not straightforward to do, in Windows, macOS, Linux, and others,
it will negatively impact the no-GIL project:
</p><blockquote>
This links back to the packaging question, because how easy it is for users
to try out nogil builds, and how easy it is for a user to select between
nogil and gil, will strongly affect how much demand there is for nogil
builds, and hence how much pressure there will be on package maintainers to
provide nogil-compatible wheels in the first place. 
</blockquote>


<p>
Barry Scott <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/naming-the-python-binary-when-disable-gil-is-set/34052/3">wondered</a>
what names would be used, noting that the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29">shebang line</a>" 
(i.e. "<tt>#!/usr/bin/python</tt>" or similar at the top of a script)
needs to indicate which interpreter to invoke, which should the same across
all of the platforms if possible:
</p><blockquote>
The gil version of python executable is "python3".
What is the name of the nogil executable? "python-nogil3",
"python-nogil3.13" etc? 
</blockquote>


<p>
But the no-GIL build for&nbsp;3.13 is clearly meant as an experimental feature,
Gregory P. Smith <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/naming-the-python-binary-when-disable-gil-is-set/34052/5">said</a>,
which means that distributions should not be putting that build on
the default <tt>$PATH</tt>, at least in his opinion.  Smith is a member of
the steering council, but noted that he was using his "<q>personal
reply hat</q>".  Having a lengthy name for the interpreter that lingers for
long periods afterward because it remains in shebang lines is not
desirable, so he suggested waiting: 
</p><blockquote>
In effect this defers any potential install naming decision until&nbsp;3.14 or
later once we've got some practical knowledge of how things are working out
- we'll presumably know better at that time if there's a need for parallel
installs. It's okay for some things like this to be decided later, in
effect that is why <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/#python-build-modes">PEP-703 has an
Open Issues section</a> not fully specifying this area today. 
</blockquote>


<p>
But Fedora developer Petr Viktorin <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/naming-the-python-binary-when-disable-gil-is-set/34052/6">pointed
out</a> that distributions are likely to want to package the no-GIL
interpreter for their users to experiment with.  Moore <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/naming-the-python-binary-when-disable-gil-is-set/34052/7">agreed</a>
that users are going to want that:

</p><blockquote>
I would like to be able to write scripts with <tt>#!/usr/bin/env
python3.13-nogil</tt> (or something like that) in order to get the free threaded
build <i>without</i> needing to hard-code a long and probably non-intuitive path
(which on Windows is also user-specific). 
</blockquote>



<p>
In another <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/nogil-installers-on-windows/34049">thread</a> that was started by Steve Dower, who creates the official
Python packages for Windows, Smith <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/nogil-installers-on-windows/34049/3">noted</a>
that the steering council has agreed that it wants to avoid the name
"nogil" to describe the build.  With his council hat on, he
said that there were two reasons behind this decision: it "<q>does not
communicate well to most non-core devs, people need not know what a GIL
is</q>" and it contains a negative.  There is a suggested alternative:

</p><blockquote>
A more appropriate term for this experimental in&nbsp;3.13 build if you have a
need to provide builds is "free-threading". We realize "free-threading"
doesn't roll off the tongue like two-syllable "nogil" does, but it should
be more understandable to people-who-are-not-us. 
</blockquote>



<p>
That set off some predictable bikeshedding on naming, with several in the
thread noting that they think "nogil" is the better choice—or at least that
they
are perfectly happy with that name.  Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/nogil-installers-on-windows/34049/7">thought</a>
that the suggested alternative was confusing: "<q>While I understand the
objections to 'nogil', I don't think 'free-threading' is likely to be
understood by people-who-are-not-us.</q>" He noted that the term is not
widely used elsewhere.  Most participants generally just wanted to use
something short—"nogil" was the clear "winner" in that department—but none
of the suggestions made there seemed to resonate.  The one concrete change
was to switch the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/#build-configuration-changes">ABI
tag for the no-GIL builds</a> from "n" to "t" (for "threading"). Excising
"nogil" at this point is going to be something of an uphill climb, it would
seem. 
</p>

<h4>Proposing abi4</h4>

<p>
Back in the original thread, there was some discussion, mostly between
Viktorin and Gross, about problem areas in the API changes that Gross
proposed. That led to a <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/27">new
proposal</a> that incorporated the feedback and adopted the idea of
creating a new ABI, abi4.  Gross has developed a <a href="https://github.com/colesbury/cpython/commit/2c1d02a85ac3b41c545d1089f7439b108059cb53">prototype</a>
of the new ABI.  Viktorin is <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/29">generally
in agreement</a> with the approach, though some details still need to be
worked out.
</p>

<p>
One of those details is that a PEP for abi4 is needed, as Stinner <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/32">pointed
out</a>.  Viktorin <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/33">agreed</a>
("<q>This is a pre-PEP discussion.</q>") and it would seem that the mid-October
core developer sprint will be the venue for some face-to-face discussions
on the topic.
In particular, there is confusion about the compatibility guarantees
provided by the combinations of various limited API versions and abi3,
which will impact what will happen with abi4.  Research on those issues is <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-abis-and-pep-703/34018/54">ongoing</a>.
</p>

<p>
So, work on the no-GIL (or free-threaded) version of CPython is proceeding
apace, but the final acceptance of the PEP is <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/status-of-pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-in-cpython-is-it-accepted-or-a-draft/35635">still
pending</a>.  It is somewhat surprising that there has been such a lengthy
delay, but PEP&nbsp;703 and its knock-on effects are likely to dominate
CPython development—and ecosystem—over the next five or more
years, so the 
steering council wants to make its acceptance criteria clear.  As council
member Thomas Wouters <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/status-of-pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-in-cpython-is-it-accepted-or-a-draft/35635/2">put
it</a>: "<q>we're ironing out the exact acceptance text (we want to clarify
a lot of our decisions)</q>".  Some of that work may happen at the sprint
as well.

</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656606000055" target="new">2006 study</a>,  neuroscientist John Cacioppo and his colleagues hypnotized college students to re-experience a moment in their life when they were lonely. “Think of a time in which you felt isolated," they told the subjects. "You felt lonely. Perhaps you felt like you just didn’t belong – that you had no friends.” After confirming the hypnotism worked, they asked the students how they felt.

</p><p>Which step of the ladder do you feel you personally stand at the present time?

It makes us so vulnerable because it means telling someone that you're hurting on a primal level. So we don't talk about it. The epidemic becomes invisible.
</p><p>I see myself in so many people in this story. I see college students who spend all day around other people, only to feel completely alone. I see 20-somethings spend all day at work in hopes of filling a social void. I see middle-aged people desperately trying to be wealthy and successful, because they think it will make them worthy of love. I see elderly people who trigger my deep fear of isolation in old age, even though that's become the norm.
</p><p>If they are anything like me, they're not telling anyone they're lonely – or even admitting it to themselves.
</p><p>So here's my first attempt: I want to be around people who care about me – and I want to be able to take care of them. I want my world to be filled with the warmth of loved ones, from now until death. 
</p><p>But, really, I just don't want to go to sleep feeling like I'm all alone.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </div>  <p>12:01 am </p> <p>12:02 am </p> <p>12:03 am </p> <p>12:04 am </p> <p>12:05 am </p> <p>12:06 am </p> <p>12:07 am </p> <p>12:08 am </p> <p>12:09 am </p> <p>12:10 am </p> <p>12:11 am </p> <p>12:12 am </p> <p>12:13 am </p> <p>12:14 am </p> <p>12:15 am </p> <p>12:16 am </p> <p>12:17 am </p> <p>12:18 am </p> <p>12:19 am </p> <p>12:20 am </p> <p>12:21 am </p> <p>12:22 am </p> <p>12:23 am </p> <p>12:24 am </p> <p>12:25 am </p> <p>12:26 am </p> <p>12:27 am </p> <p>12:28 am </p> <p>12:29 am </p> <p>12:30 am </p> <p>12:31 am </p> <p>12:32 am </p> <p>12:33 am </p> <p>12:34 am </p> <p>12:35 am </p> <p>12:36 am </p> <p>12:37 am </p> <p>12:38 am </p> <p>12:39 am </p> <p>12:40 am </p> <p>12:41 am </p> <p>12:42 am </p> <p>12:43 am </p> <p>12:44 am </p> <p>12:45 am </p> <p>12:46 am </p> <p>12:47 am </p> <p>12:48 am </p> <p>12:49 am </p> <p>12:50 am </p> <p>12:51 am </p> <p>12:52 am </p> <p>12:53 am </p> <p>12:54 am </p> <p>12:55 am </p> <p>12:56 am </p> <p>12:57 am </p> <p>12:58 am </p> <p>12:59 am </p> <p>1:00 am </p> <p>1:01 am </p> <p>1:02 am </p> <p>1:03 am </p> <p>1:04 am </p> <p>1:05 am </p> <p>1:06 am </p> <p>1:07 am </p> <p>1:08 am </p> <p>1:09 am </p> <p>1:10 am </p> <p>1:11 am </p> <p>1:12 am </p> <p>1:13 am </p> <p>1:14 am </p> <p>1:15 am </p> <p>1:16 am </p> <p>1:17 am </p> <p>1:18 am </p> <p>1:19 am </p> <p>1:20 am </p> <p>1:21 am </p> <p>1:22 am </p> <p>1:23 am </p> <p>1:24 am </p> <p>1:25 am </p> <p>1:26 am </p> <p>1:27 am </p> <p>1:28 am </p> <p>1:29 am </p> <p>1:30 am </p> <p>1:31 am </p> <p>1:32 am </p> <p>1:33 am </p> <p>1:34 am </p> <p>1:35 am </p> <p>1:36 am </p> <p>1:37 am </p> <p>1:38 am </p> <p>1:39 am </p> <p>1:40 am </p> <p>1:41 am </p> <p>1:42 am </p> <p>1:43 am </p> <p>1:44 am </p> <p>1:45 am </p> <p>1:46 am </p> <p>1:47 am </p> <p>1:48 am </p> <p>1:49 am </p> <p>1:50 am </p> <p>1:51 am </p> <p>1:52 am </p> <p>1:53 am </p> <p>1:54 am </p> <p>1:55 am </p> <p>1:56 am </p> <p>1:57 am </p> <p>1:58 am </p> <p>1:59 am </p> <p>2:00 am </p> <p>2:01 am </p> <p>2:02 am </p> <p>2:03 am </p> <p>2:04 am </p> <p>2:05 am </p> <p>2:06 am </p> <p>2:07 am </p> <p>2:08 am </p> <p>2:09 am </p> <p>2:10 am </p> <p>2:11 am </p> <p>2:12 am </p> <p>2:13 am </p> <p>2:14 am </p> <p>2:15 am </p> <p>2:16 am </p> <p>2:17 am </p> <p>2:18 am </p> <p>2:19 am </p> <p>2:20 am </p> <p>2:21 am </p> <p>2:22 am </p> <p>2:23 am </p> <p>2:24 am </p> <p>2:25 am </p> <p>2:26 am </p> <p>2:27 am </p> <p>2:28 am </p> <p>2:29 am </p> <p>2:30 am </p> <p>2:31 am </p> <p>2:32 am </p> <p>2:33 am </p> <p>2:34 am </p> <p>2:35 am </p> <p>2:36 am </p> <p>2:37 am </p> <p>2:38 am </p> <p>2:39 am </p> <p>2:40 am </p> <p>2:41 am </p> <p>2:42 am </p> <p>2:43 am </p> <p>2:44 am </p> <p>2:45 am </p> <p>2:46 am </p> <p>2:47 am </p> <p>2:48 am </p> <p>2:49 am </p> <p>2:50 am </p> <p>2:51 am </p> <p>2:52 am </p> <p>2:53 am </p> <p>2:54 am </p> <p>2:55 am </p> <p>2:56 am </p> <p>2:57 am </p> <p>2:58 am </p> <p>2:59 am </p> <p>3:00 am </p> <p>3:01 am </p> <p>3:02 am </p> <p>3:03 am </p> <p>3:04 am </p> <p>3:05 am </p> <p>3:06 am </p> <p>3:07 am </p> <p>3:08 am </p> <p>3:09 am </p> <p>3:10 am </p> <p>3:11 am </p> <p>3:12 am </p> <p>3:13 am </p> <p>3:14 am </p> <p>3:15 am </p> <p>3:16 am </p> <p>3:17 am </p> <p>3:18 am </p> <p>3:19 am </p> <p>3:20 am </p> <p>3:21 am </p> <p>3:22 am </p> <p>3:23 am </p> <p>3:24 am </p> <p>3:25 am </p> <p>3:26 am </p> <p>3:27 am </p> <p>3:28 am </p> <p>3:29 am </p> <p>3:30 am </p> <p>3:31 am </p> <p>3:32 am </p> <p>3:33 am </p> <p>3:34 am </p> <p>3:35 am </p> <p>3:36 am </p> <p>3:37 am </p> <p>3:38 am </p> <p>3:39 am </p> <p>3:40 am </p> <p>3:41 am </p> <p>3:42 am </p> <p>3:43 am </p> <p>3:44 am </p> <p>3:45 am </p> <p>3:46 am </p> <p>3:47 am </p> <p>3:48 am </p> <p>3:49 am </p> <p>3:50 am </p> <p>3:51 am </p> <p>3:52 am </p> <p>3:53 am </p> <p>3:54 am </p> <p>3:55 am </p> <p>3:56 am </p> <p>3:57 am </p> <p>3:58 am </p> <p>3:59 am </p> <p>4:00 am </p></div><p>Thank you for reading to the end!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/hackers-stole-access-tokens-from-oktas-support-unit/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/hackers-stole-access-tokens-from-oktas-support-unit/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37959904">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p><strong>Okta</strong>, a company that provides identity tools like multi-factor authentication and single sign-on to thousands of businesses, has suffered a security breach involving a compromise of its customer support unit, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Okta says the incident affected a “very small number” of customers, however it appears the hackers responsible had access to Okta’s support platform for at least two weeks before the company fully contained the intrusion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/okta-ss.png" alt="" width="672" height="426"></p>
<p>In an advisory sent to an undisclosed number of customers on Oct. 19, Okta said it “has identified adversarial activity that leveraged access to a stolen credential to access Okta’s support case management system. The threat actor was able to view files uploaded by certain Okta customers as part of recent support cases.”</p>
<p>Okta explained that when it is troubleshooting issues with customers it will often ask for a recording of a Web browser session (a.k.a. an HTTP Archive or <strong>HAR</strong> file). These are sensitive files because in this case they include the customer’s cookies and session tokens, which intruders can then use to impersonate valid users.</p>
<p>“Okta has worked with impacted customers to investigate, and has taken measures to protect our customers, including the revocation of embedded session tokens,” their notice continued. “In general, Okta recommends sanitizing all credentials and cookies/session tokens within a HAR file before sharing it.”</p>
<p>The security firm <strong>BeyondTrust</strong> is among the Okta customers who received Thursday’s alert from Okta. BeyondTrust Chief Technology Officer <strong>Marc Maiffret</strong> said that alert came more than two weeks after his company alerted Okta to a potential problem.</p>
<p>Maiffret emphasized that BeyondTrust caught the attack earlier this month as it was happening, and that none of its own customers were affected. He said that on Oct 2., BeyondTrust’s security team detected that someone was trying to use an Okta account assigned to one of their engineers to create an all-powerful administrator account within their Okta environment.</p>
<p>When BeyondTrust reviewed the activity of the employee account that tried to create the new administrative profile, they found that — just 30 minutes prior to the unauthorized activity — one of their support engineers shared with Okta one of these HAR files that contained a valid Okta session token, Maiffret said.</p>
<p>“Our admin sent that [HAR file] over at Okta’s request, and 30 minutes after that the attacker started doing session hijacking, tried to replay the browser session and leverage the cookie in that browser recording to act on behalf of that user,” he said.</p>
<p>Maiffret said BeyondTrust followed up with Okta on Oct. 3 and said they were fairly confident Okta had suffered an intrusion, and that he reiterated that conclusion in a phone call with Okta on October 11 and again on Oct. 13.</p>
<p>In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Okta’s Deputy Chief Information Security Officer <strong>Charlotte Wylie</strong> said Okta initially believed that BeyondTrust’s alert on Oct. 2 was not a result of a breach in its systems. But she said that by Oct. 17, the company had identified and contained the incident — disabling the compromised customer case management account, and invalidating Okta access tokens associated with that account.<span id="more-65404"></span></p>
<p>Wylie declined to say exactly how many customers received alerts of a potential security issue, but characterized it as a “very, very small subset” of its more than 18,000 customers.</p>
<p>The disclosure from Okta comes just weeks after casino giants <strong>Caesar’s Entertainment</strong> and <strong>MGM Resorts</strong> were hacked. In both cases, the attackers managed to social engineer employees into <a href="https://sec.okta.com/articles/2023/08/cross-tenant-impersonation-prevention-and-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resetting the multi-factor login requirements for Okta administrator accounts</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2022, Okta disclosed a breach from the hacking group LAPSUS$, a criminal hacking group that specialized in social-engineering employees at targeted companies. An <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/04/okta-concludes-its-investigation-into-the-january-2022-compromise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after-action report from Okta</a> on that incident found that LAPSUS$ had social engineered its way onto the workstation of a support engineer at Sitel, a third-party outsourcing company that had access to Okta resources.</p>
<p>Okta’s Wylie declined to answer questions about how long the intruder may have had access to the company’s case management account, or who might have been responsible for the attack. However, she did say the company believes this is an adversary they have seen before.</p>
<p>“This is a known threat actor that we believe has targeted us and Okta-specific customers,” Wylie said.</p>

They can and will ruin everything you loveby Miranda Reinert In March of 2022, Bandcamp</p><p><img src="https://www.welcometohellworld.com/favicon.ico" alt=""><span>Welcome to Hell World</span><span>Luke O’Neil</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.welcometohellworld.com/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-19-at-8.47.35-AM.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><!--members-only--><hr><p>In March of 2022, <a href="https://bandcamp.com/?ref=welcometohellworld.com" rel="noreferrer">Bandcamp</a> was acquired by Epic Games, the folks behind Fortnite and Unreal Engine. While the change in ownership raised eyebrows and triggered endless jokes, the site seemed to stay running much the same at first. Just over a year later in May of 2023 it was announced that Bandcamp’s employees voted 31-7 to unionize as Bandcamp United and were to be recognized by Epic. All the while Bandcamp Daily’s distinctive editorial coverage continued. Their popular Bandcamp Fridays – an initiative started in 2020 in which the site forgoes their 15% fee of sales on the first Friday of each month – also continued.&nbsp;So far so good.</p><p>Then at the end of September 2023 it was announced that Epic would be selling Bandcamp to content licensing and service company Songtradr. As of their initial statement regarding the acquisition, Songtradr is planning to continue Bandcamp Friday, keep Bandcamp Daily, and maintain all current features, but they were clear that not all employees would be retained. As with all layoffs, this decision was presented as a necessary evil – there’s simply no way they could run this company with all those employees! – but they swore to you, their darling consumer, that you would feel no effects.&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, having observed one single corporate acquisition before, Songtradr didn't recognize Bandcamp’s union, and employees remained in limbo for weeks before it was finally announced who would be let go – 60 of the 118 employees, slashing 50% or more across all departments, including half of the Bandcamp Daily editorial staff and 70% of the vinyl team. SFGate <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/bandcamp-bargaining-union-layoffs-songtradr-18432047.php?ref=welcometohellworld.com" rel="noreferrer">reports that</a> the layoffs disproportionately impact those eligible for union membership, including every member of their 8 person bargaining team. But don’t worry about that! Songtradr loves your community! Their CEO is a “passionate musician” himself. You can trust him. Paul Wiltshire would have you believe his company is aligned with artists, even if he comes at music <a href="https://themusicnetwork.com/paul-wiltshire-interview/?ref=welcometohellworld.com" rel="noreferrer">with beliefs like</a> “music as a whole is inherently more valuable as a consequence” of catalog sales – i.e. the transfer of entire catalogs of music to venture capitalist firms looking to exploit copyrights they had no hand in creating. It’s a trend underscored not by increased value of art, but a change in who is able to actually profit off art. The current state of the music industry has devalued music to the point massive artists will make more money selling off their rights than they can off sales.&nbsp;</p><p>This has been the first blow to Bandcamp’s pretty untouchable reputation. While Bandcamp has always been a tech company, it has also long been seen as a line of defense against the big, bad music streaming services, and has held a culture of its own as a discovery tool for underground, independent music. It is a website that has been able to garner goodwill on all three prongs of its offerings. It’s a music journalism outlet – importantly, that pays – uniquely interested in underground, independent art. It’s a natural extension of the reputation of being able to stumble upon great, independent music via the database of extensively tagged music. Bandcamp Daily has been a beacon of interesting and diverse coverage in a music journalism landscape that is increasingly only interested in finding a way to shoehorn Taylor Swift in wherever they can.</p><p>From an artist perspective, the combination of the coverage Bandcamp Daily provides and the nature of the built-in discovery tools has made the site integral to being seen in an increasingly crowded digital world. Upon news of the sale and of layoffs, musicians took to Twitter to give their support to the Bandcamp staff and share their worry about the future due to what Bandcamp has meant to them. New Zealand musician, Lukas Mayo, who makes music under the name Pickle Darling, <a href="https://twitter.com/pickledarlinggg/status/1707490206600040482?s=20&amp;ref=welcometohellworld.com" rel="noreferrer">expressed concern</a> that much of their favorite music “is going to disappear forever” and credits former members of the editorial staff at Bandcamp for all of the traction their music ever received – “no algorithms, just people who loved music and wanted to highlight music they loved, without any concern about how ‘big’ or important the artist was,” <a href="https://twitter.com/pickledarlinggg/status/1714248878135169028?s=20&amp;ref=welcometohellworld.com" rel="noreferrer">they said</a>. Philadelphia indie punk band Gladie credited the platform with being instrumental in their ability to self release their album, Don’t Know What You’re in Until You’re Out, but <a href="https://twitter.com/Glad_eee/status/1714070379554091515?s=20https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FGlad_eee%2Fstatus%2F1714070379554091515%3Fs%3D20&amp;ref=welcometohellworld.com" rel="noreferrer">remain skeptical</a> of what Songtradr will do “to a once beloved community in order to squeeze out every last dollar for its investors.”&nbsp;</p><p>Social media is full of endless sentiments bolstering the fact that Bandcamp has achieved a reputation of being a mostly altruistic, artist first company up to this point. It’s hard to overstate just how much good will Bandcamp has been able to accrue. Just like Spotify is trying to be seen as synonymous with the very concept of listening to music, Bandcamp has aimed to be seen as synonymous with the act of supporting artists. And what’s more they’ve succeeded! It’s a convenient service that is seen as <em>the</em> alternative to fractions of pennies per stream and unpredictable algorithms. The refrain is everywhere: Don’t stream music on Spotify! Go buy it on Bandcamp!</p><p>Bandcamp has been the reputational beneficiary of an unforced binary born of the era of convenience internet. It is the very rare decent middle man that is providing enough value to the thing people care about – supporting music and the artists who make it – that it’s become the only logical music purchasing option for many people. Fans have built libraries and have been able to feel good doing it. People want to support people who make the art and media that they enjoy. It’s obvious in the rise of OnlyFans and of newsletters helmed by individual writers.&nbsp; What Bandcamp did was make it so easy to feel good about the company beyond being that middle man service. It’s even more centralized than supporting writers through newsletters, as much as Substack would like you to see them as synonymous with supporting writers. The reputation is better than OnlyFans because the platform doesn’t appear to be as much at odds with the people creating the content on the site.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite discussions centered so much around editorial staff layoffs and the implications for music journalism, I think Bandcamp should be discussed more like MySpace than it is like, for example, a formerly taste-making site like Vice. This is a story about the cyclical issue with the internet. Bandcamp and MySpace were both built by people who genuinely love music. They have served as universes within themselves where the possibilities of music discovery are endless – it’s easy to search for hours and find new, exciting music within any genre or location imaginable. They have both had curated homepages run by people with deep, earnest connections to music who are hoping to bring ears to the best of what’s available on their respective websites. They’ve both spawned new genres and music scenes, because that’s what happens when that’s where the musicians can be found. Perhaps most importantly, they both have also offered the great promise of the internet – the idea of democratization. This idea that you can skirt the music industry, release whatever you want to everybody in the world directly through this one website, and the people will find you.&nbsp;</p><p>It can work. At least until the companies with dubious interest in “music culture” decide it’s not enough to just sustain. The line must go up infinitely. Beloved websites are destroyed by money hungry ghouls everyday. The websites I spent years of my life reading as a teenager desperate to read about music and culture — The AV Club, Gawker, Noisey— existed as hollowed out versions of themselves to different degrees long after they became depressing to look at. Whether it comes down to an SEO click farm, a shell of former infamy without understanding what made it successful, or a slow fade out of anything published at all— they all end up looking the same. They’re graveyards of broken and unreadable articles that changed my life.</p><p>Just like all those websites, MySpace was a zombie of itself for a long time before the nails were finally put in the coffin. We know the end of the MySpace saga. Now it’s nothing but a memory of a seemingly better version of the intersection of music and the internet. It’s easy to believe that in 15 years someone will be writing a book mourning the heyday of Bandcamp when it had the power to make real careers and real scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The companies that buy up sites like Bandcamp are interested in nothing except ensuring the executives’ pockets get lined appropriately. Growth is the only thing of interest. It’s the story of capitalism, but here, like with MySpace, it becomes a matter of cultural preservation. They can – and will – ruin everything you love and wipe it from existence. MySpace lost 13 years of music, photos, and videos. We can talk about what was going on on MySpace and interview people who were there, but the data being erased remains an unimaginable culture loss. It’s difficult to even know what has been lost due to the sheer incompetence. Right now there are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23899461/discogs-sellers-vinyl-cds-community-fees?ref=welcometohellworld.com">brewing problems over at resale site and database</a>, Discogs, due to increased fees as a result of a push for growth and in exchange for very little in terms of functionality. The data Discogs has – just like Bandcamp and just like what has been lost at MySpace – is irreplaceable and ever growing. So to have years of culture on Twitter – everything from the continued existence of legacy accounts to the basic usefulness of news organizations being verified –  been ravaged by Elon Musk’s vanity. The internet is forever, until it’s ripped away by people who don’t add value to it.</p><p>Bandcamp isn’t gone, and maybe it won’t really deteriorate or go away, but it feels as though everybody has come to the conclusion that no website is acting in your best interest – no matter the reputation. No parent company willing to slash half a staff cares about your music community, even if purchasing items through their web stores is still more beneficial to an artist than pulling it up on Spotify. The writing is on the wall, and it has caused a mourning in the broader music community of what Bandcamp represents. Or we thought it represented.</p><p>It’s hard, right now, to imagine something that could be able to take Bandcamp’s place because it’s hard to imagine something that will be as usable and as convenient without the money vultures picking it clean. Maybe something will come along – the nature of the internet is that things will be cycled out when something new arrives – but, as of now, I think we may have to just move away from the idea that a convenient service is also going to be a stable, long term home for community.</p><p>In Aaron Cometbus’s 2019 book Post-Mortem, the question “what’s left if Gilman Street closes?” is raised. The answer given is easy. The people are left. The loss of the place will be felt, but the people will still be there. Music community in Chicago persists without the Fireside Bowl. Music community in Boston persists without Great Scott. Music community in Philly persists without Everybody Hits. Music culture persists in spite of the corporate overlords who make it harder because it has to. Music community online will persist without Bandcamp or Twitter or Tumblr or MySpace or whatever comes next, but we can’t let it be wiped away completely.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime download your music libraries and the PDFs of articles you’ve written if you’re a writer. Make your own web stores to sell you art. Pay the people you believe in to write about music. Nobody will preserve the culture you care about for you. Nobody can make it better but us.</p><p><em>Miranda Reinert is a writer, podcaster and zine maker based in Chicago.

<p>Research published yesterday by several European media outlets has revealed that an international campaign in support of the EU’s proposed child sexual abuse regulation has been largely orchestrated and financed by a network of organisations <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/">with links to the tech industry and security services</a>. The controversial “chat control” regulation would require providers to indiscriminately scan and automatically disclose allegedly suspicious private messages and photos. EU Parliament lawmaker Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party), negotiator for the Greens/European Free Alliance group on the proposed regulation, expresses shock:</p>



<p>“As negotiator for my group, many of the organisations mentioned in the report, which call themselves child protection organisations or victims’ associations, also contacted me. But I had no idea that the pro-chat control campaign was being orchestrated and funded by a network of organisations linked to the tech industry and security services, drawing millions in funding from a US-led foundation and paying foreign consulting agencies to create lobbying strategies. I had previously only expected corporations to use such methods of ‘capturing legislation’.</p>



<p>To set a precedent, US stakeholders apparently want to push through indiscriminate screening of our private messages and photos in Europe, which is not law in the US itself.</p>



<p>So far, the EU’s Home Affairs Commission has mainly attracted attention <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/platforms/news/fact-checkers-call-out-commission-on-anti-child-abuse-material-proposal/">as a source of misinformation on chat control</a>. Yesterday’s report makes EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson look like a double agent of foreign interference. We urgently need a legislative footprint that exposes such remote-controlled and foreign-dictated legislation. This is about nothing less than defending our democracy and our fundamental right to digital privacy of correspondence!”</p>



<p>Commenting on the report, President of non-commercial encrypted messaging service Signal <a href="https://mastodon.world/@Mer__edith/111125416449604414">Meredith Whittaker said</a>, “the best follow the money reporting on who’s behind the global attack on digital privacy yet.</p>



<p>It’s law enforcement x AI companies posing as NGOs with a commercial interest in selling scammy mass scanning tech. Deeply cynical, deeply shady.”</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1706299597813887456">Cryptologist Matthew Green commented</a>, “Just saw this new investigation into the web of for-profit AI companies pushing anti-encryption legislation in Europe, and it feels like the work of secret organization in a James Bond movie.”</p>



<p><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/press-release-csa-regulation-who-benefits-from-the-eu-commissions-mass-surveillance-law/">Diego Naranjo, Head of Policy of European Digital Rights</a>, said “The investigation published today confirms our worst fears: The most criticised European law touching on technology in the last decade is the product of the lobby of private corporations and law enforcement. Commissioner Johansson ignored academia and civil society in Europe while she shook hands with Big Tech in order to propose a law that will attempt to legalise mass surveillance and break encryption.”</p>
