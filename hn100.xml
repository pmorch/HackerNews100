<p>Many large concerts feature wristbands that light up on command. They are used to produce varied visual effects across a stadium. One company that makes these is <a href="https://pixmob.com/">PixMob</a>. Their controllable, illuminated wristbands are currently being used as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour">Taylor Swift's Eras Tour</a>. A short Wired article <a href="https://wired.me/technology/the-tech-behind-taylor-swift-concert-wristbands/">here</a> gives some details and here's a video from the Wall Street Journal:</p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCsmZA08oD8?si=e3755KHJFdna_zBV" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p><p>For the Eras Tour the company's X2 product is being used.

So, simply put, PixMob works by installed a really big (and moveable) IR remote control (you can read about this on their website <a href="https://pixmob.com/our-effects">here</a>) and transmitting commands to the bracelets to produce colours, fades, flashes, etc. Cute.</p><p>There are a bunch of hardware details <a href="https://yeokhengmeng.com/2019/08/teardown-of-ndp2019-led-wristband/">here</a>.</p><p>Since they are projecting infrared with moveable projector they can sweep effects around the stadium, and cover the projector with cut outs to make things like hearts. It's simple technology that works very nicely. And, of course, there's a reverse engineering community built up around this.</p><p>The best place to start learning about that is <a href="https://github.com/danielweidman/pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering">this</a> GitHub repository. It brings together a bunch of reverse engineering efforts that have looked into the IR protocol. These have been somewhat successful and, since the <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero</a> has IR capability, there's a <a href="https://github.com/danielweidman/flipper-pixmob-ir-codes">project</a> that makes it control the wristband.</p><p>Here's a short video of me making the wristbands fade orange.</p><p>Such nice simple technology that produces very cool effects.</p>

The circle of dealers is small - so the internet has become a vital trading tool and eBay in particular a rich source of bargains.</p><p>Millions of miscellaneous items are posted for sale each day, but on 7 August 2016, something unusual happened.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Dr Ittai Gradel collects ancient gemstones</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>A grey and white piece of a cameo gemstone featuring Priapus - the Greek god of fertility - was posted by a user called "sultan1966" for just £40.</p><p>The listing was taken down after a few hours, unsold.</p><p>Priapus is one of the more memorable gods - often depicted with his oversized genitals on show. The seller may have hoped Priapus' brief appearance online had gone unnoticed - but alas not.</p><p>It was spotted by Dr Gradel, who says he was born with a photographic memory.</p><p>He says the unusual skill has helped him identify rare finds. In this case, it would also help him uncover the identity of a suspected thief.</p><p>Dr Gradel had been buying gemstones from sultan1966 on eBay for almost two years. The seller had told him his name was Paul Higgins and that he had inherited the gems from a grandfather. They were being sold at bargain prices but Dr Gradel could tell many were very valuable.</p><p>This time, he knew he had seen the Priapus cameo before. He was sure it featured in an old gems catalogue he owned from one of the world’s most famous institutions, the British Museum.</p><p>“There was no doubt it was the same object and I was confused,” he says.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Priapus cameo listed on eBay matched a picture in the Walters 1926 catalogue and an image on the British Museum website</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>The museum has since said in documents filed at the High Court that it believes the cameo had been taken from a storeroom in the Greece and Rome department by a senior curator, Dr Peter Higgs, just a week before it appeared for sale.</p><p>Dr Higgs started working at the British Museum in 1993 as a research assistant, having studied archaeology at the University of Liverpool.</p><p>Living in an ordinary semi-detached house in Hastings on the south coast, he was later described by the museum’s chairman as a “rather quiet, introverted” person.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Dr Peter Higgs started working at the museum in 1993</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>Within hours of removing the eBay listing in 2016, the museum believes Dr Higgs logged into its database and attempted to tamper with the Priapus cameo's catalogue entry.</p><p>An estimated 2.4 million items at the museum are uncatalogued, or partially uncatalogued, out of its total collection of 8 million. The museum, which has now brought a civil court case against Dr Higgs, believes he was mostly targeting these uncatalogued artefacts - and that, this time, he had made a mistake.</p><p>Dr Higgs would have been able to see the cameo was a catalogued item, searchable by the public and staff alike. It was even on the museum’s website - it was not the kind of item that could disappear and not be missed.</p><p>If his tampering had been successful, says the museum in its court papers, it would have hidden the database photo of the cameo from view - but it says he failed.</p><p>The next day, Dr Higgs is known to have returned alone to the storeroom where the cameo was kept, the museum says.

It would be worth double that, says the museum, if it still had its gold mount.</p><p>Dr Gradel says it is “totally bizarre” that he could sit at a computer on a small Danish island and be the first person to discover something was awry at the British Museum.</p><p>He wrote to sultan1966, the man he knew as Paul Higgins, asking why the Priapus cameo had been withdrawn. The seller replied saying it had been a mistake - it belonged to his sister, who didn't want him to sell it.</p><p>Dr Gradel chose not to alert sultan1966 about his suspicions. “That would enable him to cover his tracks,” he said.</p><p>Instead he decided to keep an eye on him - to see if any other pieces belonging to the museum appeared.</p><p>Four years would pass before the next clue - when Dr Gradel would make the shocking discovery that it appeared to be an inside job.</p></div><div width="wide"><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="The-second-clue" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">The second clue</span></h2></p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>In May 2020, Dr Gradel noticed an image in a newly published book on gemstones.</p><p>Figure 736 was a gem featuring a man who resembled the Roman Emperor Augustus. It was labelled as belonging to the British Museum.</p><p>The figure portrayed on the gem had an usual hairstyle for the period.</p><p>Suspicious once again, Dr Gradel looked through his records. </p><p>He matched the image in the book to a photograph on his computer hard drive of an olive-green gem fragment that he had previously been offered for sale by a British dealer called Malcolm Hay.</p><p>Dr Gradel told him about his suspicions around the gem right away.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Photos of gem casts resembled the gem fragment. The production process would have reversed the cast imprint - hence the face on the gem looks to the left</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>But when Malcolm Hay wrote to the museum to make enquiries about the startling similarity, he was told it was closed because of the Covid lockdown.</p><p>“[Deputy Director] Jonathan Williams replied to me, and he said, of course, there's no way of confirming anything at the moment because no-one could get into the museum,” Mr Hay said. “He asked me to hold it.”</p><p>Luckily, the person who had first sold it to Mr Hay happened to be a mutual friend of Dr Gradel’s - a gallery-owner in Bath called Rolf von Kiaer. Dr Gradel got in touch with him immediately.</p><p>Rolf replied that he had bought the olive-green gem on eBay a few years before.</p><p>The name of the seller? Sultan1966.</p><p>At this point, Dr Gradel feared something was very wrong. He began to comb through computer files and paper records of everything he had bought from sultan1966.</p><p>He meticulously went through eBay listings, correspondences and transaction receipts, dating back to his very first purchase from sultan1966 in 2014.</p><p>An online receipt provided a crucial clue - apparently revealing the seller's real name. It was listed as Peter Higgs rather than Paul Higgins.</p><p>“A PayPal receipt has to be attached to a real bank account,” Dr Gradel explains. “So this had to be his real name.”</p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>He immediately called Rolf von Kiaer once again.</p><p>“[Rolf] then said to me, ‘Ittai, you do realise that is the name of a curator in the British Museum Greece and Rome department, don't you?’ And I remember that distinctly, my hair stood on end, I was absolutely shocked by this.”</p><p>Over the coming days, Dr Gradel continued to unearth new connections between the online seller and Peter Higgs.</p><p>He discovered that “sultan1966” was also Dr Higgs’s account name on Twitter - now known as X - and that 1966 was the year he was born.</p><p>“The email address on the PayPal account was Bodrum1966,” said Dr Gradel. “His specialty was actually working on sculpture from ancient Halicarnassus in modern day Turkey. And the modern name of that place is Bodrum.”</p><p>Finally, Dr Gradel found an eBay receipt for a gem he had bought from sultan1966 that gave a full private address. Dr Gradel decided to check it against property records - and the name given was Peter Higgs, the British Museum curator.</p><p>Everything suddenly made sense to the Danish collector with the photographic memory.</p><p>“There was no other possible conclusion to draw from this. It was what it seemed to be - that the British Museum curator was pilfering his own museum,” says Dr Gradel.</p><p>Dr Higgs has since denied all the allegations and is defending the civil claim the British Museum is bringing against him.</p></div><div width="wide"><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Someone-could-be-framing-him" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">'Someone could be framing him'</span></h2></p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>While Dr Gradel was combing through his receipts, Peter Higgs’ career seemed to be going from strength to strength.</p><p>In January 2021, he was promoted to acting head of the Department of Greece and Rome, having built a reputation for helping track down stolen antiquities around the globe.</p><p>He had been described by the UK government as “a world-renowned curator” in 2015 after helping to return a stolen 2,000-year-old statue to Libya. Dr Higgs later appeared on BBC’s Crimewatch to describe his work.</p><p>When Dr Gradel emailed the museum’s management in February 2021 with his concerns about Dr Higgs, he got a return acknowledgement from deputy director Jonathan Williams but that was all.</p><p>Dr Gradel was unaware the management had already heard about the allegations against Dr Higgs just a day earlier, accompanied by a warning he might be being framed.  Dr Higgs had been tipped off by another archaeologist - Dorothy Lobel King, after Dr Gradel had approached her on social media for advice.</p><p>Ms Lobel King had become concerned Dr Higgs was being set up. She had emailed him, and he had forwarded the email on to Dr Williams the deputy director - the court documents now say.</p><p>The museum did investigate Dr Gradel’s concerns - but as it did so, Dr Higgs was allowed to keep running his department. He tried to throw colleagues off his scent, the museum says, by altering computer records and implying that items had gone missing decades earlier.</p></div><div data-component="image-block" width="wide"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The museum believes Dr Higgs covered his tracks by writing a note and making it appear as though it had been written in 1963</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>The day after Dr Gradel emailed his allegations, according to the museum’s court documents, it believes Dr Higgs made a report falsely claiming that the olive-green gem, which had been bought by Malcolm Hay, had actually been lost decades ago.</p><p>The museum also believes Dr Higgs marked the item as lost in its catalogue entry by inserting a note made to look like it had been written in 1963.</p><p>The British Museum chairman, George Osborne, says the museum’s court evidence suggested the thief had gone to “pretty elaborate lengths” to cover his tracks.</p><p>In May 2021, Malcolm Hay was invited to a meeting to hand back his gem. He said the museum was not really interested in where he had got it: “They were just happy to have it back.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr Gradel was growing increasingly anxious that he hadn’t heard anything back about his allegations, despite asking for an update several times. </p><p>Finally, in July 2021, he received a reply from deputy director Dr Williams saying the museum had carried out a “thorough investigation”. All objects had been accounted for, he was told, and there was no suggestion of wrongdoing by staff.</p><p>Dr Gradel says this was “bizarre to say the least - totally absurd”.</p><p>He knew Mr Hay’s gem had gone missing, been bought online and was only in the collection after being handed back. When Dr Gradel tried to find out more, the museum told him details were confidential.</p></div><div width="wide"><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 id="Gouging-marks-left-by-pliers" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">Gouging marks left by pliers</span></h2></p></div><div data-component="text-block" width="wide"><p>Inside the museum however, that was not the end of it.</p><p>In December 2021, a routine spot-check revealed items were missing in the Greece and Rome department and a top-secret second investigation was launched. The following April, a curator was hired to check every single item - although under the supervision of department head, Peter Higgs.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was becoming clear that something was very wrong.</p><p>The museum says the hired curator discovered that more than 300 registered items, many with gold mounts, had been damaged or stolen.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/lets-say-instead-of-auth/">https://ntietz.com/blog/lets-say-instead-of-auth/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40491480">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most computer systems we interact with have an auth system of some kind.
The problem is, that sentence is at best unclear and at worst nonsense.
"Auth" can mean at least two things: authentication or authorization<sup><a href="#or-verb-forms">1</a></sup>.
Which do we mean for an "auth system"?
It's never perfectly clear and, unfortunately, we often mean <em>both</em>.</p>
<p>This is a widespread problem, and it's well known.
One common solution, using the terms "authn" and "authz", doesn't solve the problem.
And this isn't just confusing, it leads to bad abstractions and general failures!</p>
<p><img src="https://ntietz.com/images/comics/logging-in.png" alt="Comic about an ambiguity in the term &quot;log in.&quot;" title="Tech support thought they had seen it all, but they hadn't met Sam yet"></p>
<h2 id="the-current-terms-fall-short">The current terms fall short</h2>
<p>Calling things just "auth" is common.
It's used in library names (<a href="https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/">django-allauth</a> is for authentication, and <a href="https://github.com/go-pkgz/auth">go-auth</a> is also authentication), package names (<code>django.contrib.auth</code>, which does both authentication and authorization), and even <a href="https://auth0.com/">company names</a>.</p>
<p>Since "auth" can mean two things, this naming leads to ambiguities.
When you see a new auth library or product, you don't know right away what it's able to handle.
And when you talk about it, it's also not clear what you're referring to.</p>
<p>The canonical solution is to call these "authn" and "authz", the n and z evoking the longer words.
Thes are just not satisfactory, though.
They're clunky and hard to understand: they're not universal enough to be able to skip explanation; they're easy to mishear and are close together; and what verb forms would we even use?</p>
<p>It's not just about bad communication, though.
This terminology implies that the two concepts, authentication and authorization, are more closely related than they are.
It encourages bad abstractions to combine them, because we have one word, so we feel like they <em>should</em> belong together.
But they are two pretty fundamentally distinct problems: checking who you are<sup><a href="#other-assertions">2</a></sup>, and specifying access rights.</p>
<p>There are some links between auth and auth<sup><a href="#sorry">3</a></sup>, because what you can do is tied to who you are.
But they're also very different, and deserve to be treated that way.
At the very least, recognizing that they're different leads to recognition that solving one does <em>not</em> solve the other.</p>
<h2 id="intead-use-permissions-and-login">Intead, use "permissions" and "login"</h2>
<p>We should always use the most clear terms we have.
Sometimes there's not a great option, but here, we have <em>wonderfully</em> clear terms.
Those are "login" for authentication and "permissions" for authorization.
Both are terms that will make sense with little explanation (in contrast to "authn" and "authz", which are confusing on first encounter) since almost everyone has logged into a system and has run into permissions issues.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use "login" here: the noun and the verb form.
The noun form is "login", which refers to the information you enter to gain access to the system.
And the verb form is "log in", which refers to the <em>action</em> of entering your login to use the system.</p>
<p>"Permissions" is just the noun form.
To use a verb, you would use "check permissions."
While this is long, it's also just... fine?
It hasn't been an issue in my experience.</p>
<p>Both of these are abundantly clear even to our peers in disciplines outside software engineering.
This to me makes it worth using them from a clarity perspective alone.
But then we have the big benefit to abstractions, as well.</p>
<p>When we call both by the same word, there's often an urge to combine them into a single module just by dint of the terminology.
This isn't necessarily wrong—there is certainly some merit to put them together, since permissions typically require a login.
But it's not necessary, either, and our designs will be stronger if we don't make that assumption and instead make a reasoned choice.</p>

      A new study from Lund University in Sweden suggests that tattoos could be a risk factor for cancer in the lymphatic system, or lymphoma. Now, the researchers underline the need for more research on the topic.<br>

  </p><div><p><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">Our knowledge regarding the long-term health effects of tattoos is currently poor, and there is not a lot of research within this area. Now a research group at Lund University has investigated the association between tattoos and lymphoma.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">“We have identified people diagnosed with lymphoma via population registers. These individuals were then matched with a control group of the same sex and age, but without lymphoma. The study participants answered a questionnaire about lifestyle factors to determine whether they were tattooed or not”, says Christel Nielsen, the researcher at Lund University who led the study.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">In total, the entire study included 11,905 people. Of these, 2,938 people had lymphoma when they were between 20 and 60 years old. Among them, 1,398 people answered the questionnaire, while the number of participants in the control group was 4,193. In the group with lymphoma, 21 percent were tattooed (289 individuals), while 18 percent were tattooed in the control group without a lymphoma diagnosis (735 individuals).</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">“After taking into account other relevant factors, such as smoking and age, we found that the risk of developing lymphoma was 21 percent higher among those who were tattooed. It is important to remember that lymphoma is a rare disease and that our results apply at the group level. The results now need to be verified and investigated further in other studies and such research is ongoing”, says Christel Nielsen.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">A hypothesis that Christel Nielsen's research group had before the study was that the size of the tattoo would affect the lymphoma risk. They thought that a full body tattoo might be associated with a greater risk of cancer compared to a small butterfly on the shoulder, for example. Unexpectedly, the area of tattooed body surface turned out not to matter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">“We do not yet know why this was the case. One can only speculate that a tattoo, regardless of size, triggers a low-grade inflammation in the body, which in turn can trigger cancer. The picture is thus more complex than we initially thought.” &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">Most people get their first tattoo at a young age, which means that you are exposed to tattoo ink for a large part of your life. Even so, research has only scratched the surface of the long-term health effects of tattoos.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">“We already know that when the tattoo ink is injected into the skin, the body interprets this as something foreign that should not be there and the immune system is activated. A large part of the ink is transported away from the skin, to the lymph nodes where it is deposited”, says Christel Nielsen.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">The research group will now proceed with studies of whether there is any association between tattoos and other types of cancer. They also want to do further research on other inflammatory diseases to see if there is a link to tattoos.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US" dir="ltr">“People will likely want to continue to express their identity through tattoos, and therefore it is very important that we as a society can make sure that it is safe. For the individual, it is good to know that tattoos can affect your health, and that you should turn to your health care provider if you experience symptoms that you believe could be related to your tattoo”, concludes Christel Nielsen.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/2024/04/300W-Linear-DualTracking-Lab-PSU">My brand new PSU</a>, the
most complicated circuit I designed and built just recently, started
life in October 2023. It seemed to work pretty well, at least I got
through the long and dark winter with it feeding my LED Superlamp.
(Most of the time. The rest of that time, I was using it for something
it was actually intended for, i.e., the feeding of an experimental
new circuit. By the light of a torch.)</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="mind-the-gap---or-blow-a-pcb-track">Mind the gap - or blow a PCB track!</h2>

<p>Then one day towards early Spring, while I was just sitting there,
<em>something</em> happened. I remember I was not doing anything in
particular when my subconscious alerted me to some weirdness going
on. I slowly came to realise that the weirdness was a really sharp bad
smell. A smell of something burning, or close to burning. I looked at
my bench supply – I clearly remember it was turned on but there
was nothing connected to it at the moment. And it seemed to be OK, at
least all the LED displays were lit up. But the voltage indicator was
strangely zeroed out, clearly in spite of the control settings.</p>

<p>Instinctively, I turned the instrument off, probably even before all
the above has fully gone through my head. Sniffing closer confirmed my
suspicion that the smell was indeed coming from my bench supply. I was
more than a little bit confused – what could cause such a sudden
and seemingly unprovoked failure (at idle load!) after several months
of trouble-free operation?  I mean, design errors would surely have
come out by now, and being relatively fresh off the proverbial factory
line, we are hopefully still a long way from any possible component
wear-out… I was intrigued. It was late in the day and it was already
dark (and I just lost the only power supply to my Superlamp), so I
called it a day.</p>

<p>And by the first rays of light of the next dawn, this is what I saw:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/linear-dual-lab-psu/pcb-fail1.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/linear-dual-lab-psu/pcb-fail1-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>PCB failure (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>Ouch, that PCB track in the middle got badly burned. So badly, in
fact, that a couple millimeters of the track simply disappeared (right
under the large C7 capacitor, left of the heatsinked Q9). Not for the
faint of heart!</p>

<p>Strange that the 2.5A primary side fuse (integrated into the AC inlet)
did not melt. And strangely, all the components seemed intact. I would
have expected a blown up capacitor or a shattered transistor or IC.
But nothing of that sort of catastrophe in sight – everything in
seemingly pristine condition. Except for the PCB itself.</p>

<p>Here is a better picture I took after disconnecting the wiring and
freeing the board for even closer inspection:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/linear-dual-lab-psu/pcb-fail2.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/linear-dual-lab-psu/pcb-fail2-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Same failure after disassembly, board plane view (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>So it looks like the VIN+ track (coming right from the unregulated
supply) got shorted to the ground plane, right below the ground
connection of C7. That track is 80&nbsp;mils (2&nbsp;mm) wide,
carefully sized to withstand 5A of steady current with only a
+20°C rise in temperature. So that alone cannot be the problem
– and again, there was zero load when this happened.</p>

<p>Apparently, the 8-mil (0.2&nbsp;mm) clearance between VIN+ and ground
was simply not enough to keep the 40-or-so volts apart. (It was not a
turn-on inrush event, as the instrument has been powered on for a
while.) Maybe the gap between the copper tracks was dirty (flux
remains?) which lead to increased conduction? Maybe the capacitor
being there had something to do with it? I did not really know.</p>

<p>Doing some further research I found
<a href="http://creepage.com/">creepage.com</a>, which contains an online
calculator of safety distances for <em>creepage</em>. This term refers to the
event of conduction across the surface of an insulator (such as the
gap across PCB tracks). The website allows you to get a safe distance
between conductors in the face of various voltages and environmental
conditions, according to several different industry standards.</p>

<p>So I played around with it and the result I got was (according to the
various environmental parameters, coating materials, and safety
standards I chose) somewhere between 1.0&nbsp;mm and 1.2&nbsp;mm. How
embarrassing! My PCB design is thus entirely worthless, because I did
not pay any attention to this – and the required distances are
<em>much</em> larger than I would have thought.  Another hard-earned lesson!</p>

<h2 id="mending-it">Mending it</h2>

<p>Okay, so can we salvage our wreck? After careful inspection and
ultimate removal of the charred remains of the track, I reached the
conclusion (supported by several measurements) that the rest of the
PCB survived intact, including all the components on it. The only
actual victim was the positive-side outboard pass transistor, which
did not show any external signs of damage, but DMM readouts were
contrary to what I would expect of an NPN power transistor that is
still kicking alive. So I swapped in a new part there. And I put in a
nice and thick insulated copper wire between the screw terminals of
VIN+ and the collector of Q5, the only connection that got severed by
the burn.</p>

<p>And after some further deliberation (what could possibly go wrong?) I
flipped the power on…</p>

<p><em>And it worked!</em> At least voltages seemed okay (without any load), the
readouts reacted to knob action, and no part started to burn.  All
good?</p>

<p>In a sigh of relief, I said to myself <em>I’m just gonna have to give this
baby a good workout!</em></p>



<p>While originally testing the PSU, I used some wire-wound power
inductors in the range of a few to a couple dozen Watts. Now I wanted
something bigger and badder: a test load that could steadily sink lots
of amperes (at a mostly-resistive impedance) without getting into any
trouble!</p>

<p>Enter the old classroom physics experiment I always wanted to try
myself:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water">electrolysis</a>.
That requires a hefty source of DC current, and this seemed like the
perfect occasion.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/linear-dual-lab-psu/cracker-parts.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/linear-dual-lab-psu/cracker-parts-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>All you need to build an electrolysis device (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>Above you can see all it takes to build an electrolysis tank on a
close to zero budget: a lunchbox (of the vertically aligned type), a
pair of PET bottles, a pair of stainless steel balloon whisks and
steel wool.</p>

<p>The design of my electrolysis tank was greatly inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d85OX6yEwE0">this
video</a>. I highly
recommend watching it all the way through – I found it to be an
excellent source of practical ideas and overall inspiration!</p>

<p>My lunchbox-tank has a well fitting top (with a small, sealable
opening useful for pouring stuff in, then closing it for safety).
Still, I opted for the milder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate">sodium
bicarbonate</a>
(<em>baking soda</em>) as the electrolyte instead of the more commonly used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a>
(<em>caustic soda</em>) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide">potassium
hydroxide</a>, as
those are dangerously strong bases. This means less conductivity
between the electrodes, but also the absence of hazardous material.
Note that the bottle caps are drilled through so the gases are let out
at the top. They never mix within the tank.</p>

<p>I poured exactly one liter of warm water into the tank and started to
record the current at every five volts, from 5V to 35V. After each
round, I increased the concentration by adding one scoop (5&nbsp;ml)
of baking soda to the tank. I read voltages and currents directly off
the PSU’s digital displays. Here is a plot of the results:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/files/linear-dual-lab-psu/crack-graph.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/files/linear-dual-lab-psu/crack-graph.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Download the <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/files/linear-dual-lab-psu/crack-data.csv">raw data</a> and
the <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/files/linear-dual-lab-psu/crack-graph.plt">gnuplot script</a> if
you wish.</p>

<p>In line with prior expectations, conductivity of the electrolytic
solution of sodium bicarbonate increases in proportion with the
concentration of charged particles (ions) in the water. At a given
concentration, the tank behaves pretty much as a resistor (with a
linear relationship between its DC voltage and current).</p>

<p>The very first measurement round was made with pure tap water (indexed
with the number 0, as there were zero scoops of baking soda in it).
There is <em>some</em> current flowing, but very little, equivalent to about
2&nbsp;kΩ of resistance. That resistance dropped to around
40Ω after the first scoop of soda, 14Ω after 5 scoops,
8Ω after 10 scoops and 6Ω after 15 scoops.</p>

<p>It also seems like there is a tapering effect: the additional
conductivity yielded by each new scoop of soda is diminishing. I don’t
know enough about the science of this to judge whether this effect is
real, but moving upwards, the space between adjacent curves seems to
be shrinking.  There is some irregularity to it (visible as a gap
between graphs 7 and 8, and a smaller one between 4 and 5), but I
think that might be due to me not mixing the contents of the tank well
enough to dissolve all newly added powder. This might also explain the
slight convexity seen in curves 1 and 2: I did not yet realize that I
have to mix the tank, so the soda dissolved gradually while I was
moving towards higher voltages.</p>

<p>I got a little impatient towards the end, so after the tenth scoop I
started adding more at once. First a double (reaching 12 scoops) and
then three more (for a total of 15). The bench supply did its part,
but it reached the limits of what the mains transformer could supply
– above 4 amps, the secondary voltage started to drop below 36V.
But the electronics took the beating and nothing melted or burned.</p>

<p>The intensity of bubbling in the tank increased in direct proportion
to the current (again, as expected). And the tank also got quite warm,
due to the substantial power dissipated in its volume of water.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/linear-dual-lab-psu/cracker-action.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/linear-dual-lab-psu/cracker-action-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>In action, with some 120 Watts absorbed by the tank (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So the clearances between some of the higher voltage tracks have
serious violations of the required distances to be safe from
creepage. As a result, one of the tracks has spontaneously
self-destructed, but there are a couple more places on the PCB where a
similar thing could happen basically any time. I am curious (in a less
than ideal way) of whether that would in fact happen…</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this is just another one of several design
flaws that would need to be addressed if I ever made a second build of
this kind of power supply. But for the time being, I will definitely
keep using this device. I have put it through some serious testing and
it passed with flying colours. We will see how it holds up, and (if it
should come to that) which part of the PCB will give in next!</p>

<p>Having tasted the sweet fruit of 8-mil tracks (and clearances)
bringing the ability to design fairly dense circuits, I need to
remember the lesson: there must be some real <em>distance</em> to insulate
voltages higher than a couple volts. As a reminder, there is this
ticking bomb sitting right here on my desk…</p>

<p>What? Did you say I should not be making gaseous hydrogen right next
to it? I mean, what could <em>possibly</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindenburg_disaster">go
wrong</a>?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For more than a decade now, the fact that people have a hard time gaining actionable insights from their data has been blamed on its size. “Your data is too big for your puny systems,” was the diagnosis, and the cure was to buy some new fancy technology that can handle massive scale. Of course, after the Big Data task force purchased all new tooling and migrated from Legacy systems, people found that they still were having trouble making sense of their data. They also may have noticed, if they were really paying attention, that data size wasn’t really the problem at all.</p>
<p>The world in 2023 looks different from when the Big Data alarm bells started going off. The data cataclysm that had been predicted hasn’t come to pass. Data sizes may have gotten marginally larger, but hardware has gotten bigger at an even faster rate. Vendors are still pushing their ability to scale, but practitioners are starting to wonder how any of that relates to their real world problems.</p>

But the important part is the shape, rather than the exact values.</p><p>The data behind the graphs come from having analyzed query logs, deal post-mortems, benchmark results (published and unpublished), customer support tickets, customer conversations, service logs, and published blog posts, plus a bit of intuition.</p></section>

When I moved to SingleStore, they were using their own version that had the same chart. I’ve seen several other vendors with something similar. This is the “scare” slide. Big Data is coming! You need to buy what I’m selling!</p><p>The message was that old ways of handling data were not going to work. The acceleration of data generation was going to leave the data systems of yesteryear stuck in the mud, and anyone who embraced new ideas would be able to leapfrog their competitors.</p><p>Of course, just because the amount of data being generated is increasing doesn’t mean that it becomes a problem for everyone; data is not distributed equally. Most applications do not need to process massive amounts of data. This has led to a resurgence in data management systems with traditional architectures; SQLite, Postgres, MySQL are all growing strongly, while “NoSQL” and even “NewSQL” systems are stagnating.</p><img alt="DB Engines scores over time MongoDB versus MySQL" sizes="90vw,

If Big Data were really taking over, you’d expect to see something different after all these years.</p><p>Of course, the picture looks different in analytical systems, but in OLAP you see a massive shift from on-premise to cloud, and there aren’t really any scale-up cloud analytical systems to compare against.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="most-people-dont-have-that-much-data">Most people don’t have that much data</h2><p>The intended takeaway from the “Big Data is coming” chart was that pretty soon, everyone will be inundated by their data. Ten years in, that future just hasn’t materialized. We can validate this several ways: looking at data (quantitatively), asking people if it is consistent with their experience (qualitatively), and thinking it through from first principles (inductively).</p><p>When I worked at BigQuery, I spent a lot of time looking at customer sizing. The actual data here is very sensitive, so I can’t share any numbers directly. However, I can say that the vast majority of customers had less than a terabyte of data in total data storage. There were, of course, customers with huge amounts of data, but most organizations, even some fairly large enterprises, had moderate data sizes.</p><p>Customer data sizes followed a power-law distribution. The largest customer had double the storage of the next largest customer, the next largest customer had half of that, etc. So while there were customers with hundreds of petabytes of data, the sizes trailed off very quickly.  There were many thousands of customers who paid less than $10 a month for storage, which is half a terabyte. Among customers who were using the service heavily, the median data storage size was much less than 100 GB.</p><img alt="Customer size of data as power law distribution" sizes="90vw,

We would extol our ability to handle massive data sets, and they would shrug. “This is nice,” they said, “but the vast majority of enterprises have data warehouses smaller than a terabyte.” The general feedback we got talking to folks in the industry was that 100 GB was the right order of magnitude for a data warehouse. This is where we focused a lot of our efforts in benchmarking.</p><p>One of our investors decided to find out how big analytical data sizes really are and surveyed his portfolio companies, some which were post-exit (either had IPO’d or been acquired by larger organizations). These are tech companies, which are likely going to skew towards larger data sizes. He found that the largest B2B companies in his portfolio had around a terabyte of data, while the largest B2C companies had around 10 Terabytes of data. Most, however, had far less data.</p><p>In order to understand why large data sizes are rare, it is helpful to think about where the data actually comes from. Imagine you’re a medium sized business, with a thousand customers. Let’s say each one of your customers places a new order every day with a hundred line items. This is relatively frequent, but it is still probably less than a megabyte of data generated per day. In three years you would still only have a gigabyte, and it would take millenia to generate a terabyte.</p><p>Alternately, let’s say you have a million leads in your marketing database, and you’re running dozens of campaigns. Your leads table is probably still less than a gigabyte, and tracking each lead across each campaign still probably is only a few gigabytes. It is hard to see how this adds to massive data sets under reasonable scaling assumptions.</p><p>To give a concrete example, I worked at SingleStore in 2020-2022, when it was a fast-growing Series E company with significant revenue and a unicorn valuation. If you added up the size of our finance data warehouse, our customer data, our marketing campaign tracking, and our service logs, it was probably only a few gigabytes. By any stretch of the imagination, this is not big data.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="the-storage-bias-in-separation-of-storage-and-compute">The storage bias in separation of storage and compute.</h2><p>Modern cloud data platforms all separate storage and compute, which means that customers are not tied to a single form factor. This, more than scale out, is likely the single most important change in data architectures in the last 20 years. Instead of “shared nothing” architectures which are hard to manage in real world conditions, shared disk architectures let you grow your storage and your compute independently. The rise of scalable and reasonably fast object storage like S3 and GCS meant that you could relax a lot of the constraints on how you built a database.</p><p>In practice, data sizes increase much faster than compute sizes. While popular descriptions of the benefits of storage and compute separation make it sound like you may choose to scale either one at any time, the two axes are not really equivalent. Misunderstanding of this point leads to a lot of the discussion of Big Data, because techniques for dealing with large compute requirements are different from dealing with large data. It is helpful to explore why this may be the case.</p><img alt="compute power increasing faster than data sizes" sizes="90vw,

Time is almost always an axis in a data set. New orders come in every day. New taxi rides. New logging records. New games being played. If a business is static, neither growing or shrinking, data will increase linearly with time. What does this mean for analytic needs? Clearly data storage needs will increase linearly, unless you decide to prune the data (more on this later). But compute needs will likely not need to change very much over time; most analysis is done over the recent data. Scanning old data is pretty wasteful; it doesn’t change, so why would you spend money reading it over and over again? True, you might want to keep it around just in case you want to ask a new question of the data, but it is pretty trivial to build aggregations containing the important answers.</p><p>Very often when a data warehousing customer moves from an environment where they didn’t have separation of storage and compute into one where they do have it, their storage usage grows tremendously, but their compute needs tend to not really change. In BigQuery, we had a customer who was one of the largest retailers in the world. They had an on-premise data warehouse that was around 100 TB of data. When they moved to the cloud, they ended up with 30 PB of data, a 300x increase. If their compute needs had also scaled up by a similar amount, they would have been spending billions of dollars on analytics. Instead, they spent a tiny fraction of that amount.</p><p>This bias towards storage size over compute size has a real impact in system architecture. It means that if you use scalable object stores, you might be able to use far less compute than you had anticipated. You might not even need to use distributed processing at all.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="workload-sizes-are-smaller-than-overall-data-sizes">Workload sizes are smaller than overall data sizes</h2><p>The amount of data processed for analytics workloads is almost certainly smaller than you think. Dashboards, for example, very often are built from aggregated data. People look at the last hour, or the last day, or the last week’s worth of data. Smaller tables tend to be queried more frequently, giant tables more selectively.</p><p>A couple of years ago I did an analysis of BigQuery queries, looking at customers spending more than $1000 / year. 90% of queries processed less than 100 MB of data. I sliced this a number of different ways to make sure it wasn’t just a couple of customers who ran a ton of queries skewing the results. I also cut out metadata-only queries, which are a small subset of queries in BigQuery that don’t need to read any data at all. You have to go pretty high on the percentile range until you get into the gigabytes, and there are very few queries that run in the terabyte range.</p><blockquote>
<p>Customers with giant data sizes almost never queried huge amounts of data</p>
</blockquote><p>Customers with moderate data sizes often did fairly large queries, but customers with giant data sizes almost never queried huge amounts of data. When they did, it was generally because they were generating a report, and performance wasn’t really a priority. A large social media company would run reports over the weekend to prepare for executives on Monday morning; those queries were pretty huge, but they were only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of queries they ran the rest of the week.</p><img alt="most query workloads are less than 10GB" sizes="90vw,

Modern analytical databases can do column projection to read only a subset of fields, and partition pruning to read only a narrow date range. They can often go even further with segment elimination to exploit locality in the data via clustering or automatic micro partitioning. Other tricks like computing over compressed data, projection, and predicate pushdown are ways that you can do less IO at query time. And less IO turns into less computation that needs to be done, which turns into lower costs and latency.</p><p>There are acute economic pressures incentivizing people to reduce the amount of data they process. Just because you can scale out and process something very fast doesn’t mean you can do so inexpensively. If you use a thousand nodes to get a result, that is probably going to cost you an arm and a leg. The Petabyte query I used to run on stage to show off BigQuery cost $5,000 at retail prices. Very few people would want to run something so expensive.</p><p>Note that the financial incentive to processing less data holds true even if you’re not using a pay-per-byte-scanned pricing model. If you have a Snowflake instance, if you can make your queries smaller, you can use a smaller instance, and pay less. Your queries will be faster, you can run more concurrently, and you generally will pay less over time.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="most-data-is-rarely-queried">Most data is rarely queried</h2><p>A huge percentage of the data that gets processed is less than 24 hours old. By the time data gets to be a week old, it is probably 20 times less likely to be queried than from the most recent day. After a month, data mostly just sits there. Historical data tends to be queries infrequently, perhaps when someone is running a rare report.</p><img alt="as data gets older, it's processed much less" sizes="90vw,

While a lot of data gets discarded pretty quickly, a lot of data just gets appended to the end of tables. The most recent year might only have 30% of the data but 99% of data accesses. The most recent month might have 5% of data but 80% of data accesses.</p><p>The quiescing of data means that data working set sizes are more manageable than you would expect. If you have a petabyte table that has 10 years worth of data, you might rarely access any of the data older than the current day, which might have less than 50 GB compressed.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="the-big-data-frontier-keeps-receding">The Big Data Frontier keeps receding</h2><p>One definition of “Big Data” is “whatever doesn’t fit on a single machine.. By that definition, the number of workloads that qualify has been decreasing every year.</p><p>In 2004, when the Google MapReduce paper was written, it would have been very common for a data workload to not fit on a single commodity machine. Scaling up was expensive. In 2006, AWS launched EC2, and the only size of instance you could get was a single core and 2 GB of RAM. There were a lot of workloads that wouldn’t fit on that machine.</p><p>Today, however, a standard instance on AWS uses a physical server with 64 cores and 256 GB of RAM.  That’s two orders of magnitude more RAM. If you’re willing to spend a little bit more for a memory-optimized instance, you can get another two orders of magnitude of RAM. How many workloads need more than 24TB of RAM or 445 CPU cores?</p><img alt="single machines are capable of processing a much greater percentage of workloads as time goes on and technology advances" sizes="90vw,

However, in the cloud, a VM that uses a whole server only costs 8x more than one that uses an 8th of a server. Cost scales up linearly with compute power, up through some very large sizes. In fact, if you look at the benchmarks published in the original dremel paper using 3,000 parallel nodes, you can get similar performance on a single node today (more on this to come).</p></section>
<section><h2 id="data-is-a-liability">Data is a Liability</h2><p>An alternate definition of Big Data is “when the cost of keeping data around is less than the cost of figuring out what to throw away.” I like this definition because it encapsulates why people end up with Big Data. It isn’t because they need it; they just haven’t bothered to delete it. If you think about many data lakes that organizations collect, they fit this bill entirely: giant, messy swamps where no one really knows what they hold or whether it is safe to clean them up.</p><p>The cost of keeping data around is higher than just the cost to store the physical bytes. Under regulations like GDPR and CCPA, you are required to track all usage of certain types of data. Some data needs to be deleted within a certain period of time. If you have phone numbers in a parquet file that sit around for too long in your data lake somewhere, you may be violating statutory requirements.</p><p>Beyond regulation, data can be an aid to lawsuits against you. Just as many organizations enforce limited email retention policies in order to reduce potential liability, the data in your data warehouse can likewise be used against you. If you’ve got logs from five years ago that would show a security bug in your code or missed SLA, keeping old data around can prolong your legal exposure. There is a possibly apocryphal story I’ve heard about a company keeping its data analytics capabilities secret in order to prevent them from being used during a legal discovery process.</p><p>Code often suffers from what people call “bit rot” when it isn’t actively maintained. Data can suffer from the same type of problem; that is, people forget the precise meaning of specialized fields, or data problems from the past may have faded from memory. For example, maybe there was a short-lived data bug that set every customer id to null. Or there was a huge fraudulent transaction that made it look like Q3 2017 was a lot better than it actually was. Often business logic to pull out data from a historical time period can get more and more complicated. For example, there might be a rule like, “ if the date is older than 2019 use the revenue field, between 2019 and 2021 use the revenue_usd field, and after 2022 use the revenue_usd_audited field.” The longer you keep data around, the harder it is to keep track of these special cases. And not all of them can be easily worked around, especially if there is missing data.</p><p>If you are keeping around old data, it is good to understand why you are keeping it. Are you asking the same questions over and over again? If that is the case, wouldn’t it be far less expensive in terms of storage and query costs to just store aggregates? Are you keeping it for a rainy day? Are you thinking that there are new questions you might want to ask? If so, how important is it? How likely is it that you’ll really need it? Are you really just a data hoarder? These are all important questions to ask, especially as you try to figure out the true cost of keeping the data.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="are-you-in-the-big-data-one-percent">Are you in the BIg Data One Percent?</h2><p>Big Data is real, but most people may not need to worry about it. Some questions that you can ask to figure out if you’re a “Big Data One-Percenter”:</p><ul>
<li>Are you really generating a huge amount of data?</li>
<li>If so, do you really need to use a huge amount of data at once?</li>
<li>If so, is the data really too big to fit on one machine?</li>
<li>If so, are you sure you’re not just a data hoarder?</li>
<li>If so, are you sure you wouldn’t be better off summarizing?</li>
</ul><p>If you answer no to any of these questions, you might be a good candidate for a new generation of data tools that help you handle data at the size you actually have, not the size that people try to scare you into thinking that you might have someday.</p></section></div></div>]]></description>

<p>About 9.2 billion light-years from Earth is a colossal structure which has confounded astronomers.</p>



<p>The discovery might upend current cosmological theories.</p>



<p>What they’ve found is a 1.3-billion-light-year-across, almost perfect ring of galaxies. No such structure has been seen before. And it doesn’t match any known formation mechanism. It has been dubbed the “Big Ring.”</p>



<p>The discovery was presented at the <a href="https://submissions.mirasmart.com/AAS243/Itinerary/EventsAAG.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">243rd meeting</a> of the American Astronomical Society and is detailed in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07591" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-print paper available on arXiv</a>.</p>



<p>It is the second giant structure found by teams led by Alexia Lopez, an astronomer at the University of Central Lancashire in the UK. The first, a giant arc of galaxies, was <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/516/2/1557/6657809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> in 2022. That structure is 3.3 billion light-years across and appears in the same region of sky at the same distance from Earth as the Big Ring.</p>



<p>“Neither of these two ultra-large structures is easy to explain in our current understanding of the universe,” Lopez says. “And their ultra-large sizes, distinctive shapes, and cosmological proximity must surely be telling us something important – but what exactly?”</p>



        

<p>A possible explanation for the Big Ring, according to Lopez, is “Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations” (BAOs).</p>

</a></p><p>“BAOs arise from oscillations in the early universe and today should appear, statistically at least, as spherical shells in the arrangement of galaxies. However, detailed analysis of the Big Ring revealed it is not really compatible with the BAO explanation: the Big Ring is too large and is not spherical.”</p>



<p>Another possibility is the structures are remnants of “defects” in the early universe called cosmic strings.</p>



<p>The structures challenge the so-called “Cosmological Principle.”</p>



<p>“The Cosmological Principle assumes that the part of the universe we can see is viewed as a ‘fair sample’ of what we expect the rest of the universe to be like,” Lopez explains. “We expect matter to be evenly distributed everywhere in space when we view the universe on a large scale, so there should be no noticeable irregularities above a certain size.”</p>



<p>“Cosmologists calculate the current theoretical size limit of structures to be 1.2 billion light-years, yet both of these structures are much larger,” Lopez adds.</p>



<p>“From current cosmological theories we didn’t think structures on this scale were possible. We could expect maybe one exceedingly large structure in all our observable universe. Yet, the Big Ring and the Giant Arc are two huge structures and are even cosmological neighbours, which is extraordinarily fascinating,” Lopez says.</p>

ISOC’s post states this ruling “… strongly implies the FCC’s intention to regulate (BGP) routing security.”</p>



<p>The post casts this as an area of concern, with ISOC and the Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) recommending against regulating BGP security. This is for three stated reasons: </p>



<ol>
<li>The effect regulation often has of slowing progress as the industry reviews its obligations and legal implications</li>



<li>Competitive tension that can arise from regulated behaviour.</li>



<li>Concerns of fragmentation as other economies rush to reflect this decision but implement different strategies.</li>
</ol>



<p>While these risks are real, they are unlikely to prevent the FCC from acting.</p>



<p>Firstly, telecommunications has always been regulated. In recent decades regulators may have tended toward a soft-touch approach. Still, carriers have both protections (in the form of common-carrier defences against the conduct of messages over their systems) and obligations (such as the need to provide lawful interception services under judicial process).</p>



<p>Secondly, the risks to the integrity of the function of the Internet are real. These threats stem from malicious criminal entities, adversarial states, and even from within the economy. They disrupt vital functions of the Internet, which are crucial for basic communications, emergency services, and state operations like power and water delivery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the Internet’s central role in modern society, it’s reasonable to expect actors responsible for configuring BGP to adhere to basic standards of hygiene and documentation for their resources, ensuring their trustworthiness.</p>



<p>Currently, in economies like New Zealand, ISPs are required to report significant routing state changes to authorities or to account for loss of service under cyber threats (such as in Australia where Internet entities can be declared national strategic resources with reporting obligations).</p>



<p>The ISOC / GCA stance is not particularly surprising because few industry organizations in the Internet governance sphere typically advocate for or support increased regulation — industry self-regulation tends to be the default position. However, when it comes to BGP security and the potential risks posed to the state, the light-touch approach may reach the limits of risk that a government is prepared to accept without intervention.</p>



<p>Have a read of the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401676A1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FCC report</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2024/04/the-us-fcc-signals-a-dangerous-new-course-on-bgp-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ISOC / GCA response</a>, and let me know what you think!</p>



<p>The FCC later released a fact sheet “<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402609A1.pdf">Reporting on Border Gateway Protocol Risk Mitigation Progress</a>” with specific ideas for action that will place obligations on the US ISP / BGP community.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><time datetime="2024-05-22">May 22, 2024</time></section><h2>PCTattletale leaks victims' screen recordings to entire Internet</h2><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p><a href="https://www.pctattletale.com/">PCTattletale</a> is a simple stalkerware app. Rather than the sophisticated monitoring of many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/new-thetruthspy-stalkerware-victims-is-your-android-device-compromised/">similarly insecure</a> competitors it simply asks for permission to record the targeted device (Android and Windows are supported) on infection. Afterward the observer can log in to an online portal and activate recording, at which point a screen capture is taken on the device and played on the target's browser.</p><p>I recently discovered a serious vulnerability in PCTattletale's API allowing any attacker to obtain the most recent screen capture recorded from any device on which PCTattletale is installed. It is distinct from the IDOR <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezj8/stalkerware-leaking-phone-screenshots-pctattletale">previously discovered by Jo Coscia</a>, and makes it trivial to actually obtain captures from other devices. As usual, Zack Whittaker has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/22/spyware-found-on-hotel-check-in-computers/">excellent coverage</a> at TechCrunch. Unfortunately, PCTattletale have ignored Zack and I's attempts at contacting them to fix the issue, <del>so I can't give any more details here to avoid encouraging abuse of the vulnerability. Hopefully the stalkerware author(s) can be bothered to fix the issue soon, at which point I can give a full writeup. In the meantime,</del> if you think you may be a victim of stalkerware, run an antivirus scan — on Windows, Windows Defender seems to catch most known tools, on Android I've heard good things about <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/stalkerware">Malwarebytes</a> — and have a look at the excellent advice from the <a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/information-for-survivors/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>.</p><h3 id="update-2024-05-26">UPDATE 2024-05-26</h3><p>Well, it's been an eventful few days. Check out <a href="https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/fuckstalkerware-6/">maia arson crimew's blog</a> for details. Given that PCTattletale's entire AWS infrastructure has now been <a href="https://ericdaigle.ca/docs/pctt-amazon-locked.png">locked by Amazon</a>, I can now give my original writeup.</p><h2 id="part-0-setup">Part 0: setup</h2><p>I began by making an account on the website.

When we click on one, we see a "screen capture": it actually turns out to be a series of screenshots displayed quickly in a slideshow, creating a sort of stop-motion video. Since I'm using the free trial, I can only see the first few seconds. These screenshots seem like something IDOR-able, so let's take a look at the requests.</p><p>Playing the video, we can see the screenshots being retrieved in the following request-responses:</p><pre><code><span>METHOD: GET

</span><span>*the screenshot of my device*
</span></code></pre><p>Looking at the URL, it's in the format (id of the device I added)/(date)/(timestamp).jpg. There's no authentication happening at all here, so this is an IDOR over different device IDs! I later learned this had been independently discovered by Jo Coscia as mentioned above.</p><p>Another interesting note looking at the screenshots is that they aren't taken every second. They are spaced out in seemingly random intervals, mostly concentrated between 1 and 10 seconds. This explains why the "video" in the browser is so choppy.</p><h2 id="part-2-finding-the-latest-screenshot">Part 2: finding the latest screenshot</h2><p>If we know the address of one screenshot for a device, we can reasonably poke around neighbouring timestamps to find the rest of the capture. Unfortunately there are 86400 timestamps per day, so enumerating this across all days and all devices would take forever.</p><p>When we load the devices overview, the thumbnail we're shown is of that device's <em>latest</em> screenshot. I wonder how that's being accessed? Let's reload the page and look at the requests again.</p><p>We find this:</p><pre><code><span>METHOD: POST

</span></code></pre><p>So that's how it gets the most recent screenshot. If we could get this for a device, we could easily get the rest of the capture! Unfortunately it seems to be protected in two ways: the URL contains the API Key (an unguessable UUID), and there's a token.</p><h2 id="part-3-client-side-token-generation">Part 3: client-side token generation</h2><p>While looking for the last request, I noticed a bunch of JavaScript being pulled in from pctattletale.com. Most names seemed pretty innocuous, but on seeing "member.area.dashboard.js" I decided to take a look and see if I could find where that token was coming from. Incredibly, I found the following code for the request to update a device's status:</p><pre data-lang="javascript"><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function </span><span>updateDevice</span><span>(</span><span>device</span><span>, </span><span>index</span><span>) {

</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>//  Call Login WebService
</span><span>  </span><span>$</span><span>.</span><span>ajax</span><span>({
</span><span>      method: "</span><span>POST</span><span>",
</span><span>      crossDomain: </span><span>true</span><span>,
</span><span>      contentType: "</span><span>application/json</span><span>",
</span><span>      dataType: "</span><span>json</span><span>",
</span><span>      url: </span><span>AWS_BASE_URL_LIVE </span><span>+ "</span><span>api/pctt/member/</span><span>" + </span><span>API_KEY </span><span>+ "</span><span>/</span><span>" + </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>DeviceID </span><span>+ "</span><span>/Live/</span><span>",
</span><span>      data: JSON.</span><span>stringify</span><span>({
</span><span>        Token: </span><span>deviceToken
</span><span>      })
</span><span>
</span><span>    })
</span><span>    .</span><span>success</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>) {

</span><span>
</span><span>    [...]
</span><span>
</span><span>    });
</span></code></pre><p>So the token is generated on the client-side, and is just MD5 of the device ID from the URL appended to the API key from account creation. Knowing this it is trivial to generate my own token and confirm that it matches the one being used in the requests. But I still can't get other devices' last screenshots because the URL and token both have the wrong API key, right?</p><h2 id="part-4-clearly-i-have-too-much-faith">Part 4: clearly I have too much faith</h2><p>Let's give it a try. I make a token using my API key and the device ID one less than mine, and resend the above request with the corresponding url:</p><pre><code><span>METHOD: POST
</span><span>URL: https://5uw7yeva9g.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/pctt/member/ffe3fc02-46d2-4275-a156-e65f2ae2ddad/62197/Live/

</span></code></pre><p>This happily gives me the lastScreenshot response for device ID 62197, which I do not own. It will do so for any device ID regardless of the UUID used in the URL and token.</p><h2 id="part-5-putting-together-an-exploit-script">Part 5: putting together an exploit script</h2><p>Now that we can access any screenshot from any device and know the address of the last screenshot of the most recent recording, it's pretty easy to put together a script to leak the entirety of that recording. There's a minor annoyance in how the screenshots are taken at an irregular interval: we can't just subtract a certain amount of seconds. Instead we'll use a heuristic: we'll start with the last screenshot and subtract one second at a time, downloading from each and seeing if we get a valid photo or the error XML that comes up if no screenshot was taken at that second. If we get the error XML 20 times in a row, we'll assume the recording is over and give up.</p><p>Together with the login and token code, this yields a <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/blob/740b840d0e1d9cf3cf11075e6e78ddde4f812c0c">simple exploit script</a> That downloads the most recent screen capture from every device within the chosen range of IDs.</p><h2 id="part-6-aftermath">Part 6: aftermath</h2><p>As described in better detail in maia's blog linked above, someone took my original post as inspiration and was able to recover PCTattletale's entire database, among other things.
