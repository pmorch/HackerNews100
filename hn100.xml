<p>Google has fired 28 employees over their participation in a 10-hour sit-in <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/16/business/google-staffers-storm-nyc-california-seattle-offices-to-protest-israel-ties/">at the search giant’s offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California</a>, to protest the company’s business ties with the Israel government, The Post has learned.</p>



<p>The pro-Palestinian staffers — who had donned traditional Arab headscarves as they stormed and occupied the office of a top executive in California on Tuesday — were terminated late Wednesday after an internal investigation, Google vice president of global security Chris Rackow said in a companywide memo.</p>



<p>“They took over office spaces, defaced our property, and physically impeded the work of other Googlers,” Rackow wrote in the memo obtained by The Post. “Their behavior was unacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made co-workers feel threatened.”</p>



<p>In New York, protesters had occupied the 10th floor of Google’s offices in the Chelsea section of Manhattan as part of a protest that also extended to the company’s offices in Seattle for what it called&nbsp;<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/05/business/google-engineer-accuses-company-exec-of-powering-genocide-over-israel-ties/">“No Tech for Genocide Day of Action.”</a></p>

<p>“Behavior like this has no place in our workplace and we will not tolerate it,” Rackow wrote. “It clearly violates multiple policies that all employees must adhere to – including our&nbsp;code of conduct&nbsp;and&nbsp;policy on harassment, discrimination, retaliation, standards of conduct, and workplace concerns.”</p>



<p>Rackow added that the company “takes this extremely seriously, and we will continue to apply our longstanding policies to take action against disruptive behavior – up to and including termination.”</p>


		
		


<p>The fired staffers are affiliated with a group called No Tech For Apartheid, which has been critical of Google’s response to the Israel-Hamas war. </p>



<p>The group had posted several videos and livestreams of the protests on its X account — including the exact moment that employees were issued final warnings and arrested by local police for trespassing.</p>



<p>The protesters have demanded that Google pull out of a $1.2 billion “Project Nimbus” contract — in which Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services provide cloud-computing and artificial intelligence services for the Israeli government and military.</p>

<p>Critics at the company raised concerns that the technology would be weaponized against Palestinians in Gaza.</p>



<p>The impacted workers blasted Google over the firings in a statement shared by No Tech For Apartheid spokesperson Jane Chung.</p>



<p>“This evening, Google indiscriminately fired 28 workers, including those among us who did not directly participate in yesterday’s historic, bicoastal 10-hour sit-in protests,” the workers said in the statement.</p>



<p>“This flagrant act of retaliation is a clear indication that Google values its $1.2 billion contract with the genocidal Israeli government and military more than its own workers — the ones who create real value for executives and shareholders.”</p>

<p>“Sundar Pichai and Thomas Kurian are genocide profiteers,” the statement added, referring to Google’s CEO and the CEO of its cloud unit, respectively. </p>



<p>“We cannot comprehend how these men are able to sleep at night while their tech has enabled 100,000 Palestinians killed, reported missing, or wounded in the last six months of Israel’s genocide — and counting.”</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesperson said the Tuesday protest “involved approximately 50 participants” in total and confirmed “four arrests were made for trespassing inside the Google building.”</p>



<p>The Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety said the protest in California “consisted of around 80 participants.”&nbsp;A total of five protesters who refused to leave the Google office were “arrested without incident for criminal trespassing,” booked and released, a spokesperson added.</p>



<p>It couldn’t immediately be learned if all nine arrested employees were among those who were fired. Google had earlier placed the employees on administrative leave and cut their access to internal systems.</p>

<p>“A small number of employee protesters entered and disrupted a few of our locations. Physically impeding other employees’ work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior.”</p>



<p>“We have so far concluded individual investigations that resulted in the termination of employment for 28 employees, and will continue to investigate and take action as needed,” the spokesperson added.</p>



<p>The demonstrators stormed the personal office of Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian in Sunnyvale.</p>



<p>Kurian’s custom-made, framed Golden State Warriors jersey was visible on the office wall in the background of the livestream, and employees wrote a list of their demands on his white board.</p>

<p>The companywide memo can be read in its entirety below.</p>



<p><em>Googlers,</em></p>



<p><em>You may have seen reports of protests at some of our offices yesterday. Unfortunately, a number of employees brought the event into our buildings in New York and Sunnyvale. They took over office spaces, defaced our property, and physically impeded the work of other Googlers. Their behavior was unacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made co-workers feel threatened. We placed employees involved under investigation and cut their access to our systems. Those who refused to leave were arrested by law enforcement and removed from our offices.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Following investigation, today we terminated the employment of twenty-eight employees found to be involved.&nbsp;We will continue to investigate and take action as needed.</em></p>



<p><em>Behavior like this has no place in our workplace and we will not tolerate it. It clearly violates multiple policies that all employees must adhere to – including our&nbsp;Code of Conduct&nbsp;and&nbsp;Policy on Harassment, Discrimination, Retaliation, Standards of Conduct, and Workplace Concerns.</em></p>







<p><em>We are a place of business and every Googler is expected to read our policies and apply them to how they conduct themselves and communicate in our workplace. The overwhelming majority of our employees do the right thing. If you’re one of the few who are tempted to think we’re going to overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again. The company takes this extremely seriously, and we will continue to apply our longstanding policies to take action against disruptive behavior – up to and including termination.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>You should expect to hear more from leaders about standards of behavior and discourse in the workplace.</em></p>



<p><em>Chris</em></p>

                    For the first time, scientists have managed to create sheets of gold only a single atom layer thick. The material has been termed goldene. According to researchers from Linköping University, Sweden, this has given the gold new properties that can make it suitable for use in applications such as carbon dioxide conversion, hydrogen production, and production of value-added chemicals.

                        <p>Scientists have long tried to make single-atom-thick sheets of gold but failed because the metal’s tendency to lump together. But researchers from Linköping University have now succeeded thanks to a hundred-year-old method used by Japanese smiths.</p>
<p>“If you make a material extremely thin, something extraordinary happens – as with graphene. The same thing happens with gold. As you know, gold is usually a metal, but if single-atom-layer thick, the gold can become a semiconductor instead,” says Shun Kashiwaya, researcher at the Materials Design Division at Linköping University.</p>
<h2>3D base material</h2>
<p>To create goldene, the researchers used a three-dimensional base material where gold is embedded between layers of titanium and carbon. But coming up with goldene proved to be a challenge. According to Lars Hultman, professor of thin film physics at Linköping University, part of the progress is due to serendipidy.</p>
<figure><img src="https://liu.se/dfsmedia/dd35e243dfb7406993c1815aaf88a675/83341-50063/lars-hultman-20240223-16" alt="Researcher holds small disc with tweezers close to face."><figcaption><span>Lars Hultman, professor of thin film physics at the Department of physics, chemistry and biology (IFM).</span><span aria-label="Photo credit">Olov Planthaber</span> </figcaption></figure>
<p>“We had created the base material with completely different applications in mind. We started with an electrically conductive ceramics called titanium silicon carbide, where silicon is in thin layers. Then the idea was to coat the material with gold to make a contact. But when we exposed the component to high temperature, the silicon layer was replaced by gold inside the base material,” says Lars Hultman.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is called intercalation and what the researchers had discovered was titanium gold carbide. For several years, the researchers have had titanium gold carbide without knowing how the gold can be exfoliated or panned out, so to speak.</p>
<h2>Japanese forging art</h2>
<p>By chance, Lars Hultman found a method that has been used in Japanese forging art for over a hundred years. It is called Murakami’s reagent, which etches away carbon residue and changes the colour of steel in knife making, for example. But it was not possible to use the exact same recipe as the smiths did. Shun Kashiwaya had to look at modifications:</p>
<figure><img src="https://liu.se/dfsmedia/dd35e243dfb7406993c1815aaf88a675/83345-50063/shun-kashiwaya-20240223-9" alt="Researcher in lab."><figcaption><span>Shun Kashiwaya, researcher at IFM.</span><span aria-label="Photo credit">Olov Planthaber</span> </figcaption></figure>
<p>“I tried different concentrations of Murakami’s reagent and different time spans for etching. One day, one week, one month, several months. What we noticed was that the lower the concentration and the longer the etching process, the better. But it still wasn’t enough,” he says.</p>
<p>The etching must also be carried out in the dark as cyanide develops in the reaction when it is struck by light, and it dissolves gold. The last step was to get the gold sheets stable. To prevent the exposed two-dimensional sheets from curling up, a surfactant was added. In this case, a long molecule that separates and stabilises the sheets, i.e. a tenside.</p>
<p>“The goldene sheets are in a solution, a bit like cornflakes in milk. Using a type of “sieve”, we can collect the gold and examine it using an electron microscope to confirm that we have succeeded. Which we have,” says Shun Kashiwaya.</p>
<h2>Many possible applications</h2>
<p>The new properties of goldene are due to the fact that the gold has two free bonds when two-dimensional. Thanks to this, future applications could include carbon dioxide conversion, hydrogen-generating catalysis, selective production of value-added chemicals, hydrogen production, water purification, communication, and much more.</p>

</p><p>The next step for the LiU researchers is to investigate whether it is possible to do the same with other noble metals and identify additional future applications.</p>
<p>The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Government Strategic Research Area in Materials Science (AFM) at Linköping University, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Åforsk Foundation, the Olle Enqvist Foundation, the Carl Trygger Foundation, the Göran Gustafsson Foundations, MIRAI 2.0, the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC), and the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS).</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>World's smallest "to scale" Wii console</li>
<li>Powered by USB-C</li>
<li>HDMI for lossless digital audio and video (powered by <a href="https://github.com/ikorb/gcvideo">GCVideo</a>)</li>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Size &amp; Scale</h2><a id="user-content-size--scale" aria-label="Permalink: Size &amp; Scale" href="#size--scale"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a <strong>1:2.38 scale</strong> model of an original Nintendo Wii console, but since that is hard to visualize here are some other stats:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Same size as a typical deck of playing cards</li>
<li><strong>7.4% the volume</strong> of an original Wii console</li>
<li>You could fit <strong>13.5</strong> of these inside an original Wii</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">I'm pretty sure this sets the record for the smallest functional scale-model Wii console, but let me know if I'm wrong!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Could we go smaller?</h3><a id="user-content-could-we-go-smaller" aria-label="Permalink: Could we go smaller?" href="#could-we-go-smaller"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Yes! It is definitely possible to go smaller than this. My <a href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/blob/main/images/trim.png">version of the Omega trim</a> keeps all four main mounting holes, which makes it around 7mm wider than a classic Omega trim. Additionally <a href="https://twitter.com/Weskmods" rel="nofollow">Wesk</a> has managed to get a Wii motherboard down to 52x52mm on his final destination trim, which is a a full 10mm narrower than my trim. I estimate you could reduce the volume by a further 25-30% without losing any functionality, but it would be an incredibly tight fit and tricky to assemble.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Components</h2><a id="user-content-components" aria-label="Permalink: Components" href="#components"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As the name implies, <em>Short Stack</em> is built from a stack of custom PCBs, and a custom heatsink, that are all designed to fit together in a compact and modular way.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">A modular motherboard</h3><a id="user-content-a-modular-motherboard" aria-label="Permalink: A modular motherboard" href="#a-modular-motherboard"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Making a tiny build like this is made possible by trimming the Wii motherboard down to the bare essentials. The result is a board which is just <em>62x62mm</em>, but still contains the CPU, GPU, RAM and flash memory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/blob/main/images/motherboard-front.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/raw/main/images/motherboard-front.jpg" width="45%"></a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/blob/main/images/motherboard-back.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/raw/main/images/motherboard-back.jpg" width="45%"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since we removed the original power circuitry and trimmed off the USB, Bluetooth, and GameCube connectors, we need to provide power and data to the board another way. I designed a couple of boards which solder directly to the front of a trimmed Wii motherboard to provide power and data, which help avoid a tangled mess of wires.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/loopj/wii-power-strip">Wii Power Strip</a> supplies power to the Wii motherboards using a Molex Pico-Lock connector, and additionally has footprints to help relocate of a couple of capacitors which are typically removed when trimming a Wii.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/loopj/periphlex">Periphlex</a> is a flex PCB which breaks out the Bluetooth, USB and GameCube controller data lines, as well as the power, shutdown, and reset GPIOs. These are then made available via a 14-pin FFC connector. This approach replaces 11 magnet wires with a single, removable ribbon cable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/blob/main/images/periphlex-render.png"><img src="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/raw/main/images/periphlex-render.png" alt="Periphlex"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">On the back of the motherboard, I'm using two open-source boards designed by the very talented <a href="https://github.com/mackieks">YveltalGriffin</a>. <a href="https://github.com/mackieks/fujiflex">fujiflex</a> provides digital A/V output using GCVideo, and <a href="https://github.com/mackieks/nandFlex">nandFlex</a> relocates the Wii's NAND memory chip, to enable the tight trim.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Custom PCBs</h3><a id="user-content-custom-pcbs" aria-label="Permalink: Custom PCBs" href="#custom-pcbs"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In addition to the modular boards on the motherboard, I designed two PCBs specific to Short Stack which provide the rest of the functionality for the console.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>main board</em> PCB hosts the power regulators, USB to microSD logic, HDMI connector, GameCube ports, and a microcontroller for power management. A 14-pin ribbon cable connects this board to the Wii motherboard via <em>Periphlex</em>, and a power cable delivers power to the <em>Power Strip</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/blob/main/images/main-board.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/raw/main/images/main-board.jpg" alt="Main Board"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>front panel</em> PCB hosts the power, reset, and sync buttons, as well as the power LED and disc slot LEDs. This board connects to the main board via a short 8-pin ribbon cable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/blob/main/images/front-panel.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/raw/main/images/front-panel.jpg" alt="Front Panel Board"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Cooling</h3><a id="user-content-cooling" aria-label="Permalink: Cooling" href="#cooling"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The final part of the "stack" is a custom heatsink which is designed to be as low profile as possible, while still providing adequate cooling for the Wii's CPU and GPU. The heatsink is designed to be machined from aluminum or copper, and incorporates mounting holes which align with those on the Wii motherboard.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/blob/main/images/heatsink.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/raw/main/images/heatsink.jpg" alt="Heatsink"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I managed to find a tiny 5V blower fan (<a href="https://catalog.pelonistechnologies.com/item/air-g-series-micro-fans-and-micro-blowers/micro-fans-and-micro-blowers/agb208n" rel="nofollow">Pelonis AGB208N</a>) which measures just 20x20x8mm and somehow puts out 0.84 CFM of air. This blows air through the heasink fins, out the side of the case.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Case</h3><a id="user-content-case" aria-label="Permalink: Case" href="#case"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The stack is housed in a custom 3D printed case, secured with four M2.5 screws and spacers. The rest of case is assembled using self-tapping M1.2 screws. The screw locations and fan vents are positioned to match the original Wii case as closely as possible, to minimize visible screws.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can access files on the SD card by connecting the console to a computer via USB, but I also included an access panel on the front of the case where the original Wii SD card slot is found. This panel is held in place by magnets and can be removed to access the SD card without opening the case. Shout out to Wesk for the magnet idea!</p>
<p dir="auto">To keep the clean aesthetic of the original Wii I wanted to hide the GameCube controller ports behind a panel. I always hated the hinged design of the original, and it is quite difficult to replicate at this scale, so I redesigned this panel to be a sliding panel.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/blob/main/images/gamecube-ports.png"><img src="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/raw/main/images/gamecube-ports.png" alt="GameCube Ports"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Wii's iconic disc slot lights are recreated using a 1.5mm thick custom cut acrylic light diffuser, which is illuminated by two side-mounted addressable LEDs on the front panel board. The power, reset, and sync buttons are all also 3D printed, and the power button hosts a tiny light pipe to allow the power LED to shine through.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/blob/main/images/front-assembly.png"><img src="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack/raw/main/images/front-assembly.png" alt="Front assembly"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I FDM printed the case on a Voron 2.4 in ABS using a 0.4mm nozzle at 0.1mm layer height, but it should print fine in PLA or PETG on a well-tuned printer. At this scale, dimensional accuracy is important. In theory it should be possible to print this on an SLA printer, but I haven't tried it.</p>

<p>Flying aircraft carriers show up in steampunk, dieselpunk and atompunk fiction so often, we can consider them a genre trope. From <em>Castle Wulfenbach</em> in <em>Girl Genius</em> to the British aircraft carriers in <em>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</em> to the helicarriers of S.H.I.E.L.D., here is a look at these behemoths of the sky.</p>



<p>Flying aircraft carriers have a basis in reality. A few World War I-era British airships carried biplanes that could defend the mothership from attack. The United States Navy experimented with a similar “parasite aircraft” program in the 1930s.</p>

<p>So did the Soviet Union. The Zveno project put small fighter planes on the wings of Tupolev TB-1 and TB-3 bombers. This configuration was used in Romania in the early days of World War II.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral William W. Moffett of the United States Navy had written for <em>Popular Science</em> in 1923 that airships carrying airplanes, like “lifeboats on ocean-going vessels,” weren’t far away.</p>



<p>He pointed out that airplanes had already been carried, launched and picked up by airships.</p>



<blockquote><p>The future airship, developed for naval use, will carry a sting that will make it one of the most formidable contenders for supremacy of the air, sea and earth that has ever been conceived.</p></blockquote>



<p>Moffett predicted that airships would carry a dozen planes to protect it against attack, “and in addition will mount a battery of guns that will command the respect of any enemy marauder.”</p>

<p>He didn’t see much difficulty for planes taking off:</p>



<blockquote><p>The launching of them is merely a matter of pushing the planes off into space, where they can recover themselves with the ease of a bird thrown into the air.</p></blockquote>



<p>The United States Navy in fact built two such airships, <em>Akron</em> and <em>Macon</em>, launched in 1931 and 1933, respectively. They were the largest helium-filled airships ever built. (The hydrogen-filled <em>Graf Zeppelin II</em> and <em>Hindenburg</em> were 5 meters taller and slightly more voluminous.) Both the American airships were lost in bad weather.</p>

<p>Another proposal, as reported in <em>Modern Mechanix</em> in October 1934, was to use a landing strip that could double as solar panel:</p>



<blockquote><p>The ordinary cigar-shaped dirigible would in effect have a slice taken from the upper half of her gas bag. This would provide a large deck on which could be mounted solar photo cells, an airplane runway and a hangar. Planes could land on the dirigible, floating over the sea, to refuel for transocean passenger service.</p></blockquote>



<p>Goodyear advertised a “flying carrier for warplanes” in the May 1942 edition of <em>Popular Mechanics</em> that it said could cruise at a speed of 50 nautical miles per hour, “more than twice the speed of surface aircraft carriers.”</p>

<p>A year later, <em>Popular Science</em> reported on a design by Horace Chapman Young and Eric Langlands that could double as passenger ship and flying aircraft carrier.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Airwing, as the craft is called, is built as a flying wing with space within its single-wing body for helium, fuel, crew and payload and tunnels in which propellers or blowers operate.</p></blockquote>



<p>The idea was that the plane would pull and push itself forward — “pulling through suction caused by a semivacuum created in front, and driven by exhaust pressure at the rear.” The helium would give it additional lifting power.</p>

<p>A more serious study was carried out by Lockheed in the 1950s. Its CL-1201 was meant to be a giant nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a whole string of jets under its wing. It would have been the largest plane ever built — but it never was.</p>

<figcaption>Cutaway of a Boeing 747 converted into an aircraft carrier</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the early 1970s, the United States Air Force studied the possibility of converting a Boeing 747 into a flying aircraft carrier. The problem was developing fighter jets small enough to fit inside.</p>



<p>Such practicalities don’t bother us ‘punks. Let’s move on to the fictional examples!</p>



<p>The best-known is S.H.I.E.L.D.’s helicarrier from the Marvel comic books and movies. It has gone through various iterations, from literally a flying ship to the rotor-blade version of the most recent cinematic adaptations.</p>

<p>Spectrum, the international security agency in <em>Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons</em>&nbsp;(1967-68), has a similar skyborne headquarters called Cloudbase.</p>



<p>So does the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce (UNIT) in <em>Doctor Who</em>. Its flying aircraft carrier is called the <em>Valiant</em>.</p>



<p>Peter McKinstry’s concept art for the <em>Valiant</em> looks remarkably similar to Kevin Conran’s for <em>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</em> (2004). I’m not sure if that was deliberate.</p>



<p>The carriers of <em>Sky Captain</em> ended up looking differently and they do not belong to any international organization. Rather, because the United Kingdom was still the world’s premier sea power in the real-world 1930s, in the film they are part of the British fleet.</p>

<p>The French-Canadian animation series <em>Skyland</em> (2005-07) features two flying aircraft carriers, the <em>Saint Nazaire</em> and the <em>Calisto</em>. Both carry ten fighter aircraft called Mosquitos. Their enemies, the dictatorial Sphere, operate a vertical mothership called <em>The Monolith</em>, which carries both smaller fighters and troops.</p>

<p>Steampunk fans will be familiar with <em><a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/">Girl Genius</a></em>, Phil and Kaja Foglio’s long-running webcomic. The series has not a flying aircraft carrier per se but a flying fortress, called <em>Castle Wulfenbach</em>, that can hold entire airships in its vast hangar bays. It is the headquarters of Baron Klaus Wulfenbach, the tyrant of Europe.</p>



<p>In <em>Iron Sky</em> (2012, our review <a href="https://neverwasmag.com/2012/04/iron-sky/">here</a>), the Nazis fly similarly oversized zeppelins, except these can go into space and carry a squadron of flying discs.</p>



<p>A smaller version can be found in the 2008 game <em>Turning Point: Fall of Liberty</em>, where a German <em>Flugzeugträger</em> carries a complement of fighter jets and smaller patrol zeppelins.</p>



<p>In the world of <em>The Magnificent Kotobuki</em> (2019), airships ferry goods between distant parts of the world. Each carries a squadron of fighter planes in its belly to defend against sky pirates.</p>

<p>The <em>Ace Combat</em>&nbsp;series is extremely fond of flying aircraft carriers. The games start off with the fairly conventional-looking UI-4053&nbsp;<em>Sphyrna</em> in&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere</em>&nbsp;(1999), an airship with a hangar deck. It ups the ante in <em>Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation</em> (2007) with the <em>Aigaion</em>, a kilometer-wide flying wing with an even bigger hangar deck. The next game, <em>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</em>&nbsp;(2019), has a propeller aircraft <a href="https://neverwasmag.com/2018/04/strange-aircraft-of-the-third-reich-real-and-imagined/">not unlike the flying wing</a> in <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em> (2011) that can carry eighty attack drones.</p>



<p><em>Saints Row: The Third</em> (2011) features the <em>Daedalus</em>, a mobile aircraft carrier similar to some interpretations of the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/">https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40069599">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <p>This is my claim: we, as a civilization, forgot how to center things.</p>
        <p>I mean, we know <em>how</em> to do it. It has never been simpler:</p>
        <pre><code>display: flex;
justify-content: center; /* Horizontal centering */
align-items: center; /* Vertical centering */</code></pre>
        <p>(don’t ask why you need to remember four words instead of just horizontal/vertical, <em>it’s still better than before</em>)</p>
        <p>Or you can use grids if you want:</p>
        <pre><code>display: grid;
justify-items: center; /* Horizontal centering */
align-items: center; /* Vertical centering */</code></pre>
        <p>(also don’t ask why <code>justify-content</code> became <code>justify-items</code>)</p>
        <p>If you feel like school today, we can deduce it from the first principles:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/formula@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="360" height="230">        </figure>
        <p>Hey, even ChatGPT knows how to center things:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/chatgpt@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="720">        </figure>
        <p>Okay, maybe not right away, but eventually it gets there.</p>
        <p>What I’m saying is: everybody knows how to center things. It’s trivial. And if you are lost, the knowledge is right there.</p>
        <p>Yet, when we look at actual applications, we see that these methods are not used. We see this:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/telegram_date@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="200">        </figure>
        <p>or this:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/google_maps_cross@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="200">        </figure>
        <p>or even this:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/feedly_beta@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="200">        </figure>
        <p>So something is clearly getting lost between know-how and applying that knowledge.</p>
        <figure>

        <p>In theory, there’s no difference between theory and practice. Unfortunately, we live in practice.</p>
        <p>So what’s happening? Let’s find out.</p>
        <h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2>
        <p>Fonts are one of the biggest offenders. You can see poorly aligned text everywhere. Let me showcase.</p>
        <p>Apple can’t do it:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/apple_buttons_big_sur@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="270">        </figure>
        <p>Microsoft can’t do it:</p>

<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/windows@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="337">        </figure>
        <p>GitHub can’t do it:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/github@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="230">        </figure>
        <p>Valve can’t do it:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/steam@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="200">        </figure>
        <p>Slack can’t do it:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/slack_button@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="200">        </figure>
        <p>Telegram can’t do it:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/telegram@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="170">        </figure>
        <p>Google Maps can’t do it:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/google_maps@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="200">        </figure>
        <p>Honestly, I can provide an endless supply of poorly-aligned buttons without even having to look for them:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/buttons@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="650">        </figure>
        <p>I think you get the idea. Myriad companies big and small, native or web, and none are safe from text-centering problems.</p>
        <h2 id="line-height">Line height</h2>
        <p>If font metrics are not enough, the next problem on our way to perfect centering is line-height.</p>
        <p>Line height is... complicated. A canonical article to learn about it is Vincent De Oliveira’s <a href="https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-font-metrics-line-height-and-vertical-align" target="_blank">Deep dive CSS: font metrics, line-height and vertical-align</a>.</p>
        <p>This is how it looks applied in practice. Slack:</p>

        <p>Aligning two things in different containers is almost impossible:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>Although many have tried:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/american_airlines@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="200">        </figure>
        <p>Not many have succeeded:</p>

        <p>CSS might get in the way (different controls having different defaults which you have to undo before even starting trying to align):</p>

        <p>No easy solution here, just roll up your sleeves and delve into specifications.</p>
        <h2 id="icons">Icons</h2>
        <p>Icons are like small rectangles put in line with text. Therefore all problems caused by text AND line height apply here. Aligning icons next to text is a notoriously hard task.</p>

        <p>Sometimes both lose:</p>

        <p>Some icons are just plain old HTML form controls:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/git_butler@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="300">        </figure>
        <p>Some are stylized:</p>

        <p>Sometimes people will get creative to achieve perfect alignment:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/github_close@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="250">        </figure>
        <p>But overall it’s a pretty hopeless game:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/apple_id@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="250">        </figure>
        <p>The problem is, CSS doesn’t help us either. There are 13 possible values for the <code>vertical-align</code> property, but none would align the icon in a meaningful way:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/text_align@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="810">        </figure>
        <p><code>text-align: middle</code> comes closest, but it aligns by x-height, not cap-height, which still looks unbalanced:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/middle@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="560">        </figure>
        <p>That’s exactly why people love web programming so much. There’s always a challenge.</p>
        <h2 id="icon-fonts">Icon fonts</h2>
        <p>Aligning rectangles is relatively easy. Aligning text is hard. Icons are rectangles. So what if we put icons into a font file?</p>
        <p>Now we can’t align anything:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/icon_fonts@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="550">        </figure>
        <p>Neither can we set icon size! In the example above, all icons were set to the same font size and line height. As you can see, all of them come out different sizes, with different paddings, and none were properly aligned.</p>
        <p>Despite many shortcomings and almost no upsides, companies rushed to add icon fonts everywhere. The result is this:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/calculators@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="1288"><figcaption>macOS 10.14 → macOS 10.15</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>Notice how operators are not vertically aligned anymore and are also blurry. All because of switching to icon font.</p>
        <p>Apple was so committed to icon fonts they even ruined the QuickTime record button:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/quicktime@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="260">        </figure>
        <p>Just look at it:</p>

<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/quicktime_button@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="400">        </figure>
        <p>Yes, it actually looks like this to this day. As does the calculator.</p>
        <p>But they are far from being the only ones. One:</p>

        <p>Same as with text alignment, there’s an endless supply of poorly aligned icons.</p>
        <h2 id="skill-issue">Skill issue</h2>
        <p>Not only programmers fail to center things. Designers do it, too:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>The problem with icons is that sometimes you have to take their shape into account for things to look good:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/apple_logo@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="300"><figcaption>Bad centering / good centering</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>Triangle is notably tricky:</p>

<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/triangle@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="190">        </figure>
        <p>Sometimes it is too far to the left:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/triangle_left@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="150">        </figure>
        <p>Sometimes it’s too far to the right:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/triangle_right@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="200">        </figure>
        <p>It can even be too high up (line-height strikes again):</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/triangle_up@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="200">        </figure>
        <h2 id="horizontal-centering">Horizontal centering</h2>
        <p>You might think that only centering things vertically is hard. Not only! Horizontal might be hard, too:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/apple_sign_in_business@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="540">        </figure>
        <p>I don’t think there’s a deep reason for these, except for people just being sloppy:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/twitter_horizontal@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="250">        </figure>

<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/android@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="230">        </figure>
        <p>Can this be a deliberate decision?</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/teams@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="250">        </figure>
        <p>I don’t know. Icons can suffer from it, too:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/drive@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="200">        </figure>
        <p>As can text:</p>

        <h2 id="what-can-be-done-designers">What can be done: designers</h2>
        <p>So what <em>is</em> the problem?</p>
        <p>It all starts with the font. Right now, the bounding box of a text block looks like this:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/text_bounding_box@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="360" height="158">        </figure>
        <p>The problem is, it can also look like this:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/text_bounding_box_2@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="360" height="158">        </figure>
        <p>or this:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/text_bounding_box_3@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="360" height="161">        </figure>
        <p>Now, what will happen if you try to center text by centering its bounding box?</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/text_bounding_box_4.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="290">        </figure>
        <p>The text will be off! Even though rectangles are perfectly centered.</p>
        <p>But even if font <em>can</em> have its metrics unbalanced, it doesn’t mean it does. What happens in reality?</p>
        <p>In reality, <em>most</em> of the popular fonts have metrics slightly off. Many have it <em>significantly</em> off:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/metrics@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="1322"><figcaption>Percentages are of cap-height</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>10% is not a small number. It’s a whole pixel in font size 13! Two, if you have 2× scaling! It’s easily noticeable.</p>
        <p>Basically, Segoe UI is the reason why Github on Windows looks like this:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/github@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="230">        </figure>
        <p>The solution is simple: make tight bounding boxes and centering will become trivial:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/text_bounding_box_5.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="290">        </figure>
        <p>If you use Figma, it already can do this (although it’s not the default):</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/figma_vertical_trim@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="353" height="561">        </figure>
        <h2 id="what-can-be-done-font-designers">What can be done: font designers</h2>
        <p>If you are a font designer, make life easier for everybody by setting your metrics so that <code>ascender − cap-height = descender</code>:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/font_metrics_numbers@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="400">        </figure>
        <p>Or the same idea, visually:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/font_metrics@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="400">        </figure>
        <p>Important! You don’t have to <em>actually</em> extend your ascenders/descenders to these boundaries. As you can see in the picture, my ascender space, for example, is way underutilized. Just make the numbers match.</p>
        <p>For both web and native, to avoid headaches, choose a font that already follows this rule. SF Pro Text, Inter, and Martian Mono seem to do this already, so they will center perfectly with no extra effort.</p>
        <p>See <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/font-size/">Font size is useless; let’s fix it</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2 id="what-can-be-done-web-developers">What can be done: web developers</h2>
        <p>From the developer side, it’s a bit more tricky.</p>
        <p>The first thing to understand, you need to know which font you’ll be using. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work if you plan to substitute fonts.</p>
        <p>We’ll use IBM Plex Sans, a font used on this very page. IBM Plex Sans has the following metrics:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/ibm_plex_sans@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="350">        </figure>
        <p>When you set <code>font-size</code>, what you set is UPM (this will also be equal to <code>1em</code>). However, the actual space occupied by the text block is the space between the ascender and descender.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/ibm_plex_sans_notes@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="350">        </figure>
        <p>With a few simple calculations, we get that extra <code>padding-bottom: 0.052em</code> should do the trick:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/numi@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="325">        </figure>
        <p>Should work like this:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/ibm_plex_sans_padding@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="520">        </figure>
        <p>Or in actual CSS (select text to see default text bounding box):</p>
<p>
    <span>Andy</span>
</p>        <p>You can get the required font metrics for your font from <a href="https://opentype.js.org/font-inspector.html" target="_blank">opentype.js.org/font-inspector.html</a> (ascender, descender, sCapHeight).</p>
        <p>Now that we have that sorted, aligning icons is not that hard too. You set <code>vertical-align: baseline</code> and then move them down by <code>(iconHeight - capHeight) / 2</code>:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/ibm_plex_sans_icon@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="307">        </figure>
        <p>This, unfortunately, requires you to know both font metrics and icon size. But hey, at least it works:</p>
<p>
    <span>
    <span></span>
    Andy
    </span>
</p>        <p>Again, select the text above to see how different the browser’s bounding box is from the correct position.</p>
        <h2 id="what-can-be-done-icons-fonts">What can be done: icons fonts</h2>
        <p>STOP.</p>
        <p>USING.</p>
        <p>FONTS.</p>
        <p>FOR.</p>
        <p>ICONS.</p>
        <p>Use normal image format. The one with dimensions, you know? Width and height?</p>
        <p>Here, I drew a diagram for you, to help you make a decision:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/diagram@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="720">        </figure>
        <p>Just look at how hard Apple tries to put the checkmark inside the rectangle, and the rectangle next to the text label:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/apple_sign_in@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="508">        </figure>
        <p>And they still fail!</p>
        <p>Nothing is easier than aligning two rectangles. Nothing is harder than trying to align text that has an arbitrary amount of empty space around it.</p>
        <p>This is a game that can’t be won.</p>
        <h2 id="what-can-be-done-optical-compensations">What can be done: optical compensations</h2>
        <p>We, developers, can only mathematically align perfect rectangles. So for anything that requires manual compensation, please wrap it in a big enough rectangle and visually balance your icon inside:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/icons_baked@2x.png?t=1713310106" width="720" height="650">        </figure>
        <h2 id="what-can-be-done-everyone">What can be done: everyone</h2>
        <p>Please pay attention. Please care. Bad centering can ruin otherwise decent UI:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/win@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="120">        </figure>
        <p>But a properly aligned text can make your UI sing:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/win_fix@2x.webp?t=1713310106" width="720" height="120">        </figure>
        <p>Even if it’s hard. Even if tools make it inconvenient. Even if you have to search for solutions. Together, I trust, we can find our way back to putting one rectangle inside another rectangle without messing it up.</p>
        <p>I, for one, want to live in a world of beautiful well-balanced UIs. I trust that you do, too. </p>
        <p>It’s all worth it in the end.</p>

Its researchers have produced a corpus of 1.5 million concepts and 25 million rules that feed an inference engine with more than a thousand specialized submodules. The system can use both common-sense knowledge and deep domain expertise to make deductions from chains of reasonings that are thousands of steps long. Its users range from an Ohio research hospital to the National Security Agency.</p><p>Yet despite its impressive achievements, Cyc has been largely forgotten, left behind by a new generation of machine-learning algorithms that power the chatbots and self-driving cars of today. How did one of the grandest experiments in AI end up as a historical footnote?</p><p>In 1983, a group of AI researchers met at Stanford to discuss a vexing issue in AI research: how to program machines with common sense.</p><p><span>The organizer of the meeting, Stanford professor Doug Lenat, had been thinking about the problem for some time. In the 1970s, he had made a name for himself with a series of programs that exhibited striking flashes of intelligence. The first, AM (short for 'Automated Mathematician'), was pre-programmed with some elementary mathematics and told to search for 'interesting' theorems. It found hundreds, many mundane but some of them remarkably creative; one discovery mirrored work done by the mathematical prodigy </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>AM's biggest shortcoming was the fact that its heuristics were hard-coded – meaning that it couldn't change tactics once it ran out of ideas. In Lenat's next program, EURISKO, the heuristics themselves could be evaluated and modified by the program. Lenat used EURISKO to compete against human opponents at a complicated table-top board game called Traveller Trillion Credit Squadron. Guided by Lenat, the system suggested a highly unorthodox strategy that seemed unlikely to work. But the unconventional strategy paid off, and Lenat–EURISKO won the tournament.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-143686236" href="https://outsiderart.substack.com/p/cyc-historys-forgotten-ai-project#footnote-2-143686236" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">2</a></span></p><p>Still, EURISKO eventually slowed down, too. Lenat wagered that a machine that could draw on a large body of general knowledge – what humans call 'common sense' – when it got stuck would have a better chance of achieving genuine intelligence than clever but simple-minded programs like AM and EURISKO.</p><p>At the time, the cutting edge in artificial intelligence was so-called 'expert systems'. Unlike traditional programs that proceeded mechanically along a hard-coded path (like a glorified flowchart), expert systems made inferences and deductions from a set of facts and rules written by domain experts in fields like medical diagnosis and organic chemistry. They were (in theory) capable of performing a rudimentary kind of reasoning and dealing more flexibly with complex situations.</p><p>However, each expert system had its own database of rules, which meant both wasteful duplication and the inability of different expert systems to talk to one another. Lenat saw that a shared bank of common-sense knowledge could be the foundation for a new generation of even more effective systems.</p><p>At the Stanford meeting, Lenat and the other researchers calculated that a machine would need to know several million rules before it reached the 'crossover point' when it could begin to learn on its own. Assembling such a knowledge base would take 2,000 person-years of effort – not unthinkable, but beyond the resources of a busy professor and a few grad students.</p><p><span>Lenat soon got the chance to pursue his vision outside the confines of academic research. The year after the Stanford meeting, ten US companies formed the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC), a research consortium to counter an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Generation_Computer_Systems" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">ambitious computing initiative</a><span> launched by the Japanese government. Lenat was considering a tenured position as a professor at Stanford, but the attraction of private-sector-scale resources proved too great. He signed on as MCC's chief scientist. Armed with a half-billion dollar budget and hundreds of employees, he headed MCC's flagship project: to produce the massive knowledge base that machines would need to reason like humans. They called it Cyc, from 'encyclopedia'.</span></p><p><span>Despite its name, Cyc was not meant to be encyclopedic </span><em>per se</em><span>; it would cover an even more basic level of knowledge – propositions like 'A person is born only once' and 'Animals can't talk except in fairy tales' that are so obvious that no one bothers to write them down. Cyc would be the foundation for specialized expert systems that would have domain knowledge about things like chemical compounds and human anatomy.</span></p><p><span>Cyc's knowledge base is a collection of </span><em>frames</em><span> (also called </span><em>units</em><span>), with </span><em>slots</em><span> for properties and </span><em>entries</em><span> for their values. Concretely, the frame 'Texas' has a 'capital' slot with the entry 'Austin'. Frames are organized into a global ontology, meaning that each frame belongs to one or more categories, and categories themselves belong to categories, all the way up to a root 'Thing' category that encompasses everything in the knowledge base.</span></p><p>On top of frames sits a constraint language that allows the system to express logical concepts like quantification ('every X is Y') and disjunction ('X or Y but not both'), and an inference engine to make deductions and answer queries. While there is a general-purpose reasoning engine, specialized inference engines are used for most queries for efficiency.</p><p>Cyc has 'microtheories' which allow it to reconcile seemingly contradictory facts from different domains, for example classical physics and quantum mechanics. In general, Cyc does not have 'probability factors', but it does have coarse notions of likelihood, as well as awareness that some facts (like the population of a country) are estimates and others (like the fact that dogs have four legs) are only true by default.</p><p>The 'ontological engineers' employed by Cyc originally entered the frames by hand. One technique they used was reading English text and looking for sentences with ambiguous pronouns: in a case where a pronoun like 'he' or 'she' was syntactically ambiguous, what common-sense knowledge does a human use to identify the referent? Consider these two sentences:</p><blockquote><p>Tom was mad at Joe because he stole his lunch.</p><p>Tom was mad at Joe so he stole his lunch.</p></blockquote><p>As any speaker of English can deduce without conscious effort, the word 'he' refers to Joe in the first sentence but Tom in the second, despite differing by only one word. We know this because of our understanding of human behavior and the concepts of anger and theft – it is logical that Tom would be mad at Joe if Joe stole Tom's lunch, but not if Tom stole Joe's lunch. But machines do not know this and must be taught explicitly.</p><p>Another technique was looking at pairs of sentences and figuring out the subtext that links them. For instance: "Of the five schools that accepted her, Mary decided to go to Harvard. She graduated with a degree in chemistry." Between the two sentences, we infer that Mary probably left home and went to Massachusetts for a period of approximately four years; took a few dozen courses, many but not all of which were in chemistry; met other students and professors at the university; and many other things that are left unstated. An intelligent system like Cyc ought to be able to make these inferences; if it cannot, the ontological engineers have to figure out what axioms to add to the knowledge base so that it can.</p><p><span>Work on Cyc progressed steadily through the ten years that MCC was funded. In a 1989 book-length report on the project, the Cyc team projected optimism. The knowledge base had reached 1 million 'pieces of data', including 50,000 individual units and 6,000 collections. Many "representational thorns" – difficulties in representing real-world knowledge within the system, some of which were in fact ancient problems in philosophy</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-143686236" href="https://outsiderart.substack.com/p/cyc-historys-forgotten-ai-project#footnote-3-143686236" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">3</a></span><span> – were encountered and dealt with. The guiding philosophy was pragmatism over elegance: age-old philosophical problems were side-stepped with practical solutions. The infamous </span><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-metaphysics/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">problem of causation</a><span>, for instance, was reduced to the idea that 'E1 causes E2' means 'if E1 is observed, predict that E2 will happen'.</span></p><p><span>When MCC disbanded in 1994, Cyc was spun off under a new company called Cycorp (pronounced "SIGH-core"). Cycorp sustained itself financially through contracts with the government and corporations. Much of what Cycorp did in this period has not been publicly disclosed, but a few projects have come to light through research papers and technical reports. Cyc was used by the Cleveland Clinic for answering </span><em>ad hoc</em><span> questions from medical researchers; it reduced the time from as long as a month of manual back-and-forth between medical and database experts, to less than an hour. Cycorp also partnered with the US intelligence community to assist in building a 'terrorism knowledge base' that analysts could query. Cyc's grasp of common-sense knowledge helped it 'fill in the blanks' in synthesizing information from different sources that was often incomplete or contradictory.</span></p><p>In the 2000s, Cycorp released a subset of the knowledge base as OpenCyc, and offered researchers an expanded version called ResearchCyc. A few outside researchers published papers based on the Cyc system. But the core product remained proprietary, and OpenCyc releases stopped in 2012.</p><p><span>While Cyc was slowly but steadily growing its knowledge base, the field of artificial intelligence was radically changing. Most expert systems were long gone by the 2000s. Neural networks using deep learning, a type of statistical machine learning based on generic, opaque algorithms trained on massive amounts of data, were making huge breakthroughs. It was practically the antithesis of Cyc's logical reasoning and painstakingly handcrafting knowledge base of explicit rules. But despite their lack of common-sense knowledge, deep-learning algorithms proved to be fantastically successful at previously intractable problems. Beginning with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">AlexNet</a><span> in 2012, neural nets revolutionized the field of image recognition. Game-playing programs by Google's DeepMind lab trounced the previous strongest chess-playing program and beat one of the world's top go players. And neural nets were behind the astonishing success of large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini. In a field now dominated by machine learning, Cyc's rule-based, symbolic approach increasingly looked like an anachronism.</span></p><p>Yet, forty years after its inception, Cyc is still here. It has grown to a knowledge base of 25 million rules, 1.5 million concepts, and more than a thousand specialized inference engines. Cycorp employs 50 technical staff members and is completely funded by its commercial contracts. Nevertheless, to the extent that Cyc is remembered at all in the AI community, it is as a cautionary tale of tremendous effort wasted on a misguided approach.</p><p><span>The verdict is harsh – but the expectations were high. In 1989, Lenat and co-author </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanathan_V._Guha" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">R. V. Guha</a><span> wrote "we hope that by 1999 no one would even </span><em>think</em><span> about having a computer that doesn't have Cyc running on it". They have had to settle for more modest victories. Surviving for forty years in an industry notorious for its boom-and-bust cycles is a noteworthy achievement, but Cyc's impact has failed to be revolutionary. While outsiders cannot assess the capabilities of the proprietary system, it is fair to infer that if Cyc had achieved an epoch-making breakthrough, the wider world would have heard about it.</span></p><p>Still, while overshadowed by flashier programs like ChatGPT, Cyc should not be counted out. Lenat, who passed away in 2023, wrote his final paper about the opportunities for Cyc and LLMs to complement each other. LLMs are fluent and knowledgeable, but often inconsistent and inaccurate. Cyc is not as good at understanding and generating English text, but its conclusions are always supported by a chain of reasoning that can be audited by a human. An integrated Cyc–LLM system could be a powerful synthesis.</p><p>The course of progress is unpredictable: fertile areas of research turn barren and methodologies that were left for dead suddenly come back to life. Neural nets were invented in the 1940s, then fell out of favor for decades. Rule-based systems like Cyc were once the vanguard of AI. Perhaps their time will come again.</p><p><span>Douglas B.

<p data-sid="6000006">A year and a half ago, our friends at <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/">TigerBeetle</a> invited me to give a sneak preview of Antithesis at <a href="https://systemsdistributed.com/">Systems Distributed</a>. This talk was recorded, but never published (since we were in stealth at the time).</p>
<p data-sid="6000007">We’re publishing it now because it answers one of the most common questions we get: how exactly does Antithesis explore the state spaces of complex systems, and how does it find bugs so quickly? It also explains something Alex alluded to in <a href="https://antithesis.com/blog/deterministic_hypervisor/">his post</a>: our deterministic hypervisor isn’t just about getting perfect reproducibility of the bugs we find, it also helps us find the bugs in the first place.</p>
<p data-sid="6000008">And it explains all of this using everybody’s favorite Italian plumber. Check it out:</p>

<p data-sid="6000009">As we announced before, our platform has been <a href="https://antithesis.com/blog/ag8bi/">playing and beating Nintendo games for many years</a>. Hopefully you now have some idea of why we use these programs for our bug-finding research. Far from being simple toy problems, they’re actually strictly harder to explore than “real” software in several important ways.</p>
<p data-sid="6000010">In the talk above I skipped to the end of the Super Mario Brothers solution that our platform autonomously discovered, but we’ve embedded the full video below (sped up so you can enjoy the whole thing). Antithesis can find this solution in about forty-five minutes on a 2018-era workstation CPU. The only hints our platform received were the locations in memory that hold Mario’s X and Y coordinates in a level, and which level he’s on.</p>

<p data-sid="6000011">Along the way, we can draw heatmaps of where Antithesis spends most of its time in the game. Since clipping through a wall is a relatively rare event, these heatmaps end up visibly reproducing some very recognizable level outlines:</p>
<p>
    <img alt="The heatmap of our fuzzer's path through Mario" src="https://antithesis.com/blog/sdtalk/images/marioheatmap.webp">
</p>
<p data-sid="6000012">And here we are (sped up) playing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizo">Kaizo</a> ROM hack with the exact same configuration – zero tweaking, zero hyperparameter tuning, and zero iteration on the platform. This happened literally the first time we turned the system on with the new levels. Notice that we actually get stuck at the end, but we do play the game pretty well (and we find a bug!).</p>

<p data-sid="6000013">Finally, the answer to the question I’m sure you’ve all been wondering about this whole time! Does Antithesis make it to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minus_World">Minus World</a>? You better believe it does:</p>

<p data-sid="6000014">Super Mario Bros. is a simple game, but its state space is inconceivably vast. As far as we know, we're the first autonomous system to explore that state space efficiently enough to beat the game (albeit with one or two hints).</p>
<p data-sid="6000015">That same capability for efficient state space exploration is what enables us to find bugs and deliver value to <a href="https://antithesis.com/solutions/case_studies/">our customers</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p data-block-key="naos7"><b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued an order against BloomTech and its CEO, Austen Allred, for deceiving students about the cost of loans and making false claims about graduates’ hiring rates. The CFPB found that BloomTech and Allred falsely told students the school’s “income share” agreement contracts were not loans, when in fact the agreements were loans carrying an average finance charge of around $4,000. BloomTech and Allred lured prospective enrollees with inflated promises of job-placement rates as high as 86 percent, when the company’s internal metrics showed placement rates closer to 50 percent and in some cases as low as 30 percent. The order permanently bans BloomTech from all consumer-lending activities and bans Allred from any student-lending activities for ten years. The CFPB is also ordering BloomTech and Allred to cease collecting payments on income share loans for graduates who did not have a qualifying job, eliminate finance changes for certain agreements, and allow students the option to withdraw without penalty. BloomTech and Allred must also pay over $164,000 in civil penalties, which will be deposited in the CFPB’s victims relief fund.</p><p data-block-key="7fbmi">“BloomTech and its CEO sought to drive students toward income share loans that were marketed as risk-free, but in fact carried significant finance charges and many of the same risks as other credit products,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “Today’s action underscores our increased focus on investigating individual executives and, when appropriate, charging them with breaking the law.”</p><p data-block-key="dhpkr">BloomTech is a for-profit vocational school that is headquartered in San Francisco and owned primarily by Allred and various Silicon Valley venture-capital funds. Allred founded the company as the Lambda School in 2017, and rebranded it as BloomTech or the Bloom Institute of Technology in 2022.</p><p data-block-key="ahhmu">BloomTech operates short-term, typically six-to-nine-month training programs in areas such as web development, data science, and backend engineering. Since 2017, BloomTech originated at least 11,000 income share loans, with most of BloomTech students funding their tuition with these loans. Under almost all these loans, students who earn more than $50,000 in a related field are required to pay BloomTech 17 percent of their pre-tax income each month until they make 24 payments or hit a “cap” of $30,000 in total payments.</p><p data-block-key="6ng1i">The CFPB found that BloomTech students were lured with false promises and deceptive marketing. BloomTech and Allred:</p><ul><li data-block-key="dvq1c"><b>Hid the cost and true nature of students’ debt:</b> BloomTech falsely claimed its “income share” agreements were not loans, did not create debt, did not carry a finance charge, and were “risk free.” In fact, the agreements are loans with an average finance charge of $4,000. The loans carry substantial risk, as a single missed payment triggers a default and the remainder of the $30,000 “cap” becomes due immediately. BloomTech further hid the cost and nature of the “income share” loans by not disclosing key terms like the finance charge and annual percentage rate, as required by law.</li><li data-block-key="afs34"><b>Tricked prospective students with inflated job-placement rates:</b> BloomTech advertised on its website that 71 to 86 percent of students were placed in jobs within six months of graduation, when its non-public reporting to investors consistently showed placement rates closer to 50 percent.

                          </figure><p>None of this is accidental. For years, Google has been watching users tack on "Reddit" to the end of search queries and finally decided to do something about it.</p><p>Google <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/products/search/more-content-by-people-for-people-in-search/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">started dropping hints</a> in 2022 when it promised to do a better job of promoting sites that weren't just chasing the top of search but were more helpful and human.</p><p>Last August, Google rolled out a big update to Search that seemed to kick this into action. Reddit, Quora, and other forum sites started getting more visibility in Google, both within the traditional links and within a new "discussions and forums" section, which you may have spotted if you're US-based.</p><p>The timing of this Reddit bump has led to some conspiracy theories. In February, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Google and Reddit announced</a> a blockbuster deal that would let Google train its AI models on Reddit content.

A few weeks later, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reddits-ipo-set-to-take-front-page-of-internet-public-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Reddit also went public</a>.</p><p>A Google spokesperson told BI: "Our agreement with Reddit absolutely did not include ranking its content higher on Search."</p><p>Indeed, SEO experts have watched this Reddit bump since August when Google rolled out a crucial search update six months before the deal was announced. </p><p>It's not just Reddit. Q&amp;A forum Quora is getting a huge visibility bump in Google search results, per Semrush and Sistrix data. Google says "hundreds" of other forums and communities across the web are also getting the bump.</p><p>Still, given Reddit's size, its rise is the most noticeable. Per Sistrix data, Reddit is now as visible in top Google Search results as Instagram.</p><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

Reddit's main competitors are Wikipedia, YouTube, and Fandom, Paine said, and it also competes in "high-value commercial searches," putting it up against Amazon. The "real competitors," he said, are the subreddits that compete with brands on the web. </p><h2>Giving the people what they want</h2><p>Why is Google doing this, and why <em>now</em>?</p><p>The company's stance here is simple: it's giving users what they want.</p><p>"Our research has shown that people often want to learn from others' experiences with a topic, so we've continued to make it easier to find helpful perspectives on Search when it's relevant to a query," a Google spokesperson told BI.

There are risks associated with Reddit, which relies on unpaid moderators to police unsavory content and spam.</p><p>Google told BI its systems work on all websites, including Quora and Reddit. Still, there's evidence that people are already abusing the rise of these sites in Google rankings. In a <a target="_blank" href="https://detailed.com/forum-serps/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">February study</a>, SEO blogger Glen Allsopp found that 51% of Reddit's top-ranking threads in Google Search's forums sections contained spam as a top comment.</p><p>YouTube already has heaps of videos offering advice on hijacking Reddit to rise to the top of Google Search. One of the most popular videos right now teaches viewers to purchase abandoned Reddit accounts, seek out popular Reddit posts to post comments filled with affiliate links, and then artificially inflate their popularity using "upvotes" purchased from third-party websites. This way, they can feasibly rocket to the top of Google.</p><p>It might not be that difficult. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/reddit-post-ranks-within-minutes" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Search Engine Journal reported</a> this week that one Reddit user climbed to top-ranking Google Search results in minutes (BI could confirm the post ranked in the top 10, but couldn't independently verify the time it took to get there).</p><p>A Google spokesperson said the company's anti-spam policies apply to all content and that it takes particular attention to searches for sensitive topics such as health or finance.</p><p>Still, it's unclear how much Google's spam-attacking systems, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-update-march-2024/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">which just got a boost</a>, work right now. Reddit is "heavily manipulated at the end of the day," and people can easily take advantage of it by posting content there, Solis said.</p><p>Lily Ray, vice president of SEO strategy and research for marketing agency Amsive, told BI she is concerned that Google is "shifting the burden" of monitoring abuse onto Reddit moderators. Neglected subreddits risk getting spammed with unhelpful or even false content.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lily-ray-44755615_reddit-seo-google-activity-7183851130827784192-iE_A/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Ray wrote on LinkedIn last week</a> that she found an example of Reddit ranking prominently at the top of Google when she searched "How to lose 10 pounds in a week".</p><p>"A redditor suggested 'cutting your arm off,'" she wrote.</p><p>This raises questions about whether Google can keep bad content from being eaten by its AI-generated search engine, which often sources its responses from the top search results. Already, Google is fighting an influx of AI-generated content flooding the web. At the same time, rivals such as OpenAI and Perplexity try to steal Google's lunch with AI chatbots that work like search engineers.</p><p>A Google spokesperson told BI that the company's analysis did not find that more harmful content on Search comes from forums.</p><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

In Switzerland, where Nestlé is headquartered, such products are sold with no added sugar. These are the main findings of a new investigation by Public Eye and the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN), which shed light on Nestlé’s hypocrisy and the deceptive marketing strategies deployed by the Swiss food giant.</strong></span></p>

                      <p>Meagan Adonis was 23 when she became blind as a result of a serious health condition. That same year she found out that she was pregnant, and was worried about the challenges of being a blind mum. She has now found her motherhood feet, and recently gave birth to a second child. Based in Johannesburg, South Africa, the “blind goddess” – as she calls herself – now documents her life for more than 125,000 followers on social media and chronicles her daily routine with her new baby.</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>Last year, Meagan posted several videos on TikTok promoting Cerelac infant cereals for babies from six months of age. “As you can see, I have a very active baby”, she <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@meaganadonis/video/7317231120582577414" target="_blank">explains</a> in a video in December. “As a blind mum, feeding time is always an adventure! […] Now let’s go and prepare his favourite meal of the day. Little bodies need big support with Nestlé Cerelac being the perfect addition to our mealtime,” she assures her audience in a cheerful tone – while omitting to mention that this maternal counsel comes as part of a paid partnership with Nestlé.</p>
                      <p>Thousands of kilometres away, in Guatemala, a father films his energetic little daughter. “There’s no greater satisfaction than seeing a strong, healthy child”, says Billy Saavedra, a <em>reggaeton </em>artist better known as <em>Billy the Diamond</em>. “That’s why we prefer Nido 1+, which supports the development of her bones and muscles, as well as her immune system”, he adds in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqGPA4vgN_5/" target="_blank">video</a> promoting the brand’s formulas for young children in March on his Instagram account, which has more than 550,000 followers.</p>

                      <p>The use of influencers, such as Meagan or Billy (and their children), is at the core of Nestlé’s marketing strategy to boost sales of its baby foods. This approach, which has become increasingly important in many sectors, allows companies to reach a broad audience, building on a sense of identification and relatability. Coming from parents with similar experiences, advertising messages are regarded as benevolent advice that can be trusted.</p>
                      <h2><strong>A growing market</strong></h2>
                      <p>Fifty years after the “baby killers” infant formula scandal, Nestlé <a href="http://claims/" target="_blank">claims</a> to have learned from the past and <a href="https://www.nestle.com/media/news/breast-milk-substitutes-who-code-compliance-report-2022" target="_blank">proclaims</a> its “unwavering commitment” to the “responsible marketing” of breast-milk substitutes.</p>

                      <p>The food giant is doing everything it can to present itself as the world leader in infant nutrition, meticulously targeting each stage in a child’s first years of life. It currently controls 20 percent of the baby-food market, valued at nearly $70 billion.</p>
                      <p>Cerelac and Nido are some of Nestlé’s best-selling baby-food brands in low- and middle-income countries. According to exclusive data obtained from Euromonitor, a market analysis firm specializing in the food industry, their sales value in this category was greater than $2.5 billion in 2022.</p>
                      <p>In its own communications or via third parties, Nestlé <a href="https://www.nestle.com/csv/global-initiatives/healthier-kids/nestle-products-brands" target="_blank">promotes</a> Cerelac and Nido as brands whose aim is to help children “live healthier lives”. Fortified with vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients, these products are, according to the multinational, tailored to the needs of babies and young children and help to strengthen their growth, immune system and cognitive development.</p>
                      <p>But do these infant cereals and powdered milks really offer “the best nutrition,” as Nestlé claims? That’s what Public Eye and the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) wanted to find out, by focusing on one of the key public enemies when it comes to nutrition: sugar.</p>

                      <p>Spoiler alert: Our investigation shows that, for Nestlé, not all babies are equal when it comes to added sugar. While in Switzerland, where the company is headquartered, the main infant cereals and formula brands <a href="https://www.nestlebaby.ch/fr/nestle-baby" target="_blank">sold</a> by the multinational come without added sugar, most Cerelac and Nido products marketed in lower-income countries do contain added sugar, often at high levels.</p>
                      <p>For example, in Switzerland, Nestlé promotes its biscuit-flavoured cereals for babies aged from six months with the claim “no added sugar”, while in Senegal and South Africa, Cerelac cereals with the same flavour <a href="https://www.shoprite.co.za/All-Departments/Baby/Baby-Food/Baby-and-Toddler-Breakfast/Nestl%C3%A9-Cerelac-Baby-Cereal-With-Milk-Biscuit-Flavour-250g/p/10782004EA" target="_blank">contain</a> 6 grams of added sugar per serving.</p>

                      <p>Similarly, in Germany, France and the UK – Nestlé’s <a href="https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2023-03/2022-annual-review-en.pdf" target="_blank">main European markets</a> – all formulas for young children aged 12-36 months sold by the company contain no added sugar. And while some infant cereals for young children over one year old contain added sugar, cereals for babies aged six months do not.</p>
                      <p>Cerelac wheat-based cereals for six-month-old babies sold by Nestlé in Germany and the UK has no added sugar, while the same product contains over 5 grams per serving in Ethiopia and 6 grams in Thailand.</p>

                      <p>“There is a double standard here that can’t be justified,” said Nigel Rollins, scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO), when presented with our findings. For Rollins, the fact that Nestlé does not add sugar to these products in Switzerland but is quite happy to do it in lower resources settings “is problematic both from a public health and ethical perspective.” Rollins says that manufacturers may try to get children accustomed to a certain level of sugar at a very early age, so that they prefer products high in sugar. “This is totally inappropriate,” he believes.</p>

                      <h2><strong>On the trail of hidden sugar</strong></h2>
                      <p>The amount of added sugar is often not even disclosed in the nutritional information available on the packaging of these kinds of products. In most countries, including Switzerland and across Europe, companies are only required to indicate the amount of total sugars, which also includes those naturally present in milk or whole fruit, and are <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/04-03-2015-who-calls-on-countries-to-reduce-sugars-intake-among-adults-and-children" target="_blank">not considered</a> harmful to health.</p>
                      <p>While Nestlé prominently highlights the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients contained in its products using idealizing imagery, it’s not transparent when it comes to added sugar. To uncover these “hidden sugars,” we obtained Cerelac and Nido products from a number of countries to examine their labels and, in some cases, have them analyzed by a specialized laboratory.</p>

                      <p>This turned out to be more complicated than expected. Several laboratories approached in Switzerland refused to conduct the sugar analysis of Nestlé products. One lab even wrote that it could not take part in the project because the results “could potentially have a negative impact” on its existing customers. Stonewalled, we decided to approach a lab based in Belgium. The results are edifying.</p>

                      <p>Cerelac is the world’s number one baby cereal brand, with sales exceeding $1 billion in 2022, according to Euromonitor. We examined 115 products sold in Nestlé’s main markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America. No less than 108 of them (94 percent) contained added sugar.</p>
                      <p>For 67 of these products, we were able to determine the amount of added sugar. On average, our analysis found almost 4 grams per serving, or about one sugar cube.

                      <p>In India, where sales surpassed $250 million in 2022, all Cerelac baby cereals contain added sugar, on average nearly 3 grams per serving. The same situation prevails in South Africa, the main market on the African continent, where all Cerelac baby cereals contain four grams or more of added sugar per serving. In Brazil, the world’s second-largest market, with sales of around $150 million in 2022, three-quarters of Cerelac baby cereals (known as Mucilon in the country) contain added sugar, on average 3 grams per serving.</p>

                      <p>“This is a big concern,” comments Rodrigo Vianna, epidemiologist and Professor at the Department of Nutrition of the Federal University of Paraíba in Brazil. “Sugar should not be added to foods offered to babies and young children because it is unnecessary and highly addictive. Children get used to the sweet taste and start looking for more sugary foods, starting a negative cycle that increases the risk of nutrition-based disorders in adult life. These include obesity and other chronic non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes or high blood-pressure,” laments the expert.</p>

                      <p>Although less pronounced, this trend is confirmed with the Nido<em> </em>brand, the most <a href="https://www.nestle.com/brands/baby-foods/nido" target="_blank">popular</a> on the growing-up milks market. In 2022, global sales of Nido products for young children aged one to three had exceeded $1 billion according to Euromonitor. We examined 29 of these products sold by Nestlé in some of the main markets in low- and middle-income countries. The result: 21 of them (72 percent) contain added sugar<em>.</em></p>
                      <p>For ten of these products, we were able to determine the amount of added sugar. On average, our analysis found almost two grams per serving. The maximum value – 5.3 grams per serving – was detected in a <a href="https://www.nestleagustoconlavida.com/nido-1" target="_blank">product</a> sold in Panama.</p>

                      <p>With sales at around $400 million in 2022, Indonesia is the world’s leading market for Nido, known locally as Dancow. The two products for children aged one and over sold in the country contain added sugar – more than 0.7 grams per serving.</p>

                      <p>While the multinational is quick to highlight that these products are “without added sucrose,” they do contain added sugar in the form of honey. However, honey and sucrose are both considered by the WHO as sugars that should not be added to baby food. Indeed, Nestlé itself <a href="https://www.nidokids.co.za/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/sugar-fact-fiction-quiz" target="_blank">explains</a><a href="https://www.nidokids.co.za/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/sugar-fact-fiction-quiz"> </a>it very well in an educational quiz on Nido’s website in South-Africa: replacing sucrose with honey has “no scientific health benefit”, as both can contribute “to weight gain and possibly obesity”.</p>
                      <p>In Brazil, the world’s second-largest market for Nido, Nestlé <a href="https://www.ninho.com.br/ninho-fases1" target="_blank">claims</a> not to add sugar to its products out of concern for children’s health and diet: “It’s ideal to avoid consuming these ingredients in childhood, as the sweet flavour can influence a child’s preference for this type of food in the future,” warns the food giant on the brand’s website in Brazil.</p>

                      <p>However, in most Central American countries, where Nestlé aggressively promotes Nido using influencers, the formulas for children aged one year and above contain over a sugar cube per serving. In Nigeria, Senegal, Bangladesh and South Africa – where Nido is very popular – all products for young children aged one to three contain added sugar.</p>
                      <p>“I do not understand why products for sale in South Africa should be different from those that are sold in high-income settings,” states Karen Hofman, Professor of Public Health at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and a qualified paediatrician. “It is a form of colonization and should not be tolerated,” she adds. “There is no valid reason to add sugar to baby food anywhere,” Hofman insists.</p>

        <div id="section-82hnrCQGG0" data-effects="eyJ0ZXh0UGVyTGluZSI6ZmFsc2UsImhhc0VmZmVjdHMiOmZhbHNlLCJuZWVkc0JhY2tncm91bmRDbG9uZSI6ZmFsc2UsImVuY29kZWQiOiIifQ==">
                      <p>This view is shared by the WHO, which has <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/07/1042441" target="_blank">warned</a> for several years now about the high added-sugar content in baby-food products. “This study stresses the need for urgent action to reshape the food environment for children,” Dr Francesco Branca, Director of the WHO Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, told Public Eye and IBFAN. “Eliminating added sugars from food products for young children would be an important way to implement early prevention of obesity.”</p>
                      <p>The WHO is <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/obesity" target="_blank">alarmed</a> that obesity is dramatically on the rise, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where it has now reached “epidemic proportions” and is fuelling an increase of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Increased consumption of ultra-processed foods, often high in sugar, is singled out as one of the main causes of this epidemic.</p>
                      <p>Youngest children are not immune to this scourge: childhood obesity has increased tenfold over the past four decades, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank">according to the UN agency.</a> It’s estimated that 39 million children under the age of 5 are overweight or obese, the vast majority of which live in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
                      <p>“The first two years of a child’s life are particularly important, as optimal nutrition during this period lowers morbidity and mortality, reduces the risk of chronic disease, and fosters better development overall,” <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infant-and-young-child-feeding" target="_blank">explains</a> the WHO. In 2022, the UN agency <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/364678/WHO-EURO-2022-6681-46447-67287-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank">called for</a> a ban on added sugars and sweeteners in food products for babies and children under the age of three, and <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/364678/WHO-EURO-2022-6681-46447-67287-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank">urged</a> industry to “be proactive” and “support public health goals” by reformulating its baby food products.</p>
                      <p>But Nestlé seems to be turning a deaf ear to these appeals. While the multinational publicly <a href="https://www.bebe.nestle.fr/introduire-nourriture-bebe" target="_blank">recommends</a> avoiding baby foods containing added sugar, these wise words don’t seem to apply to low- and middle-income countries, where Nestlé continues to add high levels of sugar to some of its most popular products.</p>
                      <p>Nestlé did not respond to specific questions about this double standard. But the company told Public Eye and IBFAN that it “has reduced by 11% the total amount of added sugars in [its] infant cereal portfolio worldwide” over the past decade and that it will “further reduce the level of added sugars without compromising on quality, safety and taste”. Nestlé also indicated that it is phasing out sucrose and glucose syrup of its Nido “growing up milks” globally. The company added that its products “fully comply” with the Codex Alimentarius and local laws.</p>
                      <h2><strong>Weak regulation</strong></h2>
                      <p>These baby-food products with added sugar are permitted under national legislation despite the fact that they go against WHO guidelines. National legislation is often based on the Codex Alimentarius, a collection of international standards developed by an intergovernmental commission based in Rome. The stated aim is to protect consumers’ health and ensure fair practices in the food trade. These standards, which gained importance as reference points for trade disputes following the establishment of the World Trade Organisation in 1995, tolerate added sugar in baby foods up to certain limits specific for each type of product – up to 20 percent in infant cereals.</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>Codex standards for baby foods have been strongly <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/260137/9789241513470-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">criticized</a> by the WHO, which deems them “inadequate”, particularly concerning sugar, as children establish their food preferences early in life. The agency has called for the standards to be updated and brought into line with WHO guidelines, with a particular focus on banning the addition of sugars. Current Codex standards are insufficient to determine whether a food is appropriate for promotion for infants and young children, according to the UN agency.</p>
                      <p>“WHO recommendations are independent of all industry influence,” Nigel Rollins told Public Eye and IBFAN. “At Codex, you have substantive lobbying: the sugar industry, the baby-food industry, and others are all present in the rooms where the decisions are taken.” Although the Codex Commission is an intergovernmental body, industry representatives may participate as observers, or even as members of national delegations. At a recent review of the standard for follow-up formula, industry lobbyists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9309967/" target="_blank">accounted for</a> over 40 percent of participants. For Rollins, this is the main reason why Codex standards – and by extension national laws – are less protective than WHO guidelines.</p>

                      <p>Our investigation shows that Nestlé uses aggressive marketing methods to promote Nido and Cerelac in low- and middle-income countries, despite the WHO’s International Code which <a href="https://www.who.int/tools/elena/interventions/regulation-breast-milk-substitutes" target="_blank">prohibits</a> the commercial promotion of such products. The Code, originally adopted in 1981 in the wake of the “baby killers” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nestle-baby-milk-scandal-food-industry-standards" target="_blank">scandal,</a> and clarified and strengthened by later Resolutions, bans all promotion of infant formula in order to protect breastfeeding. The ban also <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/260137/9789241513470-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">applies</a> to formulas for young children and baby foods that, like Cerelac, do not meet nutrition guidelines and contain “high levels of sugar”.</p>
                      <p>Nestlé responds that it “complies with the WHO Code and subsequent WHA resolutions as implemented by national governments everywhere in the world.” “Where local law is less stringent than our Policy for implementing the Code, we adhere to our strict Policy,” Nestlé adds.</p>
                      <p>In practice, while 70% of countries have adopted laws based on the Code, many contain loopholes and implementation is generally <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2023/06/20/default-calendar/global-congress-on-implementation-of-the-international-code-of-marketing-of-breast-milk-substitutes" target="_blank">weak</a> in low- and middle-income countries, often as a result of pressures from the baby-food industry and exporting countries. Furthermore, the Nestlé policy neither applies to formulas for children aged one year or more, nor to other baby foods, although these are all covered by the Code.</p>
                      <p>What’s more, Nestlé promotes its Nido and Cerelac products as healthy and essential for children’s development, although they contain added sugar and carry many risks for children’s health and development. “Often manufacturers’ health claims are not supported by the science,” says Rollins, in response to reading our report. “If you have a pharmaceutical product for which you want to claim that it improves brain development in babies, or improve growth in babies, you would have to pass very high standards of evidence,” he explains. “But because it’s a food, you don’t have to pass those standards.”</p>

                      <p>Nutrition and health claims “idealize the product, imply that it is better than family foods, and mask the risks,” the WHO <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/260137/9789241513470-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">explained</a> in a recent report that warns of baby-food marketing practices that compromise the progress made in infant and young-child nutrition. They mislead consumers as to the real content of these foods and should not be made, according to the UN agency. Yet Nestlé has made them a core pillar of its marketing strategy.</p>
                      <h2><strong>“Grow smart”</strong></h2>
                      <p>“Grow smart”. Huge billboards in the centre of Jakarta and other main Indonesian cities display the slogan. It’s at the heart of Nestlé’s campaign to promote its Nido brand, known in the country as Dancow, as the “parents’ partner for children’s growth and development”. “Inspired by mum’s love for baby nutrition, Dancow is the healthiest choice”, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DancowIndonesia/" target="_blank">claims</a> Nestlé, while failing to disclose that its product contains added sugar.</p>

                      <p>Last year, Nestlé launched a <a href="https://www.dancow.co.id/dpc/akudankausukadancow" target="_blank">campaign</a> aimed at “supporting the potential of children of 1 year and above in Indonesia”. The campaign managed to engage 2 million mothers in sharing “exciting moments” with their children on social media, effectively turning them into unpaid advertisers and brand ambassadors. “Thank you @dancow for accompanying my child’s growth and development,” writes one of the mothers.</p>
                      <p>Nestlé deploys the same, finely honed strategy in Brazil to promote its Cerelac (Mucilon) infant cereal brand. Its campaign is based on the concept of “nutrition enriched by Mucilon and chosen by mothers,” <a href="https://grandesnomesdapropaganda.com.br/anunciantes/nova-campanha-mostra-o-amor-dos-pais-e-a-nutricao-fortificada-por-tras-de-cada-colherada-de-mucilon/" target="_blank">muses</a> Dani Ribeiro, director of the advertising agency in charge. It plays on parents’ love for their babies, and highlights “the benefits of nutrients that contribute to babies’ immunity and brain development,” she explains. “Parents are nourished by the fact that they are making the right choice for their children,” Ribeiro adds.</p>

                      <p>Chris Van Tulleken, Professor at the University of London and author of the best-selling book <em>Ultra-Processed People</em>, which explores the pervasiveness and impact of ultra-processed food, is extremely concerned about the marketing strategy used by Nestlé. “These are not healthy products. They are not necessary. They are inferior to real food,” he stated. “These types of products are part of a global nutrition transition to an ultra-processed diet which is associated with weight gain and obesity, but also many other adverse health outcomes."</p>

                  </p>
                </div>

                      <p>Nestlé pioneered “medical marketing,” involving a set of techniques that have become standard practice in the industry today, says Phillip Baker, a senior research fellow at the University of Sydney in Australia and author of numerous studies on the subject. The strategy is based on strengthening links with health professionals and obtaining the endorsement of leading scientific authorities, while positioning the company as a partner for parents in the nutrition and development of their children.</p>
                      <p>While the main goal is to increase sales on the baby-food market itself, it plays another key role for Nestlé: developing loyal consumers for life. Baker describes it as a “cradle-to-grave marketing strategy.” “The idea being to get consumers from a very young age, develop that brand loyalty, develop those taste preferences for their products”, he explains.</p>
                      <p>Nestlé has created Baby and Me, an “educational platform” available in over 60 countries, with the stated aim of promoting healthy eating for babies and offering “expert-backed” information. Parents looking for information on infant nutrition may be directed to this platform and be exposed to content that steers them towards Nestlé products.</p>

                      <p>“Parenteam,” the Filipino version of the scheme, offers ovulation and pregnancy calendars as well as a due-date calculator. In South Africa, parents can access a “major moment checklist” to help them “win in every aspect of modern parenting”. Mexico has an allergy calculator and Brazil a guide to finding the perfect name. These websites are packed with advice, tools and recipes designed to attract parents. But ads for Nestlé products and “buy now” buttons are never far away.</p>
                      <h2><strong>Experts in white coats</strong></h2>
                      <p>Nestlé regularly organizes events on the Nido and Cerelac online channels with health professionals. Although most of the time the experts speak about child-nutrition related issues and do not directly promote the products, the Nido and Cerelac brands feature prominently, leading parents to believe that these products are endorsed by eminent scientific authorities and that Nestlé’s health and nutrition claims have scientific support.</p>
                      <p>Our investigation also uncovered cases of experts in white coats directly promoting Nestlé products. “Nido’s specialized nutrition system is designed to protect every stage of your child’s development,” explains nutritionist Kenia Lawrence in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2_ILm-rMhp/" target="_blank">video</a> posted on Instagram in Panama. “Nido1+ helps protect and strengthen the immune system, thanks to probiotics and prebiotics, and contains key nutrients for child development.” Not a word on the one and a half sugar cubes added to each portion of the product in question.</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>For Baker, it is evident that “by using health professionals, the companies powerfully shape parents’ decision making”. An influence that “can very often be harmful,” he believes. This practice also goes against WHO <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/374182/9789240084490-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">guidelines,</a> which state that manufacturers must not encourage healthcare professionals to support and recommend their brands and products.</p>
                      <p>In a <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/353604/9789240046085-eng.pdf?sequence=2" target="_blank">recent report,</a> the UN agency severely criticized the marketing practices used by the baby-food industry to promote its products online, pointing the finger at the use of various strategies that are often not identifiable as advertising. These include the use of baby-clubs, as well as the use of health professionals and influencers such as Meagan Adonis and Billy Saavedra. The UN agency <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-04-2022-who-reveals-shocking-extent-of-exploitative-formula-milk-marketing" target="_blank">called</a> on manufacturers to put an end to their “exploitative marketing practices”.</p>
                      <p>Nothing can justify the double standards highlighted by the Public Eye and IBFAN investigation. If Nestlé truly intends to act responsibly, it must follow the recommendations and guidelines of the WHO and stop getting babies and young children hooked on sugar, regardless of the country in which they were born.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

      
      <p>A possibly new algorithm for LLM Inference</p>
      <section>
        <p>
        With Effort you can adjust smoothly - and in real time - how many calculations you'd like to do during inference of an LLM model. 
        </p><p>
          At 50% calculations it is as fast as regular matrix multiplications on Apple Silicon chips. At 25% effort it's twice as fast and still retains most of the quality.
          </p><p>
            You can also freely choose to skip loading the least important weights.
          </p><p>
            It is implemented for Mistral now, it should work for all the other models just as well. No retraining needed, just conversion to a different format and some precomputation.

          </p><p>
          <img src="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ryc/ryc0.1.png">
</p><p>
You can download the implementation here - <a href="https://github.com/kolinko/effort">from Github</a>. It should run right after fetching the converted weights.
</p><p>
The implementation is done for FP16 only for now. The multiplications are fast, but inference overall is still slightly lacking because some non-essential parts - softmax etc - need improvement.

</p><p>Mixtral and Q8 are in the works. 
</p><p>
Oh, and it also allows to <b>dynamically decide how much of the model you want to load into the memory</b>. You can skip the least important 10-20-30% weights while loading. It doesn't require any conversion steps - it just loads less data. Sort of an ad-hoc distillation, you could say.
</p><p>
  Let's see it in action now.
  </p><figure id="demo">
 
  


The actual speed is constrained by the implementation overhead. Even on 0%, it still takes 15ms on my machine (and a few seconds on M1 Air) to produce a single token. These parts are done in &lt;1ms in Llama.cpp/Ollama, and I could use help from a Swift/Metal engineer to fix this.
</figure>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/kolinko/effort">You can download and test it yourself from Github.</a>
</p><p>
  Getting back to benchmarks...
</p><figure>
          <img src="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ryc/ryc0.2.png">

The pink line is actual speed, with a suboptimal implementation of the overhead (calculating norms, attn scores etc). There is a ~15ms overhead to every token that I didn't manage to fix, but Llama.cpp/Ollama/MLX don't seem to have. Help would be appreciated here from someone proficient in Metal/Swift.
</figure>
  <p>
  Let's talk quality now. 
  </p><p>
    First, of the multiplication approximation itself.
  </p><figure>
<img src="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ryc/ryc0.3.png">
Tracked by taking a sample input state vector, multiplying it by say wq, or w1. Some Matrixes seem to be easier to approximate using this method, some are slightly more difficult. But more or less the output looks like here.
  </figure>
  <p>
And now for the model itself.
</p><figure>
  <img src="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ryc/ryc0.4.png">
  Measured by generating a 500 token text first, and then comparing predictions of the tokens when this text would be given as an input. Perplexity score would be nice here, see notes at the end why it's not yet done.
</figure>
<p>
  And basic QA tests:
  </p><figure>
  <img src="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ryc/ryc0.5.png">
  BasicQ is a list of a few tricky QA prepared by GPT-4. Hopefully this and the working demo are enough to show the potential. Performing HumanEval and HellaSWAG needs fixes in the implementation first - see below.
</figure>
<p>
If you're still sceptical - as I would be - please head out to the <a href="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/pesky.html">Help Needed!</a> section to see what's needed for the better tests to be performed.
</p><p>
  The initial results (and undocumented experiments with Mixtral) seem to be robust enough to warrant publication. I hope though that the above is enough to convince you to <a href="https://github.com/kolinko/effort">play with the 0.0.1B version</a>.

Embeddings are just arrays of numbers, but they contain a compressed form of a considerable amount of human knowledge and shrink features that used to be substantial specialized projects into ones that individual product engineers can take on.</p><p>There are a ton of tooling options available to use embeddings. I’ll highlight our choices and note where you might want to make different ones for your situation.

Our project was Typescript through and through, and we used </span><a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-node?tab=readme-ov-file#drizzle-orm" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">drizzle-orm</a><span>. The docs will be a more robust place for setup documentation, so I’m leaving out that part to focus on the features you can build.</span></p><p>Once set up with pgvector, we created a strategy for encoding our icon data into vector embeddings. Embeddings are points in many-dimensional space, up to thousands of dimensions. Unfortunately, the axes of that grid are not humanly grokable ideas like “size” or “brightness.” They’re a bit of a black box. Luckily, like any good abstraction, they’re a black box with a good API.</p><p>The best practice seems to be finding the details that best represent what people want to search for and creating a function that outputs that as a string. Our icons can be a part of many use-case-based ‘categories’ and have many descriptive ‘tags’ associated with them. We encoded that information along with the icon name because that best represents what the icon is. Whereas the name of the icon set the icon belongs to, or its dimensions aren’t relevant. The strings we generated looked basically like this:</p><pre><code>const createIconEmbeddingsString = (icon) =&gt; `icon: "${icon.name}", categories: [${categories}] tags: [${tags}]`;</code></pre><p><span>Next, we chose an embedding model. </span><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OpenAI’s embedding models</a><span> will probably work just fine. We’re using their `text-embedding-3-small`. If you want to dive in, check out the </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">leaderboard</a><span> and pick the model that best meets your needs. Whether you use an embeddings API or self-host an open source option, the interface should be text in and embeddings out.</span></p><p><span>Many sites implement search, but most icon sites implement search by </span><a href="https://icon-sets.iconify.design/?query=woof" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">text</a><span> </span><a href="https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search/#q=woof" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">matching</a><span> or full-text search. If you’re looking for a dog icon, they search over the icon metadata for icons that have ‘dog’ in them. If they want to get </span><a href="https://fontawesome.com/search?q=woof&amp;o=r" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">craftier</a><span>, they come up with a bag of words related to ‘dog,’ like maybe ‘k9’, ‘puppy,’ and ‘woof’ to catch near misses. That’s pretty fragile. Someone has to choose tags for each icon; if they miss an important one, users won’t find what they’re looking for.</span></p><p><span>Our app gets relevant results when searching for ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?g=popularity&amp;q=dog&amp;qid=nmezx8efde3pvydym2f2sk9n" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">dog</a><span>.’ We also get solid results for ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?g=popularity&amp;q=puppy&amp;qid=v27kjdebk8ex7n30qe4b5tfs" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">puppy</a><span>’ without a bag of words by measuring the cosine similarity between the embeddings of your search query and each icon. There are multiple ways to measure how similar embeddings are to each other, but OpenAI’s embeddings are designed to work well with cosine distance. Cosine similarity is just the opposite of cosine distance. Order by cosine distance wherever you can to take advantage of </span><a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#why-isnt-a-query-using-an-index" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">indexes</a><span>.</span></p><pre><code>cosine_similarity(x,y) = 1 - cosine distance(x,y)</code></pre><p><span>You can even try dog breeds like ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?q=hound" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">hound</a><span>,’ ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?q=poodle" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">poodle</a><span>,’ or my favorite ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?q=samoyed" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">samoyed</a><span>.’ It pretty much just works. But that’s not all; it also works for other languages. Try ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?g=popularity&amp;q=chien&amp;qid=mcbp6rk9z3y8lb1emt1zblev" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">chien</a><span>’ and even ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?g=popularity&amp;q=%E7%8A%AC&amp;qid=hd8whx733f3rljhadasgfzb9" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">犬</a><span>’</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-143207380" href="https://bawolf.substack.com/p/embeddings-are-a-good-starting-point#footnote-1-143207380" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">1</a></span><span>! With pgvector, we can get these results with simple SQL queries.</span></p><pre><code>SELECT
  1 - cosine_distance (search_query.embedding,
    icon.embedding) as similarity,
  *
FROM
  icon
  join search_query on search_query.text = 'dog'
ORDER BY
  cosine_distance (search_query.embedding, icon.embedding) ASC
LIMIT 50;</code></pre><p>Since we’re ordering by distance, every search returns every result in the table in order of closeness. We cut off results by a fixed number to make this manageable, limiting the query to the top 50. Using an arbitrary distance cut-off is tempting, like querying for results with a cosine similarity of less than 0.8. Unfortunately, the absolute distance for one query to produce correct-feeling results might differ drastically from another. We limit by the number of results, not by a minimum value, whenever possible.</p><p><span>If we only wanted similarity search, any vector database would be fine, but Postgres allowed us to layer more features on top. The initial search looks across </span><em>all icons</em><span> in </span><em>all  icon sets</em><span>, but our user’s style might only match some of the icon sets. We can filter by values like in any other Postgres query.</span></p><pre><code>SELECT
  1 - cosine_distance (search_query.embedding,
    icon.embedding) AS similarity,
  *
FROM
  icon
  JOIN search_query ON search_query.text = 'dog'

WHERE
  icon_set.slug in('lucide', 'mdi')
ORDER BY
  cosine_distance (search_query.embedding,
    icon.embedding) ASC
LIMIT 50;</code></pre><p>This is deterministic; everyone searching for a ‘dog’ will get the same results. However, the inputs are still unbounded, so embedding search doesn’t guarantee that the best results will be produced for every input. We can try different embedding models or ways of encoding icons into embeddings to improve the system.</p><p>The embedding search usually puts the correct icon on the page, but the correct icon isn’t always the first result. We could make a simple algorithm that adjusts to user feedback and improves over time. To do this, we’d count every time a user clicks on an icon for a particular search query. When ranking search results, we’d create a score for each icon that combines the embedding search with the click data.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Here’s a simple ranking algorithm.

The algorithm might need tuning, but this is just an example of how the database handles the calculation nicely.</p><p>With a separate vector database, we might have to get values for all icons from both databases before comparing them in application code or making tradeoffs like pulling 100 results from the vector db and filtering the Postgres query for click score to those results or vice versa.

You may get some mileage using a wide range to avoid returning irrelevant long-tail results.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

They transform both speaker and hearer; they feed energy back and forth and amplify it. They feed understanding or emotion back and forth and amplify it,” Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in her exquisite manifesto for <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/10/21/telling-is-listening-ursula-k-le-guin-communication/">the magic of real human conversation</a>. Each word is a portable cathedral in which we clarify and sanctify our experience, a reliquary and a laboratory, holding the history of our search for meaning and the pliancy of the possible future, of there being richer and deeper dimensions of experience than those we name in our surface impressions. In the roots of words we find a portal to the mycelial web of invisible connections undergirding our emotional lives — the way “sadness” shares a Latin root with “sated” and originally meant a fulness of experience, the way “holy” shares a Latin root with “whole” and has its Indo-European origins in the notion of the interleaving of all things.</p>
<p>Because we know their power, we ask of words to hold what we cannot hold — the complexity of experience, the polyphony of voices inside us narrating that experience, the longing for clarity amid the confusion. There is, therefore, singular disorientation to those moments when they fail us — when these prefabricated containers of language turn out too small to contain emotions at once overwhelmingly expansive and acutely specific.</p>

<p>John Koenig offers a remedy for this lack in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Obscure-Sorrows-John-Koenig/dp/1501153641/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1285131339" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>) — a soulful invitation to “get to work redefining the world around us, until our language more closely matches the reality we experience.”</p>
<p>The title, though beautiful, is misleading — the emotional states Koenig defines are not obscure but, despite their specificity, profoundly relatable and universal; they are not sorrows but emissaries of <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/06/05/susan-cain-bittersweet/">the bittersweet</a>, with all its capacity for affirming the joy of being alive: <em>maru mori</em> (“the heartbreaking simplicity of ordinary things”), <em>apolytus</em> (“the moment you realize you are changing as a person, finally outgrowing your old problems like a reptile shedding its skin”), <em>the wends</em> (“the frustration that you’re not enjoying an experience as much as you should… as if your heart had been inadvertently demagnetized by a surge of expectations”), <em>anoscetia</em> (“the anxiety of not knowing ‘the real you'”), <em>dès vu</em> (“the awareness that this moment will become a memory”).</p>
<p>Koenig composites his imaginative etymologies from a multitude of sources: names and places from folklore and pop culture, terms from chemistry and astronomy, the existing lexicon of languages living and dead, from Latin and Ancient Greek to Japanese and Māori. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In language, all things are possible. Which means that no emotion is untranslatable. No sorrow is too obscure to define. We just have to do it.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Despite what dictionaries would have us believe, this world is still mostly undefined.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are various words addressing the maddening uncertainty of the two fundamental dimensions of human life: time and love.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ÉNOUEMENT</strong><br>
<em>n.</em> the bittersweetness of having arrived here in the future, finally learning the answers to how things turned out but being unable to tell your past self.</p>
<p>French <em>énouer</em>, to pluck defective bits from a stretch of cloth + <em>dénouement</em>, the final part of a story, in which all the threads of the plot are drawn together and everything is explained. Pronounced “ey-noo-mahn.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>QUERINOUS</strong><br>
<em>adj.</em> longing for a sense of certainty in a relationship; wishing there were some way to know ahead of time whether this is the person you’re going to wake up next to for twenty thousand mornings in a row, instead of having to count them out one by one, quietly hoping your streak continues.</p>
<p>Mandarin 确认 (<em>quèrèn</em>), confirmation. Twenty thousand days is roughly fifty-five years. Pronounced “kweh-ruh-nuhs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are words that reckon with the challenges of self-knowledge.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>AGNOSTHESIA</strong><br>
<em>n.</em> the state of not knowing how you really feel about something, which forces you to sift through clues hidden in your own behavior, as if you were some other person — noticing a twist of acid in your voice, an obscene amount of effort you put into something trifling, or an inexplicable weight on your shoulders that makes it difficult to get out of bed.</p>
<p>Ancient Greek ἄγνωστος (<em>ágnōstos</em>), not knowing + διάθεσις (<em>diáthesis</em>), condition, mood. Pronounced “ag-nos-thee-zhuh.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>ZIELSCHMERZ</strong><br>
<em>n.</em> the dread of finally pursuing a lifelong dream, which requires you to put your true abilities out there to be tested on the open savannah, no longer protected inside the terrarium of hopes and delusions that you started up in kindergarten and kept sealed as long as you could.</p>
<p>German <em>Ziel</em>, goal + <em>Schmerz</em>, pain. Pronounced “zeel-shmerts.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are words that anchor us in both the smallness and the grandeur of existence, its fierce fragility, its devastating beauty; words tasked with holding the hardest truth — that we are children of chance, born of a billion bright improbabilities that prevailed over the <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/07/25/richard-dawkins-death/">infinitely greater odds of nonexistence</a>, living with only marginal and mostly illusory control over the circumstances of our lives and other people’s choices, forever vulnerable to the accidents of a universe insentient to our hopes. </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>GALAGOG</strong><br>
<em>n.</em> the state of being simultaneously entranced and unsettled by the vastness of the cosmos, which makes your deepest concerns feel laughably quaint, yet vanishingly rare.</p>
<p>From galaxy, a gravitationally bound system of millions of stars + agog, awestruck. Pronounced “gal-uh-gawg.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>CRAXIS</strong><br>
<em>n.</em> the unease of knowing how quickly your circumstances could change on you—that no matter how carefully you shape your life into what you want it to be, the whole thing could be overturned in an instant, with little more than a single word, a single step, a phone call out of the blue, and by the end of next week you might already be looking back on this morning as if it were a million years ago, a poignant last hurrah of normal life.</p>
<p>Latin <em>crāstinō diē</em>, tomorrow + <em>praxis</em>, the process of turning theory into reality. Pronounced “krak-sis.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>SUERZA</strong><br>
<em>n.</em> a feeling of quiet amazement that you exist at all; a sense of gratitude that you were even born in the first place, that you somehow emerged alive and breathing despite all odds, having won an unbroken streak of reproductive lotteries that stretches all the way back to the beginning of life itself.</p>
<p>Spanish <em>suerte</em>, luck + <em>fuerza</em>, force. Pronounced “soo-wair-zuh.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>MAHPIOHANZIA</strong><br>
<em>n.</em> the frustration of being unable to fly, unable to stretch out your arms and vault into the air, having finally shrugged off the burden of your own weight, which you’ve been carrying your entire life without a second thought. </p>
<p>Lakota <em>mahpiohanzi</em>, “a shadow caused by a cloud.” Pronounced “mah-pee-oh-han-zee-uh.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emerging from the various entries is a reminder, both haunting and comforting, that despite how singular our experience feels, we are all grappling with just about the same core concerns; that our time is short and precious; that all of our confusions are a single question, the best answer to which is love. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Early last year, a twice-weekly newspaper in Park City, Utah, published <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/state-legislature-strips-land-use-authority-from-park-city-city-decries-overreach/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="article">a story</a> on the rejection of a state <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/sbillint/SB0271S01_ComparedWith_SB0271.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Utah bill revision">measure</a> that would’ve allowed tech billionaire Matthew Prince to build an 11,000-square-foot mansion on a hill with little say from locals.</p><p>It was the first time the Park Record had ever written about Prince’s mansion. And then something curious happened: The paper started covering Prince’s plans more regularly, and positively. In January, it reported on Prince describing his future home as “<a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/proposed-home-overlooking-old-town-will-be-something-to-be-proud-of-owner-says-planning-commission-prepares-for-hearing-possible-decision-in-february/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Proposed home overlooking Old Town will be ‘something to be proud of,’ owner says; Planning Commission prepares for hearing, possible decision in February">something to be proud of</a>.” Then it <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/planning-commission-takes-up-castle-on-hill/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="article">suggested</a> the city was putting Prince’s home through a longer review than normal because of his “celebrity nature.” A week later, it called out a local official for trying to “<a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/dissenting-planning-commissioner-rehashes-prince-proposal-at-session-to-ratify-edits-of-approval-conditions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Dissenting planning commissioner rehashes Prince proposal at session to ratify edits of approval conditions">re-legislate</a>” his project after it was approved.  </p><p>One major change had occurred at the Park Record between the time of that first story and the rest: Prince <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/tatiana-and-matthew-prince-set-to-acquire-the-143-year-old-park-record-newspaper/%23:~:text=The%20Princes%20are%20acquiring%20the,alike,%E2%80%9D%20said%20Tatiana%20Prince." rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="article">bought </a>the paper. And Don Rogers, the editor Prince <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/the-park-record-names-a-new-editor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Article on hiring">hired</a> to run it, is living rent-free in one of his properties at the moment. </p><p>Rogers says he doesn’t believe Prince’s ownership of the paper (or his current living arrangements) poses a conflict of interest. The Park Record identifies its owner in coverage. Even so, this arrangement is one of the multiple ways that Prince has irked some Park City denizens. They accuse him of steamrolling his way into a new sprawling home that would eclipse surrounding residences and challenge local height and size limits. They’ve painted him as a bully who turns petty when he doesn’t get his way. And at an April 30 review to consider an appeal of his project’s approval, they plan to fight back. </p><p>In Park City, “billionaires can’t just buy what they want,” said Jim Doilney, a resident and former city council member. </p><figure data-component="article-image"><figcaption data-component="caption" data-testid="caption"><span>The new family home billionaire Matthew Prince has proposed in Park City, Utah.</span><span>Source: Park City Planning Commission</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bruce Baird, an attorney for Prince, said he doesn’t agree with the characterization of Prince as a bully. If anything, he said, Prince is being bullied by his neighbors who are “trying to play the victim card.”</p><p>Prince, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Cloudflare Inc., a cybersecurity company valued at more than $30 billion, is certainly not the first tech billionaire to get into dust-ups with his neighbors. At a much grander scale, Salesforce Inc. CEO Marc Benioff has been buying tracts of land on Hawaii’s Big Island, raising <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-05/benioff-gives-150-million-to-hawaii-hospitals-after-buying-land" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Benioff Gives $150 Million to a Pair of Hawaii Hospitals (2)">concerns</a> from locals about property prices and local culture. Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison’s purchase of the Hawaiian island of Lanai <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-oracle-larry-ellison-lanai-hawaii-plans-tourism/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Larry Ellison’s Hawaii Paradise Is Infuriating Locals">infuriated</a> residents, who learned seemingly overnight that he’d become their boss, landlord, or both.</p><p>Prince’s own conflict with locals in Park City began after he bought a property on 220 King Road in late 2020 where he proposed to build a larger, taller home, a pool and “accessory” buildings. His new home would cut into a mountainside just beneath an open space that taxpayers had <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/park-city-completes-64-million-acquisition-of-treasure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="article">bought</a> for $64 million to fend off future development. </p><p>After many discussions of rules and regulations, city officials eventually cleared Prince’s plans. But a group of locals led by residents Eric and Susan Hermann have appealed, maintaining that his house would violate ordinances. </p><p>What has arguably bothered locals just as much as Prince’s project itself is how he’s gone about it. His failed effort to slip a bill through the state legislature — brought to light by the <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.sltrib.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Salt Lake Tribune</a> — was not well received. Nor was the way he tried to rally support.</p><p>At a Feb. 14 hearing, one of Prince’s supporters described himself as a neighbor but didn’t mention that he’d co-founded a tech company with Prince and had known him for years.  Prince submitted a letter of support for his plans signed on behalf of a neighboring property — a property that he himself owned. “It’s not uncommon for people to comment on public matters without revealing all relationships,” Baird said.</p><p>Shortly after the Hermanns appealed the city’s approval of the Prince house, Prince filed a complaint against their two Bernese Mountain dogs, Sasha and Mocha. He accused the dogs of chasing people and called for a ban against them on a nearby trail. He also sued the Hermanns over a rock wall between their properties.  “We are disappointed (albeit not surprised) that he would stoop to such tactics,’’ Eric Hermann said by email.</p><figure data-component="article-image"><figcaption data-component="caption" data-testid="caption"><span>Sasha and Mocha</span><span>Source: Susan Fredston-Hermann</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, “Save Sasha and Mocha” stickers are being distributed around town, and residents have flocked to the Instagram page of a local radio station to support the dogs. </p><p>“If it hadn't gotten to the stage where the Hermanns were doing what they're doing,” Baird said, “perhaps neighbors could have sat down and talked about it.”</p><p>In February, Prince’s Park Record newspaper published a letter to the editor from local freelance journalist Michelle Deininger, who criticized Prince’s plans and chastised the paper itself for its “one-sided” coverage. </p><p>“The Princes say their finished home will be “something to be proud of,”’ Deininger <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/opinion/letters-for-print/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Letter">wrote</a>. “But will anyone feel that way about the local paper by then?” </p><p>Alongside her letter, the Park Record ran three letters in support of the Prince house.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p><strong>(2005–2024)</strong></p><p>Established in 2005, initially for a 3-year period, the Future of Humanity Institute was a multidisciplinary research group at Oxford University.&nbsp; It was founded by Prof Nick Bostrom and brought together a select set of researchers from disciplines such as philosophy, computer science, mathematics, and economics to study big-picture questions for human civilization, attempting to shield them from ordinary academic pressures and create an organizational culture conducive to creativity and intellectual progress.</p><p>During its 19-year existence, the team at FHI made a series of research contributions that helped change our conversation about the future and contributed to the creation of several new fields and paradigms.&nbsp; FHI was involved in the germination of a wide range of ideas including existential risk, effective altruism, longtermism, AI alignment, AI governance, global catastrophic risk, grand futures, information hazards, the unilateralist’s curse, and moral uncertainty.&nbsp; It also did significant work on anthropics, human enhancement ethics, systemic risk modeling, forecasting and prediction markets, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and on the attributes and strategic implications of key future technologies.&nbsp; One major contribution was in showing that it was even possible to do rigorous research on big picture questions about humanity’s future.</p><p>Over time FHI faced increasing administrative headwinds within the Faculty of Philosophy (the Institute’s organizational home).&nbsp; Starting in 2020, the Faculty imposed a freeze on fundraising and hiring.&nbsp; In late 2023, the Faculty of Philosophy decided that the contracts of the remaining FHI staff would not be renewed.&nbsp; On 16 April 2024, the Institute was closed down.</p><p>Over the course of its nineteen years, FHI inspired the emergence of a vibrant ecosystem of organizations where the kinds of questions that FHI investigated can be explored.&nbsp; FHI alumni will continue to research these questions both within Oxford and at other places around the world.&nbsp; Topics that once struggled to eke out a precarious existence at the margins of a single philosophy department are now pursued by leading AI labs, government agencies, nonprofits, and specialized academic research centers (with many more in the process of creation).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev">https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40065821">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">libxev</h2><a id="user-content-libxev" aria-label="Permalink: libxev" href="#libxev"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">libxev is a cross-platform event loop. libxev provides a unified event loop
abstraction for non-blocking IO, timers, signals, events, and more that
works on macOS, Windows, Linux, and WebAssembly (browser and WASI). It is
written in <a href="https://ziglang.org/" rel="nofollow">Zig</a> but exports a C-compatible API (which
further makes it compatible with any language out there that can communicate
with C APIs).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Project Status: 🐲 Unstable, alpha-ish quality.</strong> The feature list is quite
good across multiple platforms, but there are plenty of missing features.
The project hasn't been well tested in real-world environments and there
are lots of low-hanging fruit for performance optimization. I'm not promising
any API compatibility at this point, either. If you want a production ready,
high quality, generalized event loop implementation check out
<a href="https://libuv.org/" rel="nofollow">libuv</a>, libev, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why a new event loop library?</strong> A few reasons. One, I think Zig lacks
a generalized event loop comparable to libuv in features ("generalized"
being a key word here). Two, I wanted to build a library like this around
the design patterns of <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/what_is_io_uring.html" rel="nofollow">io_uring</a>,
even mimicking its style on top of other OS primitives (
<a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/a-friendly-abstraction-over-iouring-and-kqueue/" rel="nofollow">credit to this awesome blog post</a>).
Three, I wanted an event loop library that could build to WebAssembly
(both WASI and freestanding) and that didn't really fit well
into the goals of API style of existing libraries without bringing in
something super heavy like Emscripten. The motivation for this library
primarily though is scratching my own itch!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Cross-platform.</strong> Linux (<code>io_uring</code> and <code>epoll</code>), macOS (<code>kqueue</code>),
WebAssembly + WASI (<code>poll_oneoff</code>, threaded and non-threaded runtimes).
(Windows support is planned and coming soon)</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactor_pattern" rel="nofollow">Proactor API</a>.</strong> Work
is submitted to the libxev event loop and the caller is notified of
work <em>completion</em>, as opposed to work <em>readiness</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Zero runtime allocations.</strong> This helps make runtime performance more
predictable and makes libxev well suited for embedded environments.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Timers, TCP, UDP, Files, Processes.</strong> High-level platform-agnostic APIs for
interacting with timers, TCP/UDP sockets, files, processes, and more. For
platforms that don't support async IO, the file operations are automatically
scheduled to a thread pool.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Generic Thread Pool (Optional).</strong> You can create a generic thread pool,
configure its resource utilization, and use this to perform custom background
tasks. The thread pool is used by some backends to do non-blocking tasks that
don't have reliable non-blocking APIs (such as local file operations with
<code>kqueue</code>). The thread pool can be shared across multiple threads and event
loops to optimize resource utilization.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Low-level and High-Level API.</strong> The high-level API is platform-agnostic
but has some  opinionated behavior and limited flexibility. The high-level
API is recommended but the low-level API is always an available escape hatch.
The low-level API is platform-specific and provides a mechanism for libxev
users to squeeze out maximum performance. The low-level API is <em>just enough
abstraction</em> above the OS interface to make it easier to use without
sacrificing noticable performance.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tree Shaking (Zig).</strong> This is a feature of Zig, but substantially benefits
libraries such as libxev. Zig will only include function calls and features
that you actually use. If you don't use a particular kind of high-level
watcher (such as UDP sockets), then the functionality related to that
abstraction is not compiled into your final binary at all. This lets libxev
support optional "nice-to-have" functionality that may be considered
"bloat" in some cases, but the end user doesn't have to pay for it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Dependency-free.</strong> libxev has no dependencies other than the built-in
OS APIs at runtime. The C library depends on libc. This makes it very
easy to cross-compile.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Roadmap</h3><a id="user-content-roadmap" aria-label="Permalink: Roadmap" href="#roadmap"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are plenty of missing features that I still want to add:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Pipe high-level API</li>
<li>Signal handlers</li>
<li>Filesystem events</li>
<li>Windows backend</li>
<li>Freestanding WebAssembly support via an external event loop (i.e. the browser)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And more...</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h3><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There is plenty of room for performance improvements, and I want to be
fully clear that I haven't done a lot of optimization work. Still,
performance is looking good. I've tried to port many of
<a href="https://github.com/libuv/libuv">libuv benchmarks</a> to use the libxev
API.</p>
<p dir="auto">I won't post specific benchmark results until I have a better
environment to run them in. As a <em>very broad generalization</em>,
you shouldn't notice a slowdown using libxev compared to other
major event loops. This may differ on a feature-by-feature basis, and
if you can show really poor performance in an issue I'm interested
in resolving it!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h2><a id="user-content-example" aria-label="Permalink: Example" href="#example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The example below shows an identical program written in Zig and in C
that uses libxev to run a single 5s timer. This is almost silly how
simple it is but is meant to just convey the overall feel of the library
rather than a practical use case.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2><a id="user-content-documentation" aria-label="Permalink: Documentation" href="#documentation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">🚧 Documentation is a work-in-progress. 🚧</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, documentation is available in three forms: <strong>man pages</strong>,
<strong>examples</strong>, and <strong>code comments.</strong> In the future, I plan on writing detailed
guides and API documentation in website form, but that isn't currently
available.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Man Pages</h3><a id="user-content-man-pages" aria-label="Permalink: Man Pages" href="#man-pages"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The man pages are relatively detailed! <code>xev(7)</code> will
give you a good overview of the entire library. <code>xev-zig(7)</code> and
<code>xev-c(7)</code> will provide overviews of the Zig and C API, respectively.
From there, API-specifc man pages such as <code>xev_loop_init(3)</code> are
available. This is the best documentation currently.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are multiple ways to browse the man pages. The most immediately friendly
is to just browse the raw man page sources in the <code>docs/</code> directory in
your web browser. The man page source is a <em>markdown-like</em> syntax so it
renders <em>okay</em> in your browser via GitHub.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another approach is to run <code>zig build -Dman-pages</code> and the man pages
will be available in <code>zig-out</code>. This requires
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc" rel="nofollow">scdoc</a>
to be installed (this is available in most package managers).
Once you've built the man pages, you can render them by path:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ man zig-out/share/man/man7/xev.7"><pre><code>$ man zig-out/share/man/man7/xev.7
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And the final approach is to install libxev via your favorite package
manager (if and when available), which should hopefully put your man pages
into your man path, so you can just do <code>man 7 xev</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h3><a id="user-content-examples" aria-label="Permalink: Examples" href="#examples"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are examples available in the <code>examples/</code> folder. The examples are
available in both C and Zig, and you can tell which one is which using
the file extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build an example, use the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ zig build -Dexample-name=_basic.zig
...
$ zig-out/bin/example-basic
..."><pre><code>$ zig build -Dexample-name=_basic.zig
...
$ zig-out/bin/example-basic
...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-Dexample-name</code> value should be the filename including the extension.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Code Comments</h3><a id="user-content-code-comments" aria-label="Permalink: Code Comments" href="#code-comments"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Zig code is well commented. If you're comfortable reading code comments
you can find a lot of insight within them. The source is in the <code>src/</code>
directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Build</h2><a id="user-content-build" aria-label="Permalink: Build" href="#build"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Build requires the installation of the latest <a href="https://ziglang.org/download/" rel="nofollow">Zig nightly</a>.
<strong>libxev has no other build dependencies.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Once installed, <code>zig build install</code> on its own will build the full library and output
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard" rel="nofollow">FHS-compatible</a>
directory in <code>zig-out</code>. You can customize the output directory with the
<code>--prefix</code> flag.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tests</h2><a id="user-content-tests" aria-label="Permalink: Tests" href="#tests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">libxev has a large and growing test suite. To run the tests for the current
platform:</p>

<p dir="auto">This will run all the tests for all the supported features for the current
host platform. For example, on Linux this will run both the full io_uring
and epoll test suite.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>You can build and run tests for other platforms</strong> by cross-compiling the
test executable, copying it to a target machine and executing it. For example,
the below shows how to cross-compile and build the tests for macOS from Linux:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-macos -Dinstall-tests
...

$ file zig-out/bin/xev-test
zig-out/bin/xev-test: Mach-O 64-bit arm64 executable"><pre>$ zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-macos -Dinstall-tests
...

$ file zig-out/bin/xev-test
zig-out/bin/xev-test: Mach-O 64-bit arm64 executable</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>WASI is a special-case.</strong> You can run tests for WASI if you have
<a href="https://wasmtime.dev/" rel="nofollow">wasmtime</a> installed:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ zig build test -Dtarget=wasm32-wasi -Dwasmtime
..."><pre><code>$ zig build test -Dtarget=wasm32-wasi -Dwasmtime
...
</code></pre></div>

They don't need to be engaged—they are fairly balanced. And they'd love to be challenged if working within the existing system wasn't so difficult. "I have my projects outside of work to be challenged; thank you very much." So, the normal playbook doesn't work. It feels condescending and paternalistic.</p><p><em>(Note: Before continuing, I want to note that skilled pragmatists often have the privilege of being ABLE to be somewhat detached yet still earn a living. Many people do not enjoy the privilege of fading into the background and are subject to much more scrutiny, stress, gaslighting, and doubt.)</em></p><p>Let's explore an example of a prototypical skilled pragmatist to make this real.</p><p>It is very clear to Maria that her team is spinning in circles. She watches with mild amusement as managers struggle in vain to push back on reactive feature requests. She's skilled and makes decent progress with the spaghetti codebase the team inherited, but she knows she could be a lot more productive.</p><p><span>At standups, Maria doesn't waste energy calling out things beyond her (and the team's) immediate control. Yes, software engineering is her passion, but she's not about to burn a lot of social capital by rocking the boat—she sees what happens to&nbsp;</span><em>those&nbsp;</em><span>people. She has some co-workers who have extremely strong careerist tendencies. In some cases, they game the performance management system to the Nth degree to the detriment of customer outcomes. She knows moving up takes a bit longer, but she has also had good luck shifting companies every couple of years to get a raise and promotion. It's almost like new hiring managers sense she has been under-utilized.</span></p><p>Maria is a skilled pragmatist. She is not a pushover or an underperformer. She is a human navigating the weird sociotechnical systems we call "Companies."</p><p>Here's the problem, however. Instead of figuring out how to tap into the incredible potential of the Maria's, companies:</p><ul><li><p>Hear the loud voices in the room, with strong opinions about what is broken. You are missing out on a whole source of information about how to fix the problem.</p></li><li><p>Focus on the obvious "poor performers". This is funny because you might have ~5% of employees who are low performers. Yet have 60-80% Marias.</p></li><li><p>Focus on rewarding 10x heroics and the cutthroat careerists</p></li><li><p>Incorrectly see the issue as an "engagement" problem.</p></li><li><p>Blame front-line managers for not engaging Maria when the issues exist elsewhere. Maria becomes a “management problem” vs. a leadership problem.</p></li><li><p>Diminish Maria's contributions because they are less visible and showy.</p></li><li><p>Promote people who actively poke and prod the system OR who are politically savvy enough to navigate the system—which has the byproduct of perpetuating whatever dysfunctions exist. Why change things when the people in power positions are adept at navigating things?</p></li></ul><p>Companies are doing layoffs when they are sitting on a goldmine of talent, motivation, and people who want to be challenged but aren't being challenged!</p><p>If you want a Part 2 here on how to solve this. Here are some closing thoughts for now.</p><p>I was thinking about what drew me to tech in the first place. Fun! How incredible is it to be paid to be a problem/puzzle solver and build/make things with other similarly curious people that can impact humans? That's incredible. Sometimes I have to pinch myself.</p><p>I've realized that one of my big triggers is incoherence, dissonance, and waste. Many companies are filled with talented people who love to solve problems, yet we're only scratching the surface regarding harnessing their potential.</p><p>And we make it SO HARD on ourselves. It is like we sabotage ourselves. I'm not sure why—maybe humans will be human, maybe it is power and money, maybe it is the natural entropy of companies and products—but many of the problems we face at work are very addressable. Yet, for whatever reason, it has to be difficult.</p><p>Or does it?</p><p>And with that…consider the untapped Maria potential in your company.</p><p><span>Update: I’ve written </span><a href="https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-272-the-biggest-opportunity-part" rel="">Part 2</a><span>.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

Part of that is imposing limits upon the government’s ability to collect and access them. That’s why it’s critical to reform Section 702, the mass surveillance law that creates an end run around our constitutional rights and a back door for the government to query our communications. In the last few weeks, there have been multiple attempts to reauthorize this power with varying levels of reform and compromise. Nearly half of the U.S. House of Representatives supported requiring the government to obtain court approval before accessing Americans’ communications in the government’s Section 702 databases—but at the last minute, the pro-mass surveillance side passed a bill which actually expands, rather than reforms these powers. That’s why we need you to tell the Senate to stop it!</p>

<p>What happened: Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is set to expire on April 19. The House of Representatives just passed the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act (RISAA), a reauthorization bill that greatly increases the scope of information the government can collect under Section 702 , and allows the government to use this unaccountable and out-of-control mass surveillance authority to spy on hopeful immigrants and asylum seekers. This move abandons any real argument that this is for terrorism or intelligence only.</p>

<p>The U.S. Senate will likely try to advance this terrible bill this week – a bill that Sen. Ron Wyden called “one of the most dramatic and terrifying expansions of government surveillance authority in history.” He’s right.</p>

<p>Tell your Senators to vote NO on the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act. Our call tool will make it easy for you to call your Senator—it only takes a moment.</p>

                <p>Section 702 allows the government to conduct surveillance of foreigners inside the United States. While Section 702  prohibits the NSA and FBI from intentionally targeting Americans, these agencies routinely acquire innocent Americans' communications “incidentally”. The government can then search Amercians’ “incidentally collected” communications, all without a probable cause warrant.</p>

<p>The government has repeatedly abused Section 702 by searching its databases for Americans’ communications. In 2021 alone, the FBI reported conducting up to 3.4 million warrantless searches of Section 702 data using Americans’ identifiers.</p>

<p>This loophole, and many other things, need to change before Congress acts to renew Section 702.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-node="14pvo7lhbrk6">
		
<p>This week we announced the retirement of our hydraulic Atlas and unveiled what comes next—a fully electric Atlas robot designed for real-world applications. The next generation of the Atlas program builds on decades of research and furthers our commitment to delivering the most capable, useful mobile robots solving the toughest challenges in industry today: with Spot, with Stretch, and now with Atlas.</p>



<p>A decade ago, we were one of the only companies putting real R&amp;D effort into <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/atlas">humanoid robots</a>. Now the landscape in the robotics industry is very different. Our customers have seen success with Spot and Stretch and they are eager to tackle the next challenge with Atlas. Given our track record of successful commercialization, we are confident in our plan to not just create an impressive R&amp;D project, but to deliver a valuable solution. </p>



<p>This journey will start with Hyundai—in addition to investing in us, the Hyundai team is building the next generation of automotive manufacturing capabilities, and it will serve as a perfect testing ground for new Atlas applications. In the months and years ahead, we’re excited to show what the world’s most dynamic humanoid robot can really do—in the lab, in the factory, and in our lives.</p>











<h2>The Journey with Atlas</h2>



<p>Having a meaningful impact outside of the lab requires collaboration beyond our walls. Following the commercial deployment of both Spot and Stretch, we know how to deliver real value for customers. Similar to our Stretch rollout, we will be partnering with a small group of innovative customers, beginning with Hyundai, to test and iterate Atlas applications over the next few years. This is the first look at a real product, but it certainly isn’t the last.</p>



<p>The electric version of Atlas will be stronger, with a broader range of motion than any of our previous generations. For example, our last generation hydraulic Atlas (HD Atlas) could already lift and maneuver a wide variety of heavy, irregular objects; we are continuing to build on those existing capabilities and are exploring several new gripper variations to meet a diverse set of expected manipulation needs in customer environments.</p>











<p>Moreover, a capable robot is only one of the pieces required for a successful commercial solution. Scaled <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/webinars/how-to-deploy-mobile-robots-for-industrial-inspection/">autonomous mobile robot deployments</a> are part of the broader digital transformation ecosystem, requiring IT infrastructure, employee buy-in, connectivity, workflows, safety standards, and operational processes for the robots and the data they generate and rely on. With over 1,500 deployments, Spot is already teaching hundreds of companies how to work alongside autonomous mobile robots. We believe that humanoids will be most effective if they are deployed with in-depth models of a facility and lots and lots of data about how it operates. You can start creating these types of digital twins with Spot today, using Spot, Stretch, and Boston Dynamics to facilitate this operational sea change for your organization.</p>



<p>And we are not just delivering industry-leading hardware. Some of our most exciting progress over the past couple of years has been in software. In addition to our decades of expertise in simulation and model predictive control, we have equipped our robots with new AI and machine learning tools, like <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/blog/starting-on-the-right-foot-with-reinforcement-learning/">reinforcement learning</a> and computer vision to ensure they can operate and adapt efficiently to complex real-world situations.</p>



<p>We also recently launched our <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/products/orbit/">Orbit™</a> software, which provides a centralized platform to manage your entire robot fleet, site maps, and digital transformation data. Today it’s available for Spot, but Stretch and Atlas will also be integrated into this enterprise solution. With a robust team of ML experts shaping our products, we are prepared to bring impactful AI to market immediately—we’ve already started with Spot, and it will get even better and faster with Atlas.</p>



<h2>The Role of a Humanoid Robot</h2>



<p>This latest iteration of the Atlas robot builds on a long <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/legacy">history of innovation</a> and R&amp;D pushing the limits of whole-body mobility and bimanual manipulation. From PETMAN testing protective clothing to the recently retired HD Atlas performing parkour, we have spent over a decade moving the state of the art forward with humanoid robotics.</p>



<p>Traditionally, we have focused on legged robots because we wanted to build robots that could balance and move dynamically—robots that could navigate unstructured, unknown, or antagonistic terrain with ease. The humanoid form factor is a useful design for robots working in a world designed for people.</p>



<p>However, that form factor doesn’t limit our vision of how a bipedal robot can move, what tools it needs to succeed, and how it can help people accomplish more. We designed the electric version of Atlas to be stronger, more dexterous, and more agile. Atlas may resemble a human form factor, but we are equipping the robot to move in the most efficient way possible to complete a task, rather than being constrained by a human range of motion. Atlas will move in ways that exceed human capabilities. Combining decades of practical experience with first principles thinking, we are confident in our ability to deliver a robot uniquely capable of tackling dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks in real applications.</p>



<p>Commercialization takes great engineering, but it also takes patience, imagination, and collaboration. Boston Dynamics has proven that we can deliver the full package with both industry-leading robotics and a complete ecosystem of software, services, and support to make robotics useful in the real world.</p>

<p>We discuss a recent (best-paper award) publication at ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA24) which gives a near-linear running time deterministic algorithm for the fundamental optimization problem of finding a minimum cut in weighted graphs.</p>

<div>
        <p data-block-key="ef8si">A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graph</a> is a ubiquitous data structure used in computer science that consists of nodes (or vertices) and edges between pairs of nodes to capture objects and their relations. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimum cut problem</a> (often referred to as “min-cut”) is a basic structural question about the connectivity of a graph that asks: what is the least expensive way to disconnect a network? More formally, given an input graph where edges have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(graph_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no orientation</a> (i.e., the graph is <i>undirected</i>) and are associated with positive weights quantifying the importance of the edges (e.g., capacity of a road, or strength of a relationship, level of similarity between the endpoints, etc.), a cut is a partition of the nodes into two sides. The size of a cut is the total weight of edges connecting nodes on different sides of the cut, and the min-cut problem is to find a cut of the minimum size.</p><p data-block-key="8gv1h">Solving it efficiently has been one of the most fundamental problems in algorithmic graph theory. Moreover, min-cut has diverse applications in practice such as image restoration, stereo and segmentation in computer vision, and network resilience analysis (such as for roads or power grids). It is also generally very useful when the underlying graph data is too large and needs to be partitioned into smaller components to be processed in a divide-and-conquer manner.</p><p data-block-key="20u0d">In the theory of algorithm design, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_computational_complexity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asymptotic complexity</a> for any problem that requires reading the entire input (which is the case for min-cut) is at least linear in the size of the input (since that is the time needed to read the input). A <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~gurevich/Opera/82.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly-linear time</a> algorithm essentially achieves this lower-bound, and thus is canonically viewed as the optimal result one can achieve. For the min-cut problem, existing nearly-linear time algorithms are either randomized (which may output an incorrect answer with some probability) or only work for the special case when the graph is <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SimpleGraph.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple</a> (which cannot model many real-world applications), so its optimal complexity remains an open problem.</p><p data-block-key="3mnj3">In “<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611977912.111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deterministic Near-Linear Time Minimum Cut in Weighted Graphs</a>”, which co-won the best paper award at the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (<a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SODA2024</a>), we design the first nearly-linear algorithm for the min-cut problem that is deterministic (i.e., always finds the correct answer) and that also works for general graphs, thus settling the optimal complexity for the min-cut problem.</p>

<div>
        <h2 data-block-key="ef8si">Technical insights</h2><p data-block-key="er3ve">Our result is the culmination of a long line of research, and algorithmic advances on this problem (including ours) are usually motivated by structural discoveries of graph connectivity. In particular, a seminal result by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/237814.237829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karger in 1996</a> gave a nearly-linear time randomized algorithm that finds a min-cut with high probability, and a critical insight from that work was the existence of a much smaller graph that largely preserves all cuts’ size. This is useful since one can afford to run a slower algorithm with the smaller graph as input, and the slower running time (in terms of the size of the smaller graph) can still be nearly-linear in the size of the original (larger) graph. Indeed, many of the structural discoveries on the min-cut problem are along this direction, and the high-level idea of reducing problem size while preserving structures of interest has been widely impactful in algorithm design.</p>

        <h2><span>Cut-preserving graph sparsification</span></h2>
<p><span>We start by discussing the structural insight used by Karger in more detail. Starting with a graph </span><span><em><span>G</span></em></span><span> with</span><em><span> <span>n</span></span></em><span> nodes, the cut-preserving sparsification by </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0207078.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Benzur and Karger</span></a><span> established the existence of a sparse </span><em><span>weighted</span></em><span> graph </span><em><span><span>G</span>’</span></em><span> on the same set of nodes with a smaller number of edges such that with high probability, every cut </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span>’s size in </span><em><span><span>G</span>’</span></em><span> is roughly the same as its size in </span><span><em><span>G</span></em></span><span>. This idea is illustrated below, where the original graph consists of two complete graphs connected by a single edge (i.e., the dumbbell graph), and the sparsified graph has fewer, but larger weight, edges, while all the cut sizes are approximately preserved. </span></p>

<div>
        
<p><span>To algorithmically construct such a sparser graph, Benzur and Karger used the approach of sampling edges independently, where each edge in </span><span><em><span>G</span></em></span><span> is included in </span><em><span><span>G</span>’</span></em><span> with some probability, and its weight in </span><em><span><span>G</span>’</span></em><span> is scaled up by the reciprocal of the sampling probability (e.g., an edge of original weight </span><span>1 </span><span>in </span><span><em><span>G</span></em></span><span> would have a weight of </span><span>10 </span><span>in </span><em><span><span>G</span>’</span></em><span> if it’s included with a </span><span>10%</span><span> chance). It turns out that with high probability, this remarkably simple (and nearly-linear time) method can successfully construct a cut-preserving graph sparsification.</span></p>
<p><span>The cut-preserving graph sparsification, along with several other creative algorithmic ideas, yielded Karger's breakthrough result. However, Karger’s algorithm is a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Monte Carlo algorithm</span></a><span>, i.e., the output may be incorrect with (small) probability, and there is no known way to tell if the output is correct other than comparing it with an actual known min-cut. Since then, researchers have been on the quest to resolve the open question of a nearly-linear time deterministic algorithm. In particular, the construction of the cut-preserving graph sparsification is the only component in Karger’s algorithm that is randomized, and an apparent recipe is to find a deterministic construction (a.k.a. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm#Derandomization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>derandomization</span></a><span>) of the sparsification in nearly-linear time.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2015, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5123.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Kawarabayashi and Thorup</span></a><span> achieved a major milestone with such a deterministic nearly-linear time algorithm for simple graphs, i.e., graphs that have at most one edge between every pair of nodes and all edge weights equal to </span><span>1</span><span>. The key observation in that work is a connection between min-cut and another important graph structure known as a low-conductance cut (explained below). This connection also turned out to be critical in later efforts to derandomize Karger’s algorithm on graphs of general edge weights, which eventually culminated in our result.</span></p>
    </div>

                
                


<div>
        <h2><span>Alignment of min-cut and low-conductance cut</span></h2>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductance_(graph)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>conductance</span></a><span> of a cut </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> is defined as the ratio of the cut size of </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> over the volume of </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> (assuming </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> is the smaller volume side of the cut and is non-empty), where the volume of </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> is the sum of the degree of the nodes in </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span>. A cut </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> of low conductance intuitively captures a bottleneck in a network, as there is only a small number of edges (relative to its volume) connecting </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> to the rest of the graph. The conductance of a graph is defined as the min conductance of any cut in the graph, and a graph of large conductance (a.k.a. an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>expander graph</span></a><span>) is considered well-connected as there is no bottleneck inside. </span></p>

<div>
        <p><span>Kawayabarashi and Thorup made the observation that any non-trivial (i.e., both sides have at least two nodes) min-cut must have low conductance in a simple graph where the min node degree is large. Following this observation, if one can partition the graph into well-connected clusters, the partitioning must be consistent with every non-trivial min-cut in the sense that each cluster must lie entirely on one side of every such cut. One can then contract each cluster into a single node, and work on the smaller graph where all non-trivial min-cuts of the original graph are intact.</span></p>
<p><span>However, for weighted graphs the same observation no longer holds, and the same partitioning used in the simple graph case may not be exactly consistent with non-trivial min-cuts. Nonetheless, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Li 2021</span></a><span> observed that such a partitioning is still approximately consistent with non-trivial min-cuts as illustrated in the figure below. In particular, for a non-trivial min-cut </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span>, there exists a cut </span><em><span><span>S</span>’</span></em><span> that is not too different from </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> such that </span><em><span><span>S</span>’</span></em><span> is consistent with the clusters. Li further observed that this property of the partitioning can be exploited to efficiently derandomize the construction of cut-preserving graph sparsification. </span></p>

    <p><span>In our new result, we devise an algorithm to construct such a partitioning tailored to our use case of finding min-cut. Compared to the more generic off-the-shelf method used by Li in the previous work, our tailored construction is much more precise, so that the original min-cut </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> and its corresponding cluster-consistent cut </span><em><span><span>S</span>’</span></em><span> (in the figure above) are guaranteed to have more similar cut sizes. Moreover, our algorithm is faster than off-the-shelf methods, which comes by improving previous clustering techniques developed solely for simple graphs (by </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Henzinger, Rao and Wang</span></a><span> in 2017) to work more broadly on weighted graphs. The stronger precision and running time guarantees achieved by the new construction ultimately lead to our nearly-linear time deterministic algorithm for the min-cut problem.</span></p>

<p>The LXQt team announces the release of LXQt 2.0.0, the Lightweight Qt Desktop Environment.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
  <li>LXQt 2.0.0 is based on Qt ≥ 6.6. For supporting styling and LXQt File Dialog with Qt5-based apps, <code>libqtxdg-3.12.0</code>, <code>lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1</code> and <code>libfm-qt-1.4.0</code> can be installed alongside their Qt6-based versions in LXQt 2.0.0.</li>
  <li>PCManFM-Qt’s desktop module, LXQt Runner and LXQt Desktop Notifications are completely ready to be used under Wayland compositors which support the “layer shell protocol”, like LabWC, Wayfire, kwin_wayland, Hyprland, Sway,…</li>
  <li>Wayland will be the main target for LXQt 2.1.0, as Qt6 was for LXQt 2.0.0. The components which are <em>not</em> ready for Wayland yet include ScreenGrab, LXQt Global Shortcuts, LXQt Panel’s task-bar and keyboard indicator (but LXQt Panel can be used under Wayland without those plugins), some input settings, and settings of monitor, power button, and screen locker. However, most Wayland compositors have tools that can be used instead of them, such that an LXQt-Wayland session is already possible for advanced users.</li>
  <li>LXQt Panel has a new default application menu called Fancy Menu, featuring “Favorites”, “All Applications”, and an improved search.</li>
  <li>QTerminal is the only app whose Qt6 port will be released separately – complications were encountered due to the removal of legacy encodings from Qt6. Until then, its Qt5 version 1.4.0 could be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE for Distros:</strong> For having Qt5 styling and Qt5 file dialog with LXQt 2.0.0, the installable packages of Qt5-based <code>lxqt-build-tools</code>, <code>libqtxdg</code>, <code>lxqt-qtplugin</code> and <code>libfm-qt</code> may need to be renamed, such that they can be installed in parallel with their Qt6 versions. Also, the point release of the Qt5-based <code>lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1</code> is needed for a correct Qt5 font setting (see its release note).</p>

<h3 id="libfm-qt--pcmanfm-qt">LibFM-Qt / PCManFM-Qt</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The desktop module is completely ready for Wayland, thanks to <code>layer-shell-qt6</code>. Now, PCManFM-Qt can give you a real desktop not only with desktop-agnostic X11 windows managers, but also with Wayland compositors which implement “layer shell protocol”, like those based on <code>wlroots</code> or KWin. Also, see <a href="https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/wiki#using-desktop-under-wayland">Using Desktop under Wayland</a> in Wiki.</li>
  <li>The MIME types of LXQt Archiver and Arqiver are updated in LibFM-Qt.</li>
  <li>Some menu icons are added.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lxqt-panel">LXQt Panel</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fancy Menu is added as the new default application menu. (The old menu is kept, but it is not the default menu anymore.)</li>
  <li>Wayland support is added for positioning the panel by using layer shell.</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous fixes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lxqt-runner">LXQt Runner</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Full Wayland support is added.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lxqt-desktop-notifications">LXQt Desktop Notifications</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Full Wayland support is added.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="release-notes">Release Notes</h2>

<p>Please see the release page of each LXQt component for its release note.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“A contract is only as good as the people who sign it,” was a saying often quoted by an elderly attorney I worked with for the first fifteen years of my practice and I always nodded in his general direction when he said that and smiled as if agreeing. I liked and respected him, he had won more cases than there were months in my life at the time and he had lived in a legal and business world in which the entire community knew one another and knew who to trust.</p>

<p>That world is long gone, with our population quadrupled in terms of business people and multiplied by ten in terms of attorneys practicing. The odds are good you now deal with strangers, know little about them, and simply cannot trust that the influence of the community will direct their actions.</p>

<p>But even in his smaller, kinder, world, I wondered how accurate his quotation was. Why bother with a contract, then, I always thought.&nbsp; Simply rely on people to do “the right thing.”&nbsp; Since that lawyer had written thousands of contracts, his actions belied his words.</p>

<p>When people are angels perhaps contracts will not be needed. That time is not now and any business which does not have its battery of contracts is not long for this world.</p>

<p>But it’s not just the contract that is useful for business-the very process of getting a contract can teach you a great deal about the person who you are thinking about joining in a business venture. Indeed, if done correctly, before you sign on the dotted line, the negotiation itself will tell you what is likely to happen.</p>

<p>As I saw with a doctor who now lives in Tuscany, in part because he and I learned all we needed to know about a man waving a million dollars in his face and begging him to take it.</p>

<p>The doctor turned him down cold and it was “the best deal he never made,” as he told me a year later.</p>

<p>Doctors are notoriously difficult for lawyers to work with…at least according to lawyers…who find that the doctor’s &nbsp;scientific background gives them little patience for the maneuvers and subtleties that mark the usual business negotiation. To many doctors, the answer to a legal or business question should be as straight forward as a simple diagnosis.</p>

<p>And as more and more doctors are forced to become business people, they confront more and more “grey” areas of business and employment law which are imposed upon their consciousness whether they like it or not. That doctor called it being forced to slide into the “…mire of complex chemical bonding of inarticulate and unintelligible legal jargon.” &nbsp;I didn’t argue when he said that because he was a genius and I had learned not to argue with a genius.</p>

<p>He was a research scientist who had invented a device that measured some microscopic part of one’s intestine that somehow was going to make him and his partners rich. At least that’s what he thought and since one of his partners knew a big time venture capitalist (“VC”) with a lot of successes to his name, that might just happen since he would have the capital to bring it to market.</p>

<p>But the problem was we had to negotiate how to get that VC into the company without giving the company away and the VC had a reputation for coming in with lots of money…then suing everyone in sight long enough that, broke and distraught, they threw the asset in his direction and gave up control of the product. One of my law partners called him the “’poison pill” of VCs since once you took him in, it was only a matter of time until your control of your company died. &nbsp;We needed his money and my task was to find a way to have the money but not the turmoil.</p>

<p>“You think he is trying to trap us like he did the others?” asked my doctor client.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. VCs get a bad rap no matter what they do. Inventors like you always blame them for coming in and trying to protect their investment by putting controls into the company. VCs always blame the inventors for thinking that because they can invent something, they can run a business. It’s hard to know what the guy is really all about.”</p>

<p>He was annoyed that I had hinted he was bad at business.&nbsp; He paused, then snapped, “So…test him.”</p>

<p>He had that exasperated look on his face he got whenever he was forced to say something that he considered self evident to us mere mortals. That always annoyed me and since we were old friends I let him see that.</p>

<p>“Right. &nbsp;Good idea. Written or oral?”</p>

<p>“Anything can be tested. That’s the nature of reality.&nbsp; There must be a relatively objective method available.”</p>

<p>Of course he had a point but I was curious to see what he thought would work.&nbsp; “Lie detector test? Perhaps we can torture him to get him to admit his motivations? I’m sure…”</p>

<p>“Not scientific,” broke in the doctor, not smiling. “Polygraphs seldom are reliable and torture is useless to find the truth. The subject merely tells you whatever you want to hear to stop the torture. No, use a scientific test for good faith. After. what, a thousand, five thousand contracts, you must have one. Use it.”</p>

<p>I stared at him and he stared right back. &nbsp;A long moment of silence. “You still don’t get that law is not medical research. There are no sure fire tests…No patented devices for honesty and integrity. Perhaps that could be your next invention…”</p>

<p>He pressed. “I do not believe that you have not developed a series of questions or methods by which to accurately gauge the good faith of a prospective investor and I suspect you are teasing me because you are annoyed with me.”&nbsp; He would talk like that, you see.&nbsp; Then he grinned.&nbsp; “I am told you are brilliant at this. This should give you an excellent opportunity to demonstrate it.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;Anyone calling me brilliant can mollify me so I explained, “There are some methods, some pretty good ones. &nbsp;But they are not objective, I suppose. We don’t put it into a test matrix, doctor. Besides, we have little bargaining position you tell me. We need his money. You only have one source now available. What do you do if he fails my test?”</p>

<p>He stood up, all five feet six of him, one finger in the air. “You find out if he is interested in working in good faith as a team or not. If the latter, the money I lose in rejecting him is trivial compared to the trouble I would have in accepting him. There are other sources of money out there…” He paused for effect “…but only one product that can do what this does.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course he was wrong in that, several other competing products came out a few years later….but he was dead right in that there are some pretty good tests that anyone can use to determine if a potential business partner is more interested in seizing power than sharing profits, as can be seen by what happened in this negotiation.</p>

<p>The VC never used a lawyer for the initial negotiations, only when it was time to close the deal and after ten minutes in the room, I could see why. This was during &nbsp;the High Tech boom times when wearing a suit and tie was considered an antique fashion and most of the young brilliants wore “Banana Republican” Khakis and pastel shirts, no tie, loafers. That is what I expected but he appeared in a conservative three piece business suit, horn rimmed glasses and reminded me of Clark Kent on a mission. Soft spoken, almost shy but clearly with an agenda.</p>

<p>And he knew his stuff. He had a scientific background, a sharp mind, and had done his homework. He had signed all the confidentiality agreements I had insisted upon without demur, without change, even agreeing to clauses prohibiting him from entering the particular medical field we were servicing if our deal did not go through. That surprised me. VCs don’t like to be restricted in such a broad fashion. But as I watched him work the doctor, I realized why. He had no intention of not buying the product and was convinced we would sell it to him since he was the only game in town.</p>

<p>The doctor liked him. They were both tech nerds, both loved the elegant simplicity of the device, both were happy it was going to make a huge difference in medicine, and neither was only in it for the money. I might as well have been in another building as they poured over the specs and discussed the European market. I let it go on for an hour then threw my monkey wrench into the love fest with my first question.</p>

<p>“How much will you put in for how much interest, Mr. Oswald (not his real name)?”</p>

<p>They both looked at me as if I had uttered a profanity. &nbsp;I smiled.&nbsp; “Sorry, but that’s what my job is, you know. Money and power. Unpleasant things but necessary to consider.”</p>

<p>Oswald paused a moment, then opened another file. “Our firm has standard criteria for determining how much to invest and when.”</p>

<p>“And those criteria indicate that you will put in a little money now, and only be obligated to invest more if certain milestones are met in a timely manner and if they are not met, you gain control of the company?”</p>

<p>He looked at me a moment, then smiled. “Of course. We do not write blank checks. But we are reasonable in those criteria. I can see your client owns a very valuable product and has done a great deal by taking it this far on the business plan. I am very impressed.” He looked at the doctor to show him he was impressed. The doctor looked back to show him he liked that.</p>

<p>“We are delighted you agree that we are well along in our plan,” I said, fiddling with my own papers, “and, of course, we need to know specific amounts and specific criteria in some detail. We are not interested in losing control because we are a few weeks late in the implementation of the business plan.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. You will find we are reasonable and I am talking about a million dollars upfront money right now…within two days of our execution of the documents…with an additional two million upon prototype being finished within six months and a final three million upon approval by governmental authorities. &nbsp;For twenty percent. That is quite reasonable, I believe. &nbsp;One seat on the board unless criteria are not met. Three seats on the board if criteria is not met after ninety additional days. And you will find our timelines are more conservative than yours. And the doctor remains CEO.”</p>

<p>I nodded but thought, “Until we blow a deadline. Which we will, business being what it is…and you get the control of the company ninety one days after that happens.” But what I said was, “That seems something we can use to start our discussions, certainly.”&nbsp; He nodded, realizing that the Dance of Negotiations had begun and waited for our counter. Instead, I used my first test.</p>

<p>“It is unusual to begin at the enforcement of contracts end of our discussions, I realize, but it is important for us to know if the document we eventually create is practical from our point of view.”&nbsp; He was a bit surprised and raised his eyebrows. I went on. “The best contract in the world is of no use to us if the expense to enforce it is beyond our capacity. And dangerous to us if our adversary has funds to enforce it and we do not.&nbsp; We like efficient and inexpensive methods for enforcement.”</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, considering. “You are speaking of arbitration, perhaps? Avoiding formal court and discovery and all that for a private judge?”</p>

<p>“Smart boy, “ I thought, and wondered how he would turn it down. I nodded.</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly. “We once thought that would be an excellent alternative to the law courts. It certainly had its advantages. Without depositions, without the need for long court law and motion matters, we did save tens of thousands.” He looked at the doctor, very sincere. “But we discovered why discovery and those formal court procedures exist. They exist for a reason, you know. That’s how you discover the truth.”</p>

<p>The doctor had immediately understood that he was witnessing the “test” he had asked for and, like any good scientist, did not interfere with the test in progress. He merely looked back, interested but noncommittal. Oswald saw that and turned back to me.</p>

<p>“We like to know what the other side is going to present and not be surprised at the hearing.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could agree with you…but that is a moot point. We can always agree in our arbitration agreement to allow depositions or other forms of discovery. Limit them to save expense, but allow critical discovery. So that’s no real problem, is it?”</p>

<p>He tried another approach. “No appeal. And the arbitrator is not even bound to follow the law. Is that not true?”</p>

<p>“Somewhat true. The Courts are lenient in overturning their decisions. Give the arbitrators great latitude.”</p>

<p>“Yes. &nbsp;Such laxity that in our case, despite the appellate court knowing that the arbitrator was wrong on the law, he still upheld the award. We were outraged.”</p>

<p>I bet you were, I thought. “That seems most unfortunate. But I have been in hundreds of arbitrations and that has never happened. Most arbitrators do their best to follow the law and apply it. I know of no exceptions. You must have been very unlucky.”</p>

<p>He said nothing, just watched me do my stuff.</p>

<p>I went on. “It’s simple, really, &nbsp;A small contract case will take two to three years and cost at least a hundred thousand dollars to try and there can be two more years of appeal. That same matter in arbitration would cost half as much and take six months. The odds of a bad arbitrator are really not much worse than the odds of a bad judge or jury, are they?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but we get full appeal rights in court. Almost none in arbitration. We just won’t go along with taking that chance again. That is a deal killer.” He watched me to see what I would do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I paused and did nothing waiting to see if he was firm. He said nothing, I still said nothing and the doctor looked at me to see if this test was enough to kill the deal.</p>

<p>It was not. Oswald had a good point and I knew plenty of very good attorneys and business people who hated arbitration, figuring that arbitrators, largely unafraid of the appellate courts, could be tyrants and dangerous and who wanted unlimited discovery so they would not be surprised by evidence at the arbitration.</p>

<p>But one could always put discovery into the arbitration clause if that was important and most arbitrators, including myself, were pretty good at following the law. Arbitration is not perfect. Neither are the courts. But we could afford arbitration and it was a real question if we could afford a real fight against such a well funded opponent if push came to shove. A contract without power to enforce it…is not worth the paper it is written on. I smiled as I thought that and the VC wondered what was going through my head.</p>

<p>What was going through my head was the real test I was planning to use now. And this test was the important one, the “acid test” and I went to it immediately.&nbsp; “Well, if we cannot use relatively inexpensive methods of enforcement, we can still avoid some of the problem by simply providing that the winning party in any dispute gets attorney fees from the losing party. Simple as that. It stops fights before they begin since both sides only go to court if they are convinced they will win.&nbsp; No insincere fights since if you lose you pay for your opponent’s attorney fees as well.”</p>

<p>And was the great equalizer as well.&nbsp; To win a fight and get a million dollars but spend two million to get it means you lost even if you won. A big budget opponent knows that and can destroy your case by simply forcing you to spend money. But if the winning side can get attorney fees from the other side…well, the cost benefit ratio then allows even the party with less money to take on a giant…if they are convinced they will win.</p>

<p>He tapped his fingers, face blank. I went on. “That’s the law in Germany and in quite a few European nations, you know. That’s one reason they have so little litigation. No nuisance suits. Here, as I am sure you know, in most cases you don’t get awarded attorneys fees if you win unless &nbsp;you put it in the contract. We almost always do that in our contracts.”</p>

<p>He sighed, glanced at the doctor, then answered, eyes on his file. “Well, that has not been our experience at all. Indeed, not. Indeed, attorney’s fees being awarded to the winning party encourages litigation in our experience.”</p>

<p>I leaned back in the chair. “Really? We seem to have a very different history. What would be the rationale for people starting nuisance actions if they knew they would not only pay their attorney but yours as well? One would expect that to be…a disincentive, no?”&nbsp; I wondered what nonsense he would develop.</p>

<p>“One would think so, but people are irrational. They think it will give them more when they win.”</p>

<p>“As it would. And if both sides think they will win, that is a fight that should go forward and the one that is right will be made whole. That seems only right to us.”</p>

<p>Another silence. In reality, we both knew what the real issue was. If he had a lot of money and our client did not, an attorneys fees clause such as we proposed would allow us to fight him if he started a suit just to force us to capitulate because the fees were so high. Any party really intending to work in good faith should have no hesitation in such an obviously useful clause-a clause that truly makes the wronged party whole if there is litigation.</p>

<p>“Anything that makes it easier to go to court hurts business relationships, “ he said to the doctor, “and this clause encourages people to take their chance in court rather than work out their differences.”</p>

<p>The doctor looked at me, saw my expression, and turned back to the VC. “Utter nonsense, Mr. Oswald, and I am upset that you think such weak arguments would sway me. Of course we must have an attorney fee shifting clause or I could never approach your litigation budget and you could use your in house staff of attack dogs to force me to accept any position you take.”</p>

<p>“Attack dogs? “ I asked, a little upset.</p>

<p>“Attack dogs?” Oswald said, equally upset.</p>

<p>“Present company excepted, of course,” went on the doctor, not even looking at me. “Mr. Oswald, I am not a nincompoop. I am aware that if you have a hand gun with bullets and I have a hand gun without bullets, that all your expressions of good will and interest in my project mean little for if we have a falling out, you will win. I see this clause as loading my gun…which neither will hopefully ever use. Please do not insult me by pretending otherwise.”</p>

<p>The doctor was outwardly calm but I could see he was inwardly furious. He felt he was being played for a fool, had been set up by the interest in his project shown by Oswald who was simply pulling a con job on him.&nbsp; I was not upset…this is all part of the game and any VC who did not bargain in this manner was not much of a VC. The doctor was new to this and still emotionally involved.</p>

<p>Oswald also saw the dynamics and tried to save the day. “Doctor we have a difference of opinion. This is not an insult, merely what allows fruitful negotiations.”</p>

<p>“Again, &nbsp;nonsense. If you treat me as a man of above average intelligence, you would have honestly stated that you, with more funds, wish to be able to bludgeon me into submission if we have a legal fight, knowing that I will never get back the fees I spend for my own legal counsel and that my only hope is to meet all criteria religiously. That is your actual position, is it not?”</p>

<p>Oswald was getting angry and I was seeing this negotiation collapse and was looking for a way to break into their argument. Oswald leaned forward. “Doctor, you invented a fine device. You know I like it. It is not proof of business acumen or negotiation skill.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly true, “I interjected, and gave the doctor a look telling him to shut up before Oswald walked.</p>

<p>The doctor leaned back in his chair, seeing that I wanted him to calm down, but before I could say something, looked at me and simply asked, “That is your test, correct?”</p>

<p>Silence in the room. Oswald, looking confused, was staring at me.</p>

<p>“Well…yes.”</p>

<p>“Then this is a waste of time since he has failed it. Let us end this now.”</p>

<p>Oswald could not believe it. &nbsp;He held up his file. “I have a million dollars in an account ready to be deposited into your company the moment we agree. Our terms are certainly within the range of your thinking are they not?</p>

<p>The doctor was already packing his briefcase. “Yes, they are. Not where we want them, but close enough.” Then he looked hard at Oswald. “But you are not, Mr. Oswald. In two ways. Counsel had one test to see if you wished power rather than cooperation and you failed that. But I had my own test. Would you equivocate why? I perhaps could work with a man of power interested in power if he was honest with me and we set the rules up clearly. But a man of power who does not tell me his true motivations? That is too much.”</p>

<p>And he left the room.</p>

<p>Oswald shook his head at me, slowly. “Your client is being very foolish, you know. I see it all the time. These scientists…”</p>

<p>Was he? Well, Oswald crushed the next two inventors he worked with…tossing them some money after he had pushed them out the door of their own companies. The doctor…well, he’s in Tuscany, though it took him an extra two years to raise the money. Two years in which his competitors almost beat him out.</p>

<p>And during that time I often asked him if he had second thoughts. He did not. “I may fail, but I will fail because my product or my business thinking is not good enough. I will not fail because my own backer stabs me in the back. I have no regrets.”</p>

<p>Well, he’s in Tuscany. I’m still here.</p>

<p>Doing my acid tests…</p>

      <section>
        <p>Gretchen shared with me an absolutely fascinating post on Reddit today: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fossils/comments/1c4hldl/found_a_mandible_in_the_travertin_floor_at_my/?ref=johnhawks.net" rel="noreferrer">“Found a mandible in the travertin floor at my parents house”</a>. The poster is a dentist and visited his parents house to see the new travertine they installed. It's no surprise that he recognized something right away: </p><figure><img src="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg" alt="A polished section of travertine rock with an obvious cross-section of a jawbone" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1674" srcset="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 1000w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 1600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w2400/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>This travertine would get the notice of any anthropologist. Photo: Reddit user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kidipadeli75/?ref=johnhawks.net"><span>Kidipadeli75</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>A section cut at a slight angle through a very humanlike jaw! I'm working in South Africa currently and I showed the image to some of our fossil preparation specialists today. Everybody agreed it is pretty cool! </p><p>The Reddit user who posted the story (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kidipadeli75/?ref=johnhawks.net">Kidipadeli75</a>) has followed up with some updates over the course of the day. The travertine was sourced in Turkey, and a close search of some of the other installed panels revealed some other interesting possible fossils, although none are as strikingly identifiable as the mandible. A number of professionals have reached out to offer assistance and I have no doubt that they will be able to learn a lot about the ancient person whose jaw ended up in this rock. </p><p>This naturally raises a broader question: How many other people have installed travertine with hominin fossils inside? </p><p>Travertine is a limestone that forms near natural springs. Spring water that emerges from lime-rich bedrock often carries a high concentration of dissolved calcium carbonate. When the water evaporates or cools—especially near hot springs—this calcium carbonate precipitates as rock and may form very large deposits around the spring. Travertine has an interesting internal texture when polished, and often has color bands and inclusions of calcite crystals, which make it an appealing choice for decorative flooring or wall covering. </p><p>Travertine also commonly includes fossils. Many are fossil inclusions of algae, plants, and small animals—especially molluscs and crustaceans—that live within the spring water. Much larger animals may be found and humans are no exceptions: Several well-known hominin fossil discoveries are from travertine deposits. Most of these discoveries have happened because of quarrying of the travertine deposits for use in construction. </p><p>For example, the Steinrinne site is on a terrace of the Wipper River near Bilzingsleben, Germany. The site was quarried from the Middle Ages onward into the twentieth century. Naturalists took notice of the fossils there in the nineteenth century, and straight-tusked elephants, woolly rhinos, and macaques all occur in great numbers, dating to an interglacial period sometime between 470,000 and 280,000 years ago. Many of the archaeological discoveries at the site were made by Dietrich Mania starting in 1969. Excavations since then have identified stone tools and many animal bones with cutmarks from ancient humans who butchered them—even stone handaxes made from elephant bone. </p><figure><img src="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1756" height="1042" srcset="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1000w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1756w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Bilzingsleben cranial reconstructions by Vlček. Photo from Landesmuseum fur Vorgeschichte Halle (Saale), Germany</span></figcaption></figure><p>Parts of at least two hominin skulls and a mandible were uncovered in the travertine during Mania's excavations. The remains were first studied by Emanuel Vlček, who created reconstructions of the two skulls. They have many similarities with <em>Homo erectus</em>, as Vlček emphasized, including the thick cranial bone, thick and pronounced browridges, and highly angled occipital bone at the back of the skull. Today's scientists, while recognizing these aspects, more often consider the skulls as representatives of an early Neandertal or related population, which sometimes is known as <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>. </p><p>Another fossil human was discovered in an even more dramatic way. In 2002, Mehmet Cihat Alcicek was examining fossils recovered from travertine quarries of the Denizli Basin of southwestern Turkey when he identified a cross-section of a hominin cranium. The upper and lower surfaces where the fossil was cut are well preserved, suggesting that more of the skull had likely been present but no more was found. Dating of the travertine by Anne-Marie Lebatard and collaborators in 2014 suggests that the individual lived sometime between 1.6 million and 1.2 million years ago. The quarry that produced the fossil is near the village of Kocabaş, and that is the name by which the fossil has been designated. </p><blockquote>“Given the nature of its discovery in a factory workshop, the hominin was unfortunately reduced to a standard rough-cut tile thickness of about 35 mm…” —John Kappelman and coworkers&nbsp;</blockquote><p>The shape of this portion of the Kocabaş skull and its thick supraorbital torus have led most researchers to identify it as a <em>Homo erectus</em> individual. The endocranial surface of the frontal bone has granular impressions that were initially suggested as possible evidence of tuberculosis infection. While this is still possible, later work suggested that these impressions may rather reflect a common condition in which the cranial bone remodels due to arachnoid cell growth.</p><p>The Kocabaş skull points to the most obvious question that Reddit posters shared: Why didn't anybody notice a human jaw in the travertine before it was installed in someone's house? </p><p>This question isn't so hard to answer. Quarries rough-cut travertine and other decorative stone into large panels, doing basic quality checks for gaps and large defects on the rough stone before polishing. Small defects and inclusions are the reason why people want travertine in the first place, so they don't merit special attention. Consumers who buy travertine usually browse samples in a showroom to choose the type of rock, and they don't see the actual panels or tile until installation. Tile or panels that are polished by machine and stacked in a workshop or factory for shipping are handled pretty quickly. </p><p>What this means is that there may be lots more hominin bones in people's floors and showers. </p><p>Most will be hard to recognize. Random cross-sections of hominin bones are tough to make out from other kinds of fossils without a lot of training. Noticing a fossil is not so hard, but I have to say that I've often been surprised at what the rest of a fossil looks like after skilled preparators painstakingly extract it from the surrounding rock. The ways that either nature or a masonry saw may slice a fossil don't correspond to an anatomy book, and a cross-section through part of a bone doesn't usually resemble an X-ray image of a whole bone. </p><p>Believe me, anthropologists don't want to hear about every blob of bone in your tile. Bones from other kinds of animals <strong>massively</strong> outnumber hominin bones in  large travertine deposits. Most tile and panels are cut thin enough that if a fossil not clearly identifiable from its exposed surface, the thin portion beneath the surface is not likely to identify it either. Nobody wants to drill into your shower wall on a wild goose chase. </p><p>But certainly somebody has more pieces of the mandible from the Reddit post, and more pieces of the Kocabaş individual are probably installed in hotel bathrooms all across Europe. If you take another look at your shower wall and suspect an ancient human is looking back at you, it might actually be one. </p><p>The broader point is that a lot of the archaeological and fossil record has emerged as a result of industrial processes and construction. Paleontologists are in an uneasy symbiosis with quarries. The work of the rockcutters exposes underground sections that scientists would never know for centuries, yet at the same time it destroys evidence that might be recovered with enough paleontological labor. It helps for workers to have some training to notice potentially interesting finds as they encounter them, and for paleontologists and archaeologists to be engaged with the industries and construction projects that often encounter ancient remains. </p><p>And if you do happen find a jawbone in your bathroom, my suggestion is first to contact the local authorities. Sure, a fossil in travertine likely comes from hundreds of thousands of years ago. It isn't a crime scene. But depending on your state or nation of residence, laws governing discovery of human remains on your property may be complicated and having the paperwork in order with the police, sheriff, or coroner is the first step for most investigations. </p><p>For myself, I'll be following the Reddit story with interest—I expect there will be many twists and turns in the story of this jawbone. With some teeth preserved and abundant surrounding rock, I expect that specialists will be able to learn a great deal about the life of this individual and when he or she lived. </p><p>Assuming, that is, the parents wouldn't rather keep it where it is installed now. </p><hr><p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> I've included some references for the Kocabaş and Bilzingsleben discoveries below. There is much more to say about both of them. Investigation of Middle Pleistocene and earlier travertine deposits is one of the most promising avenues to understand ancient environments in which human ancestors and relatives lived. </em></p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Kappelman, J., Alçiçek, M.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://european-pirateparty.eu/chatcontrol-eu-ministers-want-to-exempt-themselves/">https://european-pirateparty.eu/chatcontrol-eu-ministers-want-to-exempt-themselves/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40063025">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p>According to the latest draft text of the controversial <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-11-conseil-csam-compromis-9-avril.pdf">EU Child Sexual Abuse Regulation proposal </a>leaked by the French news organization Contexte, <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/179658/imfname_11360113.pdf">which the EU member states discussed</a>, the EU interior ministers want to exempt professional accounts of staff of intelligence agencies, police and military from the envisaged scanning of chats and messages (Article 1 (2a)). The regulation should also not apply to “confidential information” such as professional secrets (Article 1 (2b)). The EU governments reject the idea that the new EU Child Protection Centre should support them in the prevention of child sexual abuse and develop best practices for prevention initiatives (Article 43(8)).</p>
<p>“The fact that the EU interior ministers want to exempt police officers, soldiers, intelligence officers and even themselves from chat control scanning proves that they know exactly just how unreliable and dangerous the snooping algorithms are that they want to unleash on us citizens,” commented Pirate Party MEP Patrick Breyer. “They seem to fear that even military secrets without any link to child sexual abuse could end up in the US at any time. The confidentiality of government communications is certainly important, but the same must apply to the protection of business and of course citizens communications, including the spaces that victims of abuse themselves need for secure exchanges and therapy. We know that most of the chats leaked by today’s voluntary snooping algorithms are of no relevance to the police, for example family photos or consensual sexting. It is outrageous that the EU interior ministers themselves do not want to suffer the consequences of the destruction of digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption that they are imposing on us.”</p>
<p>“The promise that professional secrets should not be affected by chat control is a lie cast in paragraphs. No provider and no algorithm can know or determine whether a chat is being conducted with doctors, therapists, lawyers, defence lawyers, etc. so as to exempt it from chat control. Chat control inevitably threatens to leak intimate photos sent for medical purposes and trial documents sent for defending abuse victims.”</p>
<p>“It makes a mockery of the official goal of child protection that the EU interior ministers reject the development of best practices for preventing child sexual abuse. It couldn’t be clearer that the aim of this bill is China-style mass surveillance and not better protecting our children. Real child protection would require a systematic scientific evaluation and implementation of multidisciplinary prevention programmes, as well as Europe-wide standards and guidelines for criminal investigations into child abuse, including the identification of victims and the necessary technical means. None of this is planned by the EU interior ministers.”</p>
<p>The EU governments want to adopt the chat control bill by the beginning of June.</p>

<p><span><strong>Quick Note: I’m Going to CES and SPIE AR/VR/MR 2024</strong></span></p>



<p><span>Before getting to the article, I wanted my readers to know that I plan to attend CES from January 9th through the 12th. My schedule is just forming up as of this writing, so I currently have many time slots available. Most AR/VR/MR-specific companies exhibiting publicly will be in LVCC Central Hall or the Venetian like last year. While I am primarily there to meet with companies and see products, I always have some time to meet with blog fans.   </span></p>



<p><span>I will also attend the SPIE AR/MR/VR conference from January 29th through the 31st. It is much easier to meet at this conference as everything is in one building for the conference and exhibits. </span></p>



<p><span>If you want to meet up with me at either event, please email me at <strong>meet@kgontech.com</strong> </span></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Humane AI (<strong>Humane</strong>, hereafter) combines the mid-2010s failed concept of using a laser projector to project on the body with the early 2000s failed projector phone (something <a href="https://kguttag.com/2013/08/04/whatever-happened-to-pico-projectors-embedding-in-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote about in 2013</a>), only they left out the phone’s flat panel display and have more feeble processing than a good smartphone. Rational people wonder what this does that a good smartphone can’t do much better, and you can count me as one of these people. </p>

<p>This blog has been written about various laser projector scams since the beginning of 2011. Scammers like to associate “laser” with near-mystic powers that violate all the laws of physics and rational thought. The other favorite word to deceive people is “Hologram” (when they are not). The new favorite buzzword is “AI .” </p>



<p>It looks like Humane started with an abysmally poor-quality laser projector in a phone-like device, and by saying it does “AI,” it is magically something new. Their picture was good enough to raise $230 million from SK Networks (Korea), Microsoft, LG, Volvo, Qualcomm, Open AI founder Sam Alman, and others. Granted, with so many big-name companies, the stakes were chump change for each giant company giant, but it does show foolishness on a grand scale. </p>



<h2>Humane Adds AI to the Laser Projection (Hype Squared)</h2>



<p>At first glance, Human AI looks like it started with a monochrome laser projector, and realizing that that wouldn’t sell venture capital companies (VCs), they wrapped it in the current hype surrounding AI. Humane co-founders Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri (left) have the “Steve Jobs” black shirt costume down like other famous Silicon Valley scammers, Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, Sam Bankman-Fried founder of FTX, and Ronnie Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap. I have learned to be suspicious of the Steve Jobs pretender look through the years; it’s not a complete tell, but it should make you suspicious. </p>

<p>This blog has <a href="https://kguttag.com/?s=Laser+Projection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documented for over 12 years</a> how <strong>laser scanning is a terrible way to generate a display image</strong>. In short, <strong>the scanning process is too slow and inaccurate to generate a high-resolution image</strong>, and the lasers can’t be controlled fast and accurately enough to give good color depth, not to mention the poor power efficiency. </p>

<h3>The fundamental problems with pico projection include:</h3>



<p>1. <strong>Where will you project from?</strong> Humane’s “big concept” is that they will magnetically pin the projector to your shirt or jacket,  ignoring that it will sag a normal shirt and flop around as one moves. For the Humane’s introduction video, they pinned it on a heavy leather (or leather-like) jacket to give support (what do you do in the summer?).</p>

<p>2. <strong>What and where will you project on?</strong> Humane’s “big concept,” taken from laser projector scams of the past (more on this later), is to project on the skin. But the skin is a lousy, non-smooth projection screen with crevices and poor reflective qualities.  Worse yet, it <strong>requires a person to hold their hand up wherever the projector happens to be pointing</strong> as it flops around hanging on your “shirt.” Unlike a phone display, you can hold where you want or sit down. </p>



<p>3. <strong>Ambient light is the biggest killer for pico projectors due to the loss of contrast</strong>. Humane has not specified the projector’s brightness (in lumens), but it has a class 2 laser, so it can’t be that bright when projecting an image compared to the brightness of daylight. Humane demonstration videos are “staged” to put the hand’s projection surface in shadow or a dark environment. The Humane display is guaranteed to be invisible in outdoor daylight, about 100 times brighter than typical indoor lighting. Unlike flat panel displays that absorb ambient light, projection displays directly compete with it.</p>



<p>4. <strong>Humane’s projector lacks color and grayscale depth.</strong> Humane’s display a monochrome cyan (blue-green). There is no ability to even highly anything with color. Secondly, they demonstrated very limited grayscale depth; they showed just “on,” “off,” and a half-level. Even if grayscale is theoretically possible with the Humane projector, the ability fo see a grayscale image is severely hampered by using skin as a screen and the lack of contrast due to ambient light.  </p>



<p>5. <strong>Laser projection’s focus-free is a double-edged sword</strong>. While using laser scanning allows the projected image to be “focus-free,” it also means that the smallest objects blocking the projected image cast a harsh shadow blocking part of the image. </p>

<h3>Humane’s Poor Image Quality &amp; 720p Resolution Lie</h3>



<p>Human claims to have a 720p (1280 x 720 pixel) <strong>monochrome</strong> resolution. <strong>All laser projector resolution claims I have seen through the years lie about their resolution</strong>, typically by about 2x horizontally and vertically. But <strong>Humane seems to have topped them by claiming about 4x of the horizontal and vertical resolution they can deliver</strong>. A picture of a 502- x 410-pixel Apple Watch Ultra 2 is on the right. Humane’s image quality is worse than a cheap 1960s B&amp;W TV (see the series of pictures below).  </p>



<p>Humane’s website and other promotional material have a series of <strong>fake still images </strong>(“Photoshopped” images overlayed on hands). While even these pictures are pretty low-resolution (much less than a true 720p image), they turn out to be much better than what is seen in the videos of the Humane projector. I fear that AI will soon make it easy to make fake images and videos that are less obvious, but these fakes from Humane did not use its “AI” technology. </p>

<p>The images below are still frames from the Humane Introduction Video, “<a href="https://youtu.be/9lNIwOOMVHk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the Humane Ai Pin</a>.” In addition to the lower resolution and contrast than the fake stills above. Notice how the crevices in the skin break up the image and don’t just darken it. In the the third from the left still below, the hand has been turned upward, catching more light (but nothing compared to a bright room or sunlight); notice how the image looks even more faded due to the ambient light.</p>

<h3>But, but, but, it is all about voice recognition and speech.</h3>



<p>Voice recognition has been on smartphones for about a decade with Siri (2011) and Alexa (2014). People have all experienced the good and bad of voice input and output. Certainly, voice can be a good adjunct input, but it can also be very frustrating and difficult to correct when it does not understand you correctly. AI will likely improve the recognition, but it will not be perfect. In many situations, voice input is insecure, disruptive, and/or impractical (due to, say, noise or wind). What is one supposed to do with the Humane device in such situations? </p>



<p>Humane’s <a href="https://youtu.be/9lNIwOOMVHk">introduction video</a> was a fiasco in that it highlighted the combined voice and image recognition problems. The founders looked stilted, trying to time everything and speaking slowly with preplanned questions to the “AI engine,” and sometimes the device gave erroneous answers. When asked about the best place to see the next solar eclipse, it gave a location too far south, and when asked to estimate how much protein is in a small number of almonds, it said that “half a cup has 15 grams.” A spokesperson for Humane has responded that it got the date correct on the eclipse but that the location was a “bug” and that while the “AI” missed the question’s intent on the almonds, the answer was technically correct on the grams per cup. </p>



<p>The AI answered like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Clavin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cliff Clavin</a> (bar know-it-all from the TV series Cheers who constantly gave erroneous information but showed full confidence in what he was saying – <a href="https://youtu.be/k6GTZrcoWEM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example, video clip</a>). Apple uses “Siri” to trigger their audio response; maybe Humane could use “Cliff.” </p>

<p>Just for fun, I asked my iPhone’s Siri, “Where is the best place to watch the next solar eclipse?” and it came back with a series of links to articles (that included color pictures and maps) that I could scroll through on my phone but would never be able to read on Humane’s terrible display or would want read back to me. </p>



<p>In the real world, speech recognition is much more complex than Humane’s simplistic examples. The environment is going to be more complex and often noisy. When speaking, people are not careful to say each word clearly, particularly when they have to whisper to avoid disturbing the people around them too much. As has been widely discussed, AI will often answer questions with wrong information. </p>



<h2>Old Scam with Slightly New Twist</h2>



<p>Back in the days before Streaming, DVDs, and VHS tapes, the Disney company found they could rerelease their animated features every seven years, and a new generation of kids would think they were new. Disney then followed a similar pattern and put their VHS and later DVD releases in the “Disney Vault” between rereleases.</p>



<p>This pattern of letting memories fade away before reintroducing them as “new” also holds in high-tech. In 2016, this blog wrote about eyeHand in <a href="https://kguttag.com/2016/10/05/wrist-projector-scams-ritot-cicret-the-new-eyehand/">Wrist Projector Scams – Ritot, Cicret, the new eyeHand</a>. These companies showed some comically bad fake images that included “projecting black,” violating all laws of physics. </p>

<p>The scams by the small companies got big companies like Dell and Hilton to buy into the scammer’s marketing hype, and they released several “concept videos” seemingly based on these scams (see below from that <a href="https://kguttag.com/2016/10/05/wrist-projector-scams-ritot-cicret-the-new-eyehand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same article</a>).</p>

<p>In 2018, Haier and ASU revisited the concept (see <a href="https://kguttag.com/2018/02/17/2018-ces-haier-laser-projector-watch-wrist-projector-scams-revisited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2018 CES Haier Laser Projector Watch – (Wrist Projector Scams Revisited)</a>). Haier showed a prototype at CES 2018, enabling me to photograph the difference between the less obviously fake images and their real appearance (see article for more details). </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Once you get past the contrived demonstrations and crappy displays, Humane’s problem is convincing real people that what they have is better than a smartphone. A modern smartphone has a better onboard processor and, orders of magnitude, a better display, supports audio and video input, and can communicate with the internet for AI or related speech recognition and answers. A phone does not force one to wear clothes that will be able to support it or make me hold my hand out to see a crappy image. </p>



<p>Few will believe a startup company has better speech recognition and information database technology than Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other giant companies. If Humane really had better technology, why didn’t they release it as a software application rather than developing this terrible device? </p>



<p>Humane has no advantages and massive disadvantages compared to a smartphone, and it seems most people in technology have come to the same conclusion based on my reading of the responses. There are a few “everyone gets a trophy” and “anything is possible” people who have an open (or empty?) mind to this concept. </p>



<p>How so many business people could get their companies to fork over a combined $230M confounds me. I’m waiting for the AI program that can explain it . . . Not really; it is probably a combination of ego, unwillingness to do good due diligence, and fear of missing out (FOMO), all very human problems. These same “businesspeople” will run most startups through the wringer for a few million in VC money and then hold a cash bonfire with Humane AI and Magic Leap (<a href="https://kguttag.com/2020/05/03/magic-leap-starts-to-auger-in-with-3-7x-the-money-as-theranos-i-tried-to-warn-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another company that originally told investors that a key technology was laser projection</a>). Thankfully, at least this time, they are not stealing money from individuals on Kickstarter or Indigogo like Ritot, Cicret, and eyeHand did, even if the amount is two orders of magnitude higher. </p>
