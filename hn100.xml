<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">I think I’m probably going to lose quite a lot of money in the next year or two. It’s partly AI’s fault, but not
    mostly. Nonetheless I’m mostly going to write about AI, because it intersects the technosphere, where I’ve lived for
    decades.</p>

<p>I’ve given up having a regular job. The family still has income but mostly we’re harvesting our
    savings, built up over decades in a well-paid profession. Which means that we are, willy-nilly, investors. And thus aware of the
    fever-dream finance landscape that is InvestorWorld.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>The Larger Bubble</span> · 
Put in the simplest way: Things have been too good for too long in InvestorWorld: low interest, high profits, the unending rocket
    rise of the Big-Tech sector, now with AI afterburners. Wile E. Coyote hasn’t actually run off the edge of the cliff yet, but
    there are just way more ways for things to go wrong than right in the immediate future.</p>

<p>If you want to dive a little deeper, <cite>The Economist</cite> has a sharp (but
    paywalled) take in
    <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/25/stockmarkets-are-booming-but-the-good-times-are-unlikely-to-last">Stockmarkets
    are booming. But the good times are unlikely to last</a>. Their argument is that profits are overvalued by investors because, in
    recent years, they’ve always gone up. Mr Market ignores the fact that that at least some of those gleaming profits are artifacts of
    tax-slashing by right-wing governments.</p>

<p>That piece considers the observation that “Many investors hope that AI will ride to the rescue” and is politely
    skeptical.</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>Popping the bubble</span> · 
My own feelings aren’t polite; closer to
    <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yep-you-are-living-in-a-nvidia-led-tech-bubble-110014738.html">Yep, you are living in a
    Nvidia-led tech bubble</a> by Brian Sozzi over at Yahoo! Finance.</p>

<p>Sozzi is fair, pointing out that this bubble feels different from the cannabis and crypto crazes; among other things,
    chipmakers and cloud providers are reporting big high-margin revenues for real actual products. But he hammers the central point:
    What we’re seeing is FOMO-driven dumb money thrown at technology by people who have no hope of
    understanding it. Just because everybody else is and because the GPTs and image generators have cool demos.
    Sozzi has the numbers, looking at valuations through standard old-as-dirt filters and shaking his head at what he sees.</p>

<p>What’s going to happen, I’m pretty sure, is that AI/ML will, inevitably, disappoint; in the financial sense I mean, probably
    doing some useful things, maybe even a lot, but not generating the kind of profit explosions that you’d need to justify
    the bubble. So it’ll pop, and my bet it is takes a bunch of the finance world with it. As bad as 2008? Nobody knows, but it
    wouldn’t surprise me.</p>

<p>The rest of this piece considers the issues facing AI/ML,  with the goal of showing why I see it as
    a bubble-inflator and eventual bubble-popper.</p>

<p>First, a disclosure: I speak as an educated amateur. I’ve never gone much below the surface of the technology, never
    constructed a model or built model-processing software, or looked closely at the math.  But I think the discussion below still
    works.</p>

<p id="p-3"><span>What’s good about AI/ML</span> · 
Spoiler: I’m not the kind of burn-it-with-fire skeptic that I became around anything blockchain-flavored. It is clear
    that generative models manage to embed significant parts of the structure of language, of code, of pictures, of
    many things where that has previously not been the case. The understanding is sufficient to reliably accomplish the objective:
    <i>Produce plausible output</i>.</p>

<p>I’ve read enough Chomsky to believe that facility with language is a defining characteristic of intelligence. More than that, a
    necessary but not sufficient ingredient.  I dunno if anyone will build an AGI in my lifetime, but I am confident that the task
    would remain beyond reach without the functions offered by today’s generative models.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I’m super impressed by something nobody else seems to talk about: Prompt parsing. Obviously, prompts are
    processed into a representation that reliably sends the model-traversal logic down substantially the right
    paths. The LLMbots of this world may regularly be crazy and/or just wrong, but they do consistently if not correctly address the
    substance of the prompt.
    There is seriously good natural-language engineering going on here that AI’s critics aren’t paying enough attention
    to.</p>

<p>So I have no patience with those who scoff at today’s technology, accusing it being a glorified Markov chain. Like the
    song says:  Something’s
    happening here! (What it is ain’t exactly clear.)</p>

<p>It helps that in the late teens I saw neural-net pattern-matching at work on real-world problems from close up and
    developed serious respect for what that technology can do; An example is EC2’s
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/evaluating-predictive-scaling-for-amazon-ec2-capacity-optimization/">Predictive Auto
    Scaling</a> (and gosh, it looks like
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=predictive+auto+scaling&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">the competition has it
    too</a>).</p>

<p>And recently, Adobe Lightroom has shipped a pretty awesome “Select Sky” feature. It makes my M2 MacBook
    Pro think hard for a second or two, but I rarely see it miss even an isolated scrap of sky off in the corner of the frame.  It
    allows me, in a picture like this, to make the sky’s brightness echo the water’s.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/02/25/-big/PXL_20240111_213727870.jpg.html"><img alt="Brightly-lit boats on dark water under a dark sky" title="Brightly-lit boats on dark water under a dark sky" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/02/25/PXL_20240111_213727870.png"></a></p>
<p>And of course I’ve heard about success stories in radiology and other disciplines.</p>

<p>Thus, please don’t call me an “AI skeptic” or some such. There is a there there.</p>

<p id="p-4"><span>But…</span> · 
Given that, why do I still think that the flood of money being thrown at this tech is dumb, and that most of it will be lost?
    Partly just because of that flood. When financial decision makers throw loads of money at things they don’t
    understand, lots of it is <em>always</em> lost.</p>

<p>In the Venture-Capital business, that’s an understood part of the business
    cycle; they’re looking to balance that out with a small number of 10x startup wins.
    But when big old insurance companies and airlines and so on are piling in and releasing effusive statements about building
    the company around some new tech voodoo, the outcome, in my experience, is very rarely good.</p>

<p>But let’s be specific.</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>Meaning</span> · 
As I said above, I think the human mind has a large and important language-processing system.  But that’s not all. It’s also
    a (slow, poorly-understood) computer, with access to a medium-large database of facts and recollections, an ultra-slow numeric
    processor, and a facilities for estimation, prediction, speculation, and invention. Let’s group all this stuff together and call
    it “meaning”.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.463.pdf">Climbing towards NLU:
    On Meaning, Form, and Understanding in the Age of Data</a> by Emily Bender and Alexander Koller (July 2000). I don’t agree with
    all of it, and it addresses an earlier generation of generative models, but it’s very thought-provoking. It postulates the
    “Octopus Test”, a good variation on the bad old Chinese-Room analogy. It talks usefully about how human language acquisition
    works. A couple of quotes: “It is instructive to look at the past to appreciate this question. Computational linguistics has
    gone through many fashion cycles over the course of its history” and “In this paper, we have argued that in contrast to some
    current hype, meaning cannot be learned from form alone.”</p>

<p>I’m not saying these problems can’t be solved. Software systems can be equipped with databases of facts, and who knows,
    perhaps some day estimation, prediction, speculation, and invention. But it’s not going to be easy.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>Difficulty</span> · 
I think there’s a useful analogy between the stories AI and of self-driving cars. As I write this, 
    Apple has apparently decided that 
    <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/after-a-decade-of-stops-and-starts-apple-kills-its-electric-car-project">generative 
    AI is easier than shipping an autonomous car</a>. I’m particularly sensitive to this analogy because back around 2010, as the
    first self-driving prototypes were coming into view, I predicted, loudly and in public, that this technology was about to become
    ubiquitous and turn the economy inside out. Ouch.</p>

<p>There’s a pattern: The technologies that really do change the world tend to have strings of successes, producing obvious
    benefits even in their earliest forms, to the extent that geeks load them in the back floor of organizations just to get shit
    done. As they say, “The CIO is the last to know.”</p>

<p>Contrast cryptocurrencies and blockchains, which limped along from year to year, always promising a brilliant future, never
    doing anything useful.  As to the usefulness of self-driving technology, I still think it’s gonna get there, but it’s surrounded
    by a cloud of litigation.</p>

<p>Anyhow, anybody who thinks that it’ll be easy to teach “meaning” (as I described it above) to today’s generative AI is a fool,
    and you shouldn’t give them your money.</p>

<p id="p-6"><span>Money and carbon</span> · 
Another big problem we’re not talking about enough is the cost of generative AI.
    <cite>Nature</cite> offers    
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x">Generative AI’s environmental costs are soaring — and mostly
    secret</a>. In a Mastodon thread,
    <a href="https://phanpy.social/#/social.v.st/a/109360452395342558">@Quixoticgeek@social.v.st</a> says 
    <a href="https://phanpy.social/#/social.v.st/s/111991430750212364">We need to talk about data centres</a>, and includes a few
    hard and sobering numbers.</p>

<p>Short form: This shit is <em>expensive</em>, in dollars and in carbon load. Nvidia pulled in
    <a href="https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2024/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2024/">$60.9
    billion in 2023, up 126% from the previous year</a>, and is heading for a $100B/year run rate, while reporting a 75% margin.</p>

<p>Another thing these articles <em>don’t</em> mention is that building, deploying, and running generative-AI systems requires significant
    effort from a small group of people who now apparently constitute the world’s highest-paid cadre of engineers. And good luck
    trying to hire one if you’re a mainstream company where IT is a cost center.</p>

<p>All this means that for the technology to succeed, it not only has to do something useful, but people and businesses will have to
    be ready to pay a significantly high price for that something.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that there’s nothing that qualifies, but I am betting that it’s not in ad-supported territory.</p>

<p>Also, it’s going to have to deal with pushback from unreasonable climate-change resisters like, for example, me.</p>

<p id="p-8"><span>Anyhow…</span> · 
I kind of flipped out, and was motivated to finish this blog piece, when I saw
    <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-government-wants-to-use-ai-to-cut-civil-service-jobs-140031159.html">this</a>: “UK
    government wants to use AI to cut civil service jobs: Yes, you read that right.” The idea<span> —</span> to have
    citizen input processed and responded to by an LLM<span> —</span> is hideously toxic and broken; and usefully
    reveals the kind of thinking that makes morally crippled leaders all across our system love this technology.</p>

<p>The road ahead looks bumpy from where I sit. And when the business community wakes up and realizes that replacing
    people with shitty technology doesn’t show up as a positive on the financials after you factor in the consequences of customer
    rage, that’s when the hot air gushes out of the bubble.</p>

<p>It might not take big chunks of InvestorWorld with it. But I’m betting it does.</p>

<!-- cache hit 2:single/related:4ccc423290dac7d71f6097dc34e9eb05 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Today, Ford electric vehicles gained access to the Tesla Supercharger network. Last&nbsp;May, the Blue Oval was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/ford-evs-will-get-access-to-teslas-supercharger-network-in-2024/">the first automaker to throw its lot in</a> with what was then called the North American Charging Standard and is now known as J3400. Ford proved to be the first domino falling, and with Stellantis' announcement <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/stellantis-will-finally-adopt-tesla-style-fast-charger-plug/">earlier this month</a> that it too would move to J3400, the more compact DC fast-charging plug will be the de facto standard in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Until Ford made the switch, every non-Tesla EV in North America had settled on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/">Combined Charging Standard 1</a> plug (with the exception of the Nissan Leaf, which still uses CHAdeMO). CCS1 and J3400 use the same electronic communication protocols—only the actual plug and socket are different.</p>
<p>But it will take some time for car makers to start building J3400 ports into their EVs. That should begin next year, probably with the introduction of model year 2026. This means that EVs older than MY26 will need to use a passive adapter to mate a J3400 charger cable with a CCS1-equipped EV.</p>
<p>Ford is making the adapter available for free for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/revisiting-the-ford-mustang-mach-e-hows-the-pony-ev-doing-3-years-later/">Mustang Mach-E</a> and F-150 Lightning owners as long as they order one by June 30 of this year. After that date, the adapter will cost $230. Ford says that Ford Pro fleet customers can also order a complimentary adapter for their EV (which includes the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/weve-driven-fords-other-electric-workhorse-the-2022-e-transit/">E-Transit</a> as well as the Mach-E and Lightning) by contacting their Ford Pro account manager. (Ford Pro will also contact fleet owners by mail in the coming weeks.)</p>

<p>Ford EVs already use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15118">ISO 15118</a> "plug and charge" protocol, which means they give the charger their billing details as part of the electronic handshake, obviating the need to use an app or credit card to start a charging session. And more than 15,000 Tesla chargers will now show up in the BlueOval charge network, which customers can navigate to via the FordPass smartphone app or the Charge Assist app on their infotainment systems.</p>
<p>Ford EVs aren't compatible with every Tesla Supercharger, however. They must be the more recent units, which are able to charge at up to 250 kW, identified by a black collar at the base of the charging plug. Older chargers, which can only charge at up to 150 kW, have a silver collar instead. Since these older chargers won't appear in the FordPass or ChargeAssist apps, it seems prudent for Ford EV drivers to use either of those to find a suitable charger location.</p>
<p>And the adapter is only for DC fast charging, not for Tesla's AC destination chargers. (Ford's plug-in hybrids are only capable of AC charging, and there is no need for them to have access to an adapter, so they will never be able to use a Supercharger.)</p>
<p>I don't imagine an Ars Technica reader having much trouble with fitting the J3400 adapter, but for people with less dongle experience, Ford has <a href="https://www.ford.com/support/how-tos/electric-vehicles/public-charging/how-do-i-use-the-fast-charging-adapter-nacs/">produced a short tutorial film</a>. Perhaps the only potential pain point will be unplugging one's EV and driving off without the adapter—a $230 lesson to learn—but since the Tesla cable needs to be put back in its holster, even that seems pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>"This move will improve the public charging experience by giving our customers even more choice and is a vital part of our growth as an EV brand," said Ford President and CEO Jim Farley.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>This is the story of how <a href="https://twitter.com/utaal">Andrea Lattuada</a> (PhD student at ETH Zurich) and <a href="https://twitter.com/bitshiftmask">James Munns</a> (from Ferrous Systems) designed and implemented (two versions!) of an high-perf lock-free ring-buffer for cross-thread communication. If any of those words look scary to you, don't fret, we'll explain everything from the basics.</p>

<p><em>This post is cross-posted on Andrea Lattuada's <a href="http://andrea.lattuada.me/blog/2019/the-design-and-implementation-of-a-lock-free-ring-buffer-with-contiguous-reservations.html">blog</a>.</em></p>

<p>This post is for you if you're interested in (safe!) concurrency, systems programming, and cool ways to write efficient systems software. If you've never written a thread-safe data structure, this post may be a great way to get started!</p>

<h2 id="circular-buffers">Circular buffers</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3479/The-Bip-Buffer-The-Circular-Buffer-with-a-Twist"><em>BipBuffer</em></a> is a bi-partite circular buffer that always supports writing a contiguous chunk of data, instead of potentially splitting a write in two chunks when it straddles the buffer's boundaries.</p>

<p>Circular buffers are a common primitive for asynchronous (inter- or intra- thread) communication. Let's start with a very abstract, idealised view of the circular buffer interface, and then consider real-world constraints one by one, till we get to the <em>BipBuffer</em> design.</p>

<h3 id="an-idealised-infinite-buffer">An idealised infinite buffer</h3>

<p>A writer (producer) and a reader (consumer) want to communicate, and have access to the same, contiguous, and infinite array. They both keep a bookmark of which part of the array they've (respectively) written and read. They start with these <code>write</code> and <code>read</code> pointers aligned.</p>

<p>When the writer wants to send data, it appends it after the <code>write</code> pointer and then moves the pointer to the end of the newly written chunk. The reader inspects the <code>write</code> pointer at its leisure (asynchronously). When the <code>write</code> pointer has advanced further than the <code>read</code> pointer, the reader can consume and act on the available data. Once that's done, it moves the <code>read</code> pointer forwards to keep track of which part of the buffer it has already processed.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jncR6qd.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The reader will never attempt to read past the <code>write</code> pointer, because there's no guarantee there's valid data there (i.e. that the writer has put anything there). This also means that the <code>read</code> pointer can never overtake <code>write</code>. For now, we're assuming an ideal memory system that's always coherent and where writes are visible immediately and sequentially.</p>

<h3 id="a-bounded-circular-buffer">A bounded circular buffer</h3>

<p>Computers don't have magic infinite buffers. We have to allocate a finite amount of memory to use for potentially infinite communication between the writer and reader. In a circular buffer, the <code>write</code> pointer can wrap around the boundaries of the buffer when it reaches the end.</p>

<p>When new data arrives and the <code>write</code> pointer is close to the end, it splits the write in two chunks: one for the remaining buffer space at the end, and one for the remaining data at the beginning. Note that, if the <code>read</code> pointer is still close to the beginning, this has the potential of clobbering data that hasn't yet been processed by the reader. For this reason, the <code>write</code> pointer is not allowed to overtake <code>read</code> after it has wrapped around.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zfwNfD0.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We end up with two possible memory configurations:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>write</code> leads and <code>read</code> follows (<code>write</code> ≥ <code>read</code>), the valid data (written, but not yet processed by the reader) is in the section of the buffer after <code>read</code> and before <code>write</code>;</li>
  <li><code>read</code> leads and <code>write</code> follows (<code>read</code> &gt; <code>write</code>), the valid data is after <code>read</code>, till the end, and from the start of the buffer till <code>write</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that we disallow <code>read</code> == <code>write</code> in the second case, as this would be ambiguous: while <code>read</code> can catch up to <code>write</code>, after a wraparound <code>write</code> has to stay one step behind <code>read</code> to indicate that we're in case 2 instead of case 1.</p>

<p>We repeatedly move from configuration 1 to 2, then back to 1: when <code>read</code> reaches the end of the buffer, it can also wrap around to continue reading at the start.</p>

<h3 id="contiguous-writesreads">Contiguous writes/reads</h3>

<p>This is all great, but what if we have chunks of data that should remain contiguous in memory when written to the buffer? Look here, there's a new message to be written, but it doesn't fit in the remaining buffer space after <code>write</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/szHSC8M.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If, for whatever reason, we aren't allowed to split this write in two, we're stuck. Maybe we can just wait for <code>read</code> to move forwards, and place our new data in a single chunk at the start of the buffer? Well, in fact, yea. But there's a caveat.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lb8C3sq.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We've broken the property in configuration 2 earlier: there's a section of the buffer that's between <code>read</code> and the end of the buffer, but doesn't contain any valid data. If we didn't do anything about it, the reader would keep consuming data, moving <code>read</code> forwards, and it would be oblivious to the fact that at some point it would be reading a section of the buffer that doesn't contain any valid information.</p>

<h2 id="a-hardware-interlude">A Hardware Interlude</h2>

<p>Previously we asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if we have chunks of data that should remain contiguous in memory when written to the buffer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But when would we actually require that data be read or written to in a contiguous manner?</p>

<h3 id="dma---direct-memory-access">DMA - Direct Memory Access</h3>

<p>In embedded microcontroller systems, it is common to have a single core CPU. Instead of having multiple cores, they have a set of features referred to as Memory Mapped Peripherals. These Peripherals act as hardware accelerators for specific behaviors, such as sending or receiving data from a serial port.</p>

<p>In order to minimize the amount of time necessary for the CPU to manually copy data from one place to another, these Peripherals can be configured to perform an action completely autonomously, streaming data to or from a section of memory on the CPU. This action of the hardware directly reading from or writing to the memory is called DMA, or Direct Memory Access.</p>

<p>Instead of reading or writing one byte at a time to the Serial Port, the CPU can instead start the transfer, and when it is complete, process a chunk of bytes at a time. This allows for less time waiting, and is generally a more efficient method of processing data.</p>

<p>A typical usage of DMA (called a DMA transaction) looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The CPU allocates N bytes of memory to be used for DMA</li>
  <li>The CPU instructs the peripheral, such as a serial port, to receive N bytes of data, and to place those bytes in the memory allocated in step 1</li>
  <li>Once the peripheral is configured, the CPU resumes performing other actions, and the Serial Port begins filling data into the memory buffer as it is received</li>
  <li>When the Serial Port has received all N bytes requested, it notifies the CPU, and stops receiving data</li>
  <li>The CPU may now process all N bytes requested, and if necessary, repeat the process at step one</li>
</ol>

<p>Although we often only have one CPU core in most microcontrollers, we can think of these DMA actors as their own thread. They are able to operate independently of the main CPU's actions, and read and write memory based on their own needs. In these microcontroller systems, there can be tens or hundreds of these hardware actors, all operating in parallel!</p>

<h3 id="stackless-operation">Stackless Operation</h3>

<p>In step one of DMA procedure above, we talked about allocating N bytes of memory. On a non-embedded system, this would generally be done by allocating space on the heap - a <code>Box</code> in Rust, or using <code>malloc()</code> in C. In lightweight or timing critical embedded systems, it is uncommon to have a heap. Instead, all memory must be statically allocated, or allocated through the use of the stack.</p>

<p>In these systems, data structures such as Circular Buffers are used to work around these limitations. A fixed amount of space is reserved for use, and a dynamic amount of data within a fixed maximum region is used to simulate a dynamic memory region.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these DMA transactions do not understand the concept of a circular buffer. They are only aware of a pointer to where the memory region starts, and how many bytes to use from the starting pointer. This means that a normal circular buffer where the data region could wrap around would not work for DMA transfers.</p>

<h3 id="but-why-is-dma-so-important">But why is DMA so important?</h3>

<p>For operations used with DMA, the speed at which bytes are transferred is often many orders of magnitude slower than the operation of the CPU itself. For a 32 bit ARM CPU, copying 4 bytes from RAM takes a single cycle. In a 64MHz CPU, this means it will take 15.6 nanoseconds to copy these four bytes.</p>

<p>A typical serial port configuration is "115200 8N1", which means 115,200 baud (or raw bits on the wire per second), with no parity, and 1 stop bit. This means that for every data byte sent, there will be 8 data bits, 1 unused parity bit, and 1 stop bit, to signal the end of the byte, sent over the wire.</p>

<p>This means that we will need 40 bits on the wire to receive a 4 data bytes. At 115,200 bits on the wire per second, this means it will take 347,220 nanoseconds to receive the same four bytes, taking <strong>22,222 times as long</strong> as it takes our CPU to copy the same amount of data!</p>

<p>Instead of making our CPU waste all of this time waiting around, we allow the hardware to manage the simple sending and receiving process, allowing our CPU to either process other important tasks, or go into sleep mode, saving power or battery life.</p>

<h3 id="from-embedded-to-datacenters">From embedded to datacenters</h3>

<p>People writing high-performance application for datacenter grade servers have long realised this is also true for the high-grade, power-hungry CPUs they use.</p>

<p>Modern, efficient network stacks for servers use similar DMA techniques to offload all of this work to the network card, so that valuable CPU time can be spent running data-crunching applications.</p>

<h3 id="a-fork-in-the-road">A fork in the road</h3>

<p>Here's where the original BipBuffer design decides to maintain two "regions" of valid data, one at the start and one at the end of the buffer: this way it can keep track of which sections of the buffers contain valid data. Have a look at the <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3479/The-Bip-Buffer-The-Circular-Buffer-with-a-Twist">BipBuffer</a> blog post on CodeProject for details on how this works.</p>

<p>The design based on two regions works great in a single threaded environment, but requires swapping the references to two regions when the rightmost one is depleted. This is tricky to do without explicit locking (mutexes) for cases in which the writer and reader reside on different threads.</p>

<p>Our use case is communication between two concurrent threads of control: either two actual OS threads, or a main thread of control and an interrupt handler in embedded or a device driver. This is where our design takes inspiration from the <em>BipBuffer</em>, but goes in a different direction.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-design">Concurrency design</h2>

<p>A common strategy to reduce the amount of coordination that needs to happen between the two threads (writer, reader) is to associate each coordination variable (pointer) with a single thread that has exclusive write access to it. This also happens to simplify reasoning about the design, because it's always clear who's in charge of changing which variable.</p>

<p>So, let's start with a simple circular buffer that has the <code>write</code> and <code>read</code> pointers from before. The writer is the only one who ever changes <code>write</code>, and the reader is the only one who increments <code>read</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zfwNfD0.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So far so good. Each thread is only concerned with writing to one variable, and reading from the other.</p>

<h3 id="high-watermark-for-data">High watermark for data</h3>

<p>Now let's re-introduce the requirement that the data written may need to be contiguous. If there's no space available at the end of the buffer, the writer wraps around and writes the whole contiguous chunk at the start.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lb8C3sq.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As we've seen, we need a way to tell the reader which part of the buffer is valid, and which was skipped to be able to write a single contiguous chunk. We're tracking the high watermark of valid data in the buffer, so what about a <code>watermark</code> pointer that gets written when the writer wraps around and leaves empty space at the end?</p>

<p>Going back to our idealised infinite buffer from before, here's what things would look like. Whenever the valid region isn't split in two parts (at the beginning and end of the actual buffer) we simply ned to track the write and read pointers, as before. On the other hand, when valid data wraps around the buffer, we leave an artificial "hole" in the "infinite buffer" representation. The <code>watermark</code> lets us keep track of where the "hole" starts, and the end of the physical buffers marks the end.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lZrudcU.png" alt=""></p>



<p>We have all the necessary elements for our non-blocking implementation. We start with the <code>write</code> and <code>read</code> pointers aligned at the start of the buffer and the <code>watermark</code> aligned with the end.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nS0tBm1.png" alt=""></p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ContiguousAsyncBuffer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>buf</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span>
  <span>len</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
  <span>read</span><span>:</span> <span>AtomicUsize</span><span>,</span>
  <span>write</span><span>:</span> <span>AtomicUsize</span><span>,</span>
  <span>watermark</span><span>:</span> <span>AtomicUsize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We use <code>AtomicUsize</code> to let the two threads read and update the pointers concurrently and safely. The writer/sender thread is in charge of <code>write</code> and <code>watermark</code>, the reader/receiver is in charge of <code>read</code>. This is important! Contended writes from multiple threads on the same memory location are a lot harder for the CPU's cache coherence protocol to handle, and will cost latency and throughput.
What's more, it's a lot easier to reason about correctness of these concurrent protocols if each of the shared pointers are always written by a certain thread (their "owner").</p>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<p>As long as there's enough contiguous buffer space before the end of the physical buffer, as new data arrives (of length <code>write_len</code>) the sender thread moves the <code>write</code> pointer forwards to signal that a new chunk of the buffer is now valid and can be read.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// [writer thread]</span>
<span>buffer</span><span>.write</span><span>.store</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>.write</span><span>.load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>write_len</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When new data arrives and the <code>write</code> pointer is close to the end, it moves the watermark to its current location, then wraps around. Again, if the <code>read</code> pointer is still close to the beginning, this has the potential of clobbering data that hasn't yet been processed by the reader. For this reason, the <code>write</code> pointer is not allowed to overtake <code>read</code> after it has wrapped around.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// [writer thread]</span>
<span>if</span> <span>buffer</span><span>.len</span><span>.saturating_sub</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>.write</span><span>.load</span><span>())</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>write_len</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// not shown: check `read` to make sure there's enough free room</span>
  <span>buffer</span><span>.watermark</span><span>.store</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>.write</span><span>.load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>write_len</span><span>);</span>
  <span>buffer</span><span>.write</span><span>.store</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>.write</span><span>.load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>write_len</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>// not enough space, wrap around</span>
  <span>// not shown: check `read` to make sure there's enough free room at the beginning of the buffer</span>
  <span>buffer</span><span>.watermark</span><span>.store</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>.write</span><span>.load</span><span>());</span>
  <span>buffer</span><span>.write</span><span>.store</span><span>(</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>write_len</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You may have noticed that the writer also pushes the <code>watermark</code> forward when there's room at the end of the buffer. We need to do this because we may have moved it back on a previous wrap-around and we want to avoid the reader now misinterpreting it as a sign that there's a "hole" at the end.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<p>We end up again with two possible memory configurations:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>write</code> leads and <code>read</code> follows (<code>write</code> ≥ <code>read</code>), the valid data (written, but not yet processed by the reader) is in the section of the buffer after <code>read</code> and before <code>write</code>;</li>
  <li><code>read</code> leads and <code>write</code> follows (<code>read</code> &gt; <code>write</code>), the valid data is after <code>read</code>, till the <code>watermark</code>, and from the start of the buffer till <code>write</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vgqghy7.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This makes the reader thread's logic simple: read till you hit the <code>write</code> pointer, or the <code>watermark</code>, and update the <code>read</code> pointer accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-memory-ordering">A note on memory ordering</h3>

<p>Some of you may have noticed that all of our calls to <code>load</code> don't take arguments and our calls to <code>store</code> take a single argument, the new value for the <code>AtomicBool</code>. This isn't valid code, of course. The real signatures take another argument: <code>ordering: Ordering</code>.
This instructs llvm on how to emit the proper memory fences and <code>sync</code> instructions to drive the cache coherence and synchronization mechanisms built into the CPUs.</p>

<p>The safe thing to do here is to always choose <code>Ordering::SeqCst</code>, "sequential consistency", which provides the strongest guarantees. On x86, due to the hardware design, anything other than <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> is equivalent to <code>SeqCst</code>. On ARMv7/v8, things get more complicated.</p>

<p>We recommend reading up on <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/enum.Ordering.html"><code>Ordering</code></a> both in the rust doc and in the documentation for your platform. For the purpose of this post, just assume we used <code>Ordering::SeqCst</code> everywhere. This is often good enough in practice, and switching to a weaker <code>Ordering</code> is only necessary to squeeze out the last bit of performance.</p>

<p>In Andrea's implementation of the lock-free ring-buffer, <a href="https://github.com/utaal/spsc-bip-buffer">spsc-bip-buffer</a>, some of the orderings are relaxed for performance. This has the downside that it can introduce subtle concurrency bugs that may only show up on some platform (ARM, for example): to be a bit more confident that everything's still fine, Andrea's has continous integation tests both on x86 and ARM.</p>

<h3 id="support-for-embedded-systems">Support for embedded systems</h3>

<p>In James' implementation of the lock-free ring-buffer, <a href="https://github.com/jamesmunns/bbqueue">bbqueue</a>, convenience interfaces are provided for statically allocating instances of the ring-buffer. The queue can be split into Producer and Consumer halves, allowing for use of one half in interrupt context, and the other half in non-interrupt (or a different interrupt) context.</p>

One of the main hurdles in cell visualization is to render the millions of molecules in real time computationally. Here, using a video game engine, we demonstrate the capability of rendering massive biological macromolecules at the atomic level within their native environment. To facilitate the visualization, we also provide tools that help the interactive navigation inside the cells, as well as software that converts protein structures identified using CryoET to a scene that can be explored with the game engine.</p><div id="sec-1"><div><p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/12/11/2023.12.08.570879/F1.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="" rel="gallery-fragment-images-816925171" data-figure-caption="<div class=&quot;highwire-markup&quot;></div>" data-icon-position="" data-hide-link-title="0"><span><img alt="Figure" src="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/12/11/2023.12.08.570879/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="217" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></a></p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/12/11/2023.12.08.570879/F1.large.jpg?download=true" title="Download Figure1" data-icon-position="" data-hide-link-title="0">Download figure</a></li><li><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/12/11/2023.12.08.570879/F1.large.jpg" target="_blank" data-icon-position="" data-hide-link-title="0">Open in new tab</a></li></ul></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-3">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another sci-fi adaptation is making its way to Apple TV Plus. The streamer announced that it’s adapting William Gibson’s seminal cyberpunk novel <em>Neuromancer</em> into a 10-episode series. Graham Roland (<em>Lost</em>,<em> Jack Ryan</em>) will serve as showrunner, while JD Dillard (<em>Utopia</em>) will direct the first episode. (Both will also be executive producers on the series.)</p><p>That’s about all we know right now. There are no details on when the series might start streaming or who will star. In <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/02/apple-tv-announces-neuromancer-new-drama-based-on-the-multi-award-winning-science-fiction-novel-by-william-gibson/">a press release</a>, Apple said that the show “will follow a damaged, top-rung super-hacker named Case who is thrust into a web of digital espionage and high stakes crime with his partner Molly, a razor-girl assassin with mirrored eyes aiming to pull a heist on a corporate dynasty with untold secrets.”</p><div><p>This is also not the first adaptation of <em>Neuromancer</em>, which originally came out 1984 as Gibson’s debut novel. Its been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer_(video_game)">turned into a video game</a>, a graphic novel, and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16121760/neuromancer-movie-deadpool-director-tim-miller">reportedly being made into a movie</a> as well. (In 2022, Amazon adapted another Gibson novel — <em>The Peripheral</em> — into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23412567/the-peripheral-review-amazon-prime-video-william-gibson-book">a live-action streaming series</a>.)</p></div><p>Whenever it does premiere, <em>Neuromancer</em> will join an ever-growing lineup of sci-fi on Apple TV Plus. So far that has included series like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23786940/foundation-season-2-david-goyer-interview-apple-tv-plus"><em>Foundation</em></a>, <em>For All Mankind</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23711259/silo-review-season-1-apple-tv-plus"><em>Silo</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23932047/invasion-season-2-review-apple-tv-plus"><em>Invasion</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23913217/monarch-legacy-of-monsters-apple-nycc-preview-godzilla"><em>Monarch</em></a>, and <em>Constellation</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24065198/constellation-review-apple-tv-plus">which premiered earlier this month</a>.

<p>An example of the couplet.</p></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italian</a> version is <i>Ammazza la vecchia … col Flit!</i> (<i>English</i>: "Kill the old lady … with Flit!")—<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLIT" title="FLIT">Flit</a></i> being an old brand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT" title="DDT">DDT</a> insecticide. This is a humorous popular version of a post-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> commercial <i>Ammazza la mosca... col Flit</i> (<i>English</i>: "Kill the fly with Flit!").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2013)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p><p>The tune is used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language" title="Catalan language">Catalan</a> with a different lyric: "Nas de barraca … <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant_Boi_de_Llobregat" title="Sant Boi de Llobregat">Sant Boi</a>" (<i>English</i>: "Shack nose … Sant Boi"). It is also tapped, as a door knock. The Catalan lyrics may come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanes" title="Blanes">Blanes</a>, where it was sung twice with <i>Nas de barraca. Sant Boi. Cinc de carmelos pel noi</i> (<i>English</i>: Shack nose. Sant Boi. Five candies for the boy).<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>
</p><p>In Spain, it is sung with the lyrics, <i>Una copita … de Ojén</i> (<i>English</i>: "A shot … of schnapps").
</p><p>In Mexico, it means a vulgar insult with the lyrics, <i>Chinga tu madre … cabrón</i> (English: "Fuck your mother … bastard").
</p><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_pub" title="Irish pub">Irish barroom</a> music, the tune is sometimes tagged at the end of a song. The performer sings the first part to the lyrics, "How is your aul' one?" (read: "old one", a slang term for mother), to which the audience replies, "Gameball!" (A slang term meaning A-OK).<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>
</p><p>In Sweden, it is well known as <i>Kvart över elva … halv tolv</i>, which means <i>A quarter past eleven … half past eleven</i>. The twist doesn't work as well in English, as the English time system treats 11:30 as a continuation of eleven instead of as the first half of twelve. <i>Halv tolv</i> thus means <i>half twelve</i> and is the correct Swedish equivalent of half past eleven. In Sweden, the melody was also used in a commercial for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakrisal" title="Lakrisal">Bronzol</a> brand of candy with the slogan <i>Hälsan för halsen — Bronzol</i> (<i>English</i>: Health for the throat — Bronzol).
</p><p>In Icelandic, the lyrics are <i>Saltkjöt og baunir … túkall</i> (<i>English</i>: "Salt meat and split peas … two krona" (króna is the currency in Iceland)).
</p><p>In the Netherlands, the phrase is used when someone leaves with the intention to not return. <i>Die zien we nooit meer, te-rug</i> (<i>English</i>: We shall never see them, a-gain). It is used as a way to make fun of someone/something, if it suddenly disappears from the scene.
</p><p>In Argentina, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Bal%C3%A1" title="Carlos Balá">Carlos Balá</a>, a former children's TV show host, used to include a bit in his routine in which he would whistle the "shave and a haircut" part of the tune, prompting the children in the audience to answer "Ba-lá" to the rhythm of the two final notes.
In the same country in school context to call for silence being sung with the teacher saying the phrase Tapa Tapita (Bottlecap, Small cap) and the students answering Tapon (Plug), followed with the teacher singing the phrase cierro la boca (shutting my mouth) and answering ya está (already done)

			<p><em>Intended audience: You are likely to enjoy this post the most if you are interested in Linux and/or Linux manual pages, or if you enjoy reading about esoteric programming projects.</em></p>
<p>Linux computers come with pre-installed manual pages that describe how to use specific commands. These pages are readable by typing <code>man &lt;command&gt;</code> into your terminal. For example, you can get the manual for the <code>tac</code> command, which prints out a file in from bottom-to-top by using the command <code>man tac</code>. Some command line software you install adds manual pages, too.</p>
<p>Linux manual pages are formatted using the <code>roff</code> syntax, which you can use to mark up documents. <code>roff</code> was the first typesetting command line software for Unix, developed at Bell Labs. Earlier this week, with a spark for building but no particular idea in mind, I started to think about the Linux manual page. Could I serve my blog posts as Linux manual pages? Herein lay an adventure.</p>
<p>TL;DR: You can request a Linux manual page version of a blog post with the following HTTP request:</p>
<pre><code>
curl -sL -H "Accept: text/roff" https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/28/programming-projects/ &gt; post.page &amp;&amp; man ./post.page
</code></pre>

<h2>Devising the system: Content negotiation</h2>
<p>I had an idea for how I wanted this to work in mind. I wanted a user to be able to request a <code>roff</code> version of a blog post using content negotiation, part of HTTP that lets you specify ixn what format you want a file. For example, you could request an image with an <code>Accept: image/png</code>. This tells a server that, if possible, it should send a PNG file. There are lots of intricacies to content negotiation. You can provide a list of types of content you can accept, and the order in which a server should try to return them</p>
<p>But! That's a rabbit hole for another day. What's important here is that an application can ask a server for content in a specific format using a HTTP header.</p>
<p>With content negotiation, I can route requests if a user sends an <code>Accept</code> header. If a user asks for an <code>text/roff</code> document, I could return a manual page that can be opened with the <code>man</code> command.</p>
<h2>Writing the manual pages</h2>
<p>Manual pages use the <code>roff</code>syntax, so I would need to have versions of my blog posts in that format. To do this, I updated my site to generate <code>man</code> pages for each blog post. The template I used to generate the manual page was as follows:</p>
<pre><code>
.TH jamesg.blog 1 "" "jamesg.blog"
.SH TITLE
...
.SH AUTHOR
James' Coffee Blog (https://jamesg.blog)
.SH PUBLISHED
...
.SH POST
...
.SH URL
...
</code></pre>

<p>Here, I set a header with my domain name and create five sections: title, author, published date, the post content, and the URL of the post. The raw content is markdown. This doesn't always turn out well in a manual as spacing can sometimes be off. But, markdown was more readable than HTML and resulted in less information loss (i.e. titles having no distinction to paragraphs other than being on their own line) than using plain text.</p>
<p>I now had:</p>
<ol>
<li>Properly formatted manual pages, and;</li>
<li>The knowledge that content negotiation could allow someone to request a manual page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now came the final piece of the puzzle: using content negotiation to facilitate the request for manual pages.</p>
<h2>Requesting a manual page</h2>
<p>You can use the following command to request the <code>roff</code> format of blog posts on this website:</p>
<pre><code>
curl -sL -H "Accept: text/roff" https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/28/programming-projects/ &gt; post.page
</code></pre>

<p>You can then open the result as a Linux manual page:</p>
<pre><code>
man ./post.page
</code></pre>

<p>Let's talk about how this works!</p>
<p>When a browser makes a request to <code>https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/</code>, it asks for the HTML version of the page. In the <code>curl</code> command above, the command asks for the <code>text/roff</code> version. I added a few lines of text in my NGINX configuration to change how the server responds when <code>text/roff</code> is requested for a blog post.</p>
<p>First, I declared a few variables in my <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> file that let me raise a flag when a specific content type was identified:</p>
<pre><code>
map $uri $redirect_suffix {
    ~^/(.*)/$   $1;
    default     "";
}

map $http_accept $redirect_location {
    default "";
    "~^text/roff" 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can add multiple different redirect locations, but I only need two: the default, and my custom <code>text/roff</code> rule.</p>
<p>In my site NGINX configuration (the file in the <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled</code> folder), I used the following code to handle requests differently if a <code>roff</code> page is requested:</p>
<pre><code>
server {
                ...
        location / {
          if ($redirect_location = 1) {
              rewrite ^/(.*)/$ /$1.man last;
          }
            ...
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, I say: take a URL, and add <code>.man</code> to the end, removing the trailing slash, as long as the <code>Accept: text/roff</code> header is set. This tells NGINX to read from the <code>.man</code> file instead of the <code>index.html</code> file associated with each post on my site.</p>
<p>That is to say you can now read blog posts on this website as a Linux manual page. This was a fun investigation into using content negotiation in NGINX and a reminder of how far we have come with typesetting technology from the command line interfaces to modern-day typesetting software and HTML.</p>
<p><em>Thank you to <a href="https://toddpresta.com/">Todd</a> for providing guidance on setting up my NGINX configuration. Todd's help was sincerely appreciated!</em></p>

<p>It's been nearly 10 years since
<a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.0/">KDE&nbsp;Plasma&nbsp;5</a>,
which is the last major release of the <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">desktop</a>.
On February&nbsp;28 the project <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/">announced</a> its "mega release" of KDE
Plasma&nbsp;6, KDE Frameworks 6, and KDE Gear&nbsp;24.02 — all based on the <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/qt6">Qt&nbsp;6</a> development framework. This
release focuses heavily on migrating to Wayland, and aspires to be a seamless
upgrade for the user while improving performance, security, and support
for newer hardware. For developers, a lot of work has gone into removing
deprecated frameworks and decreasing dependencies to make it easier to write
applications targeting KDE.</p>

<h4>What's in Plasma 6</h4>

<p>For the purpose of this article, we'll mostly look at Plasma and <a href="https://develop.kde.org/products/frameworks/">Frameworks</a>, as Gear&nbsp;24.02
contains too many applications like KMail, Kate, and the Kdenlive
video editor that deserve more attention in their own right. I ran <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/">Fedora
Kinoite's</a> <a href="https://planet.kde.org/siosms-blog-2023-11-21-kinoite-nightly-images-with-plasma-6/">nightly</a>
releases with pre-release Plasma&nbsp;6 packages, which has proved pleasantly
stable and performant on an aging ThinkPad&nbsp;X280 with 16GB of RAM and a
Core&nbsp;i7-8650U CPU.</p>

<p>The difference between Plasma&nbsp;5 and 6 is apparent, but not
pronounced. Users who are comfortable with Plasma&nbsp;5 are unlikely to feel
discomfited with Plasma&nbsp;6, or have a hard time adapting to the changes
sprinkled throughout the desktop. Plasma&nbsp;6 has
a number of changes to default settings. The big change, of course, is <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/2188">Wayland
as the default</a> graphical session.</p>

<p>Plasma&nbsp;6 also has a smattering of smaller, less controversial changes. For example, prior to
Plasma&nbsp;6, the desktop defaulted to single-click to open a folder, launch a
program, or open a file. Users coming from other operating systems or
Linux desktop environments are often used to double-clicking to do these
things. Now, KDE upstream has relented on using a single-click to open files and
defaults to double-click instead. Distributions like Fedora, Kubuntu, and
Manjaro had been changing the upstream default anyway, so KDE developer Nate Graham <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/72">suggested</a>
disabling the feature. "<q>Distros are closer to users and clearly the feedback they've been
getting is that double-click is a better default...Let's admit it and switch
to double-click by default ourselves</q>".</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/963854/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/Plasma-6-sm.png" alt="[KDE Plasma 6 desktop]" title="KDE Plasma 6 desktop"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Plasma&nbsp;6 is also supposed to do away with the default of using the scroll
wheel on the desktop to switch virtual desktops. However, this setting is
still active in Fedora Kinoite as of this writing. Scrolling to switch virtual
desktops has been the default for some time, but Graham argued in another <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/55">proposal</a>
to disable the feature because it can easily surprise users with unexpected
and unwanted behavior. Users who prefer the old behavior can toggle it
back on in the "Mouse Actions" settings under "Desktop Folder Settings",
so it's not going away entirely. Another change to scrolling behavior
in this release is that clicking on a scrollbar moves the window to
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/92">the
location clicked</a>, rather than one "page" at a time. This is meant to
reduce the amount of fiddling with the scroll wheel to move up or down a long
"distance", in order to be a better option for users with repetitive strain injuries
(RSIs) — or for users who'd like to avoid RSIs in the first place.</p>

<p>Breeze is Plasma's default theme and it has been updated for Plasma&nbsp;6, but it's a subtle change
— sort of like repainting a room and changing the color from "flat white"
to "eggshell white". It has some changes to spacing that make it feel a
little less crowded, and it has fewer lines separating UI elements. The System
Settings application has also been revamped. This may be more noticeable, as
some of the settings have migrated to new locations. The nice thing about KDE
is that so much is configurable, but finding configuration settings is still
a challenge in Plasma&nbsp;6. For example, the aforementioned setting to scroll
virtual desktops is found in the Desktop Folder Settings application, but
not in the System Settings application under the Virtual Desktop settings.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.kde.org/dolphin/">Dolphin</a>, KDE's file manager,
had its configuration settings redesigned to make them easier to navigate. The
prior version of Dolphin included six tabs of settings for navigation, its
context menu, startup behavior, view modes, behavior of the trash, and
general settings. The redesign condenses this into four tabs, scooting the
navigation options and startup options into the new interface tab. It also adds
a fifth tab for user feedback, with options to contribute statistics and
participate in surveys. These are, as one would expect from an open-source
project that respects its users, set to share no data by default. Users
who wish to participate, though, can choose just how much participation
they're willing to engage in. This ranges from sharing just a few details
like version of the application and operating system, to more telemetry
like screen resolution, time Dolphin is used, how many network shares are
available, and more.</p>

<p>The Dolphin interface changes are minor. Instead of showing recent
files from today and yesterday, Dolphin now shows recent files and recent
locations. Settings for file history are system-wide, and found in System
Settings rather than Dolphin's settings — users can opt for keeping
history "forever" or a period of months, or turn off history entirely. (Days or
hours do not appear to be an option.) Users can also specify the applications
allowed to access file history, rather than granting access to any application.

</p><p>Plasma&nbsp;6 on Wayland has some support for <a href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2023/05/18/hdr-and-color-management-in-kwin.html">high
dynamic range (HDR) and color management</a>, depending on the application
and if one has a supported monitor. Sadly, the monitors I have on hand are not
supported. One thing that did work nicely, however, was setting the
scaling for a laptop monitor and external monitor, independently. It was easy to set the
external monitor to 100% scaling while the ThinkPad screen was set to 125% so that windows appeared
to be the same size when moved from one monitor to the other.</p>

<p>The Plasma Search feature, which is part of <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner">KRunner</a> and the
<a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Kickoff">Kickoff</a>
application launcher, has been <a href="https://write.as/alexander-lohnau/profiling-and-optimizing-krunner">refactored</a>
and is claimed to be much faster in this release. The release announcement
claimed major speedups for searching local documents and for applications,
while reducing CPU usage. It's hard to verify this, but KRunner did feel snappy
when performing web and document searches. <a href="https://apps.kde.org/spectacle/">Spectacle</a>,
KDE's screenshot utility, now takes screenshots and recordings of the entire desktop, an application
window, or just a selection of the screen. This promises to be a handy tool
to create tutorials, or share a recording of application behavior when filing
a bug.</p>

<p>KDE giveth, and KDE taketh away. As is common with major updates, some
features and settings have been removed due to design changes or difficulty
with underlying drivers or software. For example, GUI configuration for <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/merge_requests/1509">Synaptics
touchpads</a> and <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man4/evdev.4.xhtml">evdev</a>
input devices has been removed because the drivers have been superseded with <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/what-is-libinput.html">libinput</a>
in Wayland. Unmaintained features like the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/57">Air theme</a>,
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/65">icon
view for System Settings</a>, and <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/khotkeys/-/merge_requests/23">KHotkeys</a>
were all scuttled in this release. The ability to grab
wallpapers from the Unsplash free stock image site was removed due to <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kdeplasma-addons/-/merge_requests/422">API
changes</a> and the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kdeplasma-addons/-/merge_requests/487">QuickShare
applet</a> for file transfer was dropped because it never worked as
intended.</p>

<h4>Under the hood</h4>

<p>Even though Plasma&nbsp;6 may not feel like a major update, a lot of work has gone
into KDE&nbsp;Frameworks&nbsp;6 to make it possible. I asked KDE developer
Carl Schwan by email about the developer-facing changes and plans for KDE&nbsp;5 now
that Plasma&nbsp;6 has been released. Schwan said most of the work in
Frameworks&nbsp;6 was about reducing rather than adding features. Schwan pointed
to removal of deprecated frameworks, like KHtml, the KJS javascript engine,
and KHotkeys. The project has also worked to get rid of deprecated Qt APIs,
such as QtCodecs, and to decrease dependencies between frameworks so external
Qt applications can just use one or two KDE frameworks. Schwan also said that
KDE has removed a lot of APIs "which were barely used or [...] have better
alternatives either in another framework or in Qt itself". In particular,
he noted that KDE's plugin system has moved from two APIs to a single API.</p>

<p>Schwan said that Qt&nbsp;6 itself didn't have many API changes, but
it did add an abstraction layer for graphics APIs like Metal, Vulkan,
OpenGL, and DirectX "instead of only supporting OpenGL+Angle". In
addition, Qt has switched to <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>, away
from the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmake-manual.html">qmake</a>
build system, which Schwan said helped a lot to improve developer
tooling. Finally, Qt&nbsp;6 brought a number of improvements to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwaylandcompositor-index.html">Qt Wayland</a>,
which Schwan said had been driven forward in part by KDE developers.</p>

<h4>Support for KDE 5 and X11</h4>

<p>Plasma&nbsp;6 is likely to be a little
bit rough around the edges for a while, and users might want to review <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?bug_severity=critical&amp;bug_severity=grave&amp;bug_severity=major&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=CONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;classification=Applications&amp;classification=Plasma&amp;keywords=qt6%2C%20&amp;keywords_type=allwords&amp;list_id=2462812&amp;query_format=advanced">known
issues</a> before deciding to upgrade. Obviously
Plasma&nbsp;6 won't be immediately available in most
distributions, but users can refer to KDE's community wiki for <a href="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_6#How_to_use/test_it">instructions</a>
on how to test Plasma&nbsp;6 right away. Users can choose to <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Build_software_with_kdesrc-build#Plasma">build
from source</a>, try the <a href="https://neon.kde.org/download">KDE neon</a>
testing edition, or try one of the other distribution-specific methods for
Fedora, Gentoo, KaOS, NixOS, or openSUSE.</p>

<p>There is no rush to switch — KDE&nbsp;5 is not quite out of the picture
just yet. On February&nbsp;12, on the Plasma development list, David Edmundson <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123325.html">said</a>
he'd seen enough patches that should go
into&nbsp;5.27 to warrant another release. Justin Zobel <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123329.html">agreed</a>
and noted that "<q>many distros won't [adopt] it for some
time. Major bugfixes and security fixes should definitely
continue being applied until such time that most major distros
have updated to 6</q>". Valorie Zimmerman, from the Kubuntu project, <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123331.html">said</a>
this is good news since the next long-term support (LTS) release for Kubuntu is
coming in March and won't be based on Qt&nbsp;6. On February&nbsp;19, Jonathan Riddell <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123333.html">reported</a>
the Plasma team planned to do a Plasma&nbsp;5.27.11 release on March&nbsp;6.</p>

<p>Even though many in the Fedora project are eager to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/961899/">drop X11 support</a>, KDE upstream
plans to continue including X11 support for users who depend on it in the
short term. Users can expect to see support
in Plasma&nbsp;6 as well, but Schwan says there's "no fixed timeline" with
various estimates ranging from two to five years before support is fully
removed. He stressed that there will be "plenty of communication
beforehand" and the project "certainly won't drop the support from
one day to the other".</p>

<p>Overall, Plasma&nbsp;6 looks to be a smooth upgrade for users, and
KDE&nbsp;Frameworks&nbsp;6 seems to be a solid foundation for the next few
years of KDE development. It should be interesting to watch how 
Plasma evolves over the next few years.</p><br clear="all">

Since 2021, the ecommerce giant has failed to attend three meetings with the employment and social affairs committee, with the most recent meeting being missed due to “short notice”, according to a letter from the committee to Robert Metsola, the EU parliament president.</p><p>“It is unreasonable for members to be lobbied by Amazon while at the same time being deprived of the right to represent the interests of European citizens and inquire about claims of breaches of fundamental rights enshrined in EU Treaties and EU labour laws,” the letter stated.</p><p>In response to the decision, Amazon said, “We are very disappointed with this decision, as we want to engage constructively with policymakers. As a company that has been active in the EU for more than 25 years and now has more than 150,000 permanent employees here, we take our engagement with policymakers in Brussels and across Europe extremely seriously.”</p><p>Since 2013, around €18.8 million has been spent by Amazon on lobbying campaigns in EU institutions, according to non-profit research group, the Corporate Europe Observatory. “Amazon’s anti-democratic behaviour won’t be tolerated,” said Oliver Roethig, regional secretary of European trade union group UNI Europa in response to the ban.</p><p><em>Via</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/11d20273-71e8-433d-bcac-c66d919a203a" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ft.com/content/11d20273-71e8-433d-bcac-c66d919a203a">FT</a></p><h3 id="section-more-from-techradar-pro"><span>More from TechRadar Pro</span></h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/mwc-2024-all-the-top-b2b-news-from-this-years-mobile-world-congress" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/mwc-2024-all-the-top-b2b-news-from-this-years-mobile-world-congress">MWC 2024 day three — all the B2B news and announcements from Mobile World Congress</a></li><li>Take a look at our guide to the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/firewall" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/best/firewall">best firewalls</a></li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-white-house-urgently-wants-memory-safe-programming-languages-to-be-used-by-developers" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-white-house-urgently-wants-memory-safe-programming-languages-to-be-used-by-developers">The White House urgently wants memory-safe programming languages to be used by developers</a></li></ul>

<div id="slice-container-authorBio-426zPpCJf44ibCqcuF9rJA"><p>Benedict Collins is a Staff Writer at TechRadar Pro covering privacy and security. Before settling into journalism he worked as a Livestream Production Manager, covering games in the National Ice Hockey League for 5 years and contributing heavily to the advancement of livestreaming within the league. Benedict is mainly focused on security issues such as phishing, malware, and cyber criminal activity, but he also likes to draw on his knowledge of geopolitics and international relations to understand the motives and consequences of state-sponsored cyber attacks.</p>

<p>He has a MA in Security, Intelligence and Diplomacy, alongside a BA in Politics with Journalism, both from the University of Buckingham. His masters dissertation, titled 'Arms sales as a foreign policy tool,' argues that the export of weapon systems has been an integral part of the diplomatic toolkit used by the US, Russia and China since 1945. Benedict has also written about NATO's role in the era of hybrid warfare, the influence of interest groups on US foreign policy, and how reputational insecurity can contribute to the misuse of intelligence.</p>

<p>Outside of work Ben follows many sports; most notably ice hockey and rugby. When not running or climbing, Ben can most often be found deep in the shrubbery of a pub garden.</p></div>

<p>We are in the process of changing our billing structure to make it more unified; by doing this, we hope to make our products more user friendly.</p>
<p>As part of this process, we will change the billing for many of our products from monthly to hourly. Some products will be based on consumption. This structure will be similar to our Cloud billing. It will take effect in March 2024.</p>
<p>If you use a product for the whole month, we will continue to invoice you for the same monthly amount as always.</p>
<p>During the transition period, which will start with the March 2024 invoice, you may see some unusual things on your invoice. Below, you can see an <a href="#example-invoices">example</a> of what these changes may look like during the transition period.</p>
<p>Just to make it clear, the montly price you will pay will NOT change, even if you see some short-term changes in monthly totals on your invoices during the transition period.</p>
<p>It is possible that you will see a smaller-than-normal total on your invoice for March. In April, we will retro-actively invoice you for March for any hourly-based products; the invoice will be pro rata (proportional to the amount of hours in March that you used those products.)</p>
<h3 id="why-will-my-march-invoice-be-different-from-my-earlier-invoices"><a href="#why-will-my-march-invoice-be-different-from-my-earlier-invoices" aria-label="why will my march invoice be different from my earlier invoices permalink"></a>Why will my March invoice be different from my earlier invoices?</h3>
<p>Starting in April, we will only invoice customers for the services that they have used <strong>AFTER</strong> the month that they use those services.</p>
<p>For that reason, the March invoice will NOT contain any products whose prices we already calculated in March under the old billing structure. That's why your invoice for March may have a smaller total that normal.</p>
<p>The affected products (the ones with hourly-based billing) for March will then appear retro-actively on the APRIL invoice, but with the new hourly based billing.</p>
<p>Please take a look at the <a href="#example-invoices">example invoices below</a>.</p>
<h3 id="why-will-my-april-invoice-be-different-from-my-earlier-invoices"><a href="#why-will-my-april-invoice-be-different-from-my-earlier-invoices" aria-label="why will my april invoice be different from my earlier invoices permalink"></a>Why will my April invoice be different from my earlier invoices?</h3>
<p>Your April 2024 invoice will be the first one that is based on hourly billing. It will cover your hourly usage for the month of March. The hourly billing will apply to most products, but not all. For example, it will not apply to one-time products (like setup fees) or to products like domains and SSL certificates, which will continue to have yearly payment periods.</p>
<p>For this one time, the invoice will retro-actively cover products that were NOT covered on March's invoice as part of the transition period.</p>
<p>After that (starting in April) all future invoices will have a service period for hourly-based products. The service period will start on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. If you use these products for a full month, you will see the normal monthly price.</p>
<p>For more details, please look at the section below <a href="#example-invoices">("Example invoices")</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-be-new-in-the-may-invoice"><a href="#what-will-be-new-in-the-may-invoice" aria-label="what will be new in the may invoice permalink"></a>What will be new in the May invoice?</h3>
<p>By the time you get your May invoice, the transition period will be finished.</p>
<p>The May invoice will show you the products that you used in April. For hourly-based products, you will see how many hours you used each product for April. If you have used the product for the entire month of April, you will see the normal monthly price. If you use the product for less than a month, and the hourly calculation is less than the monthly total, we will charge you the smaller hourly-based amount.</p>
<p>For more details, please look at the section below <a href="#example-invoices">("Example invoices")</a>.</p>

<p>There may be a one-time delay in when we send you your April invoice. We apologize for that in advance and ask you for your understanding. Naturally, we will extend the time that you will have to pay your April invoice. In the months following April, we will send you invoices regularly and on time.</p>
<h3 id="why-am-i-now-receiving-my-invoice-on-a-different-day-of-the-month"><a href="#why-am-i-now-receiving-my-invoice-on-a-different-day-of-the-month" aria-label="why am i now receiving my invoice on a different day of the month permalink"></a>Why am I now receiving my invoice on a different day of the month?</h3>
<p>We want to provide you with better and quicker customer service in the future when you have billing questions. That's why we have decided to spread out the days of the month when we send out invoices to customers. You will always receive your invoice on the same day of the month. But this day will be different from customer to customer. This will allow our support team to answer billing questions more quickly.</p>
<p>We sent you an email informing you about this change; it had the subject line "Changes to the billing model".  We sent you this email between 29 February and 15 March. You can find a copy of this email <a href="#email-from-hetzner">below</a>. You can find your new billing day by going to <a href="https://accounts.hetzner.com/invoice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">your account</a>.</p>
<h3 id="example-invoices"><a href="#example-invoices" aria-label="example invoices permalink"></a>Example invoices</h3>
<p>Example: You have two servers, Server A and Server B under the old billing model.</p>
<p>Server A had a service period of 21 February to 20 March.
Server B had a service period of 27 January to 26 February.</p>
<p>In <strong>February</strong> you received, as usual, an invoice for both servers with their two different service periods:

    </span></p>
<p>In <strong>March</strong>, you will NOT see any products on the invoice that will have a service period that extends into April 2024.</p>
<p>To be specific in this example, only Server B would appear on March's invoice because its service period does not fall into April. It only goes from 27 February to 26 March.</p>
<p>Server A, on the other hand, has a service period that would extend into April. So it would NOT be calculated on the March 2024 invoice. That's why the invoice for this example for March would be smaller.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>Now let's imagine that you order another server, Server C, in March, and Hetzner gives you access to the server on 15 March.</p>
<p>The <strong>April</strong> invoice will be the first retro-active invoice. It will include the service period of March for any products that have not already been calculated in March's invoice:</p>

    </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Server A for 21-31 March (previous invoice calculated in February)</li>
<li>Server B for 27-31 March (previous invoice calculated in March)</li>
<li>Server C for 15-31 March (new product; first invoice)</li>
</ul>
<p>The calculation for these invoices is based on hourly usage.</p>
<p>Now let's imagine that you cancelled Server A and that cancellation takes effect on 31 March. To replace this server, you order a new one, Server D, which Hetzner gives you access to on 20 April.</p>
<p>The invoice for <strong>May</strong> will include the service period from the previous month, April. So you would see the full service period for April listed for each server. Since you used Server B and Server C for the whole month, you would see the full monthly price there. And since you only used Server D for part of the month of April, you would see the calculation there based on hourly usage.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-change-the-date-that-hetzner-issues-my-invoice"><a href="#can-i-change-the-date-that-hetzner-issues-my-invoice" aria-label="can i change the date that hetzner issues my invoice permalink"></a>Can I change the date that Hetzner issues my invoice?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, no. For the foreseeable future, it will not be possible to change the date that we issue your invoice to you. We're sorry about that.</p>
<h3 id="how-precisely-does-hetzner-calculate-the-hourly-billing"><a href="#how-precisely-does-hetzner-calculate-the-hourly-billing" aria-label="how precisely does hetzner calculate the hourly billing permalink"></a>How precisely does Hetzner calculate the hourly billing?</h3>
<p>The beginning of the hourly billing starts as soon as the product becomes available to you. We always round up when calculating the hourly use. If you only use the product for a few minutes, we will charge you a full hour. If you use the product for close to a month, and the montly price is cheaper, we will always charge you the cheaper monthly price rather than a higher hourly price.</p>
<h3 id="when-will-hetzner-charge-me-the-hourly-price"><a href="#when-will-hetzner-charge-me-the-hourly-price" aria-label="when will hetzner charge me the hourly price permalink"></a>When will Hetzner charge me the hourly price?</h3>
<p>We will always use the hourly price when it saves you money, meaning when you have used a product for less than a month, and the total hourly price is less than the monthly price.</p>
<h3 id="when-does-the-time-for-the-hourly-price-start"><a href="#when-does-the-time-for-the-hourly-price-start" aria-label="when does the time for the hourly price start permalink"></a>When does the time for the hourly price start?</h3>
<p>It starts when Hetzner makes the product you ordered available to you. This is true even for products that you use for just a short period of time.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-pay-in-yearly-payment-periods"><a href="#can-i-pay-in-yearly-payment-periods" aria-label="can i pay in yearly payment periods permalink"></a>Can I pay in yearly payment periods?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately not. In the new system, we only allow monthly payments. However, you can make automated payments with two different payment options to help make it easier to make your payments. You can do automated payments using SEPA bank transfers or credit cards.</p>
<p>Important note: It is not always possible to do automated payments. There may be some exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="email-from-hetzner"><a href="#email-from-hetzner" aria-label="email from hetzner permalink"></a>Email from Hetzner</h3>
<p>I don't have the email from Hetzner about the new billing structure at hand.
What is changing?
Starting in March 2024, almost all of our products will have consumption-based and hour-based billing, similar to our Cloud products.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you?</p>
<p>Consumption-based billing: The invoices for these products is based on the service we provide. This means you always receive an invoice for the previous month.</p>
<p>Hour-based billing: Billing is based on the actual usage time in hours. There are some exceptions: products with an annual fee (domains and SSL certificates) and licences. These products' invoices are based on the entire calendar month regardless of when during the month you order them. If you use the products for a whole month, you will be charged the monthly price as usual.</p>
<p>What is important during the changeover phase in March and April?</p>
<p>During the changeover phase, your products will be charged pro rata (based on the proportion of the month). This may result in different invoice amounts for March and April. The changeover will happen automatically. You do not need to take further action. Your monthly price will not change.</p>
<p>What is important after the changeover?</p>
<p>We want to be able to offer you even better customer service in the future. For that reason, we want to change the date of your invoice. This will make it easier for us to quickly answer questions about your invoices.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Heinz has taken a major step forward for sustainable packaging with the introduction of its first fully recyclable ketchup cap, made possible through a pioneering collaboration with <a href="https://www.berryglobal.com/en/news/articles/kraft-heinz-introduces-first-fully-recyclable-ketchup-cap-with-help-from-berry-global">Berry Global</a>. Combining complex engineering with simple materials, Heinz’s achievement offers a model for manufacturers in the <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods-cpg">consumer packaged goods (CPG)</a> space to strive for waste reduction by designing more environmentally-friendly products.</p><p>Industrial CT is the perfect tool for exploring the intricacies of Heinz's new cap design without damaging it, even while it’s fully assembled and closed. Let’s take a look.</p><h3>Mono-material construction</h3><p>The old cap featured a silicone valve, which posed recycling challenges. The new cap's uniform composition of polypropylene (PP) simplifies recycling and can be accepted by any facility that processes plastic #5. Currently only about 3% of PP products are being recycled in the United States, but it is becoming more widely accepted. The new cap appears as a uniform color in Voyager’s range map, indicating that it’s entirely made of the same material. Compare it to the old cap, whose silicone valve is denser than the surrounding plastic.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/65cbc42a80870f285b2d0c15_4fHOwfEnbmCcBVmnYkFB_8Yt0l5Nos-j_Zh6BBRvX5i688yB0SuadxUlj4lQI9ei4m1n0bYLt2qS3Oy8Hw3eVAXXIVp9mK4mla6hsoEeug2iWtnd0VDZpHm7v2u8iUhUm-fpP9SBhdSm-CWdLB2HqGY.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The dense silicone ring (left) presents obstacles for recycling. The new mono-material cap (right) is of a uniform density.</figcaption></figure><h3>Innovative valve design</h3><p>The new design leverages ketchup's shear-thinning property to dispense the perfect amount. Ketchup requires a specific amount of pressure to flow. When the bottle is squeezed, it moves through the outer channels where the wall separating them from the inner channels plays a crucial role. The wall prevents the ketchup from flowing back and directs it toward the antechamber, building the necessary pressure for the ketchup to pass through the nozzle efficiently.</p><p>Once the squeezing stops, the ketchup's viscosity increases, preventing drips and mess. This design ensures a clean and controlled dispense of the product.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/65cbc42a7b0050f7e8c59d86_CuLl6RDCU0dCWfdZnp8_4ofr0EsloqxIcsUNWJfHyHov9INxT77P_Nc9CpKqyY9hgS0Q3HuCaABFJXu1rtT6U7c0S4m9v83eZMlqdEz8qHTYPg40ZHjyA0sFZnAJW-J-Jx7B1dK41isnpiKOLGjaTpk.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Views from below (left) and above (right) of the Heinz ketchup cap's valve channels</figcaption></figure><h3>Industrial CT and sustainability</h3><p>Developing sustainable packaging can present a significant engineering challenge. Recyclable plastics often don’t perform as well as their non-recyclable counterparts, and reducing material usage can mean that safety factors are reduced as well. Effective, sustainable packaging requires careful design and lots of fine tuning.</p><p>Industrial CT plays a pivotal role in the development of sustainable packaging, offering a non-invasive method to analyze, refine, and perfect packaging solutions. By reducing the need for physical prototypes, CT scanning accelerates the development process, cuts down on waste, and helps avoid the costs associated with scrapped prototypes and recalled products. It embodies the convergence of innovation and sustainability, offering a blueprint for the packaging industry's next steps.</p><p>Heinz's recyclable cap is more than just an innovation; it's a statement of intent, reflecting a broader commitment to environmental sustainability. The cap's successful redesign, fueled by a $1.2 million investment and extensive testing, demonstrates the potential for significant waste reduction—up to 300 million plastic caps annually—and a future where packaging is fully recyclable, reusable, or compostable.</p><h3>Learn more</h3><p>Download our free white paper <strong>Removing Obstacles to Sustainable Packaging</strong> and discover how industrial x-ray CT can help packaging engineers create solutions that work.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Something happened earlier this year where I got on a run making checkbox animations and just couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>A bit of background: back in pre-pandemic 2020, I went to <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">the Recurse Center</a> for a week and built <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/">Checkboxland</a>, a JavaScript library that lets you display text and animations on a checkbox grid. It was a fun little project. I made some demos, <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/06/06/checkboxland/">blogged about it</a>, and ultimately put it on the shelf where I didn’t touch it for about a year.</p>
<p>Eventually, I was feeling desperate for a fun coding diversion so I picked it back up again. I wanted to try making better and more complex animations so I started building a ripple effect, and got hooked.</p>

<p>Building the ripple forced me to dig into some animation math. I soon realized that I could use similar techniques to build other animations, including these ones:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-circles.gif" loading="lazy" alt="A checkerboard animation made with html checkboxes">
</p>
<p>Whenever I’d show someone an animation like this, they’d often try to click the checkboxes to see what would happen. This never did anything—the animation would just override their clicks.</p>
<p>That was pretty disappointing, so I wanted to try making animations that responded to clicks.</p>

</figure>
<p>The more interactive demos I made, the more ideas I had. I could make games! <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/docs/demos/snake/">Snake</a>, Pong, Tetris!</p>
<p>But before I got too far down that path, another thought caught hold in my mind. If I could display any image, then I wouldn’t have to go through the laborious process of defining every checkbox manually or coming up with an algorithm for the scene I wanted.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>Converting images seemed tricky so I sat on the idea for while until I came across <a href="https://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2017/12/28/converting-image-to-ascii-art.html">this excellent article on converting images into ASCII text</a>. A short while later I was converting images:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-nike.png" alt="The Nike logo displayed side-by-side with an html checkbox version"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-apple.png" alt="The Apple logo displayed side-by-side with an html checkbox version"></p>
<p>I soon realized that converting images gets you 90% of the way to converting video so that became my next task.</p>
<h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-video.gif" loading="lazy" alt="A video animation displayed side-by-side with an html checkbox version.">

</figure>
<p>Soon I had extended the Checkboxland API so I could load any video (like ones from <a href="https://giphy.com/">giphy</a>) and instantly generate a checkbox version. Now checkbox animations were trivial.</p>
<p>This also meant I could display webcam data, which got a lot of attention on Twitter when I shared it:</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true">

</blockquote>

<p>Finally, my co-worker Reed told me about a challenge where people try to play the animated video “Bad Apple” on various obscure computing environments (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLajlU5EKJVdonUGTEc7B-0YqElDlz9Sf9">a bunch of examples here</a>). It sounded fun so I went ahead and put together a youtube video for that.</p>

</figure>
<hr>
<p>This whole process has been fun but I really ought to stop.</p>
<p>I got <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a>, hard. Sure it’s harmless fun, but I’m starting to feel guilty spending months tinkering on these things when I’ve got the tools and skills to put actually useful stuff into the world. <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2018/02/18/the-cure-for-boredom-is-superpowers/">I feel like Superman</a>, using his powers to fry an egg.</p>
<p>Plus, if I keep doing this then I’m going to end up known as “the checkbox guy.” That’s not exactly marketable but I guess it could be worse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it feels like I’m starting to exhaust the interesting things I could build in this format. At some point it’s like “dude, we get it, you can make anything with checkboxes.” I still have a few lingering ideas though… maybe it’s like a controlled forest fire and I should just let myself keep making these things until it burns itself out.</p>

			<p><img decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_test_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113">Revision 4 is the new version of the Starlink user terminal. As of February 2024, the new version is only available in the US.<br>
I decided to test the new hardware and compare it to the well-known REV3 (a.k.a. Gen2/V2 or “Standard Actuated”).</p>


<h3>Revision 4</h3>
<p>If you don’t understand why this model is called REV4, I explain it in the unboxing video.<br>
Here is my unboxing and initial review of the new Starlink user terminal:</p>
<p><iframe title="Starlink REV4 (V3) unbox and quick review" width="850" height="478" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WESdXlQdXsw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><strong>Revision 3 and Revision 4 specifications</strong></h3>
<p>This is a comparison of basic specifications from the Starlink website.</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev3_rev4_basic_specs_site.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev3_rev4_basic_specs_site-1024x719.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="597" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev3_rev4_basic_specs_site-1024x719.jpg 1024w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev3_rev4_basic_specs_site-400x281.jpg 400w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev3_rev4_basic_specs_site-768x539.jpg 768w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev3_rev4_basic_specs_site.jpg 1502w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"></a></p>
<h3>Breaking into</h3>
<p>The IP rating is higher because the new housing is not ultrasonically welded anymore. It has a complex construction and is glued with an automotive-class sealant.<br>
Unfortunately, this housing is quite hard to disassemble without partial destruction.</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_teardown_collage.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_teardown_collage-1024x770.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="639" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_teardown_collage-1024x770.jpg 1024w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_teardown_collage-400x300.jpg 400w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_teardown_collage-768x577.jpg 768w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_teardown_collage.jpg 1213w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"></a></p>
<p>At this moment, I have no idea how to seal it back. I’ll share more details on the teardown process in future posts.</p>
<h3>Revision 4 PCB</h3>
<p>The new Starlink terminal has a resigned PCB with all-new antenna electronics.</p>
<p>The next-gen Shiraz digital beamformers support more RF channels. There are only six beamformer ICs (rev3 has 16 chips). FEM elements are connected in a daisy chain and combined by groups. I didn’t do detailed reverse-engineering yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_pcb_overview.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_pcb_overview-1024x749.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="622" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_pcb_overview-1024x749.jpg 1024w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_pcb_overview-400x292.jpg 400w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_pcb_overview-768x562.jpg 768w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_pcb_overview-1536x1123.jpg 1536w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_pcb_overview.jpg 1853w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"></a></p>
<p>SoC, RAM, and eMMC are the same as in REV3.</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_soc_ram_flash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_soc_ram_flash.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_soc_ram_flash.jpg 900w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_soc_ram_flash-400x267.jpg 400w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_soc_ram_flash-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>The main difference is the PoE circuit. Now, it’s on a separate board. This PCB receives 48 PoE and steps it down to 12V and 3.3V. STM32 MCU controls PoE negotiation and board operation.</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_poe_board.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_poe_board.jpg" alt="" width="784" height="453" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_poe_board.jpg 900w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_poe_board-400x231.jpg 400w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_poe_board-768x444.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px"></a></p>
<p>I will not focus on further reverse engineering in this article. It’s just an overview.</p>
<h3>REV4 vs REV3: basic tests</h3>
<p>Location: Kyiv, Ukraine<br>
Test date: 23 January 2024<br>
Time: 4 p.m.<br>
Starlinks firmware version: a8a61034-4207-4484-b8ea-4c4c01f07cde<br>
Standard user setup with routers. No bypass mode.<br>
Conditions: clear sky</p>
<p>Please watch my initial and basic tests below. I’m comparing startup time, power consumption, and network speed. Snow melt mode was disabled.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="First tests of the Starlink REV4 (V3/Gen3) in Ukraine" width="850" height="478" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWPMpJrjd1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>During these synthetic tests, the new REV4 performed better. The total power consumption of the REV4 terminal and the new REV3 router was under 100W. This meets the stated specifications. But without the snow melt mode. Please note this.</p>

<p>I believe that most of the differences were caused by routers.</p>
<h3>REV4 vs REV3: advanced tests</h3>
<p>Location: Kyiv, Ukraine<br>
Test date: 4 February 2024<br>
Time: 3 p.m.<br>
REV3 firmware version: a8a61034-4207-4484-b8ea-4c4c01f07cde.uterm.release<br>
REV4 firmware version: c4718913-5c91-4cf2-b31a-45c187e4bca2.uterm_manifest.release<br>
No routers were used.<br>
Conditions: cloudy sky</p>
<p>During the second test, I used <a href="https://flent.org/">flent</a> to run <a href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/RRUL_test_suite/">rrul</a> to <code>netperf-eu.bufferbloat.net</code> and collected information about bandwidth and response fluctuations. Additionally, I ran a <a href="https://speed.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare speed test</a>. All tests were run separately for both Dishys, except one test where I ran the Cloudflare test simultaneously on both devices.</p>
<p>The video of the tests is currently editing.</p>
<p>During the tests, I used two GEN1 PoE bricks and two laptops with direct Ethernet connections.</p>

<p>I noticed a slight packet loss on both devices. That looks okay. For some reason, REV4 had a higher loss rate.</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/packet_loss_rev4_vs_rev3.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/packet_loss_rev4_vs_rev3.png" alt="" width="580" height="383" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/packet_loss_rev4_vs_rev3.png 791w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/packet_loss_rev4_vs_rev3-400x264.png 400w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/packet_loss_rev4_vs_rev3-768x507.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></a>No more problems were noticed with either device.</p>
<p><strong>REV4 power consumption</strong></p>
<p>I ran the new terminal with the Snowmelt mode ON and found this device very power-hungry. The consumption jumped way higher than I expected – 186W!<br>
Note this if you consider running this device with an autonomous power supply.</p>

<h3>Additional tests for REV4</h3>
<p>In a few days, I decided to run additional tests with the new terminal.<br>
It was 2 a.m., curfew. I wasn’t able to visit my previous test site. So, I put the terminal outside my window and tested it with many obstructions.</p>
<p>It started snowing during testing, so I measured the power consumption again.</p>
<p>Location: Kyiv, Ukraine<br>
Test date: 8-9 February 2024<br>
Time: 2 a.m.<br>
Firmware version: c4718913-5c91-4cf2-b31a-45c187e4bca2.uterm_manifest.release<br>
Two modes were tested: the Gen3 router and the Gen3 router in bypass mode.<br>
Conditions: cloudy sky, <strong>snow</strong></p>
<p>The initial synthetic speed test showed some fantastic results despite not ideal conditions. This is the speed record so far!</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_fantastic_speed_test.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_fantastic_speed_test.jpg" alt="" width="561" height="299" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_fantastic_speed_test.jpg 750w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_fantastic_speed_test-400x213.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px"></a></p>
<p>Power consumption during the test remained around <strong>85W</strong>. Activation of the Snowmelt mode caused a crazy jump to <strong>200W</strong>. It wasn’t a fluctuation, but stable consumption during the test time.</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_crazy_power_consumption.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_crazy_power_consumption.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="491" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_crazy_power_consumption.jpg 550w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rev4_crazy_power_consumption-278x300.jpg 278w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px"></a></p>
<p>This is even higher than the actual REV4 PSU advertised consumption (197W).</p>
<p>I ran <code>rrul</code> 5-minute tests in two modes: with the Gen3 router and the Gen3 router in bypass mode. There were interruptions during the tests.</p>
<p>Test command: <code>flent rrul -p all_scaled --socket-stats -s 0.5 -l 300 -H netperf-eu.bufferbloat.net -t "rrul_"$DISHY_NAME -o rrul_$DISHY_NAME.png</code></p>

<p>I haven’t reverse-engineered the new router yet. It looks like here we are dealing with the same software switch (Linux bridge) with all known problems.</p>
<p>On the other side. I noticed that the new antenna better picks up the signal in poor <strong>(snow and physical obstructions</strong>) conditions. This obviously makes it possible to achieve higher modulation rates.<br>
Please look at the obstruction map during the last test.</p>

<p>I also noticed that the obstacle map was built quite quickly. But perhaps this is simply the result of a software update.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://apiiro.com/blog/malicious-code-campaign-github-repo-confusion-attack/">https://apiiro.com/blog/malicious-code-campaign-github-repo-confusion-attack/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39545676">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    
<p>Our security research and data science teams detected a resurgence of a malicious repo confusion campaign that began mid-last year, this time on a much larger scale. The attack impacts more than 100,000 GitHub repositories (and presumably millions) when unsuspecting developers use repositories that resemble known and trusted ones but are, in fact, infected with malicious code.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-repo-confusion-attacks-happen-nbsp">How do repo confusion attacks happen?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Similar to dependency confusion attacks, malicious actors get their target to download their malicious version instead of the real one. But dependency confusion attacks take advantage of how package managers work, while repo confusion attacks simply rely on humans to mistakenly pick the malicious version over the real one, sometimes employing social engineering techniques as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, in order to maximize the chances of infection, the malicious actor is flooding GitHub with malicious repos, following these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Cloning existing repos (for example: TwitterFollowBot, WhatsappBOT, discord-boost-tool, Twitch-Follow-Bot, and hundreds more).</li>



<li>Infecting them with malware loaders.</li>



<li>Uploading them back to GitHub with identical names.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Automatically forking each thousands of times.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Covertly promoting them across the web via forums, discord, etc.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-when-the-malicious-repos-are-in-use">What happens when the malicious repos are in use?</h2>



<p>Once unsuspecting developers use any of the malicious repos, the hidden payload unpacks seven layers of obfuscation, which also involves pulling malicious Python code and later a binary executable. The malicious code (largely a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/Inplex-sys/BlackCap-Grabber-NoDualHook?tab=readme-ov-file#-%E3%80%A2-features">BlackCap-Grabber</a>) would then collect login credentials from different apps, browser passwords and cookies, and other confidential data. It then sends it back to the malicious actors’ C&amp;C (command-and-control) server and performs a long series of additional malicious activities.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/banana4.gif" alt=""></figure>



<h2 id="The-automation-effects-on-GitHub">The automation effects on GitHub</h2>



<p>Most of the forked repos are quickly removed by GitHub, which identifies the automation. However, the automation detection seems to miss many repos, and the ones that were uploaded manually survive. Because the whole attack chain seems to be mostly automated on a large scale, the 1% that survive still amount to thousands of malicious repos. You can check out a small portion of the current wave yourself by simply searching the following in GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%F0%9F%94%A5+2024+language%3Apython&amp;type=repositories&amp;s=updated&amp;o=desc"><em>🔥 2024 language:python</em></a>.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="277" src="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12-1024x277.png" alt="" srcset="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12-1024x277.png 1024w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12-300x81.png 300w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12-768x208.png 768w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12-1536x415.png 1536w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12.png 2028w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Counting the removed ones, the number of repos reaches millions. Usually the removal happens a few hours after the upload, so it’s challenging to document them. We know the removal is automated because many of the original ones still exist, and it mainly targets the fork bombs. For example, <a href="https://github.com/Mattia69?tab=repositories">here</a> you can see thousands of forks appear in the summary but <a href="https://github.com/Mattia69/discord-vanity-sniper/forks">none in the details</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/fork-bombs.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>Because of the operation’s large scope, this campaign has a sort of 2nd-order social engineering network effect when, every now and then, naive users fork the malicious repos without realizing they are spreading malware. Kind of ironic to see it spreading by humans after such heavy reliance on automation.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-did-the-campaign-start">When did the campaign start?</h2>



<p>Here is a brief history of this malicious campaign:</p>



<p><strong>May 2023: </strong>As <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/respawning-malware-persists-on-pypi/">originally reported by Phylum</a>, several malicious packages were uploaded to PyPI containing early parts of the current payload. These packages were spread by ‘<em>os.system(“pip install package”)</em>’ calls planted in forks of popular GitHub repos, such as ‘chatgpt-api’.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>July – August 2023: </strong>Several malicious repos were uploaded to GitHub, this time delivering the payload directly instead of through importing PyPI packages. This came after PyPI removed the malicious packages, and the security community increased its focus there. Aliakbar Zahravi and Peter Girnus from Trend Micro published <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_be/research/23/j/infection-techniques-across-supply-chains-and-codebases.html">a great technical analysis of it</a>.</p>



<p><strong>November 2023 – Now: </strong>We have detected more than 100,000 repos containing similar malicious payloads, and the number keeps growing. <strong>This attack approach has several advantages:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>GitHub is huge, therefore despite the large number of instances, their relative portion is still insignificant and thus hard to detect.</li>



<li>Package managers are not involved as before, therefore explicit malicious package names are not mentioned, so that’s one less indicator.</li>



<li>The targeted repos are in a small niche and have low popularity, making it easier for unsuspecting developers to make the mistake and clone their malicious impersonators.</li>
</ul>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="873" height="455" src="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Malicious-Package-Timeline.png" alt="" srcset="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Malicious-Package-Timeline.png 873w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Malicious-Package-Timeline-300x156.png 300w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Malicious-Package-Timeline-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px"></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-transition-of-malware-from-package-managers-to-scms">The transition of malware from package managers to SCMs</h2>



<p>Judging by the many incidents we have observed in package managers and SCM platforms, the transition of this campaign from malicious packages in PyPI to malicious GitHub repos seems to reflect a general trend. It seems that nowadays, the security community puts extra focus on package managers, so that was to be expected.</p>



<p>The ease of automatic generation of accounts and repos on GitHub and alike, using comfortable APIs and soft rate limits that are easy to bypass, combined with the huge number of repos to hide among, make it <strong>a perfect target for covertly infecting the software supply chain.</strong></p>



<p>This campaign, along with dependency confusion campaigns plaguing package registries and generally malicious code being spread through source control managers, demonstrates how fragile software supply chain security is, despite the abundance of tools and available security mechanisms.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-protect-yourself-against-repo-confusions">How to protect yourself against repo confusions</h2>



<p>GitHub was notified, and most of the malicious repos were deleted, but the campaign continues, and attacks that attempt to inject malicious code into the supply chain are becoming increasingly prevalent. There are countless solutions for catching malware at the system and network levels, but the supply chain remains a massive and lucrative attack surface for malicious actors.</p>



<p>At Apiiro, we’ve built a malicious code detection system that monitors any connected codebases. We then detect attacks by using deep code analysis using multiple advanced techniques: <a href="https://apiiro.com/blog/llm-code-pattern-malicious-package-detection/">LLM-based code analysis</a>, deconstruction of the code into a complete execution flow graph, an elaborate heuristics engine, dynamic decoding, decryption, and deobfuscation, and more, so it’s very hard to fool it.</p>



<p>Without monitoring your code for injected malicious payloads, the security of your whole organization is determined by things like the ability of your developers to not choose the wrong repo, which is almost identical, not having a single CI/CD misconfiguration, having 100% secure 3rd party code, and other impossible conditions. That’s where Apiiro’s <a href="https://apiiro.com/product/aspm/">deep application security posture management (ASPM)</a> platform comes in, going beyond typical vulnerability detection and ingestion to surface the next generation of software supply chain and application risks.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Algorithm</h2><a id="user-content-algorithm" aria-label="Permalink: Algorithm" href="#algorithm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a dlmalloc-style linked list allocator with boundary tagging and bucketing, aimed at general-purpose use cases. Allocation is O(n) worst case (but in practice its near-constant time, see microbenchmarks), while in-place reallocations and deallocations are O(1).</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, the layout of chunk metadata is rearranged to allow for smaller minimum-size chunks to reduce memory overhead of small allocations. The minimum chunk size is <code>3 * usize</code>, with a single <code>usize</code> being reserved per allocation. This is more efficient than <code>dlmalloc</code> and <code>galloc</code>, despite using a similar algorithm.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>This will have the largest impact on avoiding false sharing, where previously, the allocation metadata for one allocation would infringe on the cache-line of the allocation before it, even if a sufficiently high alignment was demanded. Single-threaded performance marginally increased, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed heap_exhaustion and replaced heap_efficiency benchmarks.</li>
<li>Improved documentation and other resources.</li>
<li>Changed the WASM size measurement to include slightly less overhead.</li>

<li>Added <code>dlmalloc</code> to the benchmarks.</li>
<li>WASM should now be fully supported via <code>TalckWasm</code>. Let me know what breaks ;)

<li>Tests are now passing on 32 bit targets.</li>
<li>Documentation fixes and improvements for various items.</li>
<li>Fixed using <code>lock_api</code> without <code>allocator</code>.</li>
<li>Experimental WASM support has been added via <code>TalckWasm</code> on WASM targets.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Removed dependency on <code>spin</code> and switched to using <code>lock_api</code> (thanks <a href="https://github.com/stlankes">Stefan Lankes</a>)
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You can specify the lock you want to use with <code>talc.lock::&lt;spin::Mutex&lt;()&gt;&gt;()</code> for example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed the requirement that the <code>Talc</code> struct must not be moved, and removed the <code>mov</code> function.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The arena is now used to store metadata, so extremely small arenas will result in allocation failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Made the OOM handling system use generics and traits instead of a function pointer.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Use <code>ErrOnOom</code> to do what it says on the tin. <code>InitOnOom</code> is similar but inits to the given span if completely uninitialized. Implement <code>OomHandler</code> on any struct to implement your own behaviour (the OOM handler state can be accessed from <code>handle_oom</code> via <code>talc.oom_handler</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed the API and internals of <code>Span</code> and other changes to pass <code>miri</code>'s Stacked Borrows checks.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Span now uses pointers exclusively and carries provenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated the benchmarks in a number of ways, notably adding <code>buddy_alloc</code> and removing <code>simple_chunk_allocator</code>.</li>

As long as I was flying out to Vancouver, I wanted to meet Professor</span><a href="https://spph.ubc.ca/faculty/mariana-brussoni/" rel=""> Mariana Brussoni</a><span>, who had been writing important work on the value of outdoor risky play. Our hour-long meeting expanded my thinking about risk and play, and helped me write Chapters 2 and 3 of </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/729231/the-anxious-generation-by-jonathan-haidt/" rel="">The Anxious Generation</a><span>.&nbsp; Mariana quickly joined my pantheon of experts on play, along with Lenore Skenazy and Peter Gray.

I liked Mariana and her work so much that I gave her an open-ended invitation to write whatever she wanted at After Babel. Here is her essay, laying out her findings in a format that parents and schools can use. A concise summary of her work is this simple sentence, which she said to me during our meeting: “Children should be kept as safe as necessary, not as safe as possible.”</span></em></p><p><strong>— Jon</strong></p><p>We parents are caught in a paradox. We desperately want to keep our children safe and ensure their success. We are also often terrified that they will get hurt and that they will fail—so we do everything we can to prevent that from happening. Yet many of those very efforts to manage our fears have paradoxically reduced our children’s safety and their odds of success.&nbsp;</p><p><span>For over two decades, I have </span><a href="http://outsideplay.org/" rel="">researched</a><span> children’s development, injury prevention, and outdoor risky play.

Where were you? What were you doing?&nbsp; Was there an adult supervising you?</p><p><span>Adults in many Western nations, particularly those born before the 1990s, </span><a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/330/article/896673/summary" rel="">recall playing with friends</a><span> in their neighborhoods, local parks, and abandoned places, making up the rules as they went along, without adult supervision. They often recall a sense of joy, fun, and freedom as they would run, jump, and move their bodies in ways that weren’t allowed indoors. They felt independent, taking risks and figuring things out for themselves. And this is the kind of childhood that has </span><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-01219-022" rel="">been common</a><span> for nearly all of human history. Children, like all young mammals, play.</span></p><p><span>Today, this kind of childhood is rare. Every successive generation of children since the 1970s has seen their outdoor play and freedom shrink. Time use data show that children’s leisure time has gone down, particularly time spent in unstructured outdoor play, while time spent in academic and screen-based activities has increased.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-4446.12369" rel="">Between 1975 and 2015</a><span>, outdoor play among UK children decreased by 29.4%, while screen-based activities increased by 22.4%. </span><a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/20852679" rel="">In the U.S</a><span>., only 16% of children in 1997 played outdoors every day.

On the surface, it’s not clear why a need for risky play would evolve across species, if it increases the chances that something bad will happen to those who partake in it. But when we dig a little deeper, its benefits become obvious. Risky play provides children with low-cost opportunities to develop the physical and cognitive skills to master the challenges that they will face as they grow older. So, those who engaged in it had a major </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491100900212" rel="">evolutionary advantage</a><span> over those who did not. &nbsp; Physically, risky play allows children to explore more diverse movements and gain physical movement skills. </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21594937.2022.2152531" rel="">Cognitively</a><span>, it helps them overcome their fears, build their critical thinking skills, and become accustomed to coping independently with difficult situations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Risky play can even help children </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10567-020-00338-w" rel="">overcome anxiety disorders</a><span> and the cognitive distortions that go along with them. Anxious children have difficulty tolerating uncertainty, tend to interpret ambiguity negatively and underestimate their ability to cope in uncertain situations. Through risky play, children practice dealing with strong ambiguous emotions (thrill and excitement could also be interpreted as fear and terror) and situations that abound with uncertainty. It can also show them that they are resilient and capable of coping when things go wrong. </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10578-022-01363-2" rel="">Research </a><span>shows that children with more opportunities for risky play have lower internalizing symptoms that are characteristic of anxiety disorders.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In fact, the Canadian Paediatric Society sees risky play as so important, and as a way to address many of the challenges that their patients face, that they recently released a </span><a href="https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/outdoor-risky-play" rel="">statement</a><span> encouraging pediatricians to support it in patients’ lives.</span></p><p>With all of these benefits… and the evolutionary impulse for it… why has risky play been disappearing so rapidly?</p><p><span>Among the most important factors driving the loss of risky play and childhood freedom is the move toward </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44156-1_2" rel="">intensive parenting</a><span> that began in the 1980s.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-142031950" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-children-need-risk-fear-and-excitement#footnote-2-142031950" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> Parents, particularly mothers, have been encouraged to micro-manage their children’s lives, curate their experiences, remove any barriers, and enroll them in diverse structured activities with the intention of enhancing their development and giving them an edge in the race to succeed. This approach to parenting has become like the air we breathe—</span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26931463" rel="">widely accepted in North America</a><span>—with parents of all backgrounds held to its unrealistic standard regardless of whether they can afford the necessary time, money, and energy.</span></p><p><span>This costly parenting strategy has negligible benefits at best, and can even be harmful. </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10826-014-0035-0" rel="">Research</a><span> shows that enrollment in structured activities is not associated with improved developmental outcomes, and the </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00593/full?_ga=1.242929867.851339493.1400829831" rel="">loss of free time</a><span> can be detrimental to developing basic </span><a href="https://developingchild.harvard.edu/guide/a-guide-to-executive-function/" rel="">executive function</a><span> skills.

Parents today receive constant messaging that in order to be “good parents”, they must always keep their children safe. And it is widely believed that the world is </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/11/20/facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/" rel="">no longer a safe place</a><span> for children to play in. Yet statistics show that it has never been a safer time to be a child. Injury-related deaths are at an all-time low in most Western nations. In the US, </span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0767" rel="">deaths from unintentional injuries fell</a><span> by 73% for boys and 85% for girls between 1973 and 2010. This misperception of risk creates the parental paradox.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>What kids </strong><em><strong>are</strong></em><strong> dying from today are mainly car crashes and suicides, not playing outside unsupervised with friends. </strong><em><strong>Parents are worrying about the wrong causes of injuries and harm</strong></em><strong>. In fact, the very strategies that parents use to try to keep their children safe – driving them around, maximizing supervision, and minimizing freedom – are unintentionally increasing the likelihood of injuries and even death.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>The problem lies not with our intentions. We all want children to thrive. The problem is in the decisions we’ve made to support this noble goal. We’ve prioritized safety over freedom, achievement over play, and screen time over outdoor time. The results are predictable: compromised </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-play-deficit" rel="">mental </a><span>and </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352464218302785?via%3Dihub" rel="">physical health, cognitive development</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12643" rel="">emotional competence</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The solutions are both simple and hard. We know what children need to thrive. The three key ingredients necessary for thriving play environments are </span><em><strong>Time, Space, and Freedom.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Time: </strong></em><span>Make daily outdoor playtime a priority. That can mean adding it to the schedule, much like we already do for sports or other extra-curricular activities. But schools should also take steps to prioritize outdoor instruction and recess. This can be particularly important for children from disadvantaged families without ready access to safe and stimulating outdoor environments. Parents and educators can use the U.S. Play Coalition’s</span><a href="https://usplaycoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Need-for-Recess-2019-FINAL-for-web.pdf" rel=""> position paper on recess</a><span> to advocate for more recess in schools.&nbsp; My research lab also developed a free teacher </span><a href="https://teacher.outsideplay.org/" rel="">tool</a><span> to help encourage outdoor learning, which includes short how-to videos to help overcome common barriers that teachers face.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em><strong>Space:</strong></em><span> Children need easy access to stimulating spaces for play; flexible spaces where they can use their imagination and explore risks, rather than spaces dominated by boring play structures and strict rules. Unfortunately, these kinds of spaces are harder and harder to come by as more parking lots and highways are built to accommodate a growing number of cars. At a legislative level, we need to move away from municipal planning that prioritizes cars over people–an important step that a number of North American cities have already taken. Outside of legislation, there is much that individuals can do, even with the little space that is available. For example, “loose parts” (e.g., sticks, lumber, rocks, boxes, and tarps) can turn boring and barren play spaces into places of joy and wonder.While these may look like junk to adults, children love them. Scotland developed</span><a href="https://www.inspiringscotland.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Loose-Parts-Play-Toolkit-2019-web.pdf" rel=""> a loose parts toolkit</a><span> for anyone who wants to get started. Some cities also have adventure playgrounds—child-centered, child-directed play spaces that are rich in loose parts. (Such playgrounds always have adult staff on hand, but the staff stays in the background unless serious safety risks arise.).

The biggest barrier to children’s freedom is us—the adults in their lives—and our need to manage our own fears.
