We know that security works best when it accounts for the diverse ways people use our tools. This is why we announced this change early: to gather input and ensure our solutions are balanced. We appreciate the community's engagement and have heard the early feedback – specifically from students and hobbyists who need an accessible path to learn, and from power users who are more comfortable with security risks. We are making changes to address the needs of both groups.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>To understand how these updates fit into our broader mission, it is important to first look at the specific threats we are tackling.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Why verification is important</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Keeping users safe on Android is our top priority. Combating scams and digital fraud is not new for us — it has been a central focus of our work for years. From Scam Detection in Google Messages to Google Play Protect and real-time alerts for scam calls, we have </span><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/whats-new-in-android-security-privacy-2025.html"><span>consistently acted to keep our ecosystem safe</span></a><span>.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>However, online scams and malware campaigns are becoming more aggressive. At the global scale of Android, this translates to </span><span>real harm for people around the world</span><span> – especially in rapidly digitizing regions where many are coming online for the first time. Technical safeguards are critical, but they cannot solve for every scenario where a user is manipulated. Scammers use high-pressure social engineering tactics to trick users into bypassing the very warnings designed to protect them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>For example, a common attack we track in Southeast Asia illustrates this threat clearly. A scammer calls a victim claiming their bank account is compromised and uses fear and urgency to direct them to sideload a "verification app" to secure their funds, often coaching them to ignore standard security warnings. Once installed, this app — actually malware — intercepts the victim's notifications. When the user logs into their real banking app, the malware captures their two-factor authentication codes, giving the scammer everything they need to drain the account.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>While we have advanced safeguards and protections to detect and take down bad apps, without verification, bad actors can spin up new harmful apps instantly. It becomes an endless game of whack-a-mole. Verification changes the math by forcing them to use a real identity to distribute malware, making attacks significantly harder and more costly to scale. We have already seen how effective this is on Google Play, and we are now applying those lessons to the broader Android ecosystem to ensure there is a real, accountable identity behind the software you install.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Supporting students and hobbyists</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We heard from developers who were concerned about the barrier to entry when building apps intended only for a small group, like family or friends. We are using your input to shape a dedicated account type for students and hobbyists. This will allow you to distribute your creations to a limited number of devices without going through the full verification requirements.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Empowering experienced users</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>While security is crucial, we’ve also heard from developers and power users who have a higher risk tolerance and want the ability to download unverified apps.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Based on this feedback and our ongoing conversations with the community, </span><span>we are building a new advanced flow that allows experienced users to accept the risks of installing software that isn't verified.</span><span> We are designing this flow specifically to resist coercion, ensuring that users aren't tricked into bypassing these safety checks while under pressure from a scammer. It will also include clear warnings to ensure users fully understand the risks involved, but ultimately, it puts the choice in their hands. We are gathering early feedback on the design of this feature now and will share more details in the coming months.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Getting started with early access</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Today, we’re excited to start inviting developers to the early access for developer verification in Android Developer Console for developers that distribute exclusively outside of Play, and will share invites to the Play Console experience soon for Play developers.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Spatial intelligence is the next frontier in AI,
demanding powerful world models to realize its full potential.
World models should reconstruct, generate, and simulate 3D worlds;
and allow both humans and agents to interact with them.
Spatially intelligent world models will
transform a wide variety of industries over the coming years.</p>
<p>Two months ago we shared a <a href="https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog/bigger-better-worlds">preview of Marble</a>,
our World Model that creates 3D worlds from image or text prompts.
Since then, Marble has been available to an early set of beta users
to create 3D worlds for themselves.</p>
<p>Today we are making Marble,
a first-in-class generative multimodal world model,
generally available for anyone to use.
We have also drastically expanded Marble's capabilities,
and are excited to highlight them here:</p>
<p><strong>Multimodal Marble</strong>:
Marble is now massively multimodal.
Marble can create 3D worlds from text, images, video, or coarse 3D layouts;
Marble also lets you interactively edit, expand, and combine worlds.
Once generated, 3D worlds can be exported as Gaussian splats, meshes, or videos.
These new capabilities let users create and edit worlds with fine-grained control;
and makes those worlds more useful than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>Marble Labs</strong>:
We are launching <a href="https://www.worldlabs.ai/labs">Marble Labs</a>,
a creative hub where imagination meets experimentation.
It is where artists, engineers, and designers push the boundaries of world models,
showcasing bold ideas, real-world workflows,
and new possibilities across gaming, VFX, design, robotics, and beyond.
Marble Labs is also home to in-depth case studies, tutorials, and documentation
that give anyone the tools to learn, build, and share their own 3D worlds.</p>
<p>Sign up at <a target="_blank" href="https://marble.worldlabs.ai/">marble.worldlabs.ai</a> and start creating worlds for yourself!</p>
<h2>The Marble World Model</h2>
<p>Our human experience of the world is inherently multimodal:
we use all of our senses to make sense of the world around us.
We integrate sight, sound, touch, and language to build up a mental model of the outside world;
these different representations work together, enriching and reinforcing each other to
let us reason about the world and act within it.</p>
<p>World models should work similarly.
They should be massively multimodal, able to lift whatever input signals are available
into a full 3D world, and they should be able to iteratively update their understanding
of the world as new information becomes available.</p>
<p>Marble is the first of its kind - a next-generation world model making strides toward this vision.
It can now create 3D worlds from a wide variety of input types,
and lets users iteratively edit or expand worlds.</p>
<p>Marble's new capabilities let you dive as deep as you want in controlling your generated worlds.
You can quickly create full 3D worlds from a simple image or text prompt
or interactively edit worlds in both 2D and 3D,
bringing to life a precise vision of a world in your mind.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.worldlabs.ai/images/MarbleWorldModelV4.svg"></p>
<h2>Text and Image to World</h2>
<p>To start, Marble can create a full 3D world from a single image or a short text prompt.
This is the simplest and easiest way to create worlds.
Marble can generate worlds with a wide variety of scene types and artistic styles.</p>
<p>Image prompts make it easy to combine Marble with other AI tools.
You can generate images with your favorite image generation model,
then bring it to Marble to lift it to a full 3D world.</p>
<div><p>Text-to-world generation</p><p>Text-to-world generation</p></div>
<p>Text and image prompts are intuitive and powerful,
but limited in creative control:
Marble must invent all the details of the world that are not present in the input text or image prompt.
This is often magical;
but sometimes you may want to steer Marble more directly toward a desired world.</p>
<h2>Multi-Image and Video to World</h2>
<p>An easy way to create worlds with more creative control is <strong>multi-image prompting</strong>.
Marble can accept different prompt images for different parts of the world,
stitching them together into a unified 3D world.</p>
<p>Multi-image prompts let you create worlds with more precision.
Unlike text or single-image prompts where Marble must invent all parts of the world not
present in the prompt, with multi-image prompts you can control what the generated
world will look like from different angles.</p>
<p>This leads to a brand-new workflow for generating worlds.
You can use your favorite image generation tool to iterate separately on the
input views, and Marble will lift them into full 3D worlds while also adding
seamless transitions between the input views.</p>
<div><p>Multiple Images to World</p><p>Multiple Images to World</p></div>
<p>Multi-image prompts can also be used to create worlds inspired by real-world spaces.
Marble can input a few photos or a short video depicting a real-world location from
different angles, and it will combine them to generate a 3D world with elements of
the real-world space.</p>
<div><p>Multi-image prompts can generate worlds from real-world photos</p><p>Multi-image prompts can generate worlds from real-world photos</p></div>
<h2>World Editing</h2>
<p>The creative process is highly iterative for many users.
Often, generating a world is only the start of a creative journey.
Seeing a generated 3D world often kicks off a dozen more ideas for
changing it or improving it.</p>
<p>Marble includes AI-native world editing tools.
Edits can be small and local: remove an object, touch up an area.
They can also be more drastic: swap objects, change the visual style,
or re-structure large parts of the world.
This gives a new level of fine-grained control to the world creation process.</p>
<div><p>Edit: Turn the entire back wall into a stage, and replace the tables with low benches facing the stage</p><p>Edit: Turn the entire back wall into a stage, and replace the tables with low benches facing the stage</p></div>
<p>World editing lets you re-imagine the same space in endless different ways.</p>

<h2>Chisel: Sculpting Worlds in 3D</h2>
<p>Marble's multimodal inputs and editing features give a lot of control over your generated 3D worlds.
But sometimes, creating the world exactly as you see it in your mind's eye requires finer-grained control
over the scene layout or exact sizes and positions of objects.</p>
<p>For these situations we are introducing <strong>Chisel</strong>, an AI-native tool to sculpt Marble worlds directly in 3D.</p>
<p>Chisel is a new experimental editing mode for advanced users to create 3D worlds.
It lets you lay out the coarse structure of your world in 3D
using coarse 3D shapes like boxes or planes,
or importing existing 3D assets into the scene.</p>
<p>After laying out the coarse 3D scene, you can add a text prompt to describe the visual style of the scene,
or additional elements not present in the coarse layout.
Marble will combine these inputs to give you a fully detailed 3D world.</p>
<p>Chisel decouples <strong>structure</strong> from <strong>style</strong>.
The coarse 3D scene determines the world's structure,
while the text prompt controls its overall style.
The two can be mixed in any combination, adding a whole new dimension of control to world generation.</p>
<div><p>Text prompt: A beautiful modern art museum with wooden flooring, filled with colorful paintings and curving sculptures</p><p>Text prompt: A beautiful modern art museum with wooden flooring, filled with colorful paintings and curving sculptures</p></div>
<p>The coarse 3D scene can be as simple or complex as you want.
In addition to building the coarse 3D scene out of basic blocks and walls,
you can import existing 3D assets of objects.
Objects will be restyled based on the text prompt to give a cohesive 3D world.</p>
<p>Varying the text prompt can give rise to 3D worlds with drastically different
visual styles and appearances that all share a common structure determined
by the coarse 3D scene.</p>
<div><p>Text Prompt: A serene scandinavian guesthouse bedroom with stunning views of glaciers</p><p>Text Prompt: A serene scandinavian guesthouse bedroom with stunning views of glaciers</p></div>
<h2>Building Large Worlds by Expanding and Composing</h2>
<p>Sometimes bigger really is better.
Larger worlds give more possibilities, more space, more room for your creativity to shine.
Marble offers two ways to make bigger worlds than ever before.</p>
<p>After a world has been generated, Marble allows one-step <strong>expansion</strong> to make it larger.
You are in control of this process: you can select a region of the world to
be expanded, and Marble will create more content to fill the selected region.</p>
<p>Expansion can make worlds larger. Regions of the world that previously broke
down into artifacts can become crisp and clean after expansion.
Expansion can also be used to add detail to targeted regions of a world.
Sometimes the back of a table or the far corner of a room is not a crisp
as the room's center; expanding the world in that region can improve it.</p>
<div><p>Marble can expand scenes to create larger traversable areas</p><p>Marble can expand scenes to create larger traversable areas</p></div>
<p>In addition to generating individual worlds, you can <strong>compose</strong> any number of
worlds to build out extremely large spaces with Marble's composer mode.
This composition is entirely under your control: you can choose exactly which worlds
to compose, and exactly how to lay them out relative to each other.
Composing is yet another way to build worlds that follow your creative vision.</p>
<div><p>A large train composed with Marble</p><p>A large train composed with Marble</p></div>
<h2>Exporting Worlds to 3D and Video</h2>
<p>After creating a world with Marble you have many options to export it
for incorporation into downstream projects.</p>
<p><strong>Gaussian splats</strong> are the highest-fidelity representation for Marble worlds.
They represent 3D scenes as a large set of semitransparent particles.
You can render Gaussian splats in the browser using <a target="_blank" href="https://sparkjs.dev/">Spark</a>,
our open-source cross-platform renderer integrated with THREE.js.</p>
<p>Marble worlds can also be exported as triangle meshes.
Marble can generate both <strong>collider meshes</strong>, which are low-fidelity meshes intended for
coarse physics simulation; and <strong>high-quality meshes</strong> which are intended to match the
visual fidelity of Gaussian splats as closely as possible.
Exporting worlds as meshes lets them interoperate with many industry-standard tools.</p>
<div><p>Marble can export generated worlds as Gaussian splats or triangle meshes</p><p>Marble can export generated worlds as Gaussian splats or triangle meshes</p></div>
<p>Marble worlds exist in full 3D, but sometimes a video is the best way to share a world.
You can use Marble to render generated worlds to videos with pixel-accurate camera control,
letting you frame every shot just as you imagine it.
In fact, <strong>nearly all the videos in this post were generated directly from Marble</strong>.</p>
<p>Marble can also <strong>enhance</strong> exported videos.
Enhanced videos can add detail, remove artifacts, and add dynamic elements to the scene,
while maintaining pixel-perfect camera control and adhering to the structure of the
generated 3D world.</p>
<div><p>Enhanced videos clean up artifacts and introduce motion in the scene. Notice the smoke above the chimney, the dancing flames, and the flowing water.</p><p>Enhanced videos clean up artifacts and introduce motion in the scene. Notice the smoke above the chimney, the dancing flames, and the flowing water.</p></div>
<h2>Marble Labs: A Glimpse of Future Possibilities</h2>
<p>While flexing your creativity in Marble, Marble Labs may further inspire your imagination.
This is where artists, engineers, and designers are already shaping what comes next.
From cinematic filmmaking and interactive worlds to robotics simulations and therapeutic environments,
these projects show how Marble is transforming imagination into reality.
Each one reflects a new way of building with world models, both creative and technical.

<h2>From Marble to Spatial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Marble is a state-of-the-art generative world model.
Today it lets you create worlds from diverse input types, edit them, expand them, and export them.
These capabilities give you unprecedented levels of control when creating worlds,
and are already enabling a wide variety of creative use cases across industries.</p>
<p>But Marble is just a step on our journey toward spatial intelligence.
Going forward, a key opportunity is <strong>interactivity</strong>.
Future world models will let humans and agents alike interact with generated worlds in new ways,
unlocking even more use cases in simulation, robotics, and beyond.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="issue-body-viewer" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false" id="issue-body-viewer"><h3 dir="auto">Verification</h3>
<ul>
<li> This issue's title and/or description do not reference a single formula e.g. <code>brew install wget</code>. If they do, open an issue at <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose</a> instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto">Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature</h3>
<p dir="auto"><code>--no-quarantine</code> is used to forcibly bypass Gatekeeper, which is a built-in macOS security mechanism. This is used to run unsigned/unnotarized applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">macOS Tahoe is the final release to support Intel systems, and last year Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=saqachfa" rel="nofollow">updated macOS runtime protection</a> to make it harder to override Gatekeeper. Macs with Apple silicon also don't "<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/rosetta-2-on-a-mac-with-apple-silicon-secebb113be1/1/web/1" rel="nofollow">permit native arm64 code to execute unless a valid signature is attached</a>". Finally, we are ending support for all casks that fail Gatekeeper checks on September 1st, 2026.</p>
<p dir="auto">With the above in mind, it's time to deprecate the <code>--no-quarantine</code> flag from <code>brew</code>. It intentionally bypasses macOS security mechanisms, which we already actively discourage. Deprecating now will give a decent lead time for users using it to come up with another solution or adjust their workflows.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What is the motivation for the feature?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Intel support is coming to an end from both Apple and Homebrew. This flag is primarily used to override a macOS security mechanism, which we do not want to encourage. Since we are requiring casks fulfill Gatekeeper checks next year, there is no reason to keep this flag.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?</h3>
<p dir="auto">We will provide a safer experience for our users, and stop making it easier to bypass OS-level security.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What alternatives to the feature have been considered?</h3>
<p dir="auto">None. Macs with Apple silicon are the platform that will be supported in the future, and Apple is making it harder to bypass Gatekeeper as is.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The Trump administration claims drug smugglers can be killed legally because they are combatants in an “armed conflict” with the US.</p><figure id="ec2f75f1-72da-40d7-b949-d08adf075644" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.YoutubeBlockElement"><gu-island name="YoutubeBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;2b6ea005-6934-4c79-9a27-4eb861a70ccc&quot;,&quot;assetId&quot;:&quot;akCTJr-kxmA&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:6,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0},&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false,&quot;expired&quot;:false,&quot;posterImage&quot;:&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/95b5690a271e428343815bd7206fc8316ea11dcb/0_256_4900_2756/4900.jpg&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:56,&quot;mediaTitle&quot;:&quot;Trump confirms attack on alleged 'drug-carrying submarine' in the Caribbean – video&quot;,&quot;origin&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com&quot;,&quot;stickyVideos&quot;:false,&quot;enableAds&quot;:true,&quot;iconSizeOnDesktop&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;iconSizeOnMobile&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;hidePillOnMobile&quot;:false}"><div data-chromatic="ignore"><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="36" height="23" viewBox="0 0 36 23"><path d="M3.2 0l-3.2 3.3v16.4l3.3 3.3h18.7v-23h-18.8m30.4 1l-8.6 8v5l8.6 8h2.4v-21h-2.4"></path></svg></span><span>Trump confirms attack on alleged 'drug-carrying submarine' in the Caribbean – video</span></figcaption></div></gu-island></figure><p>However, intelligence or other military assistance would not be given to an ally, including the US, if the UK had its own legal concerns about how information supplied might ultimately be used in operations.</p><p>Similar questions were raised before the raid by US B-2 bombers on Iran’s underground <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/22/how-effective-was-the-us-attack-on-irans-nuclear-sites-a-visual-guide" data-link-name="in body link">nuclear enrichment site at Fordow</a> in June, when it was believed the mission was going to be launched from the UK military base of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.

<p><img id="euler_portrait" src="https://projecteuler.net/images/clipart/euler_portrait.png" alt="Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)"></p><h3>What is Project Euler?</h3>
<div><p>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.</p><p>
The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.</p></div>
<br>
<h3>Who are the problems aimed at?</h3>
<p>The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.</p>
<p>Currently we have
1364972 registered members who have solved at least one problem, representing 220 locations throughout the world, and collectively using 113 different programming languages to solve the problems.</p>
<br>
<h3>Can anyone solve the problems?</h3>
<p>The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that may allow you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So  determined participants will be able to slowly but surely work their way through the problems.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Sixteen years ago, engineers working on the Google self-driving project conducted their first autonomous vehicle tests on the freeway that connects Silicon Valley to San Francisco. </p>

<p>The company would eventually become Waymo, autonomous vehicle testing would expand — fanning out to other cities. Eventually, the company launched commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Other cities soon followed. </p>







<p>But freeways, despite some of that early testing, would remain out of reach. Until today. </p>

<p>Waymo said Wednesday it will begin offering robotaxi rides that use freeways across San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, a critical expansion for the company that it says will reduce ride times by up to 50%. That stat could help attract a whole new group of users who need to travel between the many towns and suburbs within the greater San Francisco Bay Area or quicken commutes across the sprawling Los Angeles and Phoenix metro areas. </p>

<p>Using freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in. </p>

<p>The service won’t be offered to all Waymo riders at first, the company said. Waymo riders who want to experience freeway rides can note their preference in the Waymo app. Once the rider hails a ride, they may be matched with a freeway trip, according to the company.</p>

<p>The company’s robotaxi routes will now stretch to San Jose, an expansion that will create a unified 260-mile service area across the Peninsula, according to Waymo. The company said it will also begin curbside drop off and pick up service at the San Jose Mineta International Airport. It already offers curbside service to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/27/waymo-expands-its-curbside-robotaxi-service-to-phoenix-airport/">Sky Harbor Phoenix International Airport</a>.</p>

<p>“Freeway driving is one of those things that’s very easy to learn, but very hard to master when we’re talking about full autonomy without a human driver as a backup, and at scale,” Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov said in a media briefing with reporters. “It took time to do it properly, with a strong focus on system safety and reliability.”</p>

<p>Waymo robotaxis have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/waymo-begins-testing-robotaxis-on-la-freeways/">spotted on freeways for months</a>. TechCrunch took a test ride last year in the Phoenix area that included freeways. The company has provided trips to employees for more than a year. It also expanded testing to include closed course and simulation</p>

<p>While many assume freeway driving is easier, it comes with its own set of challenges, principal software engineer Pierre Kreitmann said in a recent briefing. He noted that critical events happen less often on freeways, which means there are fewer opportunities to expose Waymo’s self-driving system to rare scenarios and prove how the system performs when it really matters. The company chose to augment its public road driving with a combination of closed course and simulation testing.</p>







<p>This expanded testing and validation of the software was done to ensure the vehicles transition smoothly and safely between freeways and surface streets, and recognize and adapt to the unique context of the road around them, Kreitman said. </p>

<p>Waymo has also expanded its operational protocols, including how it coordinates with safety officials like California Highway Patrol, now that its robotaxis are on freeways. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	    
	    <p>Learn Prolog Now! is an introductory course to programming in <a href="https://lpn.swi-prolog.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=links">Prolog</a>. The <a href="https://lpn.swi-prolog.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=online">online version</a> has been available
since 2001, and now there is also a throughly revised version
available in <a href="https://lpn.swi-prolog.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=handheld">book form</a>.</p>
	    <p>We wanted to do two things with this course. First, we wanted to
provide a text that was relatively self contained, a text that would
permit someone with little or no knowledge of computing to pick up the
basics of Prolog with the minimum of fuss. We also wanted the text to
be clear enough to make it useful for self study. We believe that if
you read the text, and do the associated exercises, you will gain a
useful partial entry to the world of Prolog.</p>
	    <p> 
But only a partial entry, and this brings us to our second point. We
want to emphasize the practical aspects of Prolog. Prolog is something
you do. You can't learn a programming language simply by reading about
it, and if you really want to get the most out of this course, we
strongly advise you to get hold of a Prolog interpreter (you'll find
pointers to some nice ones on this website) and work through all the
Practical Sessions that we provide. And of course, don't stop with
what we provide. The more you program, the better you'll get....</p>
	    <p> We hope you enjoy the course. And whether you're using this book
to teach yourself Prolog, or you're using it as the basis for teaching
others, we would like to hear from you. Please <a href="https://lpn.swi-prolog.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=contact">send us</a> any comments/corrections
you have so that we can take them into account in later versions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>I first ran into tangent space while learning about normal mapping. It was described as this in-between space that connects surfaces and UVs, something you need to make lighting work. Nobody really explained what it was. Tutorials showed math and shader code snippets, but none of them answered the real question: what is tangent space and why does it exist at all?</p>
<p>When I first learned about normal mapping I didn’t care as long as the normals looked right. But while working on mesh processing for <a href="https://vglx.org/">VGLX</a> that answer stopped being enough. I wanted to understand what those tangent vectors <em>meant</em>, not just how to compute them. What geometry were they pointing to? What was this “space” actually describing?</p>
<p>Eventually I realized the answer wasn’t mysterious at all. Tangent space isn’t a rendering trick. It’s a geometric structure that appears any time a surface has a parameterization. I just hadn’t connected the dots before.</p>
<p>When we define tangent space using UV coordinates, it becomes the bridge between the flat world of texture coordinates and the curved world of 3D surfaces. Once you see that connection, normal mapping suddenly makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>In this article I’ll take tangent space apart piece by piece: what it really is, how it emerges from UVs, how it’s computed, and how it forms the foundation for normal mapping and other techniques that depend on local surface orientation.</p>

<h3 id="the-anatomy-of-tangent-space"><a href="#the-anatomy-of-tangent-space">The Anatomy of Tangent Space</a></h3>
<p>Tangent space isn’t a global coordinate system. It’s a local frame built independently at every point on a surface. Each point has its own small world, a tiny patch of geometry defined by the surface itself. The <em>tangent plane</em> is that world’s foundation: a flat approximation that captures how the surface behaves locally and where the space gets its name.</p>
<p>Every point on a smooth surface has a tangent plane defined by its normal vector. We can see the same idea in two dimensions: to find the normal at a point on a curve, we first take its tangent line, then rotate it ninety degrees. The tangent plane is the 3D version of that relationship.</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.shlom.dev/001/001_tangent_plane.webp"></p><p>
    Tangent plane at a point on the surface with two tangent vectors lying within the plane.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Vectors that lie on this plane are called <em>tangent vectors</em>. We can pick two perpendicular directions within the plane that together with the normal form an orthonormal basis: a local coordinate frame on the surface that we call tangent space.</p>
<p>Tangent space lets us express directions, derivatives, and transformations <em>relative to the surface itself</em> rather than the world. That's important because most shading computations depend on directions defined locally: light hitting a surface, a normal perturbation from a texture, or the direction of anisotropy.</p>
<p>But before we can use it we need to decide <em>how</em> to orient that local frame. For that we typically turn to the surface's UVs.</p>
<h3 id="how-uvs-define-orientation"><a href="#how-uvs-define-orientation">How UVs Define Orientation</a></h3>
<p>When people say "tangent space" in the context of computer graphics, they almost always mean a specific orientation of that tangent frame derived from UV parameterization.</p>
<p>A UV map gives every point on a surface a pair of 2D coordinates. These coordinates define how textures are applied, but they also do something more subtle: they tell us how movement in 2D texture space translates to movement along the surface.</p>
<p>Think of UVs as a coordinate grid draped over the mesh. Moving in the <em>U</em> direction means sliding along one axis of that grid and moving in <em>V</em> means sliding along the other. Those movements correspond to real 3D directions on the surface and those directions are exactly what defines the orientation of tangent space in practice.</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.shlom.dev/001/001_uv_orientation.webp"></p><p>
    The tangent directions follow the UV axes matching how texture coordinates move across the surface.
  </p>
</div>
<p>This connection between texture coordinates and surface geometry is what makes tangent space so useful: it anchors the surface’s local frame to something a shader can sample. The math for building that frame comes directly from this relationship.</p>
<h3 id="constructing-tangent-space"><a href="#constructing-tangent-space">Constructing Tangent Space</a></h3>
<p>The tangent vectors that define the orientation of the tangent frame are called tangent and bitangent and they describe how texture coordinates move across the surface. Together with the normal vector these directions form the <mjx-container jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="5.697ex" height="1.552ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -686 2518 686" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-1-TEX-B-1D413" d="M41 425Q41 426 51 545T62 669V675H737V669Q738 665 748 546T758 425V419H696V425Q687 517 669 555T595 607Q578 612 522 613H478V62H631V0H615Q585 3 399 3Q214 3 184 0H168V62H321V613H277H263Q164 613 134 561Q113 527 103 425V419H41V425Z"></path><path id="MJX-1-TEX-B-1D401" d="M720 510Q720 476 704 448T665 404T619 377T580 362L564 359L583 356Q602 353 632 342T690 312Q712 292 725 276Q752 235 752 189V183Q752 160 741 125Q698 18 547 2Q543 1 288 0H39V62H147V624H39V686H264H409Q502 686 542 681T624 655Q720 607 720 510ZM563 513Q563 553 548 578T518 611T486 622Q479 624 385 624H293V382H375Q458 383 467 385Q563 405 563 513ZM590 192Q590 307 505 329Q504 330 503 330L398 331H293V62H391H400H444Q496 62 528 75T580 131Q590 155 590 192Z"></path><path id="MJX-1-TEX-B-1D40D" d="M314 0Q296 3 181 3T48 0H39V62H147V624H39V686H171H265Q288 686 297 686T309 684T315 679Q317 676 500 455T684 233V624H576V686H585Q603 683 718 683T851 686H860V624H752V319Q752 15 750 11Q747 4 742 2T718 0H712Q708 0 706 0T700 0T696 1T693 2T690 4T687 7T684 11T679 16T674 23Q671 27 437 311L215 579V62H323V0H314Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="TeXAtom" data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><g data-mml-node="mi"><use data-c="1D413" xlink:href="#MJX-1-TEX-B-1D413"></use><use data-c="1D401" xlink:href="#MJX-1-TEX-B-1D401" transform="translate(800,0)"></use><use data-c="1D40D" xlink:href="#MJX-1-TEX-B-1D40D" transform="translate(1618,0)"></use></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> matrix which transforms any vector expressed in tangent space, such as a normal from a normal map, into the surface's coordinate frame at that point.</p>

The only data that links texture space to surface space are the UV coordinates. If we have those we can say that every triangle on a mesh exists twice: once in surface space, and once in UV space.

<p>Tangent vectors aren’t guaranteed to be perpendicular. UV maps are rarely uniform. Unwrapping a curved surface onto a flat plane introduces stretching and compression that can cause the tangent vectors to drift slightly away from the normal.</p>
<p>We need an orthonormal basis for stable lighting: all three axes must be perpendicular and of unit length. Assuming the UVs are mostly continuous and locally smooth, these deviations are small and can be corrected by orthogonalizing the tangent frame using the full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process">Gram–Schmidt process</a>. This ensures that the tangent and normal vectors remain perpendicular and normalized:</p>

<p>With the tangent frame defined per vertex, we can now use it to translate normal directions stored in a texture into directions on the surface.</p>
<h3 id="from-tangent-space-to-normal-mapping"><a href="#from-tangent-space-to-normal-mapping">From Tangent Space to Normal Mapping</a></h3>
<p>Normal mapping shares more than a storage and retrieval mechanism with texture mapping. It solves the same problem. Real-time meshes are low-resolution because every vertex adds cost and fewer vertices mean less geometric detail.</p>
<p>If we could afford a polygon for every pixel we wouldn’t need textures at all. But we can’t so we cheat. Textures give fragments access to data we can’t store per vertex. In normal mapping that data is surface orientation.</p>
<p>A normal map stores those orientations as colors. Each texel encodes a normal vector using its RGB channels mapped to XYZ. The blue channel dominates because most normals point roughly outward from the surface. A normal map is tinted blue for that reason.</p>

    Normal map on the right tinted blue because most normals point outward.
  </p>
</div>
<p>These per-pixel normals replace the interpolated vertex normals letting lighting respond to fine details that aren’t present in the mesh.</p>
<p>Each texel in a normal map represents a direction in local space. We sometimes say that each texel stores a direction in tangent space in the same way that surface positions in local space are said to be in model space. The name defines the frame these values are expressed in and in the previous section we derived the function that transforms them into this frame: the <mjx-container jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="5.697ex" height="1.552ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -686 2518 686" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-33-TEX-B-1D413" d="M41 425Q41 426 51 545T62 669V675H737V669Q738 665 748 546T758 425V419H696V425Q687 517 669 555T595 607Q578 612 522 613H478V62H631V0H615Q585 3 399 3Q214 3 184 0H168V62H321V613H277H263Q164 613 134 561Q113 527 103 425V419H41V425Z"></path><path id="MJX-33-TEX-B-1D401" d="M720 510Q720 476 704 448T665 404T619 377T580 362L564 359L583 356Q602 353 632 342T690 312Q712 292 725 276Q752 235 752 189V183Q752 160 741 125Q698 18 547 2Q543 1 288 0H39V62H147V624H39V686H264H409Q502 686 542 681T624 655Q720 607 720 510ZM563 513Q563 553 548 578T518 611T486 622Q479 624 385 624H293V382H375Q458 383 467 385Q563 405 563 513ZM590 192Q590 307 505 329Q504 330 503 330L398 331H293V62H391H400H444Q496 62 528 75T580 131Q590 155 590 192Z"></path><path id="MJX-33-TEX-B-1D40D" d="M314 0Q296 3 181 3T48 0H39V62H147V624H39V686H171H265Q288 686 297 686T309 684T315 679Q317 676 500 455T684 233V624H576V686H585Q603 683 718 683T851 686H860V624H752V319Q752 15 750 11Q747 4 742 2T718 0H712Q708 0 706 0T700 0T696 1T693 2T690 4T687 7T684 11T679 16T674 23Q671 27 437 311L215 579V62H323V0H314Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="TeXAtom" data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><g data-mml-node="mi"><use data-c="1D413" xlink:href="#MJX-33-TEX-B-1D413"></use><use data-c="1D401" xlink:href="#MJX-33-TEX-B-1D401" transform="translate(800,0)"></use><use data-c="1D40D" xlink:href="#MJX-33-TEX-B-1D40D" transform="translate(1618,0)"></use></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> matrix.</p>

<p>The tangent vector is transformed by the model-view matrix. Some sources say to use the normal matrix but that’s incorrect. Tangents lie <em>on</em> the surface while normals are <em>perpendicular</em> to it so each must be transformed differently.</p>
<p>The transformed tangent works well in most cases but under non-uniform scaling it can introduce slight angular drift. In practice this is often negligible but if precision matters re-orthogonalize the tangent against the normal before computing the bitangent.</p>

<p>Normal maps are only half the story. They depend on the tangent frame we built earlier. If the tangent basis isn’t generated or interpolated consistently the surface won’t match the texture that defines it. Seams appear, highlights break, and the illusion falls apart. Combining the normal map with accurate tangent frames brings low-polygon models to life revealing fine detail and form that aren’t really there.</p>

    From Paolo Cignoni: the original high-resolution model (left) is simplified to a low-poly mesh (center). By transferring detail into a normal map, the low-poly version (right) recovers nearly all the visual complexity.
  </p>
</div>
<p>The process described here follows the same principles as <a href="http://www.mikktspace.com/">MikkTSpace</a>, the standard used by most tools and engines to keep bakes and renders in sync. It defines how to build, average, and orthogonalize tangents, how to store the sign, and how to reconstruct the bitangent in the shader so the lighting behaves the same everywhere.</p>
<hr>
<p>By now the picture is complete. Tangent space gives each point on the surface its own coordinate system. UVs define how that system is oriented.

<p>Normal mapping doesn't fake bumps. It describes how the surface would curve if it had more polygons. Shading reacts the same way because light only cares about direction, not depth. At shallow angles the illusion breaks. You can see that surface detail is missing. But viewed head-on the lighting reacts as if every point on the mesh had its own direction capturing every bump and groove.</p>
<p>The same idea drives everything that uses a parameterized surface. Anisotropy, triplanar projection, detail normals, even displacement mapping, all build on the same translation between textures and surface space. Once that connection clicks what seemed like a trick becomes geometry. Tangent space isn’t a feature of shading. It’s part of how surfaces exist.</p>

Recently I've been playing around with <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> in a
virtual machine. The reason for this is that (if all goes well) some time in
December my new Framework laptop will arrive, replacing my current X1 Carbon
that is starting to show signs of old age (e.g. a keyboard where certain keys
don't always work). Framework in turn has a strong focus on Linux compatibility,
and <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/freebsd-on-framework">FreeBSD
compatibility</a> to a
certain degree. The FreeBSD foundation in turn is sponsoring work on improving
the laptop experience of FreeBSD, with a focus on Framework laptops in
particular.</p><p>In other words, if I ever wanted to run FreeBSD on a laptop, a Framework laptop
would probably be the best option, and using a new laptop means I can just wipe
the installation and replace it with Fedora if FreeBSD turns out to not be worth
it. But before I do that, I needed to figure out if it's even worth the effort
and what I might have to keep in mind.</p><h2 id="why-freebsd?">Why FreeBSD?</h2><p>Before I discuss my experience playing around with FreeBSD thus far, let's
discuss why I would even consider using FreeBSD. After all, I'm pretty happy
with my current <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/">Fedora
Silverblue</a>, minus some
paper cuts here and there. But hey, Linux wouldn't be Linux without paper cuts.</p><p>The first reason for looking into FreeBSD is the more cohesive experience it
claims (or at least its users claim) to have. That is, it's not just a kernel
but a kernel plus userspace utilities and a bunch of other things. Whether this
<em>actually</em> matters for end users is difficult to say, but as somebody who
<em>might</em> want to contribute back it could be a benefit. For example, say you want
to contribute a function (e.g. a hypothetical
<code>get_dns_without_blocking_the_calling_thread</code> function) to the
C standard library and this function requires some kernel changes. For Linux
this means contributing a change to at least two to three different projects:
the kernel, and glibc, and maybe musl for increased portability. In contrast,
for FreeBSD you just contribute to, well, FreeBSD.</p><p>The second reason is the availability of software. While some programs are not
available on FreeBSD (e.g. lua-language-server is not available) or others lag
behind a bit at times (e.g. Electron updates apparently can take a while to
become available), it seems there's a surprising amount of software available.</p><p>The third reason is the (at least claimed) stability of FreeBSD as a whole.
Combined with the availability of packages this means that in <em>theory</em> you can
get a system as stable as e.g. Fedora Silverblue, but with a lot more (and more
frequently updated) software available.</p><p>There are some additional nice-to-have's that aren't necessarily unique to
FreeBSD that are still potentially interesting. For example, ZFS seems
interesting but Btrfs is probably close enough for most people. FreeBSD also has
jails and had them for a long time, but Linux has LXC (basically FreeBSD jails),
Podman, and basically whatever else builds on top of the <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">Open Container
Initiative</a>.</p><p>Of these reason the first one is the most important one: a system that's more
cohesive, rather than something that feels more like a car engine with a bunch
of components bolted on top, each maintained by a different person.</p><h2 id="the-setup">The setup</h2><p>Until my new laptop arrives I have no spare computer available that I'm willing
to wipe <em>just</em> to play with FreeBSD, so instead I used a virtual machine.
Specifically, I have an M1 Mac Mini that I use for testing
<a href="https://inko-lang.org/">Inko</a> on macOS that is turned off most of the time, so
I used that as the VM host. This way I can play around with FreeBSD regardless
of whether I'm using my desktop computer or my laptop.</p><p>The VM was actually set up a while ago so I could more easily test Inko on
FreeBSD, using FreeBSD 14.0 which I've since upgraded to 14.3 (more on that
later). For the file system I'm using ZFS. Because this installation is used for
testing there's no desktop environment, instead it's a bare-bones server-like
setup. Note that because the VM runs on an M1 Mac Mini, the architecture is
aarch64 instead of x86-64. This in turn may affect the experience (i.e. certain
default settings may depend on this, though I don't know this for certain).</p><p>The use of a VM also means I've not yet been able how well FreeBSD supports the
Framework laptop hardware wise. I know there's been <em>a lot</em> of progress on
improving laptop support in the last few months, but until I actually have a new
laptop I can't verify this. This means the rest of this article focuses just on
the software and user experience side of things.</p><p>What follows is a collection of the various steps I took to set things up and my
experience thus far.</p><h2 id="configuring-the-network">Configuring the network</h2><p>Let's start with the first and probably most important step: setting up the
network. After all, what good is an operating system if you can't download
pictures of cats. I don't fully remember how I actually set up the network as
it's been a while, but it involved adding the following to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code>:</p><pre><code>hostname="freebsd-mini"
ifconfig_vtnet0="DHCP"
ifconfig_vtnet0_ipv6="inet6 accept_rtadv"
</code></pre><p>DHCP is managed using the "dhclient" service, which I think starts automatically
by default. This also brings me to my first small annoyance with FreeBSD: the
sensible thing to do would be something like <code>sudo service dhclient CMD</code> to do
something with the service (e.g. restart it), but instead this will fail with
the following:</p><pre><code>/etc/rc.d/dhclient: ERROR: /etc/rc.d/dhclient: no interface specified
</code></pre><p>When I first encountered this error I thought there was something wrong with the
mentioned file (<code>/etc/rc.d/dhclient</code>). After a bit of digging it turns out that
you also have to specify the interface when running the <code>service</code> command, i.e:</p><pre><code>sudo service dhclient restart vtnet0
</code></pre><p>I suppose the idea here is that you can have multiple DHCP clients for different
interfaces and want to manage them separately. Personally I'd prefer it if
leaving out the interface results in the command applying to all configured
interfaces, but I'll write this off as me just not understanding FreeBSD well
enough yet.</p><h2 id="dns-caching">DNS caching</h2><p>For DNS, FreeBSD by default just queries whatever nameservers <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>
defines, in contrast to most Linux distributions that ship something like
<a href="https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">dnsmasq</a> to handle this by default.</p><p>To enable DNS caching you have two (somewhat confusingly named) options (and
maybe more that I'm not aware of):
<a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">unbound</a> and
<a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?local-unbound">local_unbound</a>. The
difference between the two is that "unbound" is a full-blown DNS resolved, while
"local_unbound" is meant solely for responding to and caching queries from the
local machine. Or in <a href="https://grugbrain.dev/">grug speak</a>: unbound for other
grugs in network, local_unbound only for grug itself.</p><p>The <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/network-servers/index.html#_dns_server_configuration">FreeBSD handbook covers how to set up
local_unbound</a>.
The handbook mentions that the DNS servers used <em>prior</em> to enabling
local_unbound <em>must</em> support DNSSEC, otherwise DNS queries will fail. My dumb
grug brain decided to ignore that part thinking it wouldn't be relevant. As a
result I got to spend the next hour trying to figure out why DNS queries didn't
work, only to realise it's because my Mikrotik router (the upstream DNS server
that I use as a network wide DNS cache) doesn't support DNSSEC.</p><p>To resolve this, I had to figure out how to disable DNSSEC while still being
able to cache DNS queries locally. Thanks to <a href="https://www.codenicer.com/content/unbound-without-dnssec-freebsd-10">this broken looking
website</a> I
figured out you can do so by creating <code>/var/unbound/conf.d/disable-dnssec.conf</code>
with the following contents:</p><pre><code>server:
    module-config: "iterator"
</code></pre><p>Then you restart the service using <code>sudo service local_unboun restart</code> and off
you go. It would be nice if the FreeBSD handbook discussed disabling DNSSEC as
it would've saved me quite some time.</p><h2 id="changing-a-few-default-settings">Changing a few default settings</h2><p>OK so we got a working network connection and DNS caching, let's take a look at
the defaults that FreeBSD provides (or doesn't). Specifically, I read <a href="https://vez.mrsk.me/freebsd-defaults">this
article</a> a while back and was wondering
how much of the article is still relevant.</p><h3 id="aslr-and-w%5Ex-protection">ASLR and W^X protection</h3><p>First up,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">ASLR</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX">W^X</a>. The mentioned article lists a bunch
of ASLR settings though it seems to leave out a few for 64-bits executables.
Based on <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mitigations&amp;sektion=7&amp;format=html">this manual
page</a>
and the article at least the following settings are of interest for a 64-bits
system:</p><pre><code>kern.elf64.allow_wx
kern.elf64.aslr.enable
kern.elf64.aslr.honor_sbrk
kern.elf64.aslr.pie_enable
kern.elf64.aslr.stack
</code></pre><p>In my VM the defaults are as follows:</p><pre><code>kern.elf64.allow_wx: 1
kern.elf64.aslr.enable: 1
kern.elf64.aslr.honor_sbrk: 0
kern.elf64.aslr.pie_enable: 1
kern.elf64.aslr.stack: 1
</code></pre><p>For 32-bits executables it seems ASLR is disabled, though I don't know enough
about ASLR to determine if that's good or bad. For 64-bits only systems this
doesn't matter anyway.</p><p>Based on this I think the only setting worth changing is setting
<code>kern.elf64.allow_wx</code> to <code>0</code>, given this protection is widely enabled by other
operating systems.</p><h3 id="pid-randomization">PID randomization</h3><p>PID randomization is disabled by default and is enabled using the following
<code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> setting:</p><pre><code>kern.randompid=1
</code></pre><p>Whether this is useful is difficult to say. OpenBSD does this by default, while
Linux doesn't appear to enable this. I tried figuring out what a good value for
this setting is, but I haven't been able to find a good answer.</p><p>Given that it's unclear what the actual benefit of PID randomization is and that
it feels like security through obscurity, I've left this option disabled.</p><h3 id="disallow-non-root-from-reading-dmesg-and-the-likes">Disallow non-root from reading <code>dmesg</code> and the likes</h3><p>By default non-root users can read the system message buffer through <code>dmesg</code>. In
contrast, Linux (or at least Fedora) disallows this by default. Because this
buffer may contain sensitive information, I think it's a good idea to disallow
this using the following setting:</p><pre><code>security.bsd.unprivileged_read_msgbuf=0
</code></pre><h3 id="hiding-processes-of-other-users">Hiding processes of other users</h3><p>By default a user can see the processes of other users, similar to most (all?)
Linux distributions. You can turn this off using the following settings:</p><pre><code>security.bsd.see_other_uids=0
security.bsd.see_other_gids=0
security.bsd.see_jail_proc=0
</code></pre><p>For a desktop environment I would actually leave this enabled though, as it
makes debugging a little easier. For a server there's no reason for user A to be
able to see processes of user B, so it's probably best to disable this for such
setups.</p><h3 id="other-defaults">Other defaults</h3><p>There are many more defaults that may be worth looking into, but based on what I
could find most of those won't need to be changed in most cases. It certainly
doesn't seem to be as bad (anymore) as it might've once been.</p><h2 id="enabling-pkgbase">Enabling pkgbase</h2><p>OK we now have a sensible system. At this point I was still running FreeBSD
14.0, so I figured it was time to upgrade to 14.3 before doing anything else.
This brings me to this thing called
<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/action/show/pkgbase?action=show&amp;redirect=PkgBase">"pkgbase"</a>.
Basically this is a new way of updating FreeBSD installation that's still under
development but scheduled for release in FreeBSD 15. Without going into it too
deeply, FreeBSD offers (at least for now) two ways of updating your system:</p><ol><li><code>pkg</code> is used for updating individual packages (e.g. your text editor)</li><li><code>freebsd-update</code> is used for updating FreeBSD itself (e.g. from 14.0 to 14.3)</li></ol><p>The pkgbase project/thing aims to unify this so you only need to use the <code>pkg</code>
command for both. Basically it's what every Linux distribution has been doing
for decades at this point.</p><p>Until FreeBSD 15 is released you'll need to manually enable this. The <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/cutting-edge/#_converting_a_host_to_use_pkgbase">FreeBSD
handbook discusses how to do
this</a>
so I won't cover this. I did run into a few issues/quirks when enabling it:</p><ol><li>The <code>fetch</code> command from the handbook just froze and I ended up having to use
<code>curl</code> to download it instead. I don't remember why though, maybe it might've
been due to those self-inflicted DNS issues I mentioned earlier</li><li>You have to edit a config file to update to a new version. This seems a
little clunky and difficult to automate (without overwriting the entire
configuration file)</li><li>After the upgrade I ended up with a bazillion <code>.pkgsave</code> files, similar to
what <a href="https://phala.isatty.net/~amber/hacks/pkgbase">this article discusses</a>.
I ended up just removing these using the <code>find</code> command mentioned in said
article. Why were these files created? No idea, but let's hope this doesn't
keep happening</li><li>I figured you'd just run <code>pkg update</code> to update the system or maybe something
like <code>pkg update --system</code>, but instead you have to run <code>sudo pkg update -r
   FreeBSD-base</code>. It's not a big issue, but it would be nice not having to
remember the <code>FreeBSD-base</code> bit</li></ol><p>After going through this process everything did work fine, so that's nice. One
thing I'd like to see is <code>pkg</code> creating ZFS snapshots before upgrading to a new
FreeBSD version, but perhaps that's something I have to explicitly enable
somewhere (I have yet to figure this out).</p><h2 id="package-management">Package management</h2><p>The <code>pkg</code> tool itself is quite nice, and unlike <code>dnf</code> it's pretty darn fast when
it doesn't have to download anything. It also doesn't automatically update the
package database when you least expect it, instead requiring you to explicitly
run <code>pkg update</code>. I much prefer this over having to remember to use <code>dnf -C</code> to
avoid having to wait 30 seconds for it to refresh the database.</p><p>Which brings me to the downloading bit: <code>pkg</code> downloads packages sequentially,
instead of downloading them concurrently (<a href="https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/1628">a feature requested since
2017</a>). This is a bit annoying
because while I have a gigabit internet connection, the FreeBSD mirrors appear
to be limited to a speed of around 100 megabits/second. Depending on the number
of packages that need to be downloaded this means having to wait longer than
strictly necessary. Considering every Linux package manager that I know of
supports concurrent downloads, this is a bit annoying.</p><p>When it comes to packages, FreeBSD has a surprising large number of packages
available, and from what I can tell most of them are also up to date, though
there are some exceptions. For example, stylua isn't available in the Fedora
repository (though you can use <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/yorickpeterse/stylua/">my copr
repository</a>),
while FreeBSD does have it (though the version is almost one year out of date).
This will differ per package and its popularity, so your mileage may vary.</p><p>A weird quirk I ran into is that for certain packages <code>pkg info NAME</code> only works
for installed packages, which the output of <code>pkg help info</code> doesn't make clear.
It seems the closest equivalent is <code>pkg search -f NAME</code>, though that gives you
the information of <em>all</em> packages that match <code>NAME</code>, not just the package with
that exact name.</p><p>To summarise, <code>pkg</code> feels similar to <code>dnf</code>: a bit clunky and not as fast as it
should be, but manageable.</p><h2 id="firewalls">Firewalls</h2><p>The world of firewalls on Linux is a bit of a mess, with different distributions
using different firewalls (<a href="https://launchpad.net/ufw">ufw</a>,
<a href="https://firewalld.org/">firewalld</a>, etc). Fedora uses firewalld which is...OK,
but I'm not a fan of the confusing CLI.</p><p>FreeBSD has not one, not two but <em>three</em> competing firewalls: PF, IPFW, and IPF.
All seem to come with their own configuration syntax and semantics (e.g.
ordering of rules). It seems PF is generally recommended because it's based on
PF from OpenBSD, though FreeBSD uses a fork which has diverged a lot and (from
what I could find) wasn't (isn't?) kept in sync with OpenBSD's PF.</p><p>I haven't figured out yet which one should be used, but there being <em>three</em>
competing firewalls feels more like something you'd expect in Linux and not a
BSD.</p><h2 id="resource-usage">Resource usage</h2><p>On a totally different note, it's refreshing to see how few processes a basic
FreeBSD installation runs: about 50 or so (fewer if you disable all the TTY
console processes), compared to the 100-150 or so you'll end up with when using
a stock Fedora Server installation. This isn't necessarily better (and depending
on what those processes do might be worse), but at least in theory it means
fewer moving parts to worry about.</p><h2 id="cli-quirks">CLI quirks</h2><p>This is something that does annoy me far more than it should: the differences
between GNU and BSD CLI programs. Specifically, GNU programs tend to support
both short and long form options (e.g. <code>-h</code> and <code>--help</code>) while the FreeBSD
toolchain seems to stubbornly reject this and generally only supports short
options. The output of <code>--help</code> is often also utterly useless on FreeBSD. Take
the <code>ln --help</code> command for example, on Fedora it outputs the following:</p><pre><code>$ ln --help
Usage: ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME
  or:  ln [OPTION]... TARGET
  or:  ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY
  or:  ln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...
In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.
In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.
In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.
Create hard links by default, symbolic links with --symbolic.
By default, each destination (name of new link) should not already exist.
When creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links
can hold arbitrary text; if later resolved, a relative link is
interpreted in relation to its parent directory.

[options and a bunch or extra stuff here]
</code></pre><p>Meanwhile on FreeBSD:</p><pre><code>$ ln --help
ln: illegal option -- -
usage: ln [-s [-F] | -L | -P] [-f | -i] [-hnv] source_file [target_file]
       ln [-s [-F] | -L | -P] [-f | -i] [-hnv] source_file ... target_dir
</code></pre><p>Oh OK, I guess doing the sensible thing is too much to ask for so let's just use
<code>-h</code>:</p><pre><code>$ ln -h
usage: ln [-s [-F] | -L | -P] [-f | -i] [-hnv] source_file [target_file]
       ln [-s [-F] | -L | -P] [-f | -i] [-hnv] source_file ... target_dir
</code></pre><p>What about the manual page? Isn't FreeBSD better in that regard? Well, no: the
manual page for <code>ln</code> on both Fedora and FreeBSD is about the same, except the
GNU version of <code>ln</code> supports a whole bunch of extra long options that aren't
present on FreeBSD (e.g. <code>--no-target-directory</code>).</p><p>Another annoyance is that FreeBSD is more pedantic about the position of
options when combined with sub commands. For example, <code>bectl -h create</code> works
(though it's output is the same as <code>bectl -h</code>) but <code>bectl create -h</code> produces an
error, then proceeds to spit out the same output as <code>bectl -h</code>.</p><p>Of course you can install GNU coreutils (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1043103/">or the Rust rewrite if you like not
having a working system</a>), but then you might
as well stick with Linux in the first place.</p><p>To be honest, I feel the FreeBSD core utilities are a straight up downgrade
compared to GNU coreutils. Maybe I'll change my mind over time.</p><h2 id="zfs">ZFS</h2><p>I haven't had the time yet to play around with ZFS beyond creating a new boot
environment using <code>bectl</code>, so I can't comment on ZFS just yet.</p><h2 id="jails">Jails</h2><p>Similar to ZFS I have yet to play with jails. I want to look into
<a href="https://bastillebsd.org/">bastille</a> specifically since it seems to be the
closest to <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> (i.e. it has a concept similar to
<code>Dockerfile</code>/<code>Containerfile</code> files), but I haven't had a chance yet.</p><h2 id="profiling">Profiling</h2><p>This is something I still need to figure out: what is the FreeBSD approved way
of profiling userspace applications? On Linux you'd use something like
<a href="https://perfwiki.github.io/main/">perf</a> to collect your data and
<a href="https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot">hotspot</a> to visualize it, but on FreeBSD it
seems there are only a bunch of different rocks you have to bang together
yourself.</p><p>For example, there's <a href="https://dtrace.org/">dtrace</a> but I haven't been able to
figure out how you use it without having to write a bunch of D scripts yourself.
There are also some other FreeBSD specific tools such as
<a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pmcstat&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+14.3-RELEASE+and+Ports&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html">pmcstat</a>,
but I have yet to figure out how to use them.</p><p>Basically what I want is something like <code>profile-the-damn-thing PROGRAM</code>
followed by <code>visualize-the-damn-thing DATA</code> and that's it. If you happen to know
of such a tool, please let me know!</p><p>While not related to the technical merits of FreeBSD, I do feel this is worth
mentioning. The FreeBSD community is...difficult. What I mean by this is that it
feels much like the average Linux community in the early 2000s: it looks
down on others (in this case Linux users), it appears rather unwelcoming and at
times downright toxic. Any time you mention anything vaguely related to
Linux you'll inevitably cause somebody to go on a massive rant about how FreeBSD
is better than Linux.</p><p>It also seems there's a general dislike for change, even if said change is for
the better. It feels like a form of "tech boomerism": change is bad because it's
not what we're used to, even if the end result is in fact better.</p><p>Of course not everybody is like this, but at least the two main community
platforms that I know of (the FreeBSD subreddit and the FreeBSD forums) seem to
suffer from this problem quite a bit.</p><p>Solving this results in a bit of a circular problem: for a community to become
more mature and less toxic it needs to grow and attract a more diverse pool of
members, but this only happens if those wanting to join aren't pushed away in
the first place by the behavior of existing members. I don't know how you'd
break such a cycle short of having good leadership and a lot of luck.</p><h2 id="conclusions-thus-far">Conclusions thus far</h2><p>Thus far I'm not entirely sure if I'd see myself using FreeBSD, though I'd have
to play around with FreeBSD on physical hardware to get a better understanding.
For example, I'm curious how well KDE works when installed using the upcoming
FreeBSD 15 installer (I'd use GNOME but due to its systemd dependency it's
unlikely to keep working on FreeBSD in the future). I'm also curious about how
well the Framework laptop is supported.</p><p>Besides that there is a bigger question that I need to answer for myself: given
the quirks of FreeBSD, what actually would the benefit of using it be? Sure
there's ZFS, but Linux has Btrfs (and technically you can also use ZFS on Linux,
even if it's painful). Sure, the FreeBSD kernel and userspace are part of the
same project, but does that matter if the kernel doesn't necessarily perform
better or faster and the userspace is subpar compared to that of Linux? Sure,
FreeBSD may use fewer resources but does that matter if your WiFi card isn't
supported?</p><p>The only way to answer these questions is to give FreeBSD a try on my Framework
laptop when it arrives later this year, at which point I'll write a follow-up
article to share my thoughts.</p></div></section></div>]]></description>

<hr>
<p dir="auto"><em>In addition to</em> the JavaScript runtime, yt-dlp also requires the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs">yt-dlp-ejs</a> component in order to operate the JS runtime.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE:</strong> This component <strong>is already included in all of the <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest">official yt-dlp executables</a></strong>.<br>
Similarly, if you've installed &amp; upgraded the yt-dlp Python package with the <code>default</code> extra (<code>yt-dlp[default]</code>), <strong>then you already have the yt-dlp-ejs component</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you've installed yt-dlp another way, then please refer to <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS#step-2-install-ejs-challenge-solver-scripts">section 2 of the EJS wiki page</a> for more details.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Support for YouTube without a JavaScript runtime is now considered "deprecated." It does still work somewhat; however, format availability will be limited, and severely so in some cases (e.g. for logged-in users). Format availability without a JS runtime is expected to worsen as time goes on, and this will not be considered a "bug" but rather an inevitability for which there is no solution. It's also expected that, eventually, support for YouTube will not be possible at all without a JS runtime.</p>

<hr>
<h2 dir="auto">Notes to package maintainers</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you are maintaining a downstream package of yt-dlp, we offer the following guidance:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The <code>yt-dlp</code> repository, source tarball, PyPI source distribution and built distribution (wheel) are still licensed under The Unlicense (public domain); however, <strong>when the <code>yt-dlp-ejs</code> package is built, it bundles code licensed under ISC and MIT.</strong> This is the primary reason why <code>yt-dlp-ejs</code> was split off into a <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs">separate repository</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp-ejs" rel="nofollow">PyPI package</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If <code>yt-dlp</code> is packaged as a Python package in your repository, <code>yt-dlp-ejs</code> would ideally be packaged separately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>yt-dlp-ejs</code> is technically an <em>optional</em> Python dependency of yt-dlp, but YouTube support is deprecated without it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Each version of <code>yt-dlp</code> will be pinned to a specific version of <code>yt-dlp-ejs</code> and yt-dlp will reject any other <code>yt-dlp-ejs</code> version.</strong> Refer to yt-dlp's <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/2025.11.12/pyproject.toml#L59"><code>pyproject.toml</code></a> for the pinned version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If your repository packages <code>yt-dlp</code> <em>as the zipimport binary instead of as a Python package</em>, you can use <code>make yt-dlp-extra</code> to build the zip executable with <code>yt-dlp-ejs</code> included. (The Makefile will look for the <code>yt-dlp-ejs</code> wheel in the <code>build</code> subdirectory, or the extracted built distribution in the <code>yt_dlp_ejs</code> subdirectory)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>deno</code>, <code>nodejs</code>, <code>quickjs</code> and/or <code>bun</code> should be <em>optional</em> dependencies of <code>yt-dlp</code>. But again, YouTube support is deprecated without <em>one</em> of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">While <code>yt-dlp-ejs</code> and the external JavaScript runtimes are currently only used with YouTube, yt-dlp's usage of these may be expanded in the future (and necessarily so)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If this guidance is insufficient, or if you are a developer integrating yt-dlp into your software and you have further questions, please open a <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/new?template=6_question.yml">new GitHub issue</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Transmeta was the last big IPO of the <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/when-the-dotcom-bubble-burst/">dotcom era</a>, launching Nov 7, 2000. Some analysts call its $273 million IPO the last successful tech IPO until the <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/google-incorporated-september-4-1998/">Google IPO in 2004</a>. Transmeta didn’t completely fit in to the dotcom era, because they were a hardware company. But they were still a technology company, and if their plans had gone well, they would have sold their product to dotcoms, but it didn’t work out that way for them. In this blog post we explore what happened to Transmeta.</p><h2>Was Transmeta truly the last of the dotcoms?</h2><figure id="attachment_36221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36221"><a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/what-happened-to-transmeta-the-last-big-dotcom-ipo/transmeta_crusoe_tm5600_2/" rel="attachment wp-att-36221"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Transmeta_crusoe_tm5600_2.jpg?resize=300%2C250&amp;ssl=1" alt="Transmeta Crusoe CPU" width="300" height="250" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Transmeta_crusoe_tm5600_2.jpg?resize=300%2C250&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Transmeta_crusoe_tm5600_2.jpg?w=576&amp;ssl=1 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-36221">Transmeta was a CPU company, a pure technology play as investors cooled on Internet companies. Its IPO feels like the end of the dotcom era, even though the line feels a bit fuzzy..</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve heard Transmeta called the last successful IPO of the dotcom era, or the last of the big dotcom IPOs. But it’s an oversimplification to say there weren’t any successful technology IPOs between Transmeta and Google. One very notable exception is Paypal, who ran an IPO in February 2002 that raised $70.2 million.&nbsp;<em>The Register </em>even hailed Paypal as the return of the Internet IPO.</p><p>And it wasn’t just that dotcom IPOs grew scarce after November 2000. On February 7, 2002, <em>Forbes</em> stated that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2002/02/07/0207paypal.html">only 34 IPOs in total</a> launched between September 11, 2001 and February 6, 2002, compared to 87 in the same-year-earlier period, and 240 between September 11, 1999 and February 6, 2000. That date is significant. <em>Any&nbsp;</em>bad news can spook investors, and the 9/11 attack did, in fact, spook investors.</p><p>So where the dotcom-era ended is a fuzzy line, but it makes sense to draw the line at Transmeta. Technology IPOs and particularly Internet IPOs became much more scarce after Transmeta, and the size of the IPOs shrunk too. The distinction of Transmeta being a technology stock, rather than an Internet stock, also suggests investors were already cooling on Internet stocks by November 2000.</p><p>Transmeta was a CPU company. But they may be better known for their most famous employee than for any of their products. When Linus Torvalds completed his degree, there was a great deal of speculation where he would take his day job. Transmeta was not the place most technologists expected him to land. But it allowed him to continue his work on the Linux kernel while staying close to a key part of the hardware, the CPU.</p><p>In the year 2000, the CPU wars were cooling down. A few years earlier, there had been four companies not named Intel producing Socket 7 CPUs. But only two of them survived to compete in the next generation, and only AMD was able to compete at <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/amd-athlon-amds-game-changing-cpu-from-1999/">anything other than the entry level</a>. And even though the <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/cyrix-processor-chips/">Cyrix</a> name survived, it was the competing IDT technology under the hood.</p><h2>How its CPUs worked</h2><p>Transmeta wanted to take a different approach. They were going to produce an x86 compatible CPU, but they were going to use a translation layer to do it. They would design a very efficient CPU, and in theory, they could place any translation layer in front of it that they wanted. Emulating PowerPC or ARM would have been possible if they saw the need to do it. But the <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/why-is-x86-so-popular/">popular yet inefficient x86 architecture</a> was a more inviting target.</p><p>AMD was doing something similar, essentially translating x86 instructions into RISC instructions for efficiency, but they did it in hardware rather than software like Transmeta did. AMD never had any designs on putting any different translation layer in front of it.</p><p>Transmeta did ship two CPUs, but weren’t able to reach the same levels of performance AMD and Intel were reaching. Its first CPU, <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/transmeta-crusoe-cpu/">Crusoe</a>, could run at <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/pentium-iii-launched-feb-28-1999/">Pentium III</a>-like speeds but was about 30% less efficient, so a 700 MHz Crusoe ran like a 500 MHz Pentium III. Transmeta didn’t have fabrication plants of its own, so IBM handled manufacturing of its first-generation CPUs.</p><p>The Transmeta Efficieon, released in 2004, competed with the Pentium 4 but peaked at 1.7 GHz. With the Pentium 4 reaching 2.4 GHz speeds, the Efficieon had trouble competing. And AMD’s release of the <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/athlon-64-how-amd-turned-the-tables-on-intel/">Athlon 64</a> didn’t help matters. Selling 32-bit CPUs in a 64-bit world was going to be tough. TSMC and Fujitsu handled manufacturing for the Efficieon.</p><p>Transmeta CPUs saw use in low-power laptops, thin clients, and embedded applications. The Bluecoat web filtering appliance used them for a while. But if you owned a computer at that time, it’s much more likely to have had an AMD or Intel CPU in it. If you used one at work, it was even more likely to have an AMD or Intel CPU in it.</p><h2>What happened to Transmeta</h2><p>Even though Transmeta was the last big dotcom era IPO, they were not among the survivors. Torvalds resigned from Transmeta in June 2003.</p><p>What happened to Transmeta was that in 2005, Transmeta shifted to licensing intellectual property rather than selling CPUs. And in January 2009, Transmeta sold itself to Novafora, who in turn sold the patent portfolio to Intellectual Ventures, a private equity company. Novafora ceased operations in August 2009, just seven months later. Intellectual Ventures licenses the Transmeta intellectual property to other companies on a non-exclusive basis. Transmeta ended up being more like <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/netscape-the-ipo-that-went-boom-on-its-way-up-and-down/">Netscape</a> or <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/va-linux-the-biggest-dotcom-ipo/">VA Linux</a> than <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/red-hats-successful-1999-ipo/">Red Hat</a>.</p><p>Today, Transmeta hardware is rare enough to be interesting as a collectible. But there aren’t a lot of people nostalgic for it, and that probably keeps prices low.</p><div itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" itemscope="" itemprop="author"><p><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dave_farquhar_181px.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dave_farquhar_181px.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1" width="100" height="100" alt="" itemprop="image"></p><div><p>David Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author.

  <p>To be fair, it didn’t <em>go </em>anywhere. You can still boot up a copy, mess around with evolution, atmospheric conditions, and continental drift like it’s 1990… but it’s not 1990. We have 32 years of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6ctb-Pb3lc">computing advances</a> at our backs and yet no SimEarth 2. Sure there’s <a href="https://www.superworldbox.com/">WorldBox</a> and <a href="https://drtardigrade.itch.io/worldhistorysim">Worlds</a> and a bunch of awesome planet generation projects, (<a href="https://experilous.com/1/blog/post/procedural-planet-generation,">1</a>, <a href="https://drtardigrade.itch.io/worldhistorysim">2</a>, <a href="https://demiansky.itch.io/songs-of-the-eons">3</a>) but none allow me to play with plate tectonics, currents, or any of the “deep” factors underlying how the Earth really works.</p><p>Sometime last year, I decided against writing Will Wright a letter, begging him to spend hundreds of hours making a SimEarth 2. Instead, I did <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">what any good programmer would do</a> and decided to devote thousands of <em>my own</em> hours into the same thing. This blog describes my first step toward such a goal: describing well over a year’s worth of work and the many detours taken along the way. While there’s a long way to go from here, I’m very happy to share my progress to this point, and promise to follow up with a “part 2” at some future date.</p>

  <h2>Polygon-Based Approaches</h2><p>My first dozen or so approaches at realistic world generation involved generating polygons on a sphere, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation">Delaunay Triangulation </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi Tessellation</a>. These fancy-sounding processes allow us to cheaply turn a 2D surface (or indeed, spheres, thanks to<a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1843-planet-generation/"> this amazing blog</a>) into a number of polygons for representing geographic features. Once I wrapped my head around wrapping Voronoi polygons around the North and South Poles, I managed to get something vaguely passing as a planet generated, and applied a nice water shader.</p>

<p>The fundamental issue with a polygon-centric approach is one of tectonic plate realism: plate collisions require an incredible number of polygons to model correctly. Increasing the number of polygons in a <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> &amp; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a> environment proved prohibitively expensive, so I turned to an old favorite: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?ab_channel=Programmersarealsohuman&amp;v=s7wLYzRJt3s">C++</a>. After finding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BrendanGalea">Brendan Galea’s excellent YouTube channel</a> and building the first of the three demos above in <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2 </a>&amp; <a href="https://www.vulkan.org/">Vulkan</a> I realized what a titanic task writing a custom engine for this project would be, and went back to the (Unity) drawing board.</p>

  <h2>Cubemap-Overlap-Based Approaches</h2><p>Frustrated with the poor performance of my polygonal approach, I began to research Unity’s performance optimization tools. I chunked up and parallelized the Voronoi tessellation to no avail. I tried rearranging memory to no avail. Clearly, something about doing this amount of math on the CPU was beyond current processing capabilities… but what about the GPU?</p><p>Like most programmers, I’d heard of the legendary power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPUs</a>, but had only really harnessed it via graphics programming or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA </a>(for my <a href="https://www.patrickcelentano.com/music-ex-machina">Music ex Machina</a> project). While I had some experience writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader">conventional shaders</a>, learning how to write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute_kernel">compute shaders</a> seemed like a massive undertaking… but what option did I have? I had no room left on the CPU.</p><p>Put simply, compute shaders are capable of applying a GPU’s heavily-parallelized workflow to arbitrary data, meaning I could simulate a world full of tectonic plates one “pixel” at a time. Once I figured out how to represent potentially world-spanning plates as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_mapping">cubemaps</a>, I managed to create a neat compute shader-based simulation with plates colliding, subducting, and emerging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading">seafloor spreading</a>… but never deforming.</p><p>While I liked the direction this adventure in compute shaders had taken me, I needed some new technique which could realistically deform crust at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary">convergent plate boundaries</a>.</p>

  <h2>Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics</h2><p>Inspiration can come from anywhere, and as luck would have it, the inspiration for my next step forward came from watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9bKXY0OMxc">this physical simulation</a> of a plate boundary. The use of sand for crust material makes realistic deformation possible… and reminded me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling-sand_game">falling sand games</a> which were so popular when I was a kid. Could I simulate little bits of “crust” which could bump into one another, forming mountains and valleys? Could I use the same system for air and water?</p><p>After a little digging, I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics">Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics</a>, a technique commonly used in place of cellular fluid simulations. If I could just implement SPH on a sphere using my newfound knowledge of compute shaders, I’d have the fundamentals of a truly-unique planet sim. With a clear implementation strategy in mind, how long could implementing it possibly take?</p><p>As it turns out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSMS5INYs-c">quite a while</a>.</p><p>Writing compute shaders is difficult, as is debugging and profiling them. I found myself performing true computer “science” on multiple occasions: forming a hypothesis about the performance impact of some new algorithm on the GPU and verifying it through good, old-fashioned experimentation. I learned a great deal in the process, most notably that <em>computation is cheap and memory is expensive! </em>More in depth, I’d highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DLOJPSxJEg">this incredible talk on compute shader performance optimization</a>. I owe much of this project’s success to that talk.</p>

I hope to build a great deal on this foundation, slowly approaching a fully-featured planetary simulation. Here are a few thoughts as to what might be next:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Create map modes to display the direction of the currents (at present you can only see the waves moving in the right direction)</p></li><li><p>Show the air currents in some clever way, perhaps with a moving cloud layer on top of the planet</p></li><li><p>Allow the wind to pick up moisture from warm bodies of water and precipitate it back on land… including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_shadow">rain shadows</a> caused by mountain ranges</p></li><li><p>Allow currents to warm up the surrounding air, causing phenomenon like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Current">North Atlantic Current's</a> miraculous warming of Europe.</p></li><li><p>Add hotspots, volcanoes, and a variety of rock types</p></li><li><p>Optimize it to run on hardware beyond my Surface Book 2</p></li></ul><p>Here’s to blog #2, with whatever new features that brings!

    <p>Yesterday, I checked out the Goodnotes app because I’m planning to buy an iPad to give note-taking on it a try again. I opened it and I saw that it has updated to Goodnotes 6. I looked through the changelogs, and what? There are AI-integrated features now, which, as far as I’m aware, can’t be turned off.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> And the option to buy a lifetime license? Gone.</p>
<p>I bought the previous “lifetime” version of the app, but for WHAT, since I have to pay for the subscription to access the newest features. Sure, I can switch back to the outdated version, but if I had known this would happen, I would’ve just gone for the yearly subscription (even though I try to avoid them). It would’ve been cheaper anyway.</p>
<p>Sadly, everything is going in this direction. You can have a subscription for almost everything now. From food delivery apps to beer subscription.</p>
<p>Companies prey on those who forget to cancel their free trial. So far, it only happened once to me, but thankfully, I managed to get my refund. But not everyone might feel like going through the refund process, because companies make it intentionally hard by creating friction - hiding it deep into their websites or adding extra unnecessary steps like forcing you to reach out to the support. People might just sigh, mutter “this bloody subscription rahhh,” and cancel it so it won’t charge them again.</p>
<p>It’s funny how “ownership” in the digital world has become an illusion. You don’t really own your apps, your music, or even your tools anymore. You’re just renting access until someone decides to move the paywall. It’s convenient, sure, but it also feels like losing control over something that used to be ours.</p>
<p>Market values steady revenue streams over fair ownership. The subscription model rewards companies not for making better products, but for finding better ways to keep us paying indefinitely. They won’t disappear, not unless they find something more profitable. Maybe they’ll start sucking out our souls for profit?</p>

<p id="6b31b0de-e39e-4bbb-8bcc-33d7e0f40336">The race to achieve AGI (artificial general intelligence) has pushed constituents to invest in and build data centers at a pace far outstripping our ability to make them. Manufacturers are struggling to keep up with AI demand, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/server-dram-prices-surge-50-percent" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/server-dram-prices-surge-50-percent">ongoing DRAM shortage</a> is proof of this, with memory kits costing more than double what they did just a few months ago.

As the news cycle suggests, AI money doesn't wait for anyone, so hyperscalers are now switching to QLC NAND-based SSDs to avoid these backorders. Picking QLC over TLC allows them to maintain costs while achieving sufficient endurance for cold storage.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="bc16009f-644a-4a4c-b8ab-37a2d25d11c7"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

<p>Perkeep (<a href="https://github.com/perkeep/perkeep/issues/981">née Camlistore</a>) is a set of open source formats, protocols, and software for modeling, storing, searching, sharing and synchronizing data in the post-PC era. Data may be files or objects, tweets or 5TB videos, and you can access it via a phone, browser or FUSE filesystem.</p>

<p>Perkeep is under active development. If you're a programmer or fairly technical, you can probably get it up and running and get some utility out of it. Many bits and pieces are actively being developed, so be prepared for bugs and unfinished features.</p>

<p>Things Perkeep believes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your data is entirely under your control</li>
  <li>Open Source</li>
  <li>Paranoid about privacy, everything private by default</li>
  <li>No SPOF: don't rely on any single party (including yourself)</li>
  <li>Your data should be alive in 80 years, especially if you are</li>
</ul>
