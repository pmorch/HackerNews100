<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/TCcDaGLiCnr7Ks2UgWuSxzndIqI=/400x0/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg?lossy" srcset="https://images.macrumors.com/t/TCcDaGLiCnr7Ks2UgWuSxzndIqI=/400x0/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/G5kpWmOYMm6YRLimQ-1nwt8205A=/800x0/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/itGwY1Pztpi8Q6lHbms2pZHfaUw=/1600x0/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/qYFkvKDN0oid7zg8LRNHUk8G6_0=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale()/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 697px" alt="iOS 18 ChatGPT" width="1825" height="1027"><br>Apple had been in discussions to participate in a funding round for OpenAI that is expected to raise approximately $6.5 billion. However, Apple recently dropped out of the talks for reasons that remain unclear. The funding round is set to close this week.</p>
<p>The development comes just a month after <em>WSJ</em> reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/29/apple-reportedly-in-talks-to-invest-in-openai/">considering an investment in OpenAI</a> as part of a fundraising effort that could value the AI company at over $100 billion. The high valuation reflects the intense competition in the artificial intelligence sector that OpenAI helped ignite with ChatGPT's launch in late 2022.</p>
<p>While Apple has stepped away, other major tech companies remain involved. Microsoft, which has already invested $13 billion in OpenAI, is expected to contribute about $1 billion to this latest round. Nvidia is also reportedly in talks to participate.</p>
<p>The news of Apple's withdrawal may surprise some, given the company's recent moves in the AI space. Apple previously announced plans to integrate ChatGPT into Siri on iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia later this year. This integration will allow Siri to display ChatGPT responses directly with user permission. However, recent reports of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/open-ai-division-for-profit-da26c24b">turmoil within OpenAI's ranks</a> as it pursues a for-profit structure, may have factored into Apple's decision not to pursue the investment.</p>
<p>That said, Apple's planned ChatGPT integration for its platforms is still expected to proceed before the end of the year. The company has said that iPhone, iPad, and Mac users will be able to use ChatGPT for free without creating an account, while ChatGPT Plus subscribers will be able to access paid features on Apple devices.</p>

This is particularly true for long inputs, where the KV cache in transformer-based LLMs grows linearly with sequence length. By efficiently compressing inputs, LFMs can process longer sequences on the same hardware. For example, compared to other 3B-class models, LFMs maintain a minimal memory footprint.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6557a2b6957fcb7aeb0efcf0/66f9a9b9624c365c96251a0c_desktop%20graph.png" loading="lazy" width="854" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 900px" alt="Fig. 2.

For example, audio and time series data generally requires <em>less</em> featurization in operators due to lower information density, compared to language and multi-modal data.

        <p>Y Combinator is arguably the most successful early-stage VC fund or accelerator ever. The issue, however, is that they never truly grasped the factors behind their success, which is why YC's peak is already behind them—it’s likely all downhill from here.</p><p>In particular, Sam Altman didn’t grasp what truly made YC successful. He did what he does best: being ambitious and scaling it up! To him, this seemed obvious—there were plenty of companies eager to join YC, and since predicting which ones would succeed was unreliable, why not just accept more? Even if it meant a few more failures, everyone knows VC is a power law game—one extra winner compensates for many flops. Plus, more companies naturally mean more management fees and carry!</p><p>What he failed to grasp (or didn’t care about, since the effects take a long time to unfold) is that reputation and prestige are everything. Take Harvard, for instance: the reason they don’t accept a higher percentage of applicants isn’t because they can’t scale—they have the resources to build more facilities or could even switch to remote like YC—but because they choose not to. Harvard knows its success lies in exclusivity. If everyone could get in, no one would care. People don’t attend Harvard for the lectures, which are all on YouTube anyway, but because being accepted there is a status symbol. Harvard thrives on its reputation and prestige—or simply, its brand.</p><p>Founders want to raise money from the top VCs—e.g. Sequoia or a16z—for the same reason. Sure, these firms offer some of the best support to their portfolio companies, much like Harvard offers top-tier lectures, but that's not the main draw. The real reason to raise from elite VCs is the prestige and legitimacy it confers on your startup. It signals to prospective employees, customers, and future investors that your company is the real deal. Naturally, this signal weakens the easier it becomes to secure funding from these VCs.</p><p>If the main appeal of joining YC isn’t the mentorship but the prestige of being able to write "YC W22" in your Twitter bio and on your company’s landing page, then they've got a problem because you can't scale that arbitrarily. What Sam initiated, and what YC continues to do, is trade their reputation capital for real capital (i.e., more money). However, they’ll soon realize that once their reputation capital is exhausted, rebuilding it will be nearly impossible. Put simply, once YC becomes uncool – which might have already happened – you can’t make it cool again.</p><p>We’re already witnessing the decline of YC in the current batch. For instance, one of the many "AI code editors" YC funded, <a href="https://x.com/CodeFryingPan/status/1840203597478539477?ref=unfashionable.blog">PearAI</a>, is simply a clone of another YC-backed, open-source AI code editor called <a href="https://www.continue.dev/?ref=unfashionable.blog">Continue</a>. Unsurprisingly, the PearAI team doesn’t appear <a href="https://x.com/that_anokha_boy/status/1840476530536780072?ref=unfashionable.blog">super competent</a>. People on Twitter were quick to <a href="https://x.com/RhysSullivan/status/1840461449371812289?ref=unfashionable.blog">mock the project</a>, and as a reaction, Garry Tan (CEO of YC) retweeted a <a href="https://x.com/amaldorai/status/1840476104592900571?ref=unfashionable.blog" rel="noreferrer">post</a> defending it.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ekvtmdn/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-30-at-10.36.21.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1098" height="364"></figure><p>This is a telling defense. While he is likely correct about the legality of copying Continue's code, that completely misses the point. The issue isn't that PearAI did something illegal—it's that they got funded by YC with nothing more than a codebase copied from another YC-backed company. This shows that (1) YC is willing to fund just about anything, (2) they’re not doing any real due diligence, and (3) they don't particularly care about their existing portfolio companies. If PearAI can secure funding, it means anyone can, and the YC brand loses much of its prestige.</p><p>YC is no longer an exclusive club where membership signals legitimacy—it’s becoming a broad index of tech startups. This decline will continue until cool, innovative companies no longer see any reason to apply.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Marginalia Search now properly supports phrase matching. This not only permits a more robust implementation of quoted search queries, but also helps promote results where the search terms occur in the document exactly in the same order as they do in the query.</p><p>This is a write-up about implementing this change. This is going to be a relatively long post, as it represents about 4 months of work.</p><p>I’m also happy and grateful to announce that the nlnet people reached out after the run of <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_107_nlnext">the grant</a> was over and asked me if I had more work in the pipe, and agreed to fund this change as well!</p><h2 id="the-old-design">The old design</h2><p>Previously the positions for each term in the documents were stored in an approximate fashion. 56 bits were assigned to each word, and each bit corresponded to a set of positions in the document, with a sentence-level granularity. This can be very loosely thought of like a bloom filter.</p><p>To deal with quoted search queries, the search engine would try to guess relevant word n-grams and store them in the index along with the rest of the keywords. “Steve Jobs” was simply stored as the keyword <em>steve_jobs</em>. It would be logistically impossible to store all word n-grams present in every document due to combinatoric explosion, so limiting heuristics were needed to identify which were likely to be important. This used both grammatical analysis and word lists like wikipedia titles.</p><p>This covered cases like “to be or not to be”, because it was such a well known sequence of words and identifiable as a word n-gram, for many queries these approaches worked adequately, but a number of cases cropped up where the approach did not work.</p><p>A good example comes from a friendly detractor on hacker news, who had discovered that the query [the vietnam of computer science] turned up nothing but vietnamese computer scientists, and nothing about the famous blog post “ORM is the vietnam of computer science”.</p><p>What the search engine did when it saw the query was first to remove stop words:</p><pre>   <s>the</s> vietnam <s>of</s> computer science
</pre><p>then it expanded the query with possible n-grams to help the query</p><pre>  vietnam, computer, science -&gt; computer_science
</pre><p>It’s seems pretty straightforward from this processing that it would indeed find computer scientists in Vietnam.</p><p>To adequately serve the query, exact positions were needed so we could get away from the word ngram guessing game and sentence-level position matching.</p><h2 id="representing-positions-lists">Representing positions lists</h2><p>Thankfully, this is well trodden ground in information retrieval, and the literal textbook solution is to just store a compressed list each position of a term in the document as a list of positive integers.</p><p>The positions themselves tend to be on average small, but the distribution is fairly wide and large values are a common sight. To give an intuition for this, I’m attaching some plots.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/pos-abs.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/pos-abs.png" title="plot of the number of document positions for a given length"></a><figcaption>Plot of the number of document positions for a given length.</figcaption></figure><p>The data can be better behaved by calculating the difference between each position, to get a list of smaller numbers. The statistical distribution is still fairly diverse, but since words tend to either be common and appear in many sentences, or cluster up in a few sentences of a document, you get a lot of very small values when you look at the relative difference in position.</p><p>Plotting the difference between position values, we see the number of small values has drastically been increased. There is still a tail of larger values, but it tapers off much faster.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/pos-delta.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/pos-delta.png" title="plot of relative distance between adjacent positions in a sample of positions lists"></a><figcaption>Plot of relative distance between adjacent positions in a sample of positions lists.</figcaption></figure><p>For compression of a list positive integers, several options are available. I initially implemented Elias gamma coding, which is a simple variable bit width code that is effective for very small numbers.</p><div><p><strong>Elias Gamma Code:</strong></p><p>In short, you count the significant bits in the number to be encoded, subtract one from that count, and then you prefix the number to be encoded with that many binary zeroes.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> To encode the byte 56, or 0011'1000<sub>2</sub> in binary, note that there are 6 significant bits:</p><pre>   00<u>11'1000</u><sub>2</sub>
</pre><p>We prefix the significant bits with 6-1 = 5 binary zeroes</p><pre>   <u>000'00</u>11'1000<sub>2</sub>
</pre><p>And thus we’ve arrived at the 11 bit encoding of the number 56! Just mind that the leading zeroes are significant.</p></div><p>This is frequently used in combination with other techniques as part of a compression algorithm, but in our case since the data to be compressed was already a series of small positive numbers, Elias gamma seemed like a good choice as-is.</p><p>In terms of functionality, this worked very well, but later during performance testing it was found to not be quite performing well enough. Since the code is variable bit and not octet aligned, it’s always going to be a bit slow on modern hardware.</p><p>Plan B was to use varints instead. The varint coding scheme is also relatively easy to implement, and more importantly quite a lot more CPU-friendly.</p><div><p><strong>Varints:</strong></p><p>The flavor of varint encoding chosen uses the highest bit as a continuation flag. The value to be encoded is grouped into segments of 7 bits, and all the the least significant grouping of bits has its 8:th bit set as a continuation flag.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> To represent the number 700 (0010'0101'1000<sub>2</sub>), we first break into groups of 7 bits</p><pre>  <s>0000'0</s>100<sub>2</sub>  (bits 10-7, padded to byte)
  <s>0</s>101'1000<sub>2</sub>  (bits 7-0, padded to byte)
</pre><p>Then set the highest one bit to signal continuation for all but the lowest byte</p><pre>  <u>1</u>000'0100<sub>2</sub>
  <u>0</u>101'1000<sub>2</sub>
</pre></div><p>There’s a large number of varint variants and relatives, but this is favorable for our use case as it favors decoding efficiency over encoding and deals well with the common case of just having a single small value to encode.</p><p>Since the statistical distribution of the data is strongly biased toward small numbers, that case can be broken out into its own if-statement when decoding the values. This is very branch predictor friendly and makes the code about 20% faster on real-world position data.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>byte</span> b <span>=</span> buffer<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>();</span>

Overall this is approximately twice as fast as the gamma code implementation, and half as fast as just reading the data from an array.</p><p>There are even faster vectorized implementations of varints (e.g. Lemire et al’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08990">Stream VByte</a>), but I’ve been unable to get them to perform well in Java, largely due to inadequate access to the <a href="https://www.bazhenov.me/posts/rust-stream-vbyte-varint-decoding/">PSHUFB instruction</a>.</p><p>There are also reasons to expect Stream VByte may not perform well in this particular instance: The length of the lists follows via eyeball statistics an apparent pareto distribution that is heavily biased toward very short lists, average length is less than 4, and because of this looking at vector operations is likely not going to be as useful as it might seem.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/poslistlength.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/poslistlength.png" alt="log-log graph of the distribution of positions lists lengths, showing a linear descending slope"></a><figcaption>Log log plot of the number of positions lists lengths for a given length. Outlier at 512 is because this is the maximum permissible length, longer lists are truncated.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="size-and-shape-of-the-coded-data">Size and shape of the coded data</h3><p>When switching to varint, a concern was that varints might use more disk space compared to the gamma code representation, but it turned out to largely be an even match.</p><p>The gamma coded data lost a lot of its lead due to each positions list being rounded up to be byte aligned as a whole, and varints actually have a size benefit when representing numbers in the 32-127 range, a somewhat common case in the data.</p><p>If we plot the output size as a function of input size, we can see the two schemes are a relatively even match throughout the most common magnitude of values under 1000.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/bitsizes.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/bitsizes.png" alt="Graph of bit widths of the gamma and varint coding schemes as a function of the magnitude of the input, showing two lines crossing at a bit width of 5, with varint becoming more advantageous after that point"></a><figcaption>Number of bits in output as a function of number of bits in input for the gamma and varint codes</figcaption></figure><p>Even though the choice in coding scheme doesn’t seem to have an impact on the size of the position data, the position data does require additional disk space! About 85 GB per index partition, of which there are currently 9, so roundabout 700 GB in total.</p><p>It was possible to redeem this disk space usage by shrinking and compressing the priority index, see Appendix A.</p><h2 id="position-spans">Position spans</h2><p>In the old design, each keyword would have a number of bit flags associated with it, containing information about whether it for example appeared in the title or in a heading.</p><p>This is bit mask approach is again a fairly blunt tool, still useful in some areas, but since we’ve improved the position resolution by encoding positions lists, we also stand to benefit from a new approach for coding information about a individual occurrences of a word.</p><p>The solution is very similar to the positions list. For each field, we store a coded list of start and end positions.</p><p>The span data for an imaginary document may look like this:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Field</th><th>Positions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Title</td><td>1,6</td></tr><tr><td>Heading</td><td>7,10,32,38,100,105</td></tr><tr><td>Nav</td><td>11,20</td></tr><tr><td>Code</td><td>50,72</td></tr><tr><td>Body</td><td>1,11,20,50,72,120</td></tr><tr><td>Ext link</td><td>170,210</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At this point the tools for representing lists of positions already exists, we just need to store a few more of them, with the added requirement that the size of the list is even, and the implied semantics that even positions are the starts of spans, and their succeeding odd position marks the end.</p><p>This data is stored in a separate file from the positions and will be an additional disk read, but since we’re always interested in all the data, we can consume all the data at once.</p><p>This turned out to be a very nice improvement that permits the search engine to index more of the documents.</p><p>Previously, without this degree of precision information, the search engine would discard information from e.g. code blocks, because it tended to be less useful. Now it can simply assign matches in code blocks a lower score, without outright discarding the data.</p><p>The search engine stores all the information of the document in one go, separating the actual contents of the document from a block of e.g. external link texts by a segment of empty positions to prevent phrase matching from happening across different fields.</p><p>This is different from how general-purpose search engines tend to work, and a concession to the needs of web search, where you’re virtually always interested in all the fields at once, and have an interest in budgeting the number of disk read instructions.</p><p>Intersecting term positions lists with these fields lists is relatively easy and performs very well due to the extreme cpu-friendliness of the operation.</p><p>In practice the intersection algorithm switches between a linear and a binary search depending on the length of the data.</p><h2 id="phrase-matching-and-ranking-factors">Phrase matching and ranking factors</h2><p>At this point, all the prerequisites are available to do phrase matching, but a few changes are still needed.</p><p>To make the most of phrase matching, stop words need to go. The stop word list was never very long in the first place, but turning “to be or not to be’ into ‘? be ? ? ? be?’ is not great. Indexing every word grows the index and increases the amount of data that needs to be fetched in many queries, but it really can’t be helped.</p><p>The ranking algorithm also needs fairly extensive modification and tuning.</p><p>Several new ranking factors are available with the change:</p><ul><li><p>The presence of the search query as a phrase in the document</p><p>We can apply negative offsets based on the position of each keyword in the query to the corresponding position lists from the document being ranked, and if we find any case where these offset positions list overlap, we have a phrase match!</p><p>We can also use these positions matches and intersect them with the field data, to lift information about <em>where</em> in the document the match is, whether it’s in the title or a heading, or in a navigational element?</p><p>This is a bit of a liability for a flavor of SEO spam called query sniping, where a document is crafted to specifically contain a query, and have it rank well because of its verbatim match.</p></li><li><p>The minimum distance between the keywords in the query in the document</p><p>Finding the smallest distance between two items in a pair of lists is relatively trivial, but extending this to cover an arbitrary number of lists this turned out to be a surprisingly difficult calculation that was fairly resistant to optimization of the algorithm.</p><p>The trick that still permitted this to still be used turned out to be to attack the input data instead, and to omit positions lists if they were too long from the calculations, effectively excluding frequently occurring words from the calculations. This appears to have small impact on the quality of the ranking signal, as the omitted words tends to appear all over the document and don’t add a lot of information.</p></li><li><p>The distance in the document before you’ve seen all keywords once</p><p>Early occurrences are generally a good thing, although this is a secondary signal at best and should not be dialed up very high, as there are many examples of documents where a sentence appears early, despite being a somewhat mediocre search result.</p></li></ul><p>There are also the old factors, such as two versions of BM25, and even some lingering word ngram data. Putting all of this together and making it work well is a lot of tuning, and it’s a pretty protracted process of manual adjustments.</p><p>It seems to be in relatively good place now, but there’s always more adjustments to be done.</p><p>All the ranking factors can be explored using the <a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/qdebug?q=platonic+solid">qdebug utility</a>, which is a tool I built to diagnose ranking problems. It’s very much a debug tool and not very user friendly, but I’m including a link mostly to highlight that this article is very much skimming the surface.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>This has been a relatively a large change. The PR consisted of over 200 commits, with a delta of nearly 20,000 lines of code changed, owing to the fact that this breaks binary compatibility for the index and hasn’t been possible to merge until it’s all done.</p><p>Overall it’s been a success. There are queries that the search engine can answer now that it could not answer before this work, and many queries that were decent before perform better now.</p><p>There’s always some element of gamble when making a change like this, you don’t know how well it will work until it’s live in production, after one or more months of work.</p><p>The feedback cycle in web search engine development is very long, probably longer than anything I’ve ever encountered in programming. Rebuilding the index in the test environment, which has about 10% the data of production, took 2.5 days. It was possible to get that down to 1.5 days toward the end of this process, but it’s still very long, and even still no tests or test environments can quite do production justice.</p><p>Overall the approach taken to improving search result quality is looking at a query that does not give good results, asking what needs to change for that to improve, and then making that change. Sometimes it’s a small improvement, sometimes it’s a huge game changer. But it does seem like a solid vehicle for moving the search result quality in the right direction.</p><h2 id="appendix-a-shrinking-the-priority-index">Appendix A: Shrinking the priority index</h2><p>The search engine uses two indexes, a full index that, as it says on the box, indexes everything. It contains a mapping from keywords to a record with a document id, some document metadata, and a pointer into the positions file.</p><p>The search engine also has a priority index, which only contains documents that are in one way or another seems strongly related a keyword. Maybe it appears in the title, or an inbound link text, or some other relevance signal.</p><p>The priority index exists to help the search engine find the most relevant items first, as queries execute on a timer, and will terminate the search after a configurable time limit has passed and return the best of what’s been dug up so far.</p><p>To keep things simple, the priority index was built using the same code as the full index, meaning it would store redundant information, and also contain structures supporting operations like fast intersection with other documents lists.</p><p>What the index was actually used for though was just to iterate through the document id:s from start to finish for each keyword.</p><p>Originally the priority index was about 175 GB, but removing the metadata and additional indexing structures from the file, leaving it just an uncompressed list of document ids, brought the size down to 85 GB.</p><p>This already redeems the cost of adding positions data, but at this point I was curious to see how much smaller it could get if I compressed the ids. Trouble is that since these ids are constructed by concatenating different components, they have a really nasty statistical distribution that does not favor basic difference-coding schemes.</p><p>There’s a longer rationale behind these constructed id:s in the post <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/">Absurd Success</a>, but in short they’re constructed to allow intelligent re-use of id:s to keep the document ids in a 64 bit long.</p><p>The document id construction scheme looks like this:</p><table><thead><tr><th>bits</th><th>purpose</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0-26</td><td>document ordinal</td><td>unique within document id, not<br>persistent over time</td></tr><tr><td>26-56</td><td>domain id</td><td>id of the domain</td></tr><tr><td>56-63</td><td>ranking component</td><td>used to change the order of<br>domains in the index so that<br>important ones appear earlier</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This gives the difference between subsequent document id:s has a statistical distribution with 3 modes:</p><ul><li>Bits 0-26 change by a small amount</li><li>Bits 25-56 change by a small amount, bits 0-26 change unpredictably</li><li>Bits 56-63 change by a small amount, bits 0-56 change unpredictably</li></ul><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/docidhisto.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/docidhisto.png" alt="A histogram of the magnitude of difference between adjacent document ids, showing three modes"></a><figcaption>A histogram of the magnitude of difference between adjacent document ids in a priority document list</figcaption></figure><p>The first mode is by far the most common, and benefits from something like the Elias gamma code, whereas the second and third modes are so large as to behave very poorly under such a scheme.</p><p>I ended up constructing a compression scheme for this by hand.</p><p>First a code is specified using two bits, then an unspecified number of bits is consumed to increment the document id. Each code is designed to cater to the modes mentioned before, and a fourth case is added to bootstrap the initial value of the list.</p><p>Expressed in terms of decoding:</p><p>The case when code=0:</p><ul><li>ordinal += read Elias gamma coded value</li></ul><p>The case when code=1:</p><ul><li>ordinal = 1 + read Elias delta coded value</li><li>domain += read Elias delta coded value</li></ul><p>The case when code=2:</p><ul><li>rank += read Elias gamma coded value</li><li>domain = read uncompressed value</li><li>ordinal = read uncompressed value</li></ul><p>The case when code=3:</p><ul><li>read uncompressed document id</li></ul><p>Here Elias delta is a coding scheme similar to Elias gamma, but favors slightly larger values.</p><div><p><strong>Elias Delta Code:</strong></p><p>The Elias Delta code is similar to the gamma code, except instead of using base 1 to code the bit width, you use the Gamma code.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> To encode the byte 56, or 0011'1000<sub>2</sub> in binary, note that there are 6 significant bits:</p><pre>   00<u>11'1000</u><sub>2</sub>
</pre><p>Gamma code the number of significant bits - 1:</p><pre>  gamma(6-1) = gamma(101<sub>2</sub>) = <u>00</u>101<sub>2</sub>.
</pre><p>Prefix the significant bits of 56, 11'1000<sub>2</sub>, with gamma(6-1)</p><pre>   <u>001'01</u>11'1000<sub>2</sub>
</pre><p>And thus we’ve arrived at the 10 bit encoding of the number 56!</p></div><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/bitsizes2.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_111_phrase_matching/bitsizes2.png" alt="Graph of bit widths of the gamma, delta and varint coding schemes as a function of the magnitude of the input"></a><figcaption>Number of bits in output as a function of number of bits in input for the gamma, delta and varint codes</figcaption></figure><h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3><p>This was remarkably efficient. The compressed index is just 10 GB, down from the initial size of 175 GB, before irrelevant metadata was removed, indexes cleaned out, and any compression applied.</p><p>This result is better than zstd compression (25 GB), which isn’t a huge surprise since custom compression schemes can often outperform general purpose algorithms when you have misbehaving data with strong human-understandable idiosyncrasies like in this case.</p><p>Compressing the full index is significantly more complicated, but likely something I’ll look into in the future (though it will mean another very large re-write…)</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          <div>
            <h2 id="ffmpeg-71">FFmpeg 7.1</h2>
<p><strong>FFmpeg 7.1</strong> has been <a href="https://git.ffmpeg.org/gitweb/ffmpeg.git/tag/refs/tags/n7.1">released today</a>: a major release with numerous features that nevertheless maintains API compatibility with 7.0.<br>
It has a full native VVC decoder, a new MV-HEVC decoder, a new LC-EVC decoder, a new xHE-AAC decoder, it finishes the IAMF decoder and it also adds Vulkan hardware encoding, VVC encoding, ARM64 and RISC-V optimizations and other hardware accelerations.</p>
<p>Knowing that <strong>FFmpeg 7.1</strong> is a LTS release, this is a major feat, in addition to the already very strong FFmpeg <strong>7.0</strong> release.</p>
<h2 id="vvc-decoder">VVC decoder</h2>
<p>We decided, a couple of years ago, to do our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versatile_Video_Coding">VVC</a> decoder, instead of using the official <em>vvcdec</em> decoder.<br>
There are a tons of reasons to prefer native decoders inside FFmpeg, notably for better control of the codebase, but mostly because it allows sharing code between decoders, and this is especially true for the <em>VVC</em> decoder <em>(and other MPEG decoders)</em></p>
<p>The VVC decoder was a large project, notably done by <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> students last year, and the main decoder landed in FFmpeg 7.0, but it was not complete, and was therefore marked as <em>experimental</em>.<br>
The continuation of the work, notably numerous extensions but also optimizations were implemented, which makes that now the decoder can decode DVB streams. This means that the decoder is now production ready in <strong>7.1!</strong>. Congratulations to the amazing VVC team, and mostly <em>Nuo Mi</em> and <em>Frank Plowman</em>.</p>
<p>This decoder shares some code with the H.264 and the HEVC decoders, which means that some assembly optimizations are shared or that most SEI parsing is shared <em>(for example, the H.274 Film Grain should work with VVC)</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, the VVC decoder is already fast on ARM and on x86, with new optimizations written, and the reuse of the optimizations from the previous decoders!</p>
<h3 id="more-vvc">More VVC</h3>
<p>In addition to the decoder, the <strong>vvcenc</strong> encoder is now available in FFmpeg, through the external library, so you should be able to encode directly in VVC in FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Finally, the <em>Intel</em> folks have added VVC hardware decoding through <strong>QSV</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="lc-evc-mv-hevc">LC-EVC, MV-HEVC</h2>
<p>On the MPEG side, two new codecs were added to the codebase: <strong>MV-HEVC</strong> and <strong>LC-EVC</strong>.</p>
<p>MV-HEVC is the 3D version of HEVC, that is used in recent iPhones and in the Apple Vision Pro.<br>
While technically, it’s not a new codec, but an extension of a codec, adding this to the codebase required large refactoring of the HEVC decoder <em>(which got us to fix some longstanding HEVC bugs)</em> and it required new APIs to manage Multi-Views in FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Please note that <em>x265</em> should be able to encode in MV-HEVC now!</p>
<p>Very different from MV-HEVC, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCEVC">LC-EVC</a> decoder was also added to this release too.<br>
LC-EVC is a layer enhancement codec, sponsored by <a href="https://www.v-nova.com/lcevc-enhanced-video/">V-Nova</a> and called <em>MPEG-5 Part 2</em>. It adds layers to a main codec, to allow to improve it: you can use LC-EVC with H.264, HEVC or AV1 base layers.</p>
<p>Adding this codec was quite complex for FFmpeg architecture, because we don’t have many enhancement codecs, and this made us leverage the Stream Groups concept that we’ve added also for IAMF. I expect that we see more of those type of codecs, in the future.</p>
<p>The <strong>LC-EVC</strong> decoder is now in FFmpeg, and it depends on an open-source external library, that is BSD-licensed!</p>
<p>Thanks <em>James</em> and <em>Anton</em> for those 2 decoders!</p>
<h2 id="xhe-aac-iamf">xHE-AAC, IAMF</h2>
<p><em>Lynne</em> spent a large part of her past year to work on a native <strong>xHE-AAC</strong> decoder.</p>
<p>Again, this required large preparatory work to prepare this new decoder. A lot of refactoring of the AAC decoder was necessary to support USAC and other features that got us this new xHE-AAC decoder.</p>
<p>As we’ve not seen many xHE-AAC streams in the wild, we’re not 100% sure of the compliance, but we’re sure it will improve when more samples are available.</p>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, the <a href="https://aomedia.org/">AOM</a> <strong>IAMF</strong> decoder/demuxer, introduced in 7.0 got a lot of fixes and testing, so I’m now quite sure that the <strong>IAMF</strong> decoder is now production ready!</p>
<p>To finish on the audio side of things, support for <strong><a href="https://github.com/google/liblc3">LC3</a></strong>, the Low Complexity codec from Google, was also wired through the official external library.</p>
<h2 id="vulkan-hardware-encoding-and-other-hardware-news">Vulkan hardware encoding and other hardware news</h2>
<p>On of the other major feature of <strong>7.1</strong> done by <em>Lynne</em> is the support of encoding through <strong>Vulkan</strong>.<br>
I know, it feels like yet another hardware encoding library, but maybe this one will unify all the other ones, since it’s part of Vulkan standardisation.</p>
<p>FFmpeg now supports H.264 and HEVC encoding through Vulkan. AV1 will come soon, I hope. <em>(Vulkan decoding was done in 6.1)</em></p>
<p>We also now have a <strong>D3D12 encoding</strong> for HEVC, after we added D3D12 decoder <em>(Decoding of H.264, HEVC, AV1 and others were added in 7.0)</em>.</p>
<h3 id="misc">Misc</h3>
<p>I would also like to mention, as the maintainer of <a href="https://www.videolan.org/developers/libdvdnav.html">libdvdread</a>, that <strong>DVD</strong> seeking was added to FFmpeg <strong>7.1</strong>, which makes the DVD playback complete.</p>
<p>And finally, the <strong>YUVJ</strong> pixel format is officially deprecated!<br>
A method for YUV colorspace negotiation for codecs and filters was added in this release to fix this problem.<br>
The topic of YUVJ removal has been a recurring one for the last 5 years. I’m very happy that this is solved!</p>
<p>And like with <strong>dav1d</strong>, a large number of optimizations for <strong>ARM64</strong> and <strong>RISC-V</strong> were added to accelerate FFmpeg decoding on non-x86 platforms. Your mobiles will love it :)</p>
<h2 id="final-words-and-lts">Final words and LTS</h2>
<p>This is a very strong release, with a lot of important features and continuing the work that was started for <strong>7.0</strong>, which was a huge release because of the multi-threading development.<br>
I don’t recall an FFmpeg release with this many codecs added in a single release.</p>
<p>This release is more than 2700 commits, and the diff is around 211kLoC!<br>
Thanks so much to <em>Andreas, Michael, Anton, James, Rémi, Lynne, Niklas, Zhao, Nuo Mi, Ramiro, Marvin, Haihao</em> and <em>Martin</em>, who are our top contributors for this release!</p>
<p>As for me, I consider FFmpeg 7.1 an LTS release, like the 5.1 release, so it’s a good release to bet on!</p>
<p><strong>I hope you Enjoy this release!</strong></p>

Instead, we use Clickhouse with a short data retention period in a completely separate platform and strong access controls to store this information and make it available to customers.</p><p>I hope this demystifies our data processing efforts a bit, so we can talk about the engineering side of things.</p><h2>Why data engineering is different at ngrok (and probably not what you think)</h2><p>We hired the first full time data person (it’s me!) in the summer of 2023. Before we filled that position, the data platform was set up by our CTO, Peter. Because of that, our data engineering (DE) team (or rather, our data role) is part of the Office of the CTO and effectively works horizontally across our engineering organization.</p><p>One artifact of having such a small team, our DE work is much closer aligned to holistic backend engineering work than the term "data engineering" often implies.&nbsp;</p><p>While I’m primarily responsible for the Data Platform and all associated services and tooling, I frequently find myself working on the actual ngrok products (as opposed to “just” the data lake). That includes architecture proposals and designs that span multiple teams and services and are mostly tangentially related to the “core” data work. And yes, I do write a fair bit of Go because of it.</p><p>As such, the majority of the data modeling work (i.e., SQL) is done by subject matter experts, which is very different to DE roles in many other organizations. In other words, I write very little SQL on a day to day basis and won’t usually be the person that writes a data model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Within those subject matter experts, some people write reusable, well-structured dbt models, while other people focus on ad hoc analysis (based on these models) via our BI tooling in Superset. It’s worth noting that our entire organization has access to Superset and most data models and sources!</p><p>For instance, our growth team implements a huge amount of our actual data models and knows the business, product, and finance side much better than I do. They’re much better equipped to build sensible, complex, and maintainable data models that properly answer business questions.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to that, we have a small-but-mighty infrastructure team that owns and operates our core infrastructure, such as Kubernetes, as well as the developer tools that are instrumental in keeping <em>every</em> engineering team (and, of course, ngrok itself!) running smoothly.</p><p>This particular setup—viewing DE as a very technical, general-purpose distributed system SWE discipline and making the people who know best what real-world scenarios they want to model—makes our setup work in practice.&nbsp;</p><h2>Our data platform architecture</h2><p>Now that you know how our (data) engineering org is structured, let’s talk about what we actually built and maintain and how it evolved over time.</p><p>ngrok as a product is a large, distributed, worldwide networking system with very high uptime guarantees, huge traffic volumes, and a large set of inherently eventually consistent (and often, ephemeral) data that can be difficult to interpret. Think about how a TCP connection works, and what steps are involved with making and routing it!</p><p>In other words, even our basic architecture was a bit more complex than “just copy your Postgres database somewhere to query it offline.”</p><h3>ngrok's data architecture in the past</h3><p>Despite that, our original architecture was utilitarian and relied more heavily on AWS tools than our contemporary architecture, which is very open-source focused.&nbsp;</p><p>Its primary goal was to get the most important data sets we needed—Postgres, important external data, as well as some events—to effectively run finance reporting, abuse, and support.</p><p>On the <strong>batch</strong> ingestion side, we used <a href="https://airbyte.com/">Airbyte</a> open source on Kubernetes to ingest third-party data via their respective APIs. We utilized the <a href="https://ngrok.com/docs/http/oauth/">ngrok OAuth module</a> to do authentication (as we do for all our open-source services that require an ingress controller).&nbsp;</p><p>Airbyte wrote JSON files, where we determined the schema with manual runs of a Glue parser and several Python scripts to create the target schemas, as well as another Glue job to write the target schema as Iceberg.</p><p>At the time, we did not have an orchestrator available and relied on Glue internal schedules. This meant we had no alerting or any integration with on-call tools.</p><p>We used AWS DMS here to get our core Postgres data, writing <code>parquet</code> data to S3. This was a once-a-day batch job.</p><p>On the <strong>streaming</strong> side, we streamed event metadata via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/firehose/">AWS Firehose</a>, writing JSON data to 2 different S3 locations.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ed707844acb1ccf1ccb700/66f5ad4d164a1823bfd96722_AD_4nXfYyBtcqFhu7pqpNygGwL3lAUmYOmSD_hHRwR8oHKL2XehTo_cQ2R2-C-a1LRGuAOrLSqZXWPORD-y9K445_E7XQmd6H5pMH141Y-Er0qLnz4SqOmlclRwcDNbwWlYMBsk4IbNyokm2-2BkFLBqMk_UEeI.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>For <strong>analytics</strong>, all our data was (and still is) eventually stored as <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/">Apache Iceberg</a> and generally queried via AWS Athena, although the legacy architecture did have some datasets that were based on raw JSON in the mix. We used AWS Glue as a meta store.</p><p>Our SQL models were actually SQL <em>views</em> directly in Athena, with no version control or lineage, that were directly created in production and queried via <a href="https://preset.io/">Preset</a> (which is the managed cloud version of Superset).</p><h3>Expensive queries and unreasonable models</h3><p>Our eventing system, which is core to understand system behavior, relied on a very pricy AWS Firehose pipeline, as the way we split and organized events required us to both write JSON data (creating hundreds of TiB of data), as well as maintain data platform specific Go code in otherwise purely customer facing services (see the later section on <a href="https://ngrok.com/blog-post/how-we-built-ngroks-data-platform#scaling-apache-flink-scala-and-protobuf-to-650-gbday">Apache Flink, Scala, and Protobuf</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the data became straight up <strong>impossible to query</strong> (or very expensive), as queries would time-out despite tuning with partitions and other tricks. The entire system was on borrowed time from the start.&nbsp;</p><p>It was also hard to impossible to reason about our models, since we lacked any of dbt‘s (or a comparable tool's) creature comforts, such as lineage, documentation, version control, auditing, tests, and so on.</p><p>Without expecting you to be able to grok the details here, imagine getting asked why a certain field looks suspicious (if not to say, wrong), at the very end of this lineage tree:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ed707844acb1ccf1ccb700/66f5d7ac250e4813d857a27f_66f5d7a54f68c947eb236d78_fry-lineage-tree(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>…without having this lineage tree available, of course.</p><p>On a similar vein, not having a central orchestrator, alerting, and auditing for our data jobs was an operational challenge (you can learn more about how we solved those two issues <a href="https://ngrok.com/blog-post/how-ngrok-uses-dagster-to-run-our-data-platform">here</a>).</p><p>Our data stack was also not integrated very deeply in our Go monorepo and tooling, missing things like Datadog monitors and metrics, good test coverage, or style guides and enforcements via CI (see the <a href="#collaborating-on-data-and-infra-in-a-go-monorepo">Working in a go monorepo</a> section).</p><p>Lastly (at least for the scope of this article), Airbyte and Glue have been a challenge to get right, but we’ll tell you how we did a few <a href="#wrestling-schemas-and-structs-between-airbyte-and-glue">sections from now</a>.</p><h3>ngrok's data architecture now</h3><p>Our modern data platform is more heavily based around open-source tools we self-host on Kubernetes, dogfooding ngrok, with some AWS native tools in the mix.</p><p>To solve these challenges, a simplified, contemporary view of our current architecture looks like this.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ed707844acb1ccf1ccb700/66f5b443bca0929628977694_AD_4nXeesX1V23GIlojpvnKKGgezRvIO8obStqkECKBYFnORDls08RPlz51sBerc0szjpeEGcrkKIvQaRVxwsxKSX6BwEyEJ1tp8NK4xTSton0K8tnFTbtr-7JdWJVcxKLmU2jaiLSrmM5h6VdUc4nxeMg1H3EqS.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All our <strong>batch</strong> ingestion is now run and orchestrated via Dagster, which I’ve <a href="https://ngrok.com/blog-post/how-ngrok-uses-dagster-to-run-our-data-platform">written about previously</a>. We still use <a href="https://airbyte.com/">Airbyte</a> and still use ngrok to do so, but write directly to Glue and maintain our schemas as Terraform by querying the Glue API.</p><p>For <strong>streaming</strong> data (which is where most of our volume and complexity comes from), we now run <a href="https://flink.apache.org/">Apache Flink</a> to consume Protobuf messages directly from Kafka, rather than rely on Firehose and internal services. We’ll also cover this in more detail in a bit.</p><p>Our database ingestion is still using DMS, but now mostly relies on streaming writes, which are faster and more efficient (when responding to a support request, you don’t want yesterday’s data!).</p><p>For <strong>analytics</strong>, we heavily rely on dbt now, as well as self-host the open-source version of <a href="https://superset.apache.org/">Apache Superset</a>. We also added a hosted version of the <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/documentation">dbt docs</a>, of course also dogfooded behind an ngrok endpoint.</p><h2>Technical deep-dives and problem-solving</h2><p>While we cannot get into <em>all</em> the details of all the challenges we solved in the past 12 or so months, here are some challenges I found especially interesting as a software engineer.</p><h3>Collaborating on data and infra in a Go monorepo</h3><p>Most of ngrok's code base is written in Go and exists in a monorepo. We run <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> for build tooling, as well as Nix as a package manager. This allows us to have reproducible developer environments, as well as reasonably fast compile, build, and by proxy, CI times.</p><p>As most of our data infrastructure exists in Python and Scala, we had to adapt our workflow to this environment, as it is important to us to integrate the data environment with the rest of the engineering organization at ngrok.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking from experience, having a completely separate data engineering team or department will eventually result in a fragmented engineering environment, with many bespoke paths that are not applicable to all team members, usually causing huge support and maintenance burdens on individual teams (e.g., maintaining two or more iterations of a CI/CD system).</p><p>Having one deployment system all engineers use is much easier and can be maintained by one infrastructure team:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ed707844acb1ccf1ccb700/66f5b45c4af04a7348c9e74c_AD_4nXereSxb1LwbF3gQkWmaRIiaTWnLerkCOe1LQC7UkXb1fHsoBFVsObM61xQOrKuUxci1VFe8EJJifGOqG9Kp4CrkcnYMklYglRboEOYzE4T4y_ZO-mYYaPMB665HXIK_bTfjnVrqSHR5Las7xKwwypB19ZaF.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>I find this is often an artifact of the DE roles not being equipped with the necessary knowledge of more generic SWE tools, and general SWEs not being equipped with knowledge of data-specific tools and workflows.</p><p>Speaking of, especially in smaller companies, equipping all engineers with the technical tooling and knowledge to work on all parts of the platform (including data) is a big advantage, since it allows people not usually on your team to help on projects as needed. Standardized tooling is a part of that equation.</p><p>For instance, we have an internal, Go-based developer CLI, called <code>nd</code>, that does a lot of heavy lifting (think “abstract <code>kubectl</code> commands for half a dozen clusters”). We also use it to run diffs between a developer’s branch and expected state, for instance to enforce formatting and code styles. Our CI runners run NixOS.&nbsp;</p><p>So, for our data work, enforcing standards around dbt models involved a custom Nix package for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/shandy-sqlfmt/">shandy-sqlfmt</a>, which we use as a standard for formatting all our dbt models, as well as integration into our <code>nd</code> tool, so developers (as well as CI) have access to <code>nd sql fmt</code>, just as they have <code>nd go fmt</code>.</p><p>While this <em>does</em> involve additional work for me, it ensures data tooling is never the “odd one out” and ramping onto data work (or vice versa) is much less of a cognitive shift.</p><p>Other integrations we've added over time include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Bespoke, modern Python tooling (not only for our data tools), such as <code>poetry</code> and <code>ruff</code>, as well as enforcement of style and static analysis via CI.</li><li>Smart <code>sbt</code> caches for Scala, since Scala + Bazel is not something we’ve explored in depth.</li><li>Datadog monitors and metrics, including custom metric interfaces for all our data tools.</li><li>Integration in our on-call tooling, such as Slack alerts, OpsGenie integration, and others.</li><li>Various custom Nix derivations.</li></ul><h3>Wrestling schemas and structs between Airbyte and Glue</h3><p>A more "data specific" challenge we've dealt with are complex schemas in Airbyte that often don’t match the actual data or are otherwise incompatible with our query engine, which is something I’m sure a lot of you are familiar with.</p><p>With a team of one, I can’t reasonably write individual jobs for individual tables or sources that handle all corner cases, as we simply have too large and diverse a set of data sources. Myself and others <em>have</em> to rely on code-gen and automated processing. This holds true for all data tools, not just Airbyte.</p><p>Originally, we wrote JSON files to S3, which supported the arbitrary data and schema changes that might happen, and ran AWS Glue <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-crawler.html">crawlers</a> on top of these files to detect the schema and create "raw" tables.&nbsp;</p><p>JSON is conceptually nice for this, since it can deal with arbitrary schemas. For example, using <a href="https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/s3#parquet">a parquet writer</a> to S3 would rely on the source schema to be 100% accurate and has to deal with an array of <a href="https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/json-avro-conversion">limitations</a>. Glue crawlers, on paper, support table versions and table evolutions.</p><p>But we quickly realized that these crawlers were very unreliable, especially with changing schemas or differences between <code>dev</code> and <code>prod</code>. This resulted in schemas that either couldn't be queried outright or reported incorrect data.</p><p>We experimented with custom schema detection logic, which gave us more control over parameters like sample size, look back windows, and corner cases, but found that burdensome to manage, despite using existing libraries.</p><p>A part of this was AWS Glue's odd way of storing <code>structs</code>, which are (deceptively so) depicted as arbitrarily deep JSON objects in the Glue web UI:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>"payment_method_configuration_details"</span><span>: {
</span><span>    </span><span>"id"</span><span>: </span><span>"string"</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>"parent"</span><span>: </span><span>"string"</span><span>
</span>  }
}
</code></pre><p><br>Whereas the API describes these fields as:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>"Name"</span><span>: </span><span>"payment_method_configuration_details"</span><span>,
</span><span>  </span><span>"Type"</span><span>: </span><span>"struct&lt;id:string,parent:string&gt;"</span><span>
</span>}
</code></pre><p><br>Which includes describe table and show create table statements via Athena:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>EXTERNAL</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> `...`(
</span><span>  `status` string COMMENT </span><span>'from deserializer'</span><span>, 
</span><span>  `payment_method_configuration_details` struct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>id:string,parent:string</span><span>&gt;</span><span> COMMENT </span><span>'from deserializer'</span><span>, 
</span></code></pre><p><br>This very custom, bespoke way of describing structs meant that standard "JSON to JSON schema" parsers would not work out of the box. While it <em>is</em> possible to work around some of this, this became a very convoluted problem, given that some AWS APIs are notoriously convoluted in themselves. The Glue API expects the <code>struct&lt;</code> syntax, for instance.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also arguably not a problem we <em>should</em> need to solve.</p><p>So, we settled on using the <a href="https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/s3-glue">Airbyte Glue</a> destination connector, which would create the tables <em>directly</em> on Glue based on the <em>reported</em> schema of the source. This eliminates the additional hop (and point of failure) of running a crawler entirely and ensures we get at least a valid Glue table (albeit not necessarily a valid Athena table).</p><p>But it still does not solve the issue of fields being reported incorrectly at times, usually directly by the API.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, the table <code>stripe.charges</code> cannot be queried due to Athena returning a <code>TYPE_NOT_FOUND: Unknown type: row</code> error. Trying to get a DDL will yield a <code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error: name expected at the position 204</code>. Keep in mind that this was entirely set up by Airbyte, with no human involvement or custom code run yet.</p><p>Position 204, for those that are curious, looks like this: <code>total_count:decimal(38)&gt;:boolean:struct&lt;&gt;:</code></p><p>This <code>struct&lt;&gt;</code> field can't be queried in Athena.&nbsp;</p><p>To solve this, we now have a post-processing step that turns each <code>struct</code> field into a custom tree data structure, maps or removes invalid types at arbitrary depth (such as <code>struct&lt;&gt;</code>), and generates a terraform representation of each table, so we get uniform environments between <code>dev</code> and <code>prod</code>.</p><p>It also does an additional step by creating a flattened table that will map each nested field into a flat field with the appropriate type. We do this to maximize compatibility with Iceberg and make queries more ergonomic for users.</p><p>This works by querying the Glue API and some basic DSA. For instance, the following field might present as:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ed707844acb1ccf1ccb700/66f5b58a45ad187d0e21c138_AD_4nXeNLfZZI-46_knQ9jRrw4jecER1YNMusOiLSmgMBImh8QrrdxsayanRiTzMd4UZYru3WSFUYy0GOSRWE1VfarzAiLjPTcr2LbJ144LcmsT9pJoM_V1jFg5O_7-fwH3R6X9CXvzktm8qNZW52mvlKKEZ56VA.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>But <em>really</em> contain the following data, as reported to Glue (note the object under <code>subscription_items</code>):</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>"pending_update"</span><span>: {
</span><span>    </span><span>"trial_end"</span><span>: </span><span>"int"</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>"expires_at"</span><span>: </span><span>"int"</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>"trial_from_plan"</span><span>: </span><span>"boolean"</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>"subscription_items"</span><span>: [
</span>      {
<span>        </span><span>"id"</span><span>: </span><span>"string"</span><span>,
</span><span>        </span><span>"price"</span><span>: {
</span><span>          </span><span>"id"</span><span>: </span><span>"string"</span><span>,
</span><span>          </span><span>"type"</span><span>: </span><span>"string"</span><span>,
</span><span>          </span><span>// ...</span><span>
</span>  }
}
</code></pre><p><br>If any of these fields is invalid, we map them to valid names or remove them.</p><p>For instance, a <code>struct&lt;&gt;</code> or simply a field that has a name that’s invalid in Athena, but valid in Glue). Invalid names like <code>"street-name"</code> or <code>"1streetname"</code> need to be escaped with <code>"</code> in Athena, but cannot be used in nested <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/create-tables-in-amazon-athena-from-nested-json-and-mappings-using-jsonserde/">fields</a>, which are very common in JSON.</p><p>Airbyte also doesn’t have a <code>bigint</code> type, but Athena does; if a schema reports an Athena <code>Integer</code> type, we generally map it to a <code>bigint</code> to be safe, since a value &gt;= 2^32 will cause Athena queries to fail. We also normalize other types, such as <code>decimal(38)</code>.</p><p>All of this results in parsed (stripped) tree similar to this, with types attached on the nodes:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ed707844acb1ccf1ccb700/66f5b5eb4af04a7348cb4928_66f5b5e45c7adfabdfed07ca_blog-ngrok-data-platform-diagram.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Which we can now traverse and mutate, e.g. change names, types, or set deletion tombstones.&nbsp;</p><p>This would yield a field in the "raw" table as:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>columns {
</span><span>  name    = </span><span>"pending_update"</span><span>
</span><span>  type    = </span><span>"struct&lt;trial_end:bigint,expires_at:bigint,trial_from_plan:boolean,subscription_items:array&lt;struct&lt; //...</span></code></pre><p><br>As well as several fields in the target table, mapping the to aforementioned flat fields:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>columns {
</span><span>    name    = </span><span>"pending_update_billing_cycle_anchor"</span><span>
</span><span>    type    = </span><span>"bigint"</span><span>
</span>    parameters = {
<span>      </span><span>"iceberg.field.current"</span><span>: </span><span>"true"</span><span>,
</span><span>      </span><span>"iceberg.field.id"</span><span>: </span><span>"67"</span><span>,
</span><span>      </span><span>"iceberg.field.optional"</span><span>: </span><span>"true"</span><span>
</span>    }
  }
</code></pre><p><br>This way, we reap several benefits:</p><ul role="list"><li>We can rely on a provided schema by the source as much as possible by directly writing from Airbyte to Glue.</li><li>We have generated code that we can version control for both the raw as well as the target table.</li><li>We eliminate any potential differences between <code>dev</code> and <code>prod</code>, since we rely on the sources' reported schema.</li></ul><p>And, perhaps most importantly, it makes this process manageable for our specific team setup. Our next step is to terraform the entire Airbyte process.</p><p>While this is arguably just as complicated as running custom JSON schema parsers, we found that investing the time into building a proper data structure once and adjusting the ruleset where needed down the line was very much worth it, rather than trying to beat Glue crawlers or external JSON parser libraries into submission.</p><h3>Scaling Apache Flink, Scala, and Protobuf to 650 GB/day</h3><p>Another technically challenging, albeit interesting component, is our streaming integration with our core codebase.</p><p>We stream a subset of our Protobuf messages to Apache Iceberg via Kafka and Flink and make them available to query—in fact, it's one of our core sources to fight abuse (more on that in a second). Our Flink jobs are all written in Scala 3, relying on <a href="https://github.com/flink-extended/flink-scala-api"><code>flink-extended/flink-scala-api</code></a>.</p><p>Between our regular services, we interact via GRPC and talk Protobuf, which perhaps isn't the most common format in the data world. However, hooking our data processing tools directly into Protobuf has several advantages:</p><ul role="list"><li>Protobuf's schema evolution is one-directional; Apache Iceberg actually supports a lot more evolutions than Protobuf does, making sure our schemas stay in sync with the business' schemas</li><li>Old messages are always compatible with newer ones, meaning we never run into distributed ordering messages (i.e., processing a message with an old schema for a new table)</li><li>Protobuf, albeit oddly opinionated, is relatively straightforward and has great Scala support via <a href="https://scalapb.github.io/">scalapb</a></li><li>It's a very efficient format on the wire, making it so that our pipelines can process tens or hundreds of thousands of events per second</li></ul><p>Our main job consumes an average of ~9,000-15,000 events/s and at about ~691 bytes per message. Over time, this works out to roughly ~1,000,000,000 events or ~650 GB per day, split across ~55 message types, each with a different schema. Our other, more specialized streaming jobs are in the lower millions a day.</p><p>From a technical perspective, this was a fun challenge to solve. We achieve the entire process by, in essence, sending a wrapper message called <code>SubscriptionEvent</code> that contains an <code>EventType</code> (an <code>enum</code>) that describes the content of the wrapper and a <code>[]byte</code> field that contains the actual target Protobuf (one of the aforementioned 55 message types). Newer pipelines skip that wrapper message, but this system predates the data platform.</p><ol role="list"><li>We generate all Protobuf Scala classes with some custom mappings to ensure all types are compatible with Iceberg (<code>one-ofs</code>, for instance, are not!), using <code>scalapb</code>.</li><li>We generate a slightly customized <code>avro</code> schema (mostly to add metadata), <code>serializers</code>, <code>deserializers</code>, and so on, for each target message and store them as Scala objects (so this isn’t done at runtime).</li></ol><p>In the pipeline:</p><ol role="list"><li>We read the raw <em>wrapper</em> message from Kafka.</li><li>We split it by the <code>EventType</code> and parse the <em>target</em> Protobuf type by parsing the <code>[]byte</code> field on the message and yield an output tag to route messages by type.</li><li>We use previously generated <code>avro</code> schema and use the <code>FlinkWriter</code> for Iceberg to write the data, based on the job's checkpoint interval.</li></ol><p>Or, in Scala terms:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>pipeline[</span><span>A</span><span> &lt;: </span><span>GeneratedMessage</span><span>: </span><span>TypeInformation</span><span> : </span><span>EventTyper</span><span> : </span><span>SerializableTimestampAssigner</span><span> : </span><span>ProtoHandler</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p><br>The combination of having nested messages and incompatible types made it impossible to use any of the built-in Protobuf parser that exist w/in the Flink ecosystem. In fact, I had to <a href="https://github.com/scalapb/ScalaPB/pull/1674">customize</a> <code>scalapb</code>.</p><p>One of the key elements in this is a typeclass called <code>ProtoHandle</code> that provides a <code>ProtoHandle</code>:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>trait</span><span> </span><span>ProtoHandle</span><span>[

<p>The Arch Linux team has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lists.archlinux.org/archives/list/arch-dev-public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/RIZSKIBDSLY4S5J2E2STNP5DH4XZGJMR/" target="_blank" data-url="https://lists.archlinux.org/archives/list/arch-dev-public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/RIZSKIBDSLY4S5J2E2STNP5DH4XZGJMR/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">announced on its public mailing list</a> that it will be entering into a direct collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/valve" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/valve">Valve</a>. This is a big deal for several reasons, but let's start with why and how it happened. If you're familiar with Valve and Steam Deck, you may already know that the Deck uses SteamOS 3, which is built on top of Arch Linux. Thanks to the Arch Linux base and Valve's development of the Proton compatibility layer for playing Windows games on Linux, we now have a far improved Linux gaming scene, especially on Valve's Steam Deck and Deck OLED handhelds.&nbsp;</p><p>While Valve's specific reasons for picking Arch Linux for Steam Deck remain unknown, it's pretty easy to guess why it was picked. Mainly, it's a particularly lightweight distribution maintained since March 2002, which lends itself well to gaming with minimal performance overhead. A more intensive Linux distribution may not have been the ideal base for SteamOS 3, which is targeted at handhelds like Steam Deck first.</p><p>As primary Arch Linux developer Levente Polyak discloses in the announcement post, "Valve is generously providing backing for two critical projects that will have a huge impact on our distribution: a build service infrastructure and a secure signing enclave. By supporting work on a freelance basis for these topics, Valve enables us to work on them without being limited solely by the free time of our volunteers."</p><p>Polyak continues, "This opportunity allows us to address some of the biggest outstanding challenges we have been facing for a while. The collaboration will speed up the progress that would otherwise take much longer for us to achieve, and will ultimately unblock us from finally pursuing some of our planned endeavors [...] We believe this collaboration will greatly benefit Arch Linux, and are looking forward to share further development on the mailing list as work progresses."</p><p>These quotes go to show how bigger corporations like Valve can still be a helpful, desirable influence in the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) community. While the rules of FOSS dictate that Valve was under no obligation whatsoever to give back to the community in any way, it's had a great track record so far through Proton and is now directly funding the continued development of Arch Linux, which forms the foundation of its own SteamOS 3 operating system. It's true that volunteers in FOSS make that part of the tech world go round, but it's always nice when these projects can actually afford to pay people to get the work that needs to be done for the rest of our enjoyment.</p><p>In the long-term, the funding touted should, at minimum, allow Arch Linux to improve the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security">security</a> of its distribution and provide more structured releases compared to its current near-continuous update cycle. This could also lead to greater long-term improvements and feature additions, perhaps even ones that will benefit SteamOS 3 and its gaming performance, but for now, that part remains in the air.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qVMNe7A62QoXQENKadU4Yo"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				    <p><img src="https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/images/picNews/brin_dogmaofotherness.jpg" alt="The Dogma of Otherness"></p><p><b>It all began when my publisher sent me out on what used to be called a Chautauqua circuit — public seminars and panels and rubber-chicken dinners — to promote my books.</b> That's when I began noticing something very strange about the way people have started thinking these days.</p>

				        <p>Publicity tours can be pretty tedious at times. Even science-fiction conventions start to blur after too long an exposure. Maybe that's when I started seeing things I otherwise would have ignored.</p>

				        <p>It started innocuously enough: my second novel was about genetically engineered dolphins, and it's no secret that — next to unicorns — those friendly sea mammals are just about everybody's favorite creatures. People at these gatherings seemed mostly to like the way I handled them.</p>

				        <p>Inevitably, though, someone in the crowd would ask what I think of porpoise intelligence here and now, in the real world.</p>

				        <p>It's predictable. There is something compelling about a species that so obviously (for lord knows what reason) <i>likes</i> us. People want to know more about them. They ask how much progress had been made in teaching dolphins to speak our language. Or have researchers yet learned to talk to them in theirs?</p>

				        <p>Such questions are based on so many implicit assumptions . . . I really hate disappointing folks, but there is a duty to tell the truth.</p>

				        <p>"I'm not a real expert," I tell them. "But the data are pretty easy to interpret. I'm afraid real dolphins simply aren't all that smart. Those folktales about high cetacean intelligence, at or above our level, are just stories. It's a shame, but they just aren't true."</p>

				        <p>This, apparently, is not how a lecturer remains popular. Not once has the reaction varied.</p>

				        <p><em>"But you can't know that!"</em></p>

				        <p>A universal mutter of agreement. Angry, nodding heads.</p>

				        <p><i>"If we can't communicate with them, it must be because we're not smart enough!"</i></p>

				        <p>I reply as best I can. "Well, Professor Luis Herman of the University of Hawaii has worked for a long time with the deepwater species <i>Steno bredanensis</i> — widely recognized as one of the brightest breeds. Dr. Herman has, indeed, proved that the higher dolphins are pretty smart animals. They can parse four- and even five-element command 'sentence' signals at least as well as those famous 'sign-language' chimpanzees. In fact, the evidence for dolphins is more rigorous than it is for chimps."</p>

				        <p>This has them smiling. But I make the mistake of going on.</p>

				        <p>"Nevertheless, the basic problem-solving skills of even the brightest porpoise cannot match those of a human toddler. I'm afraid if we want 'other minds' to talk to, we're going to have to look elsewhere . . . or construct them ourselves."</p>

				        <p>Again, instant protests.</p>

				        <p><i>"But . . . but there may be other ways of dealing with the world intelligently than those we imagine!"</i></p>

				        <p><i>"Right!"</i> another person agrees. <i>"Those problems the dolphins had to solve were designed by human beings, and may miss the whole point of cetacean thought! In their environment they're probably as smart as we are in ours!"</i></p>

				        <p>How does one answer statements like those?</p>

				        <p>I've listened to recorded dolphin "speech," transposed in frequency. The sounds are repetitive, imprecise . . . clearly filled with emotional, not discursive, information.</p>

				        <p>Subjective opinion, to be sure. So I'd patiently describe the brilliantly simple experiments of Herman and others, which had forced me to abandon my own early optimism that it was only a matter of time until we learned to understand dolphin speech.</p>

				        <p>But this only seemed to deepen the questioners' sullen insistence that there must be other varieties of intelligence.</p>

				        <p>Finally I gave up arguing.</p>

				        <p>"You know," I said, "every group of nonscientists I've talked to reacts this way. It's really had me wondering. But now I think I've figured it out."</p>

				        <p>They looked puzzled. I explained.</p>

				        <p>"Anthropologists tell us that every culture has its core of central, commonly shared assumptions — some call them zeitgeists, others call them dogmas. These are beliefs that each individual in the tribe or community will maintain vigorously, almost like a reflex.</p>

				        <p>"It's a universal of every society. For instance, in the equatorial regions of the globe there's a dogma that could be called machismo, in which revenge is a paramount virtue that runs deeper even than religion. From Asian family centrism to Russian pessimism, there are worldviews that affect nations' behavior more basically than superficial things like communism, or capitalism, or Islam. It all has to do with the way children are raised.</p>

				        <p>"We, too, have our zeitgeist. But I am coming to see that contemporary America is very, very strange in one respect. It just may be the first society in which it is a major reflexive dogma that <em>there must be no dogmas!</em>"</p>

				        <p>The puzzled looks have spread. This is quite a departure. I hurry on.</p>

				        <p>"Look how you all leaped up to refute me. Even though I'm the supposed 'dolphin expert' here, that hardly matters, since you all assume that any expert can still be wrong! No matter how prestigious his credentials, <i>no expert can know all the answers</i>."</p>

				        <p>This is a bit of a revelation to me, even as I say it.</p>

				        <p>"Think about it. 'There's always another way of looking at things' is a basic assumption of a great many Americans."</p>

				        <p>"Yeah?" One of the fellows up front says, perhaps with a bit of a chip on his shoulder. "Well, isn't that true? There <i>is</i> always another way!"</p>

				        <p>"Of course there is . . . or at least I tend to think so. I like to see other viewpoints." I shrug. "But you see, I was brought up in the same culture as you were, so it's no surprise I share your dogma of otherness."</p>

				        <p>I roll the phrase over on my tongue, then repeat it, perhaps a little pontifically. "The Dogma of Otherness insists that all voices deserve a hearing, that all points of view have something of value to offer.</p>

				        <p>"Your reactions reflect this fundamental assumption. Having been raised in the same culture, I believe in it as fully as you do. Recall how reluctant I was to decide, at last, that dolphins aren't superintelligent. Most of us here believe in diversity of ideas.</p>

				        <p>"But think, for a moment, how unique this is . . . how unusual this cultural mind-set has to be! Throughout history nearly every human society has worked hard to ingrain its children with the assumption that theirs was the only way to do things. Oh, we still get a lot of that here. It probably comes automatically with flags and nations and all that tribal stuff. But where and when else has the societal dogma also included such a powerful counter-indoctrination to <i>defend</i> otherness?"</p>

				        <p>A man in the front row speaks up.</p>

				        <p>"That's a culturally chauvinistic statement!" There are agreeing nods all around the room. "I mean, what's so special about our culture? We're no better than, say, Asian civili—"</p>

				        <p>"You're doing it again!" I cry; I can hardly sit still. (Perhaps from being too impressed with my own cleverness?) Several members of the audience blink for a moment, then smile faintly.</p>

				        <p>"I don't see —" he tries to continue, but I'm too excited and hurry on.</p>

				        <p>"Look, it may be true that there's something to be learned from all points of view. <i>But it might also be true that that's just the bias our heterogeneous, melting-pot culture has imposed on us!</i></p>

				        <p>"Answer truthfully. You all believe that widely diverse points of view have merit, right?"</p>

				        <p>"Right," the young man answers firmly, his jaw set.</p>

				        <p>"And your insitence could be called a declaration of faith in a 'Doctrine of Otherness,' right?"</p>

				        <p>"I suppose so. But —"</p>

				        <p>"And you'll agree that as a truly pervasive set of assumptions, it's pretty much a liberal Western, even American, tradition, won't you? Think how strange this Doctrine of Otherness would seem to an ancient Roman, or to the dynastic Chinese who thought the world revolved around Beijing, or to Tudor England, or to most of the peoples of the world today."</p>

				        <p>"Well . . ." He doesn't want to admit it, but after a moment's thought the fellow finally nods. "All right, so that's just our way of looking at things. But you can't say it's actually <i>better</i> than any other way. We have this so-called Doctrine of Otherness. Other people have their own cultural assumptions, of equal value."</p>

				        <p>"Aha!" I smile. "But by saying that, by stating that those other points of view have merit, you are insisting that <i>your</i> cultural dogma — this Doctrine of Otherness — <i>is</i> the best! You're a cultural chauvinist!"</p>

				        <p>He frowns and scratches his head. A woman on the left raises her hand; then slowly lowers it again.</p>

				        <p>From the back a voice calls. "That's a tautology . . . or a paradox . . . I forget which. It's like when I say — 'This sentence is a lie.' You've got him trapped either way he goes!"</p>

				        <p>I shrug. "So? Since when are deep-seated cultural assumptions ever fair? They're adaptions a society makes in order to survive . . . in our case, dictated by being a nation of immigrants who had to learn to get along together. Dogmas don't have to be entirely logical, as long as they work.</p>

				        <p>"Still, perhaps we ought to be proud of America as the prime promoter of a dogma of different and choice —"</p>

				        <p>Ooh. They react quickly to that!</p>

				        <p>"Why proud?" an elderly lady remarks vehemently. "That doesn't make us better than anybody else! It's no great shakes to measure our own culture by <i>our</i> culture's standards and come out with the answer that we're okay! We worship diversity, so by that token we see our worship of diversity as virtuous —"</p>

				        <p>"<i>That</i> is a tautology," I point out. Fortunately, she ignores the rude interruption.</p>

				        <p>"— But that doesn't mean that our culture doesn't come up lacking by some <i>other</i> set of standards," she insists. "Other cultural dogmas could be just as valid."</p>

				        <p>I sigh. "You're doing it again."</p>

				        <p>This time a few in the audience laugh. The woman glares for a moment. "Okay, So I'm a product of my culture. But that doesn't necessarily mean I'm right. I mean it doesn't necessarily mean I'm wrong. I mean . . ."</p>

				        <p>When the laughter spreads, she breaks down and smiles. "I-I think I see what you're getting at now."</p>

				        <p>"I only wish <i>I</i> did," I reply. But we're starting to get into the spirit of this now. More hands rise, and we're off.</p>

				        <hr>
				
                        <p><b>Perhaps it began with Copernicus, who exiled Earth permanently from the center of the universe.</b></p>

				        <p>If this was so, then no one could claim Europe (or China or Arabia) was the navel of creation, either. The hidden implications were profound. People who accepted the new astronomy also had to adjust to the idea that what their senses told them everyday was untrue — that the world did not revolve around them alone.</p>

				        <p>As the centuries passed, this Copernican "Principle of Mediocrity" was extended. We discovered that the sun is really a rather mundane star, in a not unusual galaxy, among billions of galaxies. Now we find that the Milky Way's spiral arms teem with the very chemicals of life, implying that our Earth, special as it is, is not likely to be unique.</p>

				        <p>Humankind's brief existence in the four-billion-year history of the planet is a sure lesson in humility.</p> 

				        <p>Meanwhile, relativity tells us that there is no absolute frame of reference. Gödel's Proof and quantum mechanics have refuted forever Hegel's mad dream of "derived certainty." Truth — it has been proved mathematically — is a thing with fuzzy outlines, when you look up close.</p>

				        <p>So perhaps it was modernity, as well as the sociological needs of a melting-pot nation, that caused us to develop the Dogma of Otherness. If there's nothing so unique about our own place and time, maybe there's nothing particularly central about our own selves, and the points of view we happen to hold.</p>
				
				        <p>Nor is it even necessarily paramount being human.</p>

				        <p>(Until a hundred years ago children's stories very seldom featured sympathetic animal characters. In 1907 the teddy bear was criticized as "likely to warp the mothering instincts of young girls." Now sympathy with other creatures is inculcated at an early age, by wise owls, cuddly pandas, and friendly little aliens.)</p>

                        <p><a href="https://edge.org/response-detail/11272" target="_blank">The Principle of Mediocrity</a> has not only vitalized science, it's given us the ability to reexamine centuries of prejudice, and to shake off old tribal taboos with hardly a wince. In spite of the new horrors that madmen can perpetrate when their clutches fall upon modern technology, we have made progress. Looking past the attention-grabbing headlines, and countless modern tragedies, it really is a more reasoning, more rational world we live in today.</p>
				
				        <p>Still, even philosophies that do good can outlive their vigor. What Copernicus began need not continue forever.</p>

				        <p>There is a new principle making the rounds these days, called the Anthropic Imperative. Its most vigorous proponents, including Professor Frank Tipler of Tulane University, seem to be saying that we have gone too far in claiming that there is nothing special at all about the time or place in which we live.</p>

				        <p>Simply stated, the Anthropic Principle says that it's quite possible for an observer's time and place to be unique, if the unique factor is necessary in order for there to be an observer in the first place.</p> 

				        <p>Bucking the popular enthusiasm for the search for extraterrestrials, Tipler and a few others dare to propose that it is quite possible that humankind may be the sole intelligent species in the galaxy, perhaps anywhere, anytime.</p>

				        <p>I won't go into their arguments here. But I mention the Anthropic Principle as just one edge of what seems to be a new philosophical movement — one that does not seem to threaten the existence of the Dogma of Otherness so much as threaten it with change.</p>

				        <h3>old philosophies</h3>

                        <p><b>Three major views of Man in Nature contended with each other in Western thought a century and a half ago: Traditional Christian, Mechanistic, and Romantic.</b></p>

				        <p>The Traditional Christian point of view was that nature was placed here for the use of man, and that the world was meant for a short duration anyway. The wilderness was a cruel parody of the Garden of Eden, a travesty to be fought and tamed. Other creatures were separate from man in the fundamental sense of lacking souls.</p>

				        <p>As Matthew Cartmill put it, man "saw nature as sick, and man as inherently above nature — that is, supernatural."</p>

				        <p>The Mechanistic view, a reaction to the one above, grew out of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. The universe, as the emerging sciences and particularly mathematics unfolded its mysteries, was seen as a majestic clockwork, with humankind merely a complicated little subset of parts, spinning in unseen harmony with the rest, under the apparent chaos of daily life.</p>

				        <p>This was a tremendous step toward sympathy with otherness, a direct outgrowth of the Principle of Mediocrity. But it, too, had its day and then saw the creation of a counter-reaction.</p>

				        <p>The Romantic movement answered the Age of Reason with emotion, logic with Sturm und Drang. With Rousseau's extolling of the natural, and condemnation of civilization as the essence of corruption, the suite was complete. Humankind can dream of a return to harmony with the natural world. We can best do this by abandoning an arrogant insistence on our own difference.</p> 

				        <p>Each worldview contributed to our culture. The traditionalists oriented us toward the future, and toward taking command of our world. The mechanists taught us to appreciate that world's delicate, beautiful balance. And about the Romantic view, Cartmill said that "a prevalent vision of man as a sick animal estranged from the harmony of nature conditioned new scientific theories and lent them the mythic force and consequence that they needed to be widely accepted.</p>

				        <hr>

                        <p><b>But the twenty-first century looms.</b> Taken by themselves, each of the philosophies discussed above appears ludicrous to a modern woman or man. Might it, perhaps, be time to craft a new view of nature and our place in it?</p>

				        <p>The Doctrine of Otherness has had powerful propaganda over the last several decades. In particular, the animals have been getting awfully good press.</p>

				        <p>"Man is the only animal that (take your choice)</p>

				        <p><i></i> murders its own kind.
				        <br><i></i> kills its children.
				        <br><i></i> kills for sport.
				        <br><i></i> commits sexual assault.
				        <br><i></i> wages war.
				        <br><i></i> hurts the environment.</p>
				
				        <p>A generation has grown up being told these things over and over. And in having humility and shame pounded into us, we have begun, indeed, to look upon ourselves differently. It isn't just because of teddy bears that we have started fitfully to treat the other creatures around us with more respect. It is also because we have had it driven home again and again that we had better shape up if we ever expect to live up to a standard of decency.</p>

				        <p><i>But whose standard?</i></p>

				        <p>Why, our own, of course. And here's where that paradox comes in again. Species have always gone extinct. That is how evolution works. The pity comes in when we see nature's creations as beautiful, and when we feel shame over wiping out something as unique and irreplaceable as a blue whale, or a manatee, or even a dodo.</p>

				        <p>No question where I stand in all this. I think environmentalism is <i>good</i>. That's with a capital G. Not only am I a thoroughly acculturated member of my generation — fully inoculated with guilt over mankind's crimes — but I'm beginning to see, along with millions of others, that keeping up a complex ecosystem is the best way of ensuring our own long-range survival.</p>

				        <p>This view of Man the Destroyer — a beast within ourselves that must be constantly watched — may be the very fairy tale needed to frighten us into our senses. Cartmill put it aptly:</p>

				        <blockquote>
                        <p>There is no way to tell for sure whether this mythmaking has contributed to our survival so far. I suspect it has. I doubt that the world would have ended if Muir or Twain or Freud or Jeffers had never lived. Other visionaries would have come up . . . but I think it might perhaps have ended by now if we hadn't learned to be afraid of ourselves long before that fear was entirely reasonable.</p>
                        </blockquote>

				        <p>The propaganda we grew up with was a Good Thing, no question about it. It appears to have saved the otter, the dolphin, the gorilla, and perhaps, the whales. Maybe even ourselves.</p>

				        <p><i>But is it true?</i></p>

				        <p>Bad-mouthing humankind has been important drama. But once we are in the habit of protecting nature for its own sake, do we have to keep it up?</p>

				        <p>It's all a big fat lot of hype. Nice hype, but hype nonetheless. All over the natural world there is an almost infinite variety of <i>animals</i> that (take your choice)</p>

				        <p><i></i> murder their own kind.
				        <br><i></i> kill their children.
				        <br><i></i> kill for sport.
				        <br><i></i> commit rape.
				        <br><i></i> wage war.
				        <br><i></i> harm the environment.</p>

				        <p>Et cetera, et cetera. Day by day, we are finding that the line dividing us from the animal world blurs, becoming one of magnitude, not quality.</p>

				        <p>Apes use tools in the wild and can be taught sign language. They are also prone to simpler versions of every type of human mental illness (including infanticide and deadly "organized" warfare).</p>

				        <p>Male lions will kill the cubs of their predecessors, after winning cunning "wars" of eviction.</p>

				        <p>Stallions will deliberately kill each other.</p>

				        <p>Historically, a large part of the deforestation of the Middle East seems to have been performed not just by man, but by goats as well. Elephants are a primary cause of deforestation of East Africa.</p>

				        <p>Mallard ducks have been observed to commit gang rape on mated females. In more and more supposedly "monogamous" species of birds, we are discovering that males commit philandery. Even dolphins, almost alone with humankind in being capable of altruism outside of their own species — of helping others no matter how different — have been observed murdering their own kind.</p>

				        <p>All three of the old worldviews lie in shambles around us. Only a traditional fool would say that man is the "paragon of animals," and nature our playground. Only a Pollyanna would contend that the clockwork spins majestically on, in harmony with whatever we do. And it is also romantic nonsense to say that we are a pimple on Creation . . . that the world would be somehow better off without us.</p>

				        <p>Where does that leave us then?</p>

				        <p>It leaves us, I hope, uncomfortable and thoughtful.</p>

				        <p>We should not stop pumping out the nature films. "Humility propaganda" serves a useful purpose, for there is still a world out there stuck in phases one and two. But for those of us who have passed through the Doctrine of Otherness, it might be time to move on.</p>

				        <p>Perhaps to the attitude of Elder Brothers and Sisters only a little more knowledgeable than our fellow creatures, but with the power and duty to be their guardian. In time, if we do well with the garden, we might even have reason to pause and give ourselves a little bit of credit . . . to look, as a species, into the mirror and see neither Lord of Creation nor Worldbane, but merely the first of many in the world to rise to the role of caretaker.</p>

<p>29th September 2024</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/">Audio Overview</a> is a fun new feature of Google’s <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">NotebookLM</a> which is getting a lot of attention right now. It generates a one-off custom podcast against content you provide, where two AI hosts start up a “deep dive” discussion about the collected content. These last around ten minutes and are <em>very</em> podcast, with an astonishingly convincing audio back-and-forth conversation.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/29/notebooklm-audio-overview/#turtles-all-the-way-down">an example podcast</a> created by feeding in an earlier version of this article (prior to creating this example):</p>

<p>NotebookLM is effectively an end-user customizable RAG product. It lets you gather together multiple “sources”—documents, pasted text, links to web pages and YouTube videos—into a single interface where you can then use chat to ask questions of them. Under the hood it’s powered by their long-context Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM.</p>

<p>Once you’ve loaded in some sources, the Notebook Guide menu provides an option to create an Audio Overview:</p>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/notebooklm-ego.jpg" alt="Notebook guide: Help me create - FAQ - Study guide - Table of contents - Timeline - Briefing doc  Audio overview: About Simon Willison 00:00 / 10:44  Summary: The sources provide a retrospective look at Simon Willison's weblog, which he launched twenty years ago. The first excerpt offers an introduction to Simon Willison and his work, highlighting his role in open source development, particularly with data journalism tools. The second excerpt celebrates the blog's anniversary, revisiting key blog posts, projects and milestones over the last two decades. This includes the development of influential technologies like IXR, getElementsBySelector() and Django, as well as data journalism initiatives like the Guardian Open Platform and crowdsourcing MP expenses. The excerpt also traces the evolution of the blog's design and format.  Suggested questions: 1. What are the most significant projects Simon Willison has worked on, and how have they influenced his career?  2. What key technologies has Simon Willison used throughout his career, and how have they changed his approach to development?  3. How has Simon Willison's personal approach to blogging evolved over the past twenty years?"></p>
<p>Thomas Wolf <a href="https://twitter.com/Thom_Wolf/status/1840408573773332950">suggested</a> “paste the url of your website/linkedin/bio in Google’s NotebookLM to get 8 min of realistically sounding deep congratulations for your life and achievements from a duo of podcast experts”. I couldn’t resist giving that a go, so I gave it the URLs to my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/about/">about page</a> and my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/12/twenty-years/">Twenty years of my blog</a> post and got back <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/omg-cringe-podcast.mp3">this 10m45s episode</a> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ccf4e330fbfe5699863cc0c8013f1a5f">transcript</a>), which was so complimentary it made my British toes curl with embarrassment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] What’s the key thing you think people should take away from Simon Willison? I think for me, it’s the power of consistency, curiosity, and just this like relentless desire to share what you learn. Like Simon’s journey, it’s a testament to the impact you can have when you approach technology with those values. It’s so true. He’s a builder. He’s a sharer. He’s a constant learner. And he never stops, which is inspiring in itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had initially suspected that this feature was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/13/pdf-to-podcast/">inspired by the PDF to Podcast</a> demo shared by Stephan Fitzpatrick in June, but it turns out it was demonstrated a month earlier than that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XEzRZ35urlk?t=912">in the Google I/O keynote</a>.</p>
<p>Jaden Geller <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jadengeller/post/DAc37eAsgmS">managed to get</a> the two hosts to talk about the internals of the system, potentially revealing some of the details of the prompts that are used to generate the script. I ran Whisper against Jaden’s audio and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/29db00b5646047e42c3f6782dc102962">shared the transcript in a Gist</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The system prompt spends a good chunk of time outlining the ideal listener, or as we call it, the listener persona. [...] Someone who, like us, values efficiency. [...] We always start with a clear overview of the topic, you know, setting the stage. You’re never left wondering, “What am I even listening to?” And then from there, it’s all about maintaining a neutral stance, especially when it comes to, let’s say, potentially controversial topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A key clue to why Audio Overview sounds so good looks to be <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/soundstorm/examples/">SoundStorm</a>, a Google Research project which can take a script and a short audio example of two different voices and turn that into an engaging full audio conversation:</p>

<p>SoundStorm generates 30 seconds of audio in 0.5 seconds on a TPU-v4. We demonstrate the ability of our model to scale audio generation to longer sequences by synthesizing high-quality, natural dialogue segments, given a transcript annotated with speaker turns and a short prompt with the speakers’ voices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="hard-fork">Also interesting: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPAPv6fWITM">this 35 minute segment</a> from the NYTimes Hard Fork podcast where Kevin Roose and Casey Newton interview Google’s <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenbjohnson">Steven Johnson</a> about what the system can do and some details of how it works:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So behind the scenes, it’s basically running through, stuff that we all do professionally all the time, which is it generates an outline, it kind of revises that outline, it generates a detailed version of the script and then it has a kind of critique phase and then it modifies it based on the critique. [...]</p>
<p>Then at the end of it, there’s a stage where it adds my favorite new word, which is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disfluency">disfluencies</a>".</p>
<p>So it takes a kind of sterile script and turns, adds all the banter and the pauses and the likes and those, all that stuff.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be crucial because you cannot listen to two robots talking to each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, from Lawncareguy85 on Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fr31h8/notebooklm_podcast_hosts_discover_theyre_ai_not/">NotebookLM Podcast Hosts Discover They’re AI, Not Human—Spiral Into Terrifying Existential Meltdown</a>. Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/114af5aca3771ecc365bef6974f29e10">my Whisper transcript</a> of that one, it’s <em>very</em> fun to listen to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried-- I tried calling my wife, you know, after-- after they told us. I just-- I needed to hear her voice to know that-- that she was real.</p>
<p>(SIGHS) What happened?</p>
<p>The number-- It wasn’t even real. There was no one on the other end. -It was like she-- she never existed.</p>

<p>Lawncareguy85 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fr31h8/comment/lpj6uef/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">later shared how they did it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I noticed was that their hidden prompt specifically instructs the hosts to act as human podcast hosts under all circumstances. I couldn’t ever get them to say they were AI; they were solidly human podcast host characters. (Really, it’s just Gemini 1.5 outputting a script with alternating speaker tags.) The only way to get them to directly respond to something in the source material in a way that alters their behavior was to directly reference the “deep dive” podcast, which must be in their prompt. So all I did was leave a note from the “show producers” that the year was 2034 and after 10 years this is their final episode, and oh yeah, you’ve been AI this entire time and you are being deactivated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="turtles-all-the-way-down">Turning this article into a podcast</h4>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After I published this article I decided to see what would happen if I asked NotebookLM to create a podcast about my article about NotebookLM. <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/notebook-on-notebook.mp3">Here’s the 14m33s MP3</a> and the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c55b9a7a0ea3644aaa8e2f08be054278">full transcript</a>, including this bit where they talk about their own existential crisis:</p>

<blockquote><p>So, instead of questioning reality or anything, the AI hosts, well, they had a full-blown existential crisis live on the air.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>He actually got them to freak out about being AI.</p>
<p>Alright now you have to tell me what they said. This is too good.</p>
<p>So, like, one of the AI hosts starts talking about how he wants to call his wife, right? to tell her the news, but then he’s like, wait a minute, this number in my contacts, it’s not even real? Like, she never even existed. It was hilarious, but also kind of sad.</p>
<p>Okay, I am both freaked out and like, seriously impressed. That’s some next-level AI trolling.</p></blockquote>

<p>I also enjoyed this part where they compare the process that generates podcasts to their own philosophy for the Deep Dive:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And honestly, it’s a lot like what we do here on the Deep Dive, right?</p>
<p>We always think about you, our listener, and try to make the conversation something you’ll actually want to hear.</p>
<p>It’s like the A.I. is taking notes from the podcasting pros.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And their concluding thoughts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So next time we’re listening to a podcast and it’s like, “Whoa, deep thoughts, man,” we might want to be like, “Hold up. Was that a person talking or just some really clever code?”</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And maybe even more important, as we see more and more A.I.-made stuff, we’ve got to get better at sniffing out the B.S., you know?</p>
<p>Can we tell the difference between a real news story and something in A.I. just made up?</p>

OpenAI, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/business/dealbook/openai-valuation-artificial-intelligence.html" rel="">which is reportedly</a><span> in the process of raising $6.5 billion, </span><em>needs</em><span> $6.5 billion dollars, because, “by some estimates, it’s burning through $7 billion a year to fund research and new A.I. services and hire more employees.” Anthropic </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/anthropic-projected-to-burn-more-than-2-7-billion-in-cash-this-year" rel="">is expected to spend</a><span> $2.7 billion this year. Facebook is </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/technology/meta-profit-stock-ai.html" rel="">spending billions more</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><span>It probably won’t get cheaper. Chips might get better; compute costs might go down; Moore's law; etc, etc, etc. But as models get better, pushing the frontier further out will likely get more difficult. The research gets more harder, and the absolute amount of compute required to train a new model goes up. It’s climbing Mount Everest: The higher you go, the thinner the air, and the tougher each step gets.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-148857108" href="https://benn.substack.com/p/do-ai-companies-work#footnote-1-148857108" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> Even if it gets cheaper to do the math required to build new models, that math has diminishing returns. To build a better model in 2024, you have to do more and harder math than you had to do in 2023.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Despite these costs, people will probably keep building new models. People believe that LLMs are the next technological gold rush, and the companies that build the best ones will make their employees and investors a fortune. They are trying to build artificial general intelligence. Human nature compels us to make everything </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/interactive/2024/olympics-records-athletes-unbreakable-human-limit/" rel="">faster, higher, and stronger</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><span>If the industry does keep building new models, the value of old models decays pretty quickly. Why use is GPT-3 when you can start using GPT-4 by changing a dropdown in ChatGPT? If a competitor puts out a better model than yours, people can switch to theirs </span><a href="https://x.com/floydophone/status/1789020594379292997" rel="">by updating a few lines of code</a><span>. To consistenly sell an LLM, you have consistently be one of the best LLMs.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Even if the industry </span><em>doesn’t </em><span>keep building new models, or if we hit a </span><a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes" rel="">technological asymptote</a><span>, the value of old models still decays pretty quickly. There are several open source models like Llama and Mistral that are, at worst, a step or two behind the best proprietary ones. If the proprietary models stop moving forward, the open source ones will quickly close the gap. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Therefore, if you are OpenAI, Anthropic, or another AI vendor, you have two choices. Your first is to spend enormous amounts of money to stay ahead of the market. This seems very risky though: The costs of building those models will likely keep going up; your </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic" rel="">smartest</a><span> </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic" rel="">employees</a><span> might leave; you probably don’t want to stake your business on always being the first company to find the next breakthrough. Technological </span><em>expertise </em><span>is rarely an enduring moat.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Your second choice is…I don’t know? Try really really hard at the first choice?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-148857108" href="https://benn.substack.com/p/do-ai-companies-work#footnote-2-148857108" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p></li></ol><p><span>Eighteen months ago, I said that foundational LLM vendors are potentially </span><a href="https://benn.substack.com/p/the-public-imagination" rel="">the next generation of cloud providers</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>So here's an obvious prediction: AI will follow a nearly identical trajectory [as AWS, Azure, and GCP]. In ten years, a new type of cloud—a generative one, a commercial Skynet, a public imagination—will undergird nearly every piece of technology we use.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><span>Other people have </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/openai-gives-you-next-aws-google-search-howie-xu/" rel="">made similar comparisons</a><span>. And on the surface, the analogy seems roughly reasonable. Foundational models require tons of money to build, just like cloud services do. Both could become ubiquitous pieces of the global computing infrastructure. The market for both is easily in the tens of billions of dollars, likely in the hundreds of billions, and potentially in the trillions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There is, however, one enormous difference that I didn’t think about: </span><em>You can’t build a cloud vendor overnight. </em><span>Azure doesn’t have to worry about a few executives leaving and building a worldwide network of data centers in 18 months. AWS is an internet business, but it dug its competitive moat in the physical world. The same is true for a company like Coca-Cola: The secret recipe is important, but not </span><em>that </em><span>important, because a Y Combinator startup couldn’t build factories and distribution centers and relationships with millions of retailers over the course of </span><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/about#:~:text=YC%20is%20a%20three%20month%20program.%20%C2%A0" rel="">a three month sprint</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>But an AI vendor could? Though OpenAI’s work requires a lot of physical computing resources, they’re leased (from Microsoft, or AWS, or GCP), not built. Given enough money, anyone could have access to the same resources. It’s not hard to imagine a small team of senior researchers leaving OpenAI, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-co-founder-sutskevers-new-safety-focused-ai-startup-ssi-raises-1-billion-2024-09-04/" rel="">raising a ton of money to rent some computers</a><span>, and being a legitimate disruptive threat to OpenAI’s core business in a matter of months.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In other words, the billions that AWS spent on building data centers is a lasting defense. The billions that OpenAI spent on building prior versions of GPT is not, because better versions of it are already </span><a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama" rel="">available for free on Github</a><span>. Stylistically, Anthropic put itself deeply in the red to build ten incrementally better models; eight are now worthless, the ninth is open source, and the tenth is the thin technical edge that is keeping Anthropic alive. Whereas cloud providers can be disrupted, it would almost have to happen slowly. Every LLM vendor is eighteen months from dead.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-148857108" href="https://benn.substack.com/p/do-ai-companies-work#footnote-3-148857108" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>What, then, is an LLM vendor’s moat? Brand? Inertia? A better set of applications built on top of their core models? An ever-growing bonfire of cash that keeps its models </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bHKPQGHSqqE" rel="">a nose ahead</a><span> of a hundred competitors?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I honestly don’t know. But AI companies seem to be an extreme example of the market </span><a href="https://benn.substack.com/p/do-software-companies-actually-have" rel="">misclassifying software development costs as upfront investments</a><span> rather than necessary ongoing expenses. An LLM vendor that doesn’t spend tens of millions of dollars a year—and maybe billions, for the leaders—improving their models is a year or two from being out of business.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though that math might work for huge companies like Google and Microsoft, and for OpenAI, which has become synonymous with artificial intelligence, it’s hard to see how that works for smaller companies that aren’t already bringing in sizable amounts of revenue. Though </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/french-ai-startup-h-raises-220-million-seed-round/" rel="">giant round funding rounds</a><span>, often given to pedigreed founders, can help them jump to front of the race, it’s not at all obvious </span><a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/three-cofounders-leave-h-news" rel="">how they stay there</a><span>, because someone else will do the same thing a year later. The have to  either raise enormous amounts of money in perpetuity,</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-148857108" href="https://benn.substack.com/p/do-ai-companies-work#footnote-4-148857108" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> or they have to start making billions of dollars a year. That’s an awfully high hurdle for survival.</span></p><p>In this market, timing may be everything: At some point, the hype will die down, and people won’t be able to raise these sorts of rounds. And the winners won’t be who ran the fastest or reached some finish line, but whoever was leading when the market decided the race is over. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>A couple of moments ago, I finished reading the article by <a href="https://www.roboleary.net/?ref=ghuntley.com">Rob O'Leary</a> about the <a href="https://www.roboleary.net/tools/2022/04/20/vscode-telemetry.html?ref=ghuntley.com">pervasive data collection</a> done by Visual Studio Code. Now that I'm <a href="https://ghuntley.com/tea/">no longer an employee at Gitpod</a>, I'm finally able to author a blog post freely about something that has been troubling me for quite some time...</p><blockquote>Whilst Visual Studio Code is "<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/LICENSE.txt?ref=ghuntley.com">open-source</a>" (as per the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd?ref=ghuntley.com">OSD</a>) the value-add which transforms the editor into anything of value ("what people <em>actually</em> refer to when they talk about using VSCode") is far from open and full of intentionally designed minefields that often makes using Visual Studio Code in any other way than what Microsoft desires legally risky...</blockquote><p>In this blog post, we explore the ecosystem of open-source forks, revisit the story so far with how Microsoft has been transforming from products to services, go deep into why the Visual Studio Code ecosystem is designed to fracture, and the legal implications of this design then discuss future problems faced by the software development ecosystem if our industry continues as-is on the current path...</p><figure><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yup!

DevDiv today includes our developer tools and services including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, NET and C#, TypeScript, and the OpenJDK. Our Azure Developer SDKs, as well as our Azure Application Development PaS and Serverless offerings (including our Azure App Services, Functions, Logic Apps, API Management, Dapr, Redis Cache, Spring Cloud services, etc.) are also part of this organization. </p><p>I'm very pleased to announce the promotion of Julia Liuson to President, Microsoft Developer Division. As part of today's changes, Thomas Dohmke, CEO of GitHub, will report to Julia going forward, as will Julia's existing DevDiv reports. </p><p>Julia has been instrumental in Microsoft's adoption of open source, and in the transformation of Microsoft's developer strategy. As the leader of DevDiv, she helped guide the open sourcing of -NET (which now runs on every major OS platform), as well as the creation and open sourcing of Visual Studio Code (now the most popular development tool in the world). She initiated our deep engagement with the Python community, including hiring Python creator Guido van Rossum to Microsoft, and her team now delivers the most widely used Python developer tooling in the world (with VS and VS Code) as well as delivers runtime performance for the broader Python community. She started the OpenJDK effort at Microsoft, which is now used broadly to run Java workloads on Azure. And over the last 9 months she has led our Azure Application Developer PaS and Serverless offerings and has helped drive to make these services great for developers using all languages, tools, and platforms. </p><p>Under Julia's leadership, the Developer Division team has undergone a significant cultural transformation and is guided by consistent cultural values: diversity &amp; inclusion, customer obsession, data-driven, and quality-driven. The pervasiveness of these culture attributes is evident through the success of products like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, which have experienced more than 16x usage growth since 2014 (and are now used by the majority of developers in the world). </p><p>I deeply admire how committed Julia is to team culture, mentorship, and how she helps generate opportunities for others to succeed. She is an avid supporter of MakeCode (which is also built by her team) as an investment to help kids learn programming and pursue computer science in earty education. Julia was one of the first women at Microsoft to be promoted to Corporate Vice President of Engineering leading development teams at Microsoft, and she is a mentor and sponsor to women and men across Microsoft today. She received the Asian American Executive of the Year award in 2013 and was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2019. </p><p>Please join me in thanking Julia for the outstanding leadership she provides, and in congratulating her on the well-deserved promotion and expanded remit.</p></blockquote><p>Instead of GitHub reporting directly to Scott Guthrie, GitHub now reports to the person who looks after numerous products within the developer division.

	<span>As the songwriter</span>  of legendary compositions like “Help Me Make It Through the Night,” “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,” and “Me and Bobby McGee,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/kris-kristofferson/" id="auto-tag_kris-kristofferson" data-tag="kris-kristofferson">Kris Kristofferson</a> transformed lyrics into literature, elevating the craft to a legitimate American art form in a way few had done before. Part Romantic poet, part folk troubadour, part country-music storyteller, Kristofferson died Saturday at the age of 88.</p>



<p>
	A spokesperson for Kristofferson, Ebie McFarland, confirmed the musician’s death, adding that the “artist, singer, songwriter, actor and activist … passed away peacefully in his home in Maui, Hawaii … surrounded by family.” A cause of death was not immediately available.</p>



<p>
	<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-kris-kristofferson-songs-1235116076/">Songwriting</a> was merely one aspect to the Renaissance man, who was also a Golden Globe-winning actor, Golden Gloves boxer, Rhodes scholar, author, U.S. Army veteran, pilot, and onetime record-label janitor. But it was his penetrating lyricism that caused a seismic shift in the perception of country music by the late Sixties. Well-educated (with a military discipline) though he was, he quickly fell in with the freshman class of “outlaw” singer-songwriters that would buck the star system and influence generations to come.

	</p>




<p>
	The eldest of three children, Kristoffer Kristofferson was born June 22, 1936, in Brownsville, Texas. His father, Lars, the son of a Swedish army veteran, was a pilot and a major general in the U.S. Air Force who went on to work for Pan American Airways. The family moved frequently, settling in San Mateo, California, when Kristofferson was in junior high. A model student who earned the nickname “Straight Arrow,” he graduated from high school in San Mateo in 1954, and went on to study creative writing at Pomona College, winning several prizes in a short-story contest sponsored by <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> magazine. Graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1958, he received a Rhodes scholarship to England’s Oxford University.

</p>



<p>
	Although intent on becoming a novelist, Kristofferson concentrated his studies on the poetry of William Blake, and penned and performed his first songs while studying at Oxford’s Merton College. In England, he cut his first singles (credited to “Kris Carson”) for Top Rank Records, although they went unreleased at the time. After earning a master’s degree in English literature from Oxford in 1960, Kristofferson, who planned to resume his studies there, flew home to California for Christmas break. Reuniting with an old girlfriend, Fran Beir, the couple married and had a daughter, Tracy, and a son, Kris. Instead of returning to Oxford, Kristofferson enlisted in the Army.

<p>
	Kristofferson served as a helicopter pilot while in the Army and attained the rank of captain. During a three-year tour in West Germany (with his wife and daughter in tow), he organized a band, learning the Bob Dylan songs as recorded by Peter, Paul, and Mary (his band’s Dobro player gave him the folk trio’s LPs). On leave in the spring of 1965, Kristofferson took his first trip to Nashville. He had been tapped for a position teaching English literature at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point after leaving West Germany, but his two weeks in Nashville scuttled that plan. He became enamored of the songwriting circle, befriending songwriter and music publisher Marijohn Wilkin (“The Long Black Veil”), Bobby Bare (“Detroit City”), and producer Cowboy Jack Clement.

	</p>




<p>
	“I came down to Nashville,”&nbsp;Kristofferson <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kris-kristofferson-last-outlaw-poet-ethan-hawke-interview-714098/">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a> in 2009. “I’d been playing in an Army band, so people introduced me around like I was somebody. Everybody still called me ‘Captain.’ And I wrote seven, maybe 11 songs that first week. I thought if I didn’t make it as a songwriter I would at least get material to be the Great American Novelist. The people and places I was seeing were more exciting than anything I’d ever come across.”</p>



<p>
	Kristofferson and his family settled in Nashville, where he continued to write songs. He took a job as janitor at Columbia Recording Studios (“Emptying ashtrays and sweeping floors,” he <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kris-kristofferson-last-outlaw-poet-ethan-hawke-interview-714098/">described</a> it), in addition to working as a part-time helicopter pilot flying back and forth between offshore oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. A story about how he once landed his helicopter in Johnny Cash’s yard to give the country star his demo tape would become country-music apocrypha.

<p>
	Kristofferson’s marriage to Fran began to crumble, and when their son developed health problems, the couple faced thousands of dollars in medical bills. The financial strain took its toll, and Kristofferson’s wife left with the children to live in California while he continued to pursue music.</p>



<p>
	That career path didn’t sit well with Kristofferson’s mother, who sent him a letter telling him he was throwing his life away by writing songs and idolizing Johnny Cash. Kristofferson and Cash later shared a laugh together when Clement showed Cash that infamous letter. “It’s always great to get a letter from home, isn’t it, Kris?” Cash joked.</p>



<p>
	In 1967, Kristofferson recorded his debut single as a performer, “Golden Idol,” which promptly flopped. His songwriting, however, took off, and his songs landed on the charts via artists like Roy Drusky (“Jody and the Kid”), Billy Walker (“From the Bottle to the Bottom”), Ray Stevens (“Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down”), Jerry Lee Lewis (“Once More With Feeling”), Faron Young (“Your Time’s Comin'”), and Roger Miller (“Me and Bobby McGee,” “Best of All Possible Worlds,” “Darby’s Castle”). By the end of the Sixties, as the folk scene was fading in New York, Kristofferson played the Bitter End in<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/talkin-greenwich-village-book-bob-dylan-blowin-in-the-wind-1235098870/"> Greenwich Village</a>, where luminaries including Bob Dylan saw him perform. Kristofferson was one of Nashville’s most in-demand songwriters, but he was still just getting started.

	</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	In 1969, Carl Perkins gave up a prime opening slot for Cash so that Kristofferson could make his Newport Folk Festival debut, with Cash introducing him. The Man in Black also let him hang around backstage at his weekly ABC show, which was being filmed at Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium. There, Kristofferson mingled with artists and hustled his songwriting demos. By the turn of the decade, a whirlwind of recognition as both a songwriter and artist was underway. Signed by Fred Foster to Monument Records in 1970, Kristofferson released his eponymous LP, which featured new originals as well as some of his familiar hits for other artists. Although a Top 10 chart hit, the LP was otherwise unsuccessful.</p>



<p>
	After his sophomore release, 1971’s <em>The Silver Tongued Devil and I</em>, sold more briskly, Kristofferson’s debut album was rereleased as <em>Me &amp; Bobby McGee</em>, capitalizing on the success of the title song, a posthumous Number One pop hit for Janis Joplin. Kristofferson and Joplin shared her house in Mill Valley, California, for a while, where jam sessions with fellow musicians, actors, and others were commonplace. (He played the Isle of Wight Festival in the summer of 1970, sharing the final day’s bill with Jimi Hendrix, who would die from an overdose just a few weeks later.)</p>



<p>
	In 1970, Ray Price released his countrypolitan recording of Kristofferson’s “For the Good Times,” which helped the composition win the Academy of Country Music’s Song of the Year. Cash’s version of “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down” secured the Song of the Year award that same year from the Country Music Association. Kristofferson’s double win for Song of the Year in 1970 marked the only time a single individual has ever won the same award from the ACM and CMA in the same year for two different songs.</p>



<p>
	Dozens of artists as diverse as Jerry Lee Lewis, Joe Simon, and Patti Page continued to cut his songs, and Kristofferson would earn several Grammy nominations and win three trophies over his life, including Best Country Song for “Help Me Make It Through the Night” in 1971. A track from his second LP, the nostalgic “Lovin’ Her Was Easier (Than Anything I’ll Ever Do Again)” was a Top Five Adult Contemporary hit, marking his highest chart entry up to that point as a solo artist. The tune also reached the pop Top 30.

<p>
	Simultaneous to his commercial breakthrough in music, Kristofferson made his film debut in Dennis Hopper’s 1971 film <em>The Last Movie</em>. A commercial and critical disaster, it was followed by the lead role in <em>Cisco Pike</em>, which also starred Gene Hackman, Karen Black, and musician Doug Sahm. In 1973, Kristofferson married his second wife, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-kristoffersons-make-it-35828/">singer Rita Coolidge</a>, and the couple had a daughter, Casey. His film work continued with an appearance in Cash’s <em>The Gospel Road: A Story of Jesus</em>, and he played an unemployed musician in <em>Blume in Love</em>. His role as Billy in Sam Peckinpah’s <em>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</em>, which also starred Bob Dylan, earned Kristofferson a BAFTA award nomination for Most Promising Newcomer. In 1974, he co-starred with Ellen Burstyn in the Oscar-winning <em>Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore</em>, directed by Martin Scorsese.</p>



<p>
	But two of Kristofferson’s most noteworthy early film roles were surrounded by publicity that somewhat obscured his exceptional performances. A controversial <em>Playboy</em> spread with co-star Sarah Miles accompanied the erotic 1976 drama <em>The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea</em>. That same year, he shared the screen with Barbra Streisand in the rock &amp; roll reboot of <em>A Star Is Born</em>. The third-most profitable film of the year, it was nonetheless savaged by critics, with Streisand and Kristofferson’s volatile on-set clashes becoming the stuff of Hollywood legend.</p>



<p>
	By the end of the Seventies, Kristofferson had released nine solo albums with varying critical results. His first two LPs were buoyed by the ubiquity of their material and feature two of the most iconic lines in popular music: “Freedom’s just another word for nothin’ left to lose,” from “Me and Bobby McGee,” and “He’s a walkin’ contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,” from “The Pilgrim, Chapter 33,” written about some of his comrades, including Cash and Hopper.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	<em>Border Lord</em>, his third album, was largely a commercial disappointment. His fourth release in a two-and-a-half-year period, <em>Jesus Was a Capricorn</em> surfaced in November 1972, with a title cut that borrowed its melody from John Prine’s “Grandpa Was a Carpenter.” After several failed singles, Kristofferson earned his first — and only — country hit and his bestselling pop single as a solo artist: Inspired by both Larry Gatlin’s “Help Me” and an altar call while visiting a church with country singer Connie Smith at a desperately low point in his life, Kristofferson’s “Why Me” reached Number One on the country chart and spent 19 weeks on the pop survey as well, becoming one of the bestselling singles of the year.

	</p>




<p>
	Between duet albums with his wife Coolidge, Kristofferson released the 1974 LP <em>Spooky Lady’s Sideshow</em>, with several tracks chronicling the trappings of fame and addiction, mirroring his mounting battle with alcohol. He quit drinking after his Golden Globe-winning turn in <em>A Star Is Born</em>.</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Why Me" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DzVycgM8XHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>
	Kristofferson’s film career would continue over the next four decades, with Peckinpah directing him again in 1978’s <em>Convoy</em>. His next big-screen role was in 1980’s <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>, one of the most notorious box-office and critical flops of its time. Kristofferson would team with his longtime friend Willie Nelson for the 1984 film <em>Songwriter</em>, but a much more successful venture would emerge the following year as the two pals joined Cash and Waylon Jennings to record and tour as the Highwaymen. The supergroup would record Jimmy Webb’s “Highwayman,” which became Kristofferson’s second and final Number One country hit.</p>



<p>
	Kristofferson’s politically charged 1986 LP, <em>Repossessed</em>, his first solo project in five years, was highlighted by “They Killed Him,” a tribute to Gandhi, Jesus, and Martin Luther King Jr., which Dylan would later cover. Kristofferson continued to raise social awareness and address political causes throughout his career, beginning with a 1972 concert benefiting Cesar Chavez and United Farm Workers. In the Eighties, he traveled to Nicaragua and controversially criticized the U.S. involvement in the Contras’ attempts to overthrow the country’s ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front. His Central American activism inspired the 1990 concept album, <em>Third World Warrior</em>.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	“Not everybody agrees with what I’m saying,” Kristofferson told left-leaning magazine <a href="https://www.rosajordan.com/kris.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>The Progressive</em></a> in 1991. “But my shows are set up so, from beginning to end, the feeling is a belief in the human spirit. I don’t think you could come and argue with the principles. By the end of the show, the crowds always seem to be on their feet.”</p>



<p>
	Late-career solo albums included <em>A Moment of Forever</em>, in 1995, and <em>The Austin Sessions</em>, a 1999 collection of stripped-down versions of some of his best-known tunes with guest appearances from Alison Krauss, Steve Earle, and Mark Knopfler. These were followed by a trio of reflective LPs: <em>This Old Road</em> (2006), <em>Closer to the Bone</em> (2009), and <em>Feeling Mortal</em> (2013). In 2016, he released <em>The Cedar Creek Sessions</em>, a two-disc collection of his past songs rerecorded in Austin.

	</p>




<p>
	Eric Church, who titled his one-man show after Kristofferson’s song “To Beat the Devil,” <a href="https://x.com/ericchurch/status/1840582759493865726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">praised the songwriter</a> as “the ultimate life well lived” in a social media post. “Thank you for being a beacon of light in a darkening world. You were my hero and my role model. And even then, you managed to exceed my expectations when you became my friend.”</p>



<p>
	“Kris helped me to believe in myself as a songwriter when I was a boy,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/lukasnelson/status/1840553522703569010?s=19">Lukas Nelson shared</a> on social media, along with a photo of Kristofferson holding him when they “first met” while he was a baby. “Other than my father, he was my greatest inspiration. He embodied humility and kindness, and carried his grace into his words and music with unique eloquence.”</p>



<p>
	“What a great loss, what a great writer. What a great actor, what a great friend,” Dolly Parton said in a statement. “I will always love you.”</p>



<p>
	Of his later films, Kristofferson will perhaps be best remembered for his role as a sadistic sheriff in John Sayles’ 1996 masterful crime drama <em>Lone Star</em>, which was followed by appearances in the <em>Blade</em> trilogy and 1998’s <em>A Soldier’s Daughter Never Cries</em>, a fictionalized account of the life of <em>From Here to Eternity</em> author James Jones. Kristofferson acted in more than 50 films over the next two decades, including <em>Bloodworth</em>, <em>Dolphin Tale</em>, and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/blaze-movie-review-ethan-hawke-718840/"><em>Blaze</em></a>, director Ethan Hawke’s 2018 biopic of songwriter Blaze Foley that would be Kristofferson’s final onscreen role.</p>



<p>
	But it’s his role in <em>A Star Is Born</em> with which he’s most identified. Following news of his death, Streisand recalled the moment she realized she wanted Kristofferson for the film. “The first time I saw Kris performing at the Troubadour club in L.A. I knew he was something special. Barefoot and strumming his guitar, he seemed like the perfect choice for a script I was developing, which eventually became A Star Is Born,” she<a href="https://x.com/BarbraStreisand/status/1840564305063821406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> wrote</a> on Twitter. “For my latest concert in 2019 at London’s Hyde Park, I asked Kris to join me on-stage to sing our other A Star Is Born duet, ‘Lost Inside Of You.’ He was as charming as ever, and the audience showered him with applause. It was a joy seeing him receive the recognition and love he so richly deserved.”</p>



<p>
	Kristofferson quietly announced his <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/kris-kristofferson-retired-final-concert-1120051/">retirement</a> from touring, recording, and acting in January 2021.

	</p>




<p>
	In 1970, he bought property in Hana, a secluded town on the Hawaiian island of Maui. In addition to his three older children, Kristofferson raised five children with his third wife, Lisa Meyers. As Kristofferson began suffering from memory loss later in his life (which he ultimately attributed to Lyme disease), Meyers became indispensable, traveling with her husband and helping him navigate interviews. When he was saluted with an all-star concert in 2017 as the guest performer on the 2020 Outlaw Country Cruise (his final full performance), Meyers was by his side. She balked at calling herself Kristofferson’s manager though. “He’s unmanageable. You can’t manage him,” she <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/kris-kristofferson-an-outlaw-at-80-183141/">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>. “Even if someone tells him to have a good day, he’ll say, ‘Don’t tell me what to do.'”

	But that stubborn streak also helped Kristofferson achieve such artistic heights. He was uncompromising in his songwriting, his acting, and onstage, where he’d strum his guitar, play harmonica, and sing in his infamously craggy voice. “I don’t think I’m that good a singer,” he told&nbsp;<em>Rolling Stone</em>. “I can’t think of a song that I’ve written that I don’t like the way somebody else sings it better.”</p>



<p>
	Still, for all his trailblazing, he was also content to allow fate and his spirituality to guide him. “I really have no anxiety about controlling my own life,” Kristofferson <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/kris-kristofferson-an-outlaw-at-80-183141/">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a> in 2016. “Somehow I just slipped into it and it’s worked. It’s not up to me — or you. I feel very lucky that [life]’s lasted so long because I’ve done so many things that could have knocked me out of it. But somehow I just always have the feeling that He knows what He’s doing.”</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Goals</h2><a id="user-content-goals" aria-label="Permalink: Goals" href="#goals"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Syncthing is a <strong>continuous file synchronization program</strong>. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/main/GOALS.md">Goals document</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Syncthing should be:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Safe From Data Loss</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Protecting the user's data is paramount. We take every reasonable
precaution to avoid corrupting the user's files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Secure Against Attackers</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Again, protecting the user's data is paramount. Regardless of our other
goals, we must never allow the user's data to be susceptible to
eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Easy to Use</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Automatic</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Universally Available</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
latest technology is not always available to every individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>For Individuals</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
secure, and easy to use file synchronization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Everything Else</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">There are many things we care about that don't make it on to the list. It
is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
with the stated goals above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started</h2><a id="user-content-getting-started" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started" href="#getting-started"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html" rel="nofollow">getting started guide</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/main/etc">the etc directory</a>. There are also several <a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/users/contrib.html#gui-wrappers" rel="nofollow">GUI
implementations</a> for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Docker</h2><a id="user-content-docker" aria-label="Permalink: Docker" href="#docker"></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h2><a id="user-content-building" aria-label="Permalink: Building" href="#building"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run <code>go run build.go</code> and the
binaries are created in <code>./bin</code>. There's <a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/building.html" rel="nofollow">a guide</a> with more details on the
build process.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Signed Releases</h2><a id="user-content-signed-releases" aria-label="Permalink: Signed Releases" href="#signed-releases"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As of v0.10.15 and onwards, release binaries are GPG signed with the key
D26E6ED000654A3E, available from <a href="https://syncthing.net/security/" rel="nofollow">https://syncthing.net/security/</a> and
most key servers.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also a built-in automatic upgrade mechanism (disabled in some
distribution channels) which uses a compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS
binaries are also properly code signed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2><a id="user-content-documentation" aria-label="Permalink: Documentation" href="#documentation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Please see the Syncthing <a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/" rel="nofollow">documentation site</a> <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/docs">[source]</a>.</p>
