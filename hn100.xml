            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/death-of-show-hn/">https://www.arthurcnops.blog/death-of-show-hn/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47045804">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><a href="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/">← Back</a><p>Feb 17, 2026 · Arthur Cnops</p><p>A few days ago I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47023255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to Show HN</a>. I had good fun building that useless little internet experience. The post quickly disappeared from Show HN's first page, amongst the rest of the vibecoded pulp. And to be clear, I'm fine with that.</p>
<p>The behavior on Show HN was interesting to see though. So I pulled the data.</p>
<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p>Show HN of course isn't dead. You could even say it's more alive than ever. What has changed is the volume of posts and engagement per post. It's only natural when more projects are being built in a single weekend. There's less "Proof of Work".</p>
<p>From the business side of this, Johan Halse recently called this <a href="https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2026/02/03/the-sideprocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sideprocalypse</a>: the end of the small indie developer's dream. Every idea has been built, marketed better, and SEO'd into oblivion by someone with more money.</p>
<p>Some cool projects aren't getting through this noise, which is a pity. Here are a few I thought were interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47012984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neohabit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46965662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenRun</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47003384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uForwarder</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I just upvoted them!</p>
<p>Now, let's look at some data.</p>
<h2>Volume Is Exploding</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-volume.svg" alt="HN volume over time for all posts, Show HN, and non-Show-HN"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-share.svg" alt="Show HN monthly share of all HN story volume"></p>
<h2>The Graveyard Is Growing</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-one-point.svg" alt="1-point share over time for Show HN versus non-Show-HN"></p>
<p>Show HN started out <em>better</em> than regular submissions. Now it's significantly <em>worse</em>.</p>
<h2>The Shrinking Window</h2>
<p>How long does a Show HN post stay on page 1 before being pushed off? During peak hours (US daytime):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-visibility.svg" alt="Estimated visibility time for Show HN posts during peak hours"></p>
<h2>Discussion Is Dying Too</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-comments.svg" alt="Average comments per Show HN post"></p>
<h2>So Is Show HN Dead?</h2>
<p>No. There's just more noise, and less opportunity to get attention and have a discussion with other folks on HN about your project. Some gems go completely unnoticed. Maybe something for HN to think about: how do these subjective "gems" get more spotlight? How does HN remain the coolest place to talk about the coolest tech?</p>

<h2 id="introduction-feel-free-to-skip">Introduction (feel free to skip)</h2>

<p>Just a year ago, I was really deep into the Apple ecosystem. It seemed like there was no turning back from the orchard for me. Phone, laptop, watch, tablet, video and music streaming, cloud storage, and even a key tracker. All from one manufacturer. Plus shared family photo albums, calendars, and even shopping lists.</p>

<p>However, at some point, I discovered <a href="https://plenti.app/">Plenti</a>, a company that rents a really wide range of different devices at quite reasonable prices. Casually, I threw the phrase “samsung fold” into the search engine on their website and it turned out that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 could be rented for just 250-300 PLN per month. That was quite an interesting option, as I was insanely curious about how it is to live with a foldable phone, which after unfolding becomes the equivalent of a tablet. Plus, I would never dare to buy this type of device, because firstly, their price is astronomical, and secondly, I have serious doubts about the longevity of the folding screen. I checked the rental conditions from Plenti and nothing raised my suspicions. Renting seemed like a really cool option, so I decided to get the Fold 6 for half a year. That’s how I broke out of the orchard and slightly reopened the doors to my heart for solutions without the apple logo. I even wrote a post about the whole process - <a href="https://blog.tomaszdunia.pl/zdradzilem-teamapple-eng/">I betrayed #TeamApple for broken phone</a>. What I’m getting at is that this is how Android returned to my living room and I think I started liking it anew.</p>

<p>My adventure with Samsung ended after the planned 6 months. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a good phone, and the ability to unfold it to the size of a tablet is an amazing feature. However, what bothered me about it was:</p>

<ol>
  <li>after folding it was terribly thick,</li>
  <li>it couldn’t be used in a case, because all the covers either didn’t fit or slipped off the part that has screens on both sides,</li>
  <li>naked, it was very blocky, even sharp, which caused me discomfort; holding it was simply unpleasant,</li>
  <li>paying 300 PLN (~80 USD) for rent is a good short-term solution to get something to test, but not in the long run.</li>
</ol>

<p>All the points above made me give up on extending the rental and start wondering what to do next. Interestingly, I liked Android enough that I didn’t necessarily want to go back to iOS. Around this time, an article hit my RSS reader: <a href="https://ithardware.pl/aktualnosci/grapheneos_ucieka_francja_kraj_niebezpieczny_prywatnosc_open_source-46855.html">Creators of the most secure version of Android fear France. Travel ban for the whole team</a> (I think it was this one, but I’m not entirely sure, it doesn’t really matter). It talked about how France wants to get its hands on the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/"><strong>GrapheneOS</strong></a> system and thus carry out a very serious attack on the privacy of its users. I thought then, “Hey! A European country <strong>wants to force a backdoor into the system</strong>, because it is too well secured to surveil its users. Either this is artificially blowing the topic out of proportion, or <strong>there is actually something special about this system!</strong>”. At that moment, a somewhat forgotten nerd gene ignited in me. I decided to abandon not only iOS, but also mainstream Android, and try a completely alternative system.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-grapheneos">What is GrapheneOS</h2>

<p>GrapheneOS is a custom, <strong>open-source operating system</strong> designed with the idea of <strong>providing users with the highest level of privacy and security</strong>. It is based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), but differs significantly from standard software versions found in smartphones. Its creators completely <strong>eliminated integration with Google services</strong> at the system level, which avoids tracking and data collection by corporations, while offering a modern and stable working environment.</p>

<p>The system is distinguished by advanced “hardening” of the kernel and key components, which minimizes vulnerability to hacking attacks and exploits. A unique feature of GrapheneOS is the ability to run Google Play Services in an <strong>isolated environment</strong> (sandbox), allowing the user to use popular applications without granting them broad system permissions. Currently, the project focuses on supporting <strong>Google Pixel</strong> series phones, utilizing their dedicated Titan M security chips for full data protection.</p>

<h2 id="dedicated-devices">Dedicated devices</h2>

<p>When I used to read about GrapheneOS, the list of compatible devices included items from several different manufacturers. Now it’s only Google Pixel devices. This doesn’t mean you can’t run this system on a Samsung, for example, but the creators simply don’t guarantee it will work properly, and you have to deal with potentially porting the version yourself. Note that it’s quite funny that <strong>a system freed from Google services should be run exactly on Google devices</strong>. If anyone wants to read more about why Pixels are the best for GrapheneOS, I recommend checking out the following keywords - Verified Boot, Titan M, IOMMU, MTE.</p>

<h3 id="list-of-supported-devices-february-2026">List of supported devices (February 2026)</h3>

<p><em>I’ve bolded the items that are not only supported but also recommended (at the time of writing this post, you can find the current list <a href="https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices">here</a>)</em></p>

<h3 id="my-smartphone-choice">My smartphone choice</h3>
<p>At the stage of choosing a device to test GrapheneOS on, I wasn’t yet sure if such a solution would work for me at all and if I’d last with it in the long run. So it would be unreasonable to lay out a significant amount of money. Because of this, probably the only sensible choice was the <strong>Google Pixel 9a</strong>. This was a few months ago, when not enough time had passed since the premiere of the 10 series models for them to make it onto the fully supported devices list. At that time, the Pixel 9a was the freshest device on the list (<strong>offering up to 7 YEARS of support!</strong>) and on top of that, it was very attractively priced, as I bought it for around <strong>1600 PLN</strong> (~450 USD).</p>

<p>In retrospect, I still consider it a good choice and definitely <strong>recommend this path to anyone</strong> who is currently at the stage of deciding on what hardware to start their GrapheneOS adventure. The only thing that bothers me a bit about the Pixel 9a is the quality of the photos it takes. I switched to it having previously had the iPhone 15 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, which are excellent in this regard, so it’s no wonder I’m a bit spoiled, because I was simply used to a completely different level of cameras. Now I also know that <strong>GrapheneOS will stay with me for longer</strong>, so it’s possible that knowing then what I know now, I would have opted for some more expensive gear. However, this isn’t important to me now, because for the time being I don’t plan to switch to another device, and by the time that changes, the market situation and the list of available options will certainly have changed too. Besides, I’m <strong>positively surprised by the battery life and overall performance of this phone</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="installing-grapheneos">Installing GrapheneOS</h2>

<h3 id="we-need">We need</h3>

<ol>
  <li>A suitable <strong>smartphone</strong> - in my case, it’s a Google Pixel 9a.</li>
  <li>A <strong>cable</strong> to connect the phone to a computer; it can’t be just any cable, but one that is used not only for charging but also for data transmission. It’s best to just use the cable that came with the phone.</li>
  <li>A <strong>computer with a Chromium-based browser</strong> (e.g., Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi?). Unfortunately, I must recommend Windows 10/11 here, because then you don’t have to mess around with any drivers; it’s the simplest option.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="phone-preparation">Phone preparation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If it’s new, we take it out of the box and <strong>turn it on</strong>. If it was previously used, we <strong>restore it to factory settings</strong> (Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Reset options -&gt; Erase all data (factory reset) -&gt; Erase all data). I think it’s stating the obvious, but I’ll write it anyway - a factory reset results in the deletion of all user data from the device, so if you have anything important on it, you need to back it up.</li>
  <li>We must <strong>go through the basic setup</strong> until we see the home screen. We do the absolute minimum. Here is a breakdown of the steps:
    <ul>
      <li>on the welcome screen, you can change the language to whatever suits you</li>
      <li>we skip the GSM services setup (SIM card)</li>
      <li>we don’t connect to Wi-Fi, so we skip this step too</li>
      <li>the date and time settings should be correct</li>
      <li>we turn off all Google Services (location, scanning, sending diagnostic data) and accept</li>
      <li>we don’t need to do anything with the warranty terms, so just the Next button</li>
      <li>we accept the Legal Terms</li>
      <li>we set some easy PIN, e.g., 12345</li>
      <li>there is no need to waste time setting up biometrics, so we politely decline and skip fingerprint and face scan</li>
      <li>a moment of waiting</li>
      <li>we skip the tutorial</li>
      <li>swipe up and we’re done, we are on the home screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>First of all, we need to make sure that <strong>our phone’s software is updated</strong> to the latest available version. For this purpose, we go to <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; System update</strong>. If necessary, we update.</li>
  <li>Next, we go to <strong>Settings -&gt; About phone -&gt; find the Build number field</strong> and tap it 7 times until we see the message <strong>You are now a developer</strong>. In the meantime, the phone will ask for the PIN we set during the phone setup.</li>
  <li>We go back and now enter <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer options -&gt; turn on the OEM unlocking option</strong>. The phone will ask for the PIN again. After entering it, we still have to confirm that we definitely want to remove the lock.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</h3>

<ol>
  <li>We start the bootloader unlocking process by <strong>turning off the phone</strong>.</li>
  <li>When the screen goes completely dark, <strong>we simultaneously press and hold the power and volume down buttons</strong> until the text-based <strong>Fastboot Mode</strong> interface appears. If the phone starts up normally, it means we performed one of the earlier steps incorrectly.</li>
  <li>We connect the <strong>phone to the computer</strong>.</li>
  <li>We go to the computer and open the browser (based on the Chromium engine) to the address <strong><a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web">https://grapheneos.org/install/web</a></strong>.</li>
  <li>We go to the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</a> section and press the <strong>Unlock bootloader</strong> button.</li>
  <li>A window with a list of devices to choose from will pop up in the browser. There should basically be only one item on it, and that should be our Pixel. <strong>We select it and press the Connect button</strong>.</li>
  <li>Changes will occur on the phone’s display. A message will appear asking to confirm that we actually want to unlock the bootloader. To do this, we must press one of the volume buttons so that instead of <strong>Do not unlock the bootlader</strong>, <strong>Unlock the bootlader</strong> appears. At this point, we can confirm by <strong>pressing the power button</strong>.</li>
  <li>If everything succeeded, among the data displayed in Fastboot Mode we should see <strong>Device state: unlocked</strong> (in red).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="downloading-and-flashing-the-system-image">Downloading and flashing the system image</h3>

<ol>
  <li>On the GrapheneOS website, we scroll down to the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#obtaining-factory-images">Obtaining factory images</a> section and press the <strong>Download release</strong> button. If the phone is still connected to the computer, the website will decide on its own which system image to download.</li>
  <li>We wait for the download to finish. It is obvious that the time needed for this depends directly on the speed of the internet connection.</li>
  <li>When the download is complete, we can go to the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-factory-images">Flashing factory images</a> section below and press <strong>Flash release</strong>.</li>
  <li>Spit over your left shoulder now, hold your breath, and under no circumstances unplug the phone from the computer. Best not to touch either device at all.</li>
  <li>When the process is complete, the phone will restart itself and return to the Fastboot Mode interface. In the browser, we will see the message <strong>Flashed …</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="re-locking-the-bootloader">Re-locking the bootloader</h3>

<p>Locking the bootloader is crucial because it enables the full operation of the Verified Boot feature. It also prevents the use of fastboot mode to flash, format, or wipe partitions. Verified Boot detects any modifications to the OS partitions and blocks the reading of any altered or corrupted data. If changes are detected, the system uses error correction data to attempt to recover the original data, which is then verified again – thanks to this mechanism, the system is resilient to accidental (non-malicious) file corruption.</p>

<p>However, before re-securing the bootloader, I recommend checking if the system was flashed correctly and everything works as it should, because if it doesn’t, locking the bootloader might brick (completely block, or even damage) the phone. Therefore:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Being in Fastboot Mode, when we see the <strong>Start</strong> message, we press the power button, which will cause the system to start normally. If we don’t see <strong>Start</strong> at the height of the power button, we have to press the volume buttons and find this option.</li>
  <li>When the phone starts up, we can immediately perform the basic setup. The bootloader won’t run away.</li>
  <li>This is a standard procedure, so we will only go through it briefly:
    <ul>
      <li>welcome screen</li>
      <li>we choose the <strong>language</strong></li>
      <li>we choose the time zone and thus set the <strong>date and time</strong></li>
      <li>we connect to <strong>Wi-Fi</strong></li>
      <li>if you can, you can immediately set up the <strong>SIM card</strong>, but you can also postpone it for later</li>
      <li>I recommend turning off the <strong>location service</strong>, because it’s better to configure it calmly later by granting permissions only to apps that really need it</li>
      <li>securing the phone with a <strong>fingerprint</strong>; I personally am an advocate of this solution, so I recommend using it, GrapheneOS does not (yet) support face unlock, so fingerprint and a standard password are the only methods we have to choose from (of course I reject pattern unlock right at the start as a form of screen lock that cannot even in good conscience be called any security)</li>
      <li>I assume that if you are reading this post, you are a graphene freshman and you have no <strong>backup</strong> to restore, so we just skip this step</li>
      <li><strong>Start</strong> button and we are on the home screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If everything is working correctly, you can now go ahead and turn off the phone and turn it on while holding the power button and volume down, just like we did earlier.</li>
  <li>We land back in Fastboot Mode. I assume the phone was connected to the computer the whole time (if not, reconnect it). We return to the browser on the computer. We find the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#locking-the-bootloader">Locking the bootloader</a> section and press the <strong>Lock bootloader</strong> button.</li>
  <li>Again, confirmation of this operation on the phone is required. It looks analogous to unlocking, except this time, using the volume buttons, we have to make the <strong>Lock the bootloader</strong> option active and confirm it with the power button.</li>
  <li>The result should be a change of <strong>Device state</strong> to <strong>locked</strong> (in green).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="restoring-the-oem-lock">Restoring the OEM lock</h3>

<p>The final step before starting to play with the new system is reapplying the OEM lock.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Just like when removing the lock, we go to <strong>Settings -&gt; About phone -&gt; find the Build number field</strong> and tap it 7 times until we see the message <strong>You are now a developer</strong>. In the meantime, the phone will ask for the PIN we set during the phone setup.</li>
  <li>We go back and now enter <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer options -&gt; turn off the OEM unlocking option</strong>. The phone will ask us to restart to change this setting, but for now we cancel this request, because we still want to <strong>completely turn off Developer options</strong>, which is done by unchecking the box next to the first option at the very top, <strong>Use developer options</strong>.</li>
  <li>Now we can <strong>restart the device</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-vision-of-using-grapheneos">My vision of using GrapheneOS</h2>

<p>Now the real fun begins. You’ll hear/read as many opinions on what you should and shouldn’t do regarding GrapheneOS hardening as there are people. Some are conservative, while others approach the topic a bit more liberally. In my opinion, there is no one right path, and everyone should dig around, test things out, and decide what suits them and fits their security profile. You’ll quickly find out that <strong>GrapheneOS is really one big compromise between convenience and privacy</strong>. While this same rule applies to everything belonging to the digital world, it’s only in this case that you’ll truly notice it, because <strong>GrapheneOS will show you how many things you can control, which you can’t do using conventional Android</strong>.
I don’t intend to use this post to promote some “one and only” method of using GrapheneOS. I’ll simply present how I use this system. This way, I’ll show the basics to people fresh to the topic, maybe I’ll manage to suggest an interesting trick they didn’t know to those who have been users for a while, and on a third note, maybe some expert will show up who, after reading my ramblings, will suggest something interesting or point out what I’m doing wrong / could do better. I’m sure that’s the case, since my adventure with GrapheneOS has practically only been going on for 3 months. I warn you right away that I’m not sure if I’ll be able to maintain a logical train of thought, as I’ll probably jump around topics a bit. <strong>The subject of GrapheneOS is vast</strong> and in today’s post I’ll only manage to slightly touch upon it.</p>

<h3 id="additional-user-profile">Additional user profile</h3>

<p>One of the first things I did after booting up the freshly installed system was to create a second user profile. This is done in <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Multiple users</strong>. The idea is for this feature to allow two (or more) people to use one phone, each having a separate profile with their own settings, apps, etc. Who in their right mind does that? While I can imagine sharing a home tablet, sharing a phone completely eludes me. It therefore seems like a dead feature, but nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>For me, it works like this: on the <strong><em>Owner</em></strong> user, because that’s the name of the main account created automatically with the system, I installed the <strong>Google Play Store</strong> along with <strong>Google Play services</strong> and <strong>GmsCompatConfig</strong>. This is done through the <strong>App Store</strong> application, which is a component of the GrapheneOS system. Please don’t confuse this with Apple’s app store, even though the name is the same. From the Play Store I only installed the following applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>mBank</strong> - paying via contactless BLIK through NFC is possible only having Google services installed and only works for me on the user profile with administrator privileges (Owner),</li>
  <li><strong>Mój T-Mobile</strong> - without Google services, the Magenta Moments tab didn’t work for me at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s it. As you can see, this profile serves me only for apps that absolutely require integration with Google services. In practice, I switch to it only when I want to pay contactlessly in a store, which I actually do rarely lately, because if there’s an option, I pay using BLIK codes. Right after switching from Samsung there were more apps on this profile, but one by one I successively gave up on those that made me dependent on the big G.</p>

<p>It’s on the <strong>second profile</strong>, which let’s assume I called <em>Tommy</em>, that I keep my entire digital life. What does this give me? For instance, the main profile cannot be easily deleted, but the additional one can. Let’s imagine a situation where I need to quickly wipe my phone, but in a way that its basic functions still work, i.e., without a full factory reset. An example could be, say, arriving in the USA and undergoing immigration control. They want access to my phone, so I delete the <em>Tommy</em> user, switch to the <em>Owner</em> user, and hand them the phone. It makes calls, sends SMS messages, even has a banking app, so theoretically it shouldn’t arouse suspicion. However, it lacks all my contacts, a browser with my visited pages history, a password manager, and messengers with chat histories. This is rather a drastic scenario, but not really that improbable, as actions like searching a phone upon arrival in the States are something that happens on a daily basis. Besides, the basic rule of security is <strong>not to use an account with administrator privileges on a daily basis</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="obtainium">Obtainium</h3>

<p>On GrapheneOS, Obtainium is my <strong>primary aggregator for obtaining .apk installation files and automating app updates</strong>. It’s like the Google Play Store, but privacy-respecting and for open-source applications. It would be a sin to use GrapheneOS and not at least try to switch to open-source apps. Below I present a list of apps that I use. Additionally, I’m tossing in links to the source code repositories of each of them.</p>

<h4 id="list-of-my-open-source-applications">List of my open-source applications</h4>

<h3 id="aurora-store">Aurora Store</h3>

<p>I have a few apps that are not open-source, but I still need them. In this case, I don’t download them from the Google Play Store, but exactly from the <strong>Aurora Store</strong>, which I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Aurora Store is an open-source client of the Google Play store (I guess you could call it a frontend) that <strong>allows downloading applications from Google servers without needing Google services</strong> (GMS) on the phone.</p>

<p>The Internet characterizes this solution as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Privacy</strong> - you don’t need to log in with a Google account to download free apps (you can use built-in anonymous accounts).</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong> - you install original .apk files straight from Google servers, not from unverified third-party sites.</li>
  <li><strong>Functionality</strong> - allows bypassing regional restrictions and installing apps that Google Play considers “incompatible” with a given device.</li>
  <li><strong>Open Source</strong> - the entire application code is transparent and auditable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds perfect, right? A bit, yes, but unfortunately not everything holds up completely. I have <strong>two main complaints</strong> about Aurora Store.</p>

<p>With these anonymous accounts, the thing is that <strong>sometimes they work, and sometimes they don’t</strong>, due to limits that are unreachable with a normal account used by one person, but when a thousand people download apps from one account at once, it starts to get suspicious, and the limits are exceeded quite quickly. Using Aurora Store violates the Google Play Store terms of service, so on the other hand <strong>if we use our Google account, it might be temporarily blocked</strong> or permanently banned. Some option here is to create a “burner” account just for this, but that takes away some of our privacy, because Google can still index us based on what we downloaded. Anonymous accounts in this case provide almost complete anonymity, because then we are just a drop in the ocean.</p>

<p>When it comes to security, yes, in theory we download .apk files from a verified source, but <strong>only under the condition that the Aurora Store creators don’t serve us a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man in the Middle</a> attack</strong>. The decision whether you trust the creators of this app is up to you.</p>

<h4 id="list-of-apps-whose-functionality-without-gms-i-have-verified">List of apps whose functionality without GMS I have verified</h4>

<p>Below I present a list of applications that I downloaded from the Aurora Store, checked, and can confirm that they work without GMS (Google Mobile Services).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Allegro</strong> - shopping</li>
  <li><strong>Apple Music</strong> - yes, I didn’t manage to give this up when ditching the iPhone</li>
  <li><strong>Apple TV</strong> - comes in a bundle, but if it didn’t I’d cancel the subscription, because Stremio is enough for me</li>
  <li><strong>Biedronka</strong> - grocery promos</li>
  <li><strong>Bolt</strong> - taxis</li>
  <li><strong>Booksy</strong> - barber</li>
  <li><strong>BPme</strong> - fuel promos</li>
  <li><strong>CityParkApp</strong> - city parking</li>
  <li><strong>Decathlon</strong> - I got rid of it, but it worked</li>
  <li><strong>DeepL</strong> - translator, is there any open-source alternative that is equally good?</li>
  <li><strong>Discord</strong> - after recent events I’ll probably get rid of it, because I basically don’t use it</li>
  <li><strong>Duolingo</strong> - the owl! learning Italian together is a daily routine for my daughters</li>
  <li><strong>DWService</strong> - remote desktop</li>
  <li><strong>Ekstraliga</strong> (speedway) - I’m a psycho fan</li>
  <li><strong>epark</strong> - city parking</li>
  <li><strong>Formula 1</strong> - I’m a psycho fan</li>
  <li><strong>Geoportal Mobile</strong> - spatial development plans, buggy as hell app, but works better than the mobile web version</li>
  <li><strong>GitHub</strong> - I know there is the OpenHub alternative, but it crashes for me after logging into GH</li>
  <li><strong>My municipality’s app</strong> - because I need to know when they’ll collect my trash :)</li>
  <li><strong>Jakdojade</strong> - bus schedules</li>
  <li><strong>Lidl Plus</strong> - grocery promos</li>
  <li><strong>LiveKid</strong> - communication with my daughter’s kindergarten</li>
  <li><strong>Messanger</strong> - shame on me, but unfortunately I have friends who can’t imagine life without FB…</li>
  <li><strong>OLX</strong> - local classifieds, I basically only use it for notifications</li>
  <li><strong>OpenVPN</strong> - I use it as a tunnel to my home network</li>
  <li><strong>park4night</strong> - great app for finding parking on vacation (not only in a camper)</li>
  <li><strong>Pepper</strong> - bargain hunting</li>
  <li><strong>Perplexity</strong> - I switched to Gemini, but I confirm it works</li>
  <li><strong>Synology Photos</strong> - my home photo gallery on a NAS</li>
  <li><strong>Pocket Casts</strong> - podcasts, I plan to migrate to AntennaPod</li>
  <li><strong>Reddit</strong> - honestly I don’t know why I need the app, but it works</li>
  <li><strong>Reolink</strong> - home monitoring</li>
  <li><strong>SmartLife</strong> - anyone who has anything smart from China knows what this is for</li>
  <li><strong>Tapo</strong> - home cameras</li>
  <li><strong>Termius</strong> - here I’m also looking for some open-source alternative</li>
  <li><strong>Tether</strong> - managing TP-Link routers</li>
  <li><strong>TickTick</strong> - to-do lists, it’s hard for me to find a sensible alternative that is multiplatform and has all the features I need</li>
  <li><strong>TV Time</strong> - tracking what series and movies I’ve watched (I might actually be interested in finding an alternative here too)</li>
  <li><strong>Zepp</strong> - dedicated app for the Amazfit Balance smartwatch I use</li>
  <li><strong>ZeroTier</strong> - I used it instead of OpenVPN back when I didn’t have fiber optic yet, just radio internet</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="full-control-over-app-permissions">Full control over app permissions</h3>

<p>GrapheneOS allows for full control over what permissions each application can have. For example, in conventional Android forks, every application by default has granted <strong>Network</strong> (internet access) and <strong>Sensors</strong> (access to all sensors like the accelerometer) permissions.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever wondered <strong>if all apps on a phone need Internet access?</strong> Indeed, in the vast majority of cases, a mobile app without network access is useless, but you can’t generalize like that, because for example, the previously mentioned <strong>FUTO Voice Input</strong> uses a local LLM to convert speech to text, which works offline on the device. Why would such an app need Internet access then? For nothing, so <strong>it shouldn’t have such permission</strong>. Now let’s take apps like FairScan (document scanning), Catima (loyalty card aggregator), Collabora Office (office suite), or Librera (ebook reader). They too <strong>do not need Internet access!</strong></p>

<p>The situation looks even more bizarre when you look at which apps actually need access to all of our device’s sensors. If we think about it calmly, we’ll conclude that in this specific case it’s completely the opposite of the previous one, meaning <strong>practically no app needs this information</strong>. And I remind you that <strong>by default on Android with Google services, all apps have such permissions</strong>.</p>

<p>To manage a given application’s permissions, just <strong>tap and hold on its icon</strong>, select <strong>App info</strong> from the pop-up menu, and find the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab. A list categorized by things like - <strong>Allowed</strong>, <strong>Ask every time</strong>, and <strong>Not allowed</strong> will appear. I recommend reviewing this list for each app separately right after installing it. This is <strong>the foundation of GrapheneOS hardening</strong>.</p>

<p>A collective menu where you can view specific permissions and which apps have them granted is available in <strong>Settings -&gt; Security &amp; privacy -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Permission manager</strong>. Another interesting place is the <strong>Privacy dashboard</strong> available in the same location. It’s a tool that shows not only app permissions, but also how often a given app reaches for the permissions granted to it.</p>

<h3 id="private-space">Private space</h3>

<p>In GrapheneOS we don’t only have user profiles, but each user can also have something called a <strong>Private space</strong>. I encountered something similar on Samsung, where it was called <strong>Secure Folder</strong>, so I assume this might just be an Android feature implemented differently by each manufacturer.</p>

<p>Private space is turned on in <strong>Settings -&gt; Security &amp; privacy -&gt; Private space</strong>. It acts like a sort of separated sandbox that is part of the environment you use, but at the same time is isolated from it. For me, it’s a place that gives me quick access to apps that nevertheless require Google services. You might ask - why then do I keep the mBank and T-Mobile apps on the <strong>Owner</strong> user if I could keep them here? Well, for reasons unknown to me, I’m unable to configure my private space so that paying with contactless BLIK via NFC works correctly in it. The same goes for Magenta Moments from T-Mobile, which don’t work correctly despite GMS being installed in the private space.</p>

<h4 id="list-of-apps-in-my-private-space">List of apps in my private space</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Drive</strong> - I use it as a cloud to share files with clients</li>
  <li><strong>Finax</strong> - saving for retirement under PEPP</li>
  <li><strong>IKO</strong> - PKO BP bank app, treasury bonds plus PPK</li>
  <li><strong>InPost Mobile</strong> - parcel lockers, location doesn’t work for me in the private space either (the phone doesn’t send its position to the app), so I use QR codes like some Neanderthal</li>
  <li><strong>mBank</strong> - again, because while contactless payment doesn’t work for me here, other banking app functions work normally (including BLIK code payments, as well as confirming transactions with biometrics)</li>
  <li><strong>mObywatel</strong> - at first I kept this app in the main profile as downloaded from Aurora Store and everything somewhat worked, but every now and then the app caught a total freeze and stopped responding, I think it might be related to the fact that it does send some Google services-related requests in the background and doesn’t respond until such a request times out, I have this on my list to investigate</li>
  <li><strong>mojeIKP</strong> - lately I’ve been having more and more health problems, I’m clearly not as indestructible anymore, so such a geriatric app is simply essential for me</li>
  <li><strong>Mój T-Mobile</strong> - duplicated just like the mBank app, because everything works except Magenta Moments</li>
  <li><strong>Orlen Vitay</strong> - this app didn’t work for me without GMS, so sort of a D minus for Orlen, because the app from BP doesn’t have such a problem</li>
  <li><strong>Revolut</strong> - basically it probably doesn’t require GMS, but I decided I’ll just keep all financial apps in the private space</li>
  <li><strong>Santander</strong> - another banking app…</li>
  <li><strong>Play Store</strong> - I have to download all these apps from somewhere, doing it via Aurora Store in the private space wouldn’t make sense since I have the whole Google services package installed here anyway</li>
  <li><strong>XTB</strong> - another investing app… works without GMS, but like I said, I keep all financial ones in one place</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Oof… I did it again, sorry. I’m just counting the characters and it comes out to just under 35,000… I’ll probably break that barrier with these next few sentences. Well, long again, but purely meaty again, so I don’t think anyone has reason to complain. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve only touched upon the topic of GrapheneOS, which is extensive, and it’s a good thing, because it’s a <strong>great system</strong>, and the biggest <strong>respect goes to the people behind this project</strong>. It’s thanks to them that we even have the option of at least partially <strong>freeing ourselves from Google (Android) and Apple (iOS)</strong>. Therefore, I highly invite you to the final chapter of this post.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-the-grapheneos-project">Supporting the GrapheneOS project</h2>

<p>Finally, I would like to encourage you to <strong>support the GrapheneOS project</strong>. The developers behind it are doing a really great job and in my opinion deserve to have some money thrown at them. Information on where and how this can be done can be found <strong><a href="https://grapheneos.org/donate">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p><em>This post is an elaboration of a <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2021/05/29/objectives-and-constraints/">shorter post I wrote about five years ago</a>.</em></p>



<p>The two management giants of the mid-twentieth century were Peter Drucker and W. Edwards Deming. Ironically, while Drucker hails from Austria-Hungary (like me, Drucker emigrated to the U.S. as an adult) and Deming was born in the U.S., it was Drucker that proved to be more influential in America. Deming’s influence was much greater in Japan than it ever was the U.S. If you’ve ever been at an organization that uses OKRs, then you have worked in the shadow of Drucker’s legacy. While you can tell a story about how Deming influenced Toyota, and Toyota inspired the lean<em> </em>movement, I would still describe management in the U.S. as <em>Deming in exile</em>. Deming explicitly stated that management by objectives isn’t leadership, and I think you’d be hard-pressed to find managers in American companies who would agree with that sentiment.</p>

Not to scale.</figcaption></figure>



<p>An organization is a big, hairy, complex mess, and the bigger the organization is, the hairier and more complex it gets. Managers, on the other hand, have a very finite amount of bandwidth. There are only so many hours in a day, and this number does not increase with the complexity of an organization. And, let’s face it, they’re spending something close to 100% of that bandwidth attending meetings.</p>



<p>How is a manger to make sense of this mess?</p>



<h2>OKRs as a mess-reduction mechanism</h2>



<p>In the Druckerian approach of OKRs, you set a small number of <em>objectives</em>, and then you identify quantifiable <em>key results</em> for each objective that provide a signal about whether progress towards the objective is being made, and then you monitor the key results. Key results reduce the bandwidth required to make sense of what’s happening in the system. Instead of the blooming, buzzing confusion of the entire system, monitoring key results means you can filter out all of that unnecessary detail to focus specifically on the aspects that are relevant to the bandwidth-limited manager. It’s no coincidence that when John Doerr wrote a book on his experience with OKRs at Intel and how he brought them to Google, he titled his book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/measure-what-matters-how-google-bono-and-the-gates-foundation-rock-the-world-with-okrs-john-doerr/81baba4bd4bb8c25?ean=9780525536222&amp;next=t">Measure What Matters</a>.</p>

<p>The beauty of a set of key results is that they take the messiness of the system as input and create a neat summary in spreadsheet or slide format as output.</p>



<h2>Deming’s critique</h2>



<p>Deming’s approach to the problem of management was radically different from Drucker’s. In his book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/out-of-the-crisis-reissue-w-edwards-deming/6697a386cfa66ed3?ean=9780262535946&amp;next=t">Out of the Crisis</a>, Deming puts his criticism of the Drucker-ish approach in stark terms. He uses the term <em>deadly disease</em> to describe managing through numerical targets.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical goals. Substitute leadership.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Deming’s perspective can be summed up with the old saying: <em>if you don’t change the system, the system doesn’t change.</em>  He argued that if you wanted improvements, you had to make systemic changes. Furthermore, you had to understand the system if you wanted to come up with a system improvement that would actually work. </p>

<h2>Classical control versus statistical control </h2>



<p>Deming was not opposed to the idea of goals: indeed, he was a passionate believer that management should strive to improve quality and productivity, and both of those are goals. He was also not opposed to metrics: he was an advocate of applying Walter Shewhart’s statistical techniques for management. It’s the <em>use</em> of metrics that’s radically different in the two approaches.</p>



<p>The Drucker-ian approach is akin to a classical control system, like a thermostat. Specifying the key results are like setting the desired temperature (say, 68°F), and then the thermostat generates output in order to bring the current temperature of the room in line with the setpoint.</p>

<p>The idea here is that you give the organization a setpoint, and it will implement the control system that will work to achieve the setpoint.</p>



<p>Deming wrote in explicit terms about control, but he meant it in a different sense: we wrote about statistical process control, and statistical process control is about the <em>variability</em> of the output. I’ve written about statistical process control <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/11/27/fun-with-incident-data-and-statistical-process-control/">before</a>, but here I’ll touch on the concepts again, with an example. Let’s imagine we are observing the behavior of two brands of thermostats, A and B, each controlling the temperature of a different room.  Both thermostats have the same setpoint of 68°F. We observed their behavior by graphing the temperature of the two rooms over time. </p>

<p>Note how the points for thermostat A all fall within a narrow band, whereas for thermostat B there are many more outliers. We’d say that thermostat A is under statistical process control whether thermostat B is not, even though the average temperature for thermostat B is closer to the setpoint then the average temperature for thermostat A. (In practice, you’d draw a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart">control chart</a> to identify whether the system is under statistical control). </p>



<p>Deming argued that you had to understand whether your system was under statistical control in order to determine what intervention to do in order to make an improvement. For example, if your system was out of control, the next intervention would be to do a qualitative investigation into the outliers. On the other hand, if the system was under statistical control, then you’d have to figure out what systemic change to make to improve things.</p>



<p>Note how you <em>build</em> a classical control system, whereas you <em>observe</em> whether your system is under statistical process control. Statistical process control is about understanding the system. </p>



<h2>Drucker makes a manager’s life easier, Deming makes it harder</h2>

<p>One of the virtues of OKRs is that they are straightforward for managers to apply. You set direction by specifying objectives, and you enforce accountability by monitoring key results. Applying Deming’s approach, on the other hand, requires a much greater commitment of management bandwidth. Drucker offers a control mechanism with a bounded amount of information, where Deming requires a never-ending research program, with no upper bound on the kind of information that might be relevant. In fact, the information might even be unobservable. Deming approvingly quotes the statistician Lloyd Nelson, who said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The most important figures needed for management of any organization are unknown and unknowable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Myself, I’m in the Deming camp, but I can see why Drucker’s ideas won out. In reliability, we talk about “making the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard”, other people call this <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">The Pit of Success</a>. The rationale is that people will tend to do the easy thing over the hard thing. And managers are people too. But sometimes the right thing to do is the harder one, and nothing can be done about that. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had a theory for most of my adult life: hard days at work burn a lot of calories. The kind of days where you're deep in complex problems for eight hours straight, making decisions, debugging, writing. By evening, I'd feel utterly drained. Surely all that thinking was metabolically expensive. Surely it justified skipping the interval session I'd planned.</p>
<p>Then I looked at the numbers. And then I looked at what that cognitive exhaustion was actually doing to my workouts. The first part was humbling. The second part was alarming.</p>
<h2>Your brain is expensive, but thinking is cheap</h2>
<p>Your brain consumes roughly 20 to 25% of your body's total energy at rest. For an organ that accounts for about 2% of your body weight, that's extraordinarily costly. It runs almost exclusively on glucose, consuming about 120 grams per day, and it can't store meaningful reserves. It needs a constant supply delivered through the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Here's the part that surprised me: almost all of that energy goes to baseline maintenance. Keeping 86 billion neurons electrically charged. Maintaining synaptic connections. Running the background processes that keep you conscious and breathing and aware of your surroundings. The "idle cost" of having a brain is enormous.</p>
<p>The incremental cost of actually thinking hard? <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/thinking-hard-calories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Almost nothing</a>. Studies measuring brain glucose consumption during demanding cognitive tasks find increases of only about 5% above baseline. Over the course of a full day of intense mental work, that translates to maybe 100 to 200 extra calories. That's a banana and a half.</p>
<p>Even chess grandmasters, who sit for hours in states of intense concentration, burn only about <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-many-calories-chess-players-burn-2019-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.67 calories per minute</a> while playing, compared to 1.53 calories per minute at rest. A 10% premium for one of the most cognitively demanding activities humans engage in.</p>
<p>The reason is structural. Your brain's energy budget is dominated by housekeeping. Maintaining the electrochemical gradients across neuronal membranes, the resting activity of vast neural networks, the constant baseline hum of consciousness. Conscious thought, the stuff that feels effortful, is a thin layer of activity on top of this expensive foundation. It's like turning on a desk lamp in a building where the HVAC system already runs 24 hours a day. The lamp is real. It's just not where the bill comes from.</p>
<p>So no, your day of deep work didn't burn enough extra calories to justify the extra slice of pizza. I found this mildly deflating. But what I found next was far more consequential.</p>
<h2>The 15% problem</h2>
<p>In 2009, Samuele Marcora and colleagues at Bangor University published a <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.91324.2008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study in the Journal of Applied Physiology</a> that I think about every time I consider training after a long cognitive day.</p>
<p>They had 16 subjects complete two experimental conditions. In one, participants performed 90 minutes of a demanding cognitive task (the AX-CPT, a sustained attention test that requires continuous vigilance and response inhibition). In the other, they watched emotionally neutral documentaries for the same duration. Then both groups cycled to exhaustion at 80% of peak power output.</p>
<p>The mentally fatigued group quit 15% sooner. They lasted 640 seconds compared to 754 seconds for the control group.</p>
<p>Here's the part that makes this study remarkable: every physiological variable the researchers measured was identical between conditions. Heart rate, cardiac output, blood lactate, oxygen consumption, muscle glycogen use. None of it differed. The bodies of the mentally fatigued subjects were functioning normally. They had plenty of physical capacity left.</p>
<p>What differed was perceived exertion. The mentally fatigued group rated the same absolute workload as significantly harder. They reached their <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/internal-negotiation-heart-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psychological ceiling</a>, the point where continuing felt impossible, earlier. Not because their muscles had failed, but because their brains reported the effort as unbearable sooner.</p>
<p>The workout was the same. The body was the same. The brain's interpretation of it was different. And that difference cost them 15% of their endurance.</p>
<h2>This isn't one study</h2>
<p>When I first read Marcora's experiment, I wondered if it was a fluke. It wasn't.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28044281/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 systematic review in Sports Medicine</a> by Van Cutsem and colleagues analyzed 11 studies examining mental fatigue and physical performance. The finding was consistent across all of them: mental fatigue impaired endurance performance through elevated perceived exertion while leaving traditional physiological markers unchanged.</p>
<p>The effect showed up in cycling, running, and other endurance tasks. The impairment was specific to sustained effort, not maximal strength or short anaerobic bursts. And the mechanism was always the same: the body was fine, but the brain made everything feel harder than it actually was.</p>
<p>This is the same perceptual channel that <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/boredom-not-fatigue-ruins-workouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boredom operates through</a>, and the same one that the <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/internal-negotiation-heart-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal negotiation during hard intervals</a> runs on. Your brain's effort-monitoring system has limited bandwidth. When that system is already taxed from hours of cognitive work, it inflates the perceived cost of everything that follows.</p>
<h2>What's actually happening in your brain</h2>
<p>The leading explanation for why this happens involves a molecule you're already familiar with if you drink coffee: adenosine.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24504653/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pageaux and colleagues proposed in 2014</a> that prolonged cognitive activity increases adenosine accumulation in specific brain regions, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC sits at the intersection of effort perception, motor planning, and executive control. It's the region that integrates signals about how hard something feels and decides whether to keep going.</p>
<p>Adenosine is a byproduct of neuronal activity. When your brain works hard for extended periods, adenosine accumulates as neurons fire repeatedly and break down ATP (the cellular energy currency). Adenosine then binds to receptors that inhibit further neural firing, essentially acting as the brain's fatigue signal. It's the same molecule that builds up throughout the day and makes you sleepy by evening. It's also the molecule that <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/does-caffeine-improve-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caffeine blocks</a> by occupying the same receptors without activating them.</p>
<p>The hypothesis is elegant: hours of demanding cognitive work flood the ACC with adenosine. When you then ask your body to exercise, the ACC, already loaded with this inhibitory molecule, generates a louder effort signal than usual. The same physical workload now <em>feels</em> harder because the neural machinery responsible for assessing effort is running in a compromised state.</p>
<p>Supporting evidence comes from multiple directions. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29509641/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caffeine, an adenosine antagonist, counteracts the effect</a>, improving endurance by roughly 14% in mentally fatigued individuals. Sleep deprivation, which also increases brain adenosine, produces similar impairments in endurance through the same perceptual pathway. And tasks requiring response inhibition and sustained attention, which heavily recruit the ACC, produce the strongest mental fatigue effects on subsequent exercise.</p>
<h2>Why this matters for your VO₂ max</h2>
<p>Improving <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VO₂ max</a> requires training at specific intensities. The <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/how-to-improve-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4x4 interval protocol</a>, arguably the best-studied method for boosting cardiovascular fitness, demands four minutes at 90 to 95% of your maximum heart rate. That's the <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/heart-rate-zone-that-improves-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zone 4 territory</a> where real cardiovascular adaptation happens.</p>
<p>But hitting that zone requires tolerating significant discomfort. The <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/internal-negotiation-heart-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal negotiation</a> that kicks in during minute two or three of a hard interval is already a close call on a good day. If your brain's effort-assessment system is pre-loaded with adenosine from eight hours of demanding work, that negotiation tips against you earlier. You bail on the last interval. Or you never quite reach 90% because the perceived effort hits your ceiling at 85%.</p>
<p>Over weeks and months, this quietly degrades training quality. You're doing the sessions, logging the time, showing up consistently. But you're systematically underperforming during the efforts that actually <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/why-your-vo2-max-not-improving" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drive adaptation</a>. The trend line on your <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/find-vo2-max-on-apple-watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Watch</a> stays flat, and you can't figure out why.</p>
<p>I experienced this pattern without understanding it. My Tuesday evening interval sessions, scheduled after long workdays, consistently felt worse than my Saturday morning sessions. I blamed sleep, stress, hydration. Those all matter, but the research suggests the cognitive load itself was a primary culprit.</p>
<h2>What you can do about it</h2>
<p>This isn't a problem you can willpower your way through. The adenosine is physically present in your brain. Telling yourself to try harder doesn't clear it. But there are structural adjustments that help.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule hard sessions strategically.</strong> If you follow the <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/how-to-improve-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80/20 polarized model</a>, you only have one or two high-intensity sessions per week. Those are the ones that drive VO₂ max improvement. Try to place them on days with lower cognitive demand, or earlier in the day before the accumulated mental load peaks. A morning interval session before work is neurochemically different from an evening session after eight hours of complex problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>Use caffeine intentionally.</strong> Since caffeine directly blocks adenosine receptors, it can partially counteract the mental fatigue effect. A dose of 3 to 6 mg per kilogram of body weight, taken <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/does-caffeine-improve-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">45 to 60 minutes before training</a>, is well-supported by research. But this works best if you don't already rely on caffeine throughout the day, since chronic use leads to receptor upregulation that blunts the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Protect your easy days.</strong> <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/heart-rate-zone-that-improves-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zone 2 sessions</a> are more forgiving of mental fatigue because they operate at intensities where perceived exertion stays low. If you've had a brutal day at work, an easy run still provides aerobic benefit without requiring the high effort tolerance that mental fatigue compromises. Save the intervals for a fresher day. This is also where <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/boredom-not-fatigue-ruins-workouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">music or podcasts</a> pay dividends, since the attentional demands of Zone 2 are low enough for external stimulation to keep you engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Consider a brief cognitive reset.</strong> There's some evidence that even 20 to 30 minutes of low-demand activity between cognitive work and exercise can help. A walk outside, a stretch, something that doesn't require sustained attention. It won't fully clear the adenosine, but it may provide enough neural recovery to shift the perceived exertion curve back toward something manageable.</p>
<h2>The deeper insight</h2>
<p>What fascinates me about this research is what it reveals about the relationship between mental and physical performance. We tend to treat them as separate systems. Your brain does the thinking, your body does the moving. But the evidence shows they share a common metabolic currency. The adenosine that accumulates from cognitive work doesn't stay in some isolated cognitive compartment. It infiltrates the neural circuits that govern physical effort perception.</p>
<p>Your post-work exhaustion isn't imaginary. It's just not caloric. The brain spent almost no extra energy thinking all day, but it produced real metabolic byproducts that change how hard everything else feels. The tiredness is neurochemical, not energetic.</p>
<p>Understanding this reframed how I think about <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/recovery-affects-vo2-max-more-than-effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recovery</a>. Recovery isn't just about muscles and sleep. It's about the state of your brain when you begin a session. A well-rested nervous system with low adenosine load will perceive the same workout as easier, sustain higher intensities longer, and extract more <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/how-long-it-takes-to-improve-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cardiovascular adaptation</a> from the same training plan.</p>
<p>The calories your brain burns barely register. The residue it leaves behind can cost you the workout that matters most.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Over the weekend Ars Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">retracted an article</a> because the AI a writer used <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjedwards.com/post/3mewgow6ch22p">hallucinated quotes</a> from an open source library maintainer.</p><p>The irony here is the maintainer in question, Scott Shambaugh, was <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">harassed by someone's AI agent</a> over not merging it's AI slop code.</p><p>It's likely the bot was running through someone's local 'agentic AI' instance (likely using OpenClaw). The guy who built OpenClaw was just hired by OpenAI to "work on bringing agents to everyone." You'll have to forgive me if I'm not enthusastic about that.</p><h2 id="video">Video</h2><p>This blog post is a lightly-edited transcript of the video I published to YouTube today. Scroll past the video embed if you're like me, and you'd rather read the text :)</p><div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZJ7A1QoUEI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><h2 id="impacts-on-open-source">Impacts on Open Source</h2><p>Last month, even before OpenClaw's release, curl maintainer Daniel Stenberg <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2026/01/26/the-end-of-the-curl-bug-bounty/">dropped bug bounties</a> because AI slop resulted in actual <em>useful</em> vulnerability reports going from 15% of all submissions down to 5%.</p><p>And that's not the worst of it—the authors of these bug reports seem to have a more entitled attitude:</p><blockquote><p>These "helpers" try too hard to twist whatever they find into something horribly bad and a critical vulnerability, but they rarely actively contribute to actually improve curl. They can go to extreme efforts to argue and insist on their specific current finding, but not to write a fix or work with the team on improving curl long-term etc. I don't think we need more of that.</p></blockquote><p>These agentic AI users don't care about curl. They don't care about Daniel or other open source maintainers. They just want to grab quick cash bounties using their private AI army.</p><p>I manage <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy">over 300 open source projects</a>, and while many are more niche than curl or matplotlib, I've seen my own increase in AI slop PRs.</p><p>It's gotten <em>so</em> bad, GitHub added a feature to <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-new-repository-settings-for-configuring-pull-request-access/">disable Pull Requests entirely</a>. Pull Requests are the fundamental thing that made GitHub popular. And now we'll see that feature closed off in more and more repos.</p><p>AI slop generation is getting easier, but it's not getting smarter. From what I've seen, models have <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2025/9/an-ai-plateau">hit a plateau</a> where code generation is <em>pretty good</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>...</p><p>But it's not improving like it did the past few years. The problem is the humans who <em>review</em> the code—who are responsible for the useful software that keeps our systems going—don't have infinite resources (unlike AI companies).</p><p>Some people suggest AI could take over code review too, but that's not the answer.</p><p>If you're running a personal weather dashboard or building a toy server for your Homelab, fine. But I wouldn't run my production apps—that actually make money or could cause harm if they break—on unreviewed AI code.</p><p>If this was a problem already, OpenClaw's release, and this hiring by OpenAI to democratize agentic AI further, will only make it worse. Right now the AI craze feels the same as the <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/what-happened-to-nfts-094039263.html">crypto and NFT boom</a>, with the same signs of insane behavior and reckless optimism.</p><p>The difference is there's more useful purposes for LLMs and machine learning, so scammers can point to those uses as they bring down everything good in the name of their AI god.</p><p>Since my video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rbz0akyLyQ">The RAM Shortage Comes for Us All</a> in December, we have <em>hard drives</em> as the next looming AI-related shortage, as <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/western-digital-is-already-sold-out-of-hard-drives-for-all-of-2026-chief-says-some-long-term-agreements-for-2027-and-2028-already-in-place">Western Digital just announced</a> they're already sold through their inventory for 2026.</p><p>Some believe the AI bubble isn't a bubble, but those people are misguided, just like the AI that hallucinated the quotes in that Ars Technica article.</p><p>And they say <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=375826">"this time it's different"</a>, but it's not. The same signs are there from other crashes. The big question I have is, how many other things will AI companies destroy before they have to pay their dues.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<p>During the rapid technological advancements of the early 1990s, the video game industry was on the cusp of a massive addition - <span>another dimension</span>. With console shenanigans like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_FX">Super FX chip</a> giving players a taste of 3D, hype was at an all-time high.  But the games released for home consoles were nothing compared to what arcade developers were capable of doing. By employing gigantic budgets and cutting-edge hardware, the arcade gave players a chance to see the future, today.</p>



<p>But the future eventually arrived with the launch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">5th generation of consoles</a>.  All of a sudden, the revolutionary 3D hardware features that were once exclusive to arcades were now available in home consoles.  Without next-generation hype pushing players into the arcade, powerful but expensive arcade machines were no longer sustainable to develop.  The industry adjusted by moving toward more cost effective solutions, with many turning to the inexpensive, already proven 3D-capable hardware available in 5th gen home consoles.</p>
<p>Rather than turning around the decline of the arcade, the cheaper hardware may have helped accelerate it.  There were fewer unique experiences to pull players into the arcade, and previous hit exclusives were now seeing high quality home console ports that allowed them to be enjoyed without munching quarters.  When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">6th generation</a> arrived with the Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2, many arcade stalwarts waved the white flag and started to shift their arcade divisions to home console projects, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_May_Cry_2">with mixed success</a>.</p>
<p>Sega was among those hit hardest by this era.  They produced some of the greatest arcade thrills of the 1990s and enjoyed massive success in the home console market with the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.  But a string of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32X">mistakes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn">miscalculations</a> combined with the slumping arcade industry sent them to the brink of bankruptcy.  By 2002, the Dreamcast had been soundly defeated by the launch of the PlayStation 2, and Sega began <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Sonic_Adventure_2:_Battle">porting</a> some of their <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Skies_of_Arcadia_Legends">hits</a> to their former rivals' hardware just to stay afloat.</p>
<p>The home market was lost, but the languishing arcade scene presented Sega with an opportunity.  They still had legendary arcade development teams, and if Sega could leverage them to produce a wave of arcade hits, they would be in a position to dominate a new era of arcades when most others were changing gears.  There was just one problem: Sega didn't have the resources that they once did.  If they were going to do this, they needed some help.</p>
<p>And so they did something that would have been considered unthinkable just five years prior.  Sega teamed up with Nintendo to develop a <em>GameCube-based arcade platform</em>.  Bolstering their ranks was Namco, another coin-op stalwart with tons of arcade veterans.</p>
<p>Three companies, one mission: Triforce.</p>

<h3 id="triforce-hardware"><strong>Triforce Hardware</strong><a href="#triforce-hardware" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While Triforce was a collaboration project, it still feels like a very <em>Sega coded</em> arcade system.  It can even use certain <a href="https://segaretro.org/Sega_NAOMI">NAOMI</a> style components!  Along with the Xbox-based <a href="https://segaretro.org/Sega_Chihiro">Chihiro</a>, the Triforce is sometimes considered a successor to the <a href="https://segaretro.org/Sega_NAOMI_2">NAOMI 2</a>.</p>




<p><br>
Inside of this metal shell is... a GameCube!  Quite literally, actually.</p>



<p>The Triforce hardware is built around a stock GameCube motherboard, with two Triforce-specific boards attached to it: the AM-Baseboard and AM-Mediaboard. The <em>AM</em> (Amusement Machine) boards are the secret sauce of the Triforce and transform the stock GameCube into something capable of producing arcade experiences.</p>
<p>The early boot process is the same as a retail console, but a modified GameCube IPL (sometimes referred to as the GameCube BIOS) is used to initialize the Triforce hardware and load the Triforce equivalent of a "home menu", Segaboot.</p>


<p>Segaboot is a special disc image on the Mediaboard that can be loaded by the Triforce at will through special commands. It is responsible for loading the actual game and for providing the Service Menu,  where the operator can run hardware tests and change settings on the machine.</p>
<p>By using <a href="https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot">Picoboot</a> to override the boot process, it is possible to load a standard GameCube IPL or homebrew like <a href="https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc">Swiss</a>.  And since all of the pins are still on the mainboard, we can also connect a standard GameCube front panel and even load full GameCube games from microSD over Serial Port 2!</p>


<p>The Baseboard is primarily responsible for input and output.  It handles translation between JVS I/O devices (more on those later) and the GameCube's <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Hardware/Serial_Interface">SI bus</a>. It also takes the GameCube's digital video output and feeds it to two VGA ports on the back of the main unit.</p>


<p>The Mediaboard's most important responsibility is storing and serving the game software to the GameCube.  It is also used to handle other tasks, such as networking, through special commands.</p>


<p>The Triforce Baseboard was mostly unchanged throughout the Triforce's lifespan, but the Mediaboard could vary depending on the developer, game, and when the game was released.  In fact, games weren't guaranteed to even come out on the same storage medium!</p>
<h4 id="format-wars"><strong>Format Wars</strong><a href="#format-wars" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>A spinning disc and active laser were not <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Lair_(1983_video_game)">normally</a></em> considered reliable enough for an arcade environment.  These machines will be on all day, every day for <em>years</em>, and players were often rough on machines that they didn't own. So, the Triforce eschews the standard GameCube mini-DVD alike format for its own storage solutions. </p>
<p>Most games were designed for the DIMM (Dual In-line Memory Module) variant of the Triforce, where game data is shipped on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GD-ROM">GD-ROM</a> and loaded into RAM on the first boot.  GD (Gigabyte Disc) was a format initially devised by Sega and Yamaha for use in the Dreamcast. By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-density_compact_disc">increasing the data density</a> of ordinary compact disc technology, the 12cm GD-ROM had somewhat comparable capacity to the GameCube's DVD-based 8cm disc (1GiB versus 1.46GiB).</p>
<p>Were GD-ROM drives more reliable than early DVD drives?  Maybe!  By this point, GD-ROM was an established technology that Sega was already using in arcades for years.  Perhaps even more importantly, it was <em>cheaper</em>.  Sega designed it so they could even reuse GD-ROM drives designed for their other arcade platforms, since they used a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_SCSI">SCSI</a>-style connector.  </p>


<p>DIMM variant Triforces came with stickers advertising the amount of DIMM RAM on the Mediaboard. These stickers caused some confusion in the enthusiast community, as people would often mistake the amount listed as the total RAM accessible to the game. In reality, the DIMM RAM was mostly intended for use as a read-only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_drive">RAM drive</a>, rather than for general purpose use. As previously mentioned, the Triforce hardware is based around a stock GameCube motherboard, so games can only access the same 24+16 MiB of RAM that a retail GameCube uses. </p>


<p>Once the game was loaded into memory, it was intended to stay there. And thanks to a battery backup that maintained the data even in the event of a power failure, the GD-ROM may only be needed once in the entire lifetime of the machine. <em>This</em> was their secret toward making the Triforce GD-ROM drive reliable for the arcade.  One of the main exceptions would be if a new disc were inserted.  Many Triforce games saw updates, which could be shipped on new GD-ROMs. </p>
<p>Namco's Triforce games ditched the GD-ROM and DIMM RAM and instead used 512MB NAND cartridges to store game data. The NAND retains its contents even if the system loses power and the backup battery runs dry, which eliminates the need for GD-ROMs.  These games also saw updates through SD card or over the internet, with updates able to directly modify the NAND contents.</p>




<p>Both methods of storing Triforce game data have the same goal in the end: deliver a disc image to the internal GameCube. In addition to the GD-ROM or NAND cartridge, each game also has a corresponding security key that must be inserted into the Triforce unit in order for the game to run.</p>
<h4 id="type-1-type-3-and-saving-in-arcades"><strong>Type 1, Type 3, and Saving in Arcades</strong><a href="#type-1-type-3-and-saving-in-arcades" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>There are two variants of Triforce I/O: Type 1 and Type 3.  These refer to the Sega JVS Type 1 and Sega JVS Type 3.  JVS stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Amusement_Machine_and_Marketing_Association#Video">JAMMA Video Standard</a>, a common standard created by a group of Japanese game companies for connecting various accessories and controllers to arcade systems.  It's easiest to think of JVS I/O as the arcade equivalent to USB.  Other Sega JVS I/O compatible devices can work with the Triforce even if they were originally designed for other arcade platforms, but it's up to the game developers to actually add support for a particular piece of hardware.  Type 3 Triforces also have the capability to support more complicated analog input devices.</p>
<p>Whether it was Type 1 or Type 3, Sega had a trick that was instrumental to their efforts to revive the arcade scene and almost <em>every</em> Triforce game would use it.  It was a revolutionary idea that had taken hold in the home console market but was still rare to see in arcades: saving and continuing.</p>
<p>By using cheap cards that could hold a small amount of data, players could buy what amounted to a small memory card directly from the arcade machine using a built-in vendor.  These cards could be bought for as cheap as a single credit in some cases, and had enough storage to save progress, preferences, and other unlocks.  Because the data wasn't locked to the machine, these cards allowed the player to continue their progress from any arcade that had the game and a working card slot.</p>
<p>The end goal of this was to get players more invested in arcade experiences by having them progress and unlock content.  Some Triforce games are full of so many unlockables that it'd be impossible to see everything in a single session at the arcade.</p>


<p>Triforce games can support two types of cards for saving: Magnetic Cards (magcards) and Integrated Circuit (IC) cards.  Magcards are cheaper, fragile, and can only survive so many writes before failing.  They have the added bonus of having a printable side, where the game can print a player's achievements and more.  IC cards are more like old credit cards with a thicker plastic.  They weren't printable, but were much sturdier.</p>
<p>A limit of 50 writes was imposed on magcards, likely to recoup printing costs <em>and</em> because the cards would eventually wear out.  This meant that after 50 writes, the player would have to spend more money on a new card in order to continue saving their data.  If an arcade was feeling generous, the operator could choose to make buying and/or refreshing cards free.</p>


<p>Regardless of the card type, if the card were somehow destroyed outside of the machine for any reason, the save data would be lost and the player would have to start over with a fresh card.</p>
<p>Outside of the various cards and their readers, there were plenty of other fairly generic JVS I/O devices, such as coin mechanisms, arcade sticks, buttons, steering wheels, and pedals.  Because there were so few Triforce games released, we'll take a look at unique JVS I/O devices on a game-by-game basis when we start spotlighting the games.</p>
<h4 id="bringing-the-triforce-home"><strong>Bringing the Triforce Home</strong><a href="#bringing-the-triforce-home" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Hypothetically, let's say you have a vested interest in GameCube hardware and decided to purchase a Triforce arcade unit with a game to see how it works first-hand and write an article about it.  Without a cabinet and all of the additional hardware that is required to run a game, the core Triforce is just a fancy paperweight, right?  Actually, no!  </p>
<p>Using a Raspberry Pi, we can convert USB controllers into JVS devices that the games will recognize thanks to JVS I/O emulation!  JVS I/O uses a USB-A style connector, but arranges the pins differently.  Compared to USB, JVS I/O's differential serial signal is closer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485">RS485</a> standard (aka the last <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a> standard).  It's not <em>exactly the same</em>, but by using a RS485 adapter connected to through USB-A with D- and D+ hooked up as the differential pair and VBUS hooked to the sense line, USB devices can communicate with JVS I/O.  Combine that with <a href="https://github.com/OpenJVS/OpenJVS">OpenJVS</a>, and you can have a computer interface with a Triforce to emulate JVS I/O devices.</p>
<p>In our hypothetical, we suggested that we only purchased one Triforce.  In reality, we ended up with <em>four</em> over the past few years: A Type 1 DIMM, a Type 3 DIMM, and two Type 3 NANDs.  We also bought a few JVS I/O devices that popped up, including a Virtua Striker 4 Card Reader and a Chihiro/Triforce/NAOMI 2 compatible magcard reader/printer/distributor.  However, our real JVS I/O devices ended up being pretty useless due to the fact we were still missing too much hardware to hook them up.  JVS I/O emulation was mandatory, and was used to fake enough of the devices to get the games into a working state. To replace the Triforce's JVS power supply, we used an ATX power supply with the 20+4 pin power connector carefully modified to match its pinout.  Do not attempt this at home!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/OpenJVS/OpenJVS">OpenJVS</a> does a well enough job faking devices that most Triforce games can be made to run under it.  More importantly, it also let us map the various input devices attached to the games to a DS4 controller.  As a bonus, we used some of the extra buttons on the controller to map actions like inserting coins to make general play easier. </p>
<p>All of this tinkering was <em>just enough</em> to let us control and play real Triforce games on real hardware.</p>


<p>Now that we could play Triforce games, we had to give it a spin.</p>

<h3 id="the-triforce-games"><strong>The Triforce Games</strong><a href="#the-triforce-games" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given that Nintendo hardware powers the Triforce, one might expect it to have some <em>Nintendo-developed games</em>.  But there aren't any.  Despite Nintendo's pedigree for creating appealing and accessible games, they had no interest in making arcade games for the Triforce.  Hits like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Donkey_Kong">Donkey Kong</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Bros.">Mario Bros</a> were eons ago and the market had drastically changed since then.  Instead, Nintendo opted to license out their IPs to the more experienced arcade developers at Sega and Namco.</p>
<p>This partnership resulted in a golden opportunity for the two companies. Their experienced arcade developers had access to some extremely popular IPs, and the GameCube base meant they had a powerful core machine that was also affordable.  In the end, though, the Triforce only had <strong>nine</strong> games released for it and several of those saw home ports.</p>
<p>With so few titles released for the system, it affords us the rare opportunity go through each and every one.  The games range from fairly typical arcade titles to high budget monstrosities that would be the crown jewel of any arcade.  We'll be looking at obscure games, legendary games, and everything in between while doing our best to see how they took advantage of the Triforce hardware.  Let's begin.</p>

<p>Did you know that the Triforce has not one, but <em>two</em> Mario Kart games?  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> (2005) and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> (2007) are often forgotten when people talk about the phenomenal Mario Kart series due to their limited release, especially internationally.  Both games are built off the <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart:_Double_Dash%E2%80%BC">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a> engine, but have more of a focus on arcade simplicity and play closer to the style of the original <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Mario_Kart">Super Mario Kart</a>.</p>
<p>Those that have played a Mario Kart game know what to expect at the surface level.  This is an arcade kart racer with tons of wacky items, popular characters, and colorful tracks to race on.  This time around, some popular characters from Namco properties join Mario Kart veterans, such as Pac-Man!</p>


<p>The first game launched with twelve race tracks spread across six cups.  Each cup has four stages that use two of the tracks.  The second time you race a track in the cup, it will be remixed slightly.  Sometimes this just means some different visuals or items, but other times it might have some slight alterations to make driving the track more difficult.</p>


<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> has all of the tracks from the first game and four brand new ones spread out between two new cups.  If this was a home console game, the amount of reused content would have been very disappointing.  In the arcade setting, it's not nearly as big of a deal.  Most players wouldn't have had a lot of experience on every course, and many might not have played the first game at all!  That being said, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> still feels more like an improved <em>version 2.0</em> rather than a full fledged sequel.</p>
<p>On that note, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> has some very puzzling omissions that were fixed by the sequel.  For instance?  Only <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> has the iconic 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc difficulty options available from the start!  Both games have the same three gameplay modes: Grand Prix, Time Trial, and Versus.  Grand Prix has players racing through cups one round at a time.  By winning a race in a cup, you unlock the next race.  Time Trial should be familiar to anyone.  Players are given a triple mushroom and a solo run on a course to set the best time possible.  Versus mode can only happen in multicabinet setups when multiple players are around.  In this mode, up to four players can race one another on any track.</p>
<p>Regardless of mode, races have a time limit to keep people moving, but they are relaxed enough that they usually won't come into play.</p>
<p>In order to record progress, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> rely on magcards.  When the game starts, it'll ask the player to insert or create a license profile to save their progress.  On some cabinets, a camera (known as the "namcam2") will be present to take a picture that will be used during the race.  Players' faces will show up in the heads-up display and with various <em>distraction items</em>, so making a goofy face could be an advantage in multiplayer.  Note that these features are optional, and a player can always choose to play without taking a picture or using a magcard.</p>


<p>There is one rather egregious oversight that is only present in the first game.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> <strong>locks a player to a single character once they've created a license card</strong>.  That means before the player even gets a chance to play the game, they have to choose a character and are forced to use that character unless they start over!  Characters have different driving characteristics, so this is a rather important decision!</p>
<p>Regardless, the developers must have realized how awkward this was and changed it so that swapping characters is possible in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> even when using a magcard.</p>
<p>Whether the driving model for a Mario Kart game is good or not mostly comes down to player preference.  Some players love Mario Kart DS, others swear by <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a>, or even <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart:_Double_Dash%E2%80%BC">Double Dash</a>.  The GP games are definitely on the slippery side of the series, especially when using the "difficult" characters at higher CCs.</p>
<p>Controls are simple even compared to the already casual home Mario Kart games.   The game uses a racing wheel, gas and brake pedals, and an item button.  Additionally, there's a <em>Versus Cancel</em> to opt out of multiplayer to focus on winning the cups.  Despite this, it takes some time to get acclimated to the arcade exclusives after coming from modern Mario Kart games.  The harder courses pull no punches and will relentlessly throw tight corners.  The Grand Prix mode even has hindrances added to certain tracks on their reruns.  On Bowser's Castle, Kamek invades and blocks some of the racing lines on the later laps!</p>


<p>To win on harder difficulties, the player needs every advantage they can get.  Items can be the advantage that players need.  Both games feature <strong>over 100 items</strong>, but during a race, each player has access to a pool of three items.  In harder Grand Prix cups (and sometimes later stages in earlier ones), players get the option to create their own unique item pool from their unlocked items.  Even though a lot of them share properties, a surprising number of them have their own wrinkles.  For example, dropping a banana can cause a spinout and immediate time loss, but dropping tacks will cause a kart to pop a tire and lean to one side, making overall driving temporarily more difficult for that player. Items aren't very balanced so unlocking powerful items gives an undeniable edge.</p>
<p>Throwing items are simple.  Aside from the green shell, almost all forward throwing items feature a powerful lock-on effect.  Lock-on is automatic and happens after keeping another driver in front for a couple of seconds.  Once locked on, that item will head toward the target regardless of what they do to avoid it.</p>


<p>In the first game, players must win all four stages of a cup and the minigame that follows. These minigames are short solo challenges that test a player's control over the game in unusual situations.  Sometimes this means pushing an object, getting big air over jumps, driving backwards, hitting tons of pedestrians (they're Koopa Troopas, that makes it OK), or even facing off with Bowser outside of his castle.  In the sequel, the bonus games are no longer required for cup completion and only award bonus coins.</p>


<p>By winning all of the cups, players unlock a <em>Special</em> mode that varies per game.  In GP 1, that is 150cc mode.   <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> has 150cc mode unlocked by default, so they went a different direction.  Instead, players unlock new track layouts in <em>reverse mode</em>.  Unlike the <em>mirror mode</em> present in other games, reverse mode significantly changes some of the tracks beyond just ruining muscle memory.  Fun fact, reverse mode <em>was</em> also planned for <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart:_Double_Dash%E2%80%BC">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a> before being cut for mirror mode.</p>
<p>To handle the plethora of tricky corners and tracks, GP games have a drifting mechanic.  By tapping the brake, players can initiate a hop.  By turning in the air before landing, players can initiate a drift that allows sharp corners to be taken at higher speeds.  Because of the powerful lock-on that most items have, drifting has been given an additional benefit.  During a drift, players will <em>reflect</em> most items with a shield.  An unexpected drift will cost some time, but could be used to block an item at the last moment.  Some items also provide a shield, such as the <em>Invincibility Star</em> and <em>Shield</em> items.</p>
<p>Much like the original <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Mario_Kart">Super Mario Kart</a> and more recent Mario Kart entries, the GP games have coins strewn across the track.  Collecting coins increases a kart's stop speed, adding a layer of strategy as just driving the optimal lines isn't enough. During a race, holding 15 coins pushes a kart to its maximum speed.  But driving at that speed can also be dangerous, as hitting walls, bouncing off other karts, or being hit by items can cause the player to lose coins.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> changes all of the coins on the track to <em>Mario Coins</em>.  The first time these coins are collected they count as currency toward unlocks.  If coins are dropped, players don't lose the Mario Coins and they will respawn as golden coins.  Up to 25 Mario Coins can be picked up on the track along with bonuses from race ranking and minigames.</p>
<p>Collecting Mario Coins allows for unlocking certain karts, items, portraits, and <em>kart upgrades</em> that will make the veteran players much faster than players just starting out.</p>


<p>Lastly,  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> also adds one more major feature: <s>Waluigi!</s>  a "live" announcer that gives updates throughout the race.  This feature is proudly demonstrated during the attract menu, even!  As corny as it sounds, it's rather entertaining to leave on at least a few times.  Players that don't want the announcer can turn it off and their preference will be saved to their magcard.</p>
<p>Overall, both of these games are best as multiplayer arcade spectacles. The depth and content of these games don't quite rival contemporary home releases like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a>. But none of that matters in the arcade with friends, where loud and bombastic multiplayer experiences really shine.</p>
<p>The Mario Kart Arcade GP series would continue with <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_DX">Mario Kart Arcade GP DX</a> in 2013 and <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_VR">Mario Kart Arcade GP VR</a> in 2017, but those would run on newer and more standard PC-based arcade hardware.</p>
<p>These Mario Kart titles were the only two games Namco released on the Triforce hardware.  But they had planned <em>at least</em> one other game.</p>
<h4 id="star-fox-working-title-unreleased-by-namco"><strong>Star Fox</strong> (working title, unreleased) by Namco<a href="#star-fox-working-title-unreleased-by-namco" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Announced in 2002 as a dual GameCube and arcade release, Star Fox was originally planned to launch before either of the Mario Kart Arcade GP games in 2003.  As part of a push for games that could easily be ported between GameCube and arcade, Star Fox would have had connectivity between the two versions through <em>GameCube memory card slots</em> included on the machines.  That way, players could bring their own memory cards to transfer progress and/or unlockables between the home version and the arcade version of the game.</p>


<p>Considering the arcade style action featured in Star Fox and Star Fox 64, this seemed like a natural choice for an arcade hit.  Players were already chasing high scores in Star Fox 64 and the overall game design would need little modification to work in an arcade.  If rumors were true, Namco wasn't planning to skimp on the hardware, either.  They were going to use the massively impressive and incredibly expensive <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-greatest-arcade-cabinet-that-never-was-5849339">O.R.B.S. cabinet</a>, which was designed specifically for on-rail shooters.  Essentially, the player would be locked in a fully immersive orb that would place them squarely in the cockpit of an Arwing with a semi-spherical screen acting as a bubble canopy.  On top of that, the cabinet could rotate and slide to reflect what was going on in-game.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, Star Fox Arcade <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Star_Fox_Arcade_(lost_build_of_cancelled_arcade_port_of_GameCube_rail-shooter_%22Star_Fox:_Assault%22;_2002)">was quietly cancelled</a> and the O.R.B.S. cabinet itself would never actually be used for any arcade game.  The GameCube version did <em>eventually</em> see the light of day, however.  Released as <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Star_Fox:_Assault">Star Fox Assault</a> in <strong>2005</strong>, the game was heavily reworked and padded out with third person on foot sections.  Perhaps as a nod to its origins, players can unlock a port of the arcade classic <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Xevious_(Arcade)">Xevious</a> by collecting all silver medals.</p>
<p>With that side quest complete, we've now covered the entirety of Namco's contributions to the Triforce library.  Thankfully, we're not done yet, as Sega developed a variety of Triforce arcade games.</p>

<h4 id="gekitou-pro-yakyuu-by-wow-entertainment"><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a></strong> by <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:WOW_Entertainment_(Developer)">WOW Entertainment</a><a href="#gekitou-pro-yakyuu-by-wow-entertainment" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a> is a rather unique baseball game that combines characters from various baseball manga created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinji_Mizushima">Shinji Mizushima</a> with real-life Japanese professional baseball players of the era.  The game also has a faithful home console port, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(GC)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a>, for the GameCube and PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>The main draw of this baseball game is that it can provide a faithful simulation style game between professional players or a zany arcade experience with special pitches, strong batters, and manga cutaways featuring the illustrated characters.  What makes the game so interesting is that these two things aren't separated - both teams can be filled with a mix of illustrated and professional players, letting their contrasting styles clash right on the field.</p>


<p>At its core, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a> is a fairly standard late early 2000s baseball game.  Pitchers can roughly place their pitches anywhere in and around the strike zone and batters in turn try to guess where the pitch will be to get a solid hit.  Pitchers have a variety of pitches at their disposal that add movement to the ball, and batters in turn have multiple swing types that can counter pitches.  Players with better stats generally have more options at their disposal.  If the batter guesses the pitch right, their aiming reticle will turn red giving them advanced warning that they guessed correctly.</p>
<p>When playing in the arcade, both teams are filled with a mix of real players and manga players.  This creates the interesting scenario where many manga players often feel like <em>superstars</em> that can break the game if not carefully played around.  Most of them have special quirks and often have access to special abilities.  Manga pitchers can make the ball disappear, zig zag, and confound the batter.  Manga batters can also counter this as they have active and passive abilities of their own.  One player has his contact range and power grow further out from the center of the strike zone, making him incredibly powerful if the pitcher is painting the corners.</p>


<p>For those interested in playing this game without a Triforce, there's good news.  The home console port is incredibly faithful and even adds some additional modes and features for depth.  The GameCube controller also affords players analog control, whereas the arcade original uses an eight-way gate.  Once you get in game, though, it's very apparent that this is the same game.</p>


<p>The home port, as far as we could tell, is missing <em>one small thing</em>.  The Triforce version has a scoring system for putting up high scores on the machine.  Rather than just trying to win baseball games, players are instead challenged to get a high score across a nine-inning game.  Doing positive things like getting hits and getting the opponent out will give the player points.  Big moments like double plays and grand slams will give even bigger bonuses, pushing players to the top of the leaderboards.</p>
<p>Players get two innings per credit or can pay 4 credits for a full nine-inning game.  Players aiming for a high score <em>need</em> to do that, as those extra innings give more opportunities for scoring points, and there's a large swath of bonus points for winning the baseball game outright.  After nine-innings, win or lose, the game ends.  The game also lists high scores for a home run contest, but we couldn't figure out how to get to that mode.</p>


<p>This game suggests that it has some kind of save card support in the Service Menu, but we weren't able to find any cards for it to be sure.  In all likelihood, cards would have been used to save team data and other preferences for a player.  Overall, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a> is an effective, if not somewhat simple baseball game that lends itself well to the pick up and play nature of the arcade.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="virtua-striker-3-ver-2002-by-amusement-vision"><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a></strong> by <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Amusement_Vision_(Developer)">Amusement Vision</a><a href="#virtua-striker-3-ver-2002-by-amusement-vision" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>While it was developed by a different team within Sega, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a> is very similar to <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekito Pro Yakyuu</a> in some ways.  It is a simple to pick up and easy to play sports game with an incredibly faithful home port that brings the same experience to console players with modes that add extra depth.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a> is a three-button game:  short pass (tackle on defense), long pass, and shoot.  That's it.</p>


<p>The <em><a href="https://youtu.be/Rfg9FFytpPM?t=3978">gooooooal</a></em> of the game is to win five matches in a row against the AI to secure the championship while surviving potential intruders jumping in from the second player in standard mode.  This is a <em>king of the hill</em> style arcade game, so whoever wins gets to keep playing while the loser is knocked out.  This remains true when playing against AI, so a strong player can play up to five games against the AI before reaching the credits and having to put in more money.</p>
<p>The game follows the rules of <s>football</s> soccer closely.  There are yellow cards, red cards, offsides, corner kicks, penalty kicks, free kicks and injury time.  As an arcade game, it even captures some of the pageantry of the sport with a bombastic opening as the players march onto the field.  However, once you're in game it is a very no frills experience.</p>
<p>The arcade operator could adjust the cabinet's settings to make things more or less unfair to optimize their profits.  In addition to difficulty settings, Golden Goal (short overtime period) and Penalty Kicks could be disabled to give the players less opportunities to break a tie.  And this matters a lot, because <em>the AI wins in the event of a tie</em>, forcing the player to plunk in more money to continue.</p>
<p>For competitive events and tournaments, there's an aptly named <em>tournament mode</em> present in the settings.  This mode has both players kicked off the game after match, regardless of who wins.  This mode wasn't (just) added to allow the operator to maximize profits, but rather it was intended for holding in-person tournaments where players would be swapping in and out after every match.</p>
<p>The simplicity to the controls is both the game's selling point and an annoyance.  When on defense in particular, sometimes the defender will rush to get into a particular position regardless of the direction being held on the arcade stick.  This lack of control is only worsened by the fact that there's no switch player button... on the arcade version, at least.  The home port is mostly faithful gameplay-wise, but it does take advantage of the extra buttons on the controller to give players the ability to change tactics and swap defenders.</p>


<p>One thing that we should mention is that we were playing on revision 0001 of <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a>.  Most games on the Triforce have multiple revisions or updates, with some revisions coming with significant upgrades.  Later revisions may have addressed problems in this revisions, especially if the supposed <em>Type 3</em> version exists.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a> was a tad underwhelming in our opinion.  If you're a huge fan of these games and are seething at our mini-review, we're fully aware that a lot of our frustrations might simply boil down to a <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuE0QMHErQo">skill issue</a></em>.  But since we were familiar with the rich history of the veterans at <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Amusement_Vision_(Developer)">Amusement Vision</a> and their legendary track record of arcade games, this one was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>Originally released in 2003, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon: The Wizard Master</a> is a strange and very, <em>very</em> expensive arcade game.  This game was not just expensive for the players, but it was also expensive for the operator too!  This game is powered by <strong>five</strong> Triforce cabinets: one central Triforce server for the main game screen, and four additional satellite Triforce pedestals for the players.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon: The Wizard Master</a> is an arcade trading card board game.  The objective of the game is simple - players scan in their decks and see their monsters on the big screen while battling up to three other players for supremacy. </p>
<p>Before playing the game, players need to purchase a starter deck of 30 random trading cards. This deck also comes with an IC card so that players can save their progress. Each satellite Triforce comes with a deck reader to allow a player to scan in their deck of cards. But how would you control the game after scanning in your cards? Why, a <em>touchscreen</em>, of course!  And if that wasn't enough, the game also came with a separate card kiosk specifically for purchasing starter decks and booster packs.</p>


<p>There are at least six revisions of The Key of Avalon.  It is important to be aware of what revision a cabinet is, as cards from newer sets will not work with older revisions. Thankfully, cards are marked with what set they came from, making it fairly easy to know which revisions each card is compatible with.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon: The Wizard Master</a></strong> - Supports the initial 100 cards.  There is a 1.10 revision with small adjustments.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_Of_Avalon_Ver.1.20:_Summon_The_New_Monsters">The Key of Avalon 1.20: Summon The New Monsters</a>:</strong>  This first <em>major</em> update adds support for 52 new cards in the <strong>N</strong> series.  Earlier prints of these cards may have different stats and are missing some information on the back of the card.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_Of_Avalon_1.30:_Chaotic_Sabbat">The Key of Avalon 1.30: Chaotic Sabbat</a>:</strong>  This version adds support for 35 more cards in the <strong>C</strong> series.  Much like Summon The New Monsters, reprints of these cards have additional information and may have slightly different stats.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_Of_Avalon_2:_Eutaxy_Commandment">The Key of Avalon 2: Eutaxy Commandment</a>:</strong>  An update big enough to be called a sequel.  It has 61 new cards, a single player mode, and much more.  The cards for this revision are in the <strong>E</strong> series.  These cards do not appear to have any changes between early and late prints.  The updated stats for older cards are used by this game.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_Of_Avalon_2.5:_War_of_the_Key">The Key of Avalon 2.5: War of the Key</a>:</strong>  The final revision adds support for 40 new cards in the <strong>W</strong> series.  There are also additional <strong>Legend</strong> cards separate from the main catalogue.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, nearly 300 total cards were released spread out over five rarities:  Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, and Super Rare.  Some cards are undoubtedly stronger than others, and those cards are mostly the rarer ones.</p>
<p>Like other collectable card games, players were expected to buy packs and trade with others to build the best possible deck.  To prevent someone from getting clever with a printer and suddenly owning all the rare cards, Avalon cards have a barcode embedded into their top edge that the game reads the card data from.  Though nearly invisible in normal circumstances, if held up to a light <em>just right</em>, the material of the barcode stands out against the rest of the card.</p>


<p>Cards weren't all about utility, though.  These cards were beautifully illustrated by a myriad of artists, and each monster is represented by a detailed 3D model in game.  If someone was lucky, they might've stumbled upon alternate art or holofoil versions of cards.  Players could also be rewarded with unique <strong>Ex</strong> cards that were <strong>only</strong> distributed through events.</p>


<p>Of all of the Triforce games, this was the only one we couldn't play.  Even if we had five Triforces, five GD-ROM drives, and JVS I/O emulation for the cards, it still wouldn't be enough.  The game can be booted with fewer Triforces, but the touchscreen is a total mystery and there was no way to bypass it without having a working Avalon Satellite Pedestal.</p>


<p>We've researched the game, bought manuals, and obtained a ton of cards and understand the gameflow, but without having played it we can't really say if it's fun or not.  However, based on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sega-profits-rise-as-console-game-division-approaches-break-even">existing sales data</a> and the number of updates, we know that <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon</a> was moderately successful despite its high price.  Sega would go on to make more trading card arcade games, including a suspiciously similar Chihiro game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_of_D">Quest of D</a>.</p>

<h4 id="virtua-striker-4-and-virtua-striker-4-ver2006-by-amusement-vision"><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a></strong> by <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Amusement_Vision_(Developer)">Amusement Vision</a><a href="#virtua-striker-4-and-virtua-striker-4-ver2006-by-amusement-vision" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Two years after <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a>, Sega released the next game in the Virtua Striker lineup with <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a>.  With dramatic upgrades to the controls, support for saving progress, team configuration, rank, and more, this game is often considered the best in the series by fans.  And it only got better with <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a>, which updated the rosters and added additional online events.</p>


<p>Like most Triforce games, the newer Virtua Striker games take advantage of cards for saving. <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a> uses IC cards to track player progress, similar to <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon</a>.  These cards are nifty, as not only are they more durable than magcards, but they also contain an ID for logging in to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALL.Net">Sega ALL.Net</a></strong>.  The internet was enough of a thing at this point that Sega started experimenting with it for tracking player data and progress.</p>


<p>This meant that instead of a local arcade leaderboard, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a> could have a global leaderboard tracking players on ALL.Net-connected machines across the world. By playing against other players that had registered online, players could be promoted to higher ranks or be demoted to lower ranks.  On the surface, this is an upgrade over traditional magcards, but the obvious downside is that these games rely on servers hosted by Sega.  Unfortunately, support for these machines ended in 2017, meaning that the online features no longer work.  Thankfully, these games can still be played offline without the online services, albeit without the special features and events.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a> was a revelation to play after the previous games.  The changes are subtle, but they come together to provide a far superior experience.  The ability to dash gives players much more control over attacking at the expense of stamina, and helps avoid the common problem in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3</a> where athletes were constantly just banging into each other in a scrum.  The <em>change tactics</em> buttons add depth as players can adjust their strategy on the fly instead of waiting for halftime.  This gives the opportunity to go for that golden goal in the final seconds or play defensively to hold a tight lead.</p>
<p>Instead of being locked to an eight-way gate, this game uses a full analog lever that allows for more precise control.  Player movement is still a little stiff, but it makes a world of difference when it comes to the accuracy of shots and passes.</p>


<p>For most fans of the series, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a> is the definitive version in the series, and we can see why.  Unfortunately, it is also the last game in the series and it never saw a home console port.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="f-zero-ax-by-amusement-vision"><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a></strong> by <strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Amusement_Vision_(Developer)">Amusement Vision</a></strong><a href="#f-zero-ax-by-amusement-vision" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>If there was a crown jewel of the Triforce efforts, it has to be <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> and the home console game born from it, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a>.  Without Nintendo collaborating with Sega, there's no way that the legendary arcade racing devs at <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Amusement_Vision_(Developer)">Amusement Vision</a> would have had the chance to work with the F-Zero license.</p>
<p>For those out of the loop, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a> is renowned as one of the greatest arcade-style racing games ever made.  It has tight controls, an incredible sense of speed, and legendary difficulty.  The racing alone would make for a great game, but the developers went above and beyond with tons of content to elevate the experience.  It has tons of characters with their own 3D models, F-Zero machines, and even theme songs accompanying their profiles.  The garage functionality also gives players the ability to create their own vehicles with a custom appearance and stats.  Topping all of that off is an iconic and difficult story mode full of goofy FMV cutscenes oozing cheesy goodness.  And for those who never had a chance to play the <em>arcade-exclusive</em> tracks, the arcade tracks can actually be unlocked in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a>!</p>
<p>So that's it then?   <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a> has everything the arcade could offer and more.  There's no reason to care about <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a>, right?  <strong>Wrong</strong>.</p>


<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> is still an incredible experience even for those that have completely mastered <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a>.  The controls and physics have been adjusted to make the game play better on a force feedback yoke and pedals.  The change in controls allows players to <em>push</em> the vehicle in ways that are lost in the home console version.  And, if you're lucky enough to find a deluxe cabinet, the intensity is ramped up further with pilot seat haptics - it can tilt to throw the player around corners.</p>
<p>The game is a visceral thrill.  Everything great about the racing in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a> is here, just with the intensity cranked up to another level.  Unfortunately, it only has six tracks, with one of them being a fairly simple oval for learning the game.  The other tracks are fantastic visual showcases with devious layouts.  The long ice slide at the end of Green Plant: Spiral pushes players to go fast as they can with no traction, while the back-to-back right angle turns and thin straightaways force precision driving on Lighting: Thunder Road.</p>
<p>There are only two modes in this game: Race and Time Trial.  Race has players going up against 29 other AI opponents or three other players if playing against linked cabinets.  Time Trial is exactly what it sounds like and has players racing for the best time in a solo effort.  Best records could be uploaded online with a code, back in the day.</p>


<p>Hidden away in the Service Menu, there are five difficulty modes to help the operator tune the experience according to the clients.  In a more casual arcade, the game's difficulty could be lowered to <em>Very Easy</em> to give players more time to make mistakes and still win.  If they wanted people to suffer, <em>Hardest</em> all but guarantees no one will ever win.  The length of the races can also be adjusted.  Even a standard three lap race can be exhausting on a cabinet, so cranking up the length can really turn the game into an endurance challenge.</p>


<p>On the track, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> looks like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a>.  But after having the opportunity to play them back to back, the differences in how they drive became very apparent.  Even ignoring the arcade atmosphere, AX gives the sensation of always being one mistake from careening out of control.  After playing a lot of <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> and returning to GX, the change in feel was shocking.  Treacherous turns in AX were suddenly ordinary in GX thanks what feels like higher grip and different drifting physics.  The cars felt like they were glued to the track in the console version!</p>
<p>After spending a lot of time with both, AX definitely presents a more difficult, but rewarding to master, driving model.  The arcade game <em>does</em> grant players some reprieve though.  Running out of energy or flying off the track will happen now and then even to the most experienced players.  This is <em>not</em> an immediate race over!  Instead players will be respawned back on the track after a small time penalty.  It dampens the hopes of victory, but it's usually possible to come back from one major mistake.  However, unlike the console version, players are on a strict time limit by default.  Once the clock hits zero, the race is over regardless of whether the player is in first or last place.</p>


<p>Both magcards and GameCube memory cards can be used to save progress.  Players are assigned a license rating that can be upgraded by winning races and earning points.  Every 30,000 points, players are afforded an opportunity to buy upgrades for their own custom F-Zero Machine.  This machine could be used directly in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> or transferred to <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a> via memory card.</p>
<p>To beat <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a>, players have to win all six races and all six target times.  While doing this, players earn points that upgrade their license's rank, which allows them access to better parts for their custom F-Zero machine.</p>
<p>After experiencing it first hand, we can say that the game is a truly incredible arcade experience.  If not for <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a>, it would be a modern tragedy that it didn't see a wider release.  Still, those who love the F-Zero series should definitely give this version of the game a spin if they have the chance.</p>
<h4 id="monster-ride"><strong>Monster Ride</strong><a href="#monster-ride" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>


<p>It would be a crime if we didn't at least mention <em>Monster Ride</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX: Monster Ride</a> is a separate release of F-Zero AX and the only Sega-produced Triforce game that uses a NAND cartridge.  It has fewer features, pilots, and ships than the standard version of F-Zero AX, and doesn't seem to have multiplayer or any save support whatsoever.</p>
<p>But in exchange, Monster Ride runs in a <a href="https://segaretro.org/Cycraft">Cycraft</a> cabinet. </p>
<p>Imagine playing F-Zero AX inside a five degrees of freedom <strong>motion simulator</strong> where the player's cockpit is suspended in the air with an arm, and the cabinet literally swings the cockpit around to match the ship's movement in game. That's Monster Ride, and it's as awesome as it sounds.  Unfortunately, these cabinets are <em>incredibly</em> rare and appear to have never left Japan.  We invite readers to watch this clip showing it off, as this is as close as most of us will ever get to the real thing.</p>


<p>In most cases, something this obscure would be lost to time.  But, luckily enough, a few Monster Ride Triforces have survived over the years.  And thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bobbydilley/cycraft-emulator">Cycraft emulation</a>, Monster Ride can technically be run from a standard Type 3 NAND Triforce.  Maybe some day all of this could be hooked up to a homemade Cycraft-compatible motion simulator and Monster Ride will live again.  We can dream, right?</p>


<hr>
<h3 id="in-retrospect"><strong>In Retrospect</strong><a href="#in-retrospect" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After having played each and every Triforce game to the best of our ability, it's easy to see why the platform is still beloved by its fans.  Unfortunately, it was a victim of its era and most games only released in Japan. The games that did get international releases were only released in limited quantities.</p>
<p>As developers of a GameCube and Wii emulator, the Triforce is an especially interesting topic for us. At the core of every Triforce is a GameCube, yet that familiar hardware was used to drive a different type of experience in the arcades. It's fascinating! For this article, we wanted to shine a spotlight on this interesting step-sibling to the consoles we emulate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to emulation, arcade hardware is a very, very different challenge than emulating a home console. Even though each game is powered by a Triforce, all of the hardware around it can be unique for each game and even behave differently on different revisions of the same game!  An arcade cabinet only needs to be compatible with the specific game inside of it.  Because of that, unlike GameCube/Wii emulation, where fixing one game can sometimes fix dozens of others, each individual <em>revision</em> of an arcade game needs to be treated as its own challenge.</p>
<p>Those problems didn't stop people from trying to build Triforce emulation on top of Dolphin in the past, though!  <strong>Over 17 years ago</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/commit/93b83f8d65962a10a2776bf9fb6c39ce1eb03f2d">Dolphin gained the ability to emulate parts of the Triforce Baseboard</a>. It wasn't enough to boot any Triforce games, but it was a start. However, that was the last time anything Triforce-related hit our mainline builds.  Aside from code clean up efforts, the fledgling Baseboard emulation was left untouched <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2016/09/01/dolphin-progress-report-august-2016/">until it was removed in the summer of 2016</a> to avoid misleading users into thinking that mainline Dolphin targeted Triforce hardware.</p>
<p>Just because Triforce emulation wasn't progressing in the main builds doesn't mean it wasn't being pursued, though.  Instead, efforts were moved to a dedicated <em>Triforce branch</em>, where developers could do whatever they wanted to improve Triforce emulation.  And there was some success from this approach - it was eventually able to play a few games, such as <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP 1</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">2</a>.</p>


<p>However, a lot of this progress was achieved through <strong>brute force</strong>.  Because so little was understood about how the Triforce worked, many <em>suboptimal</em> techniques were used to get results fast, like hacking problematic behaviors out of games and hardcoding responses.  This, combined with some magic to force each game's controls to work with a standard GameCube controller, was enough to get some games running.</p>


<p>This was fine for a separate branch. Hacky emulation is sometimes a necessary first step to more accurate emulation, after all.  But on the other hand, the hacky nature of the Triforce branch made it unacceptable to be merged into mainline builds as-is, despite its achievements. Unfortunately, the emulation quality never improved and progress stalled out. The Triforce branch was abandoned after just two years of sporadic contributions, and it eventually faded into obscurity.</p>


<p>Any attempt at Triforce emulation today must be held to a higher standard. It wouldn't need to be perfect at first, but the goal should be to actually <em>emulate</em> Triforce hardware, rather than to ignore that it exists.  We should strive to give retro and arcade enthusiasts the tools to bring Triforce games to life with their own custom solutions for the platform's assortment of obscure hardware.  In a perfect world, Dolphin would be capable enough to be the core of hobbyist arcade cabinets.</p>
<p>Each Triforce game brings difficult questions that Dolphin just isn't well suited to answer.  Dolphin is a console emulator at heart and is not designed to tackle the hyper-specific challenges that come with arcade emulation.  We already have enough problems trying to emulate all the weird <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080530194734/http://www.siliconera.com/2007/01/23/introducing-the-densha-de-go-wii-controller/">Wii Remote attachments</a> and <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2025/06/04/dolphin-progress-report-release-2506/#2503-270-disguise-rock-band-playstation-usb-devices-as-wii-equivalents-by-josjuice">USB devices</a> out there!  To do right by the Triforce would take an inordinate amount of work and expertise.  And embarking on that journey for what amounts to a handful of games, many of which already saw very faithful home ports, would be a foolish endeavor at best.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, we're just as surprised as you to be announcing this...</p>
<h3 id="the-return-of-the-triforce"><strong>The Return of the Triforce</strong><a href="#the-return-of-the-triforce" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>As of <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/2512-395/">Dolphin 2512-395</a>, Triforce support is here!</strong>  Readers that have been paying close attention might have noticed that some of the screenshots in this article are suspiciously high resolution.  There's a reason for that!  <em>Every single in-game screenshot in this article comes from Dolphin!</em></p>


<p>This is the culmination of over a decade of work.  While were focused on advancing GameCube and Wii emulation, <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> doubled down and continued maintaining his own fork <em>specifically for</em> Triforce emulation.  We were aware of this fork, but given the fact that we knew little about how the Triforce worked and had bad memories of the old, hacky Triforce branch, it mostly flew under our radar.</p>
<p>Everything changed mid-2025 when <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> contacted us about potentially making a pull request to get his Triforce emulation code into our official builds.  Developers had a mixture of both excitement and concern upon hearing about this.  It would be a major project, and <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a>'s solo work would now be scrutinized by a bunch of people.</p>
<p>In the end, what won us over was the quality of emulation.  The games ran beautifully, and apart from missing touchscreen support for The Key of Avalon, each game was playable.  The hacky, messy Triforce emulation we remembered was gone, and something much better had taken its place.</p>
<p>So, we wanted Triforce emulation in Dolphin, and <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> wanted to bring it into Dolphin.  Their pull request was an easy merge, right?  Well, there was still one big hurdle in the way:  <em>code review</em>.</p>


<p>Because the Triforce has a significant amount of bespoke hardware, none of the developers reviewing the code knew much about how it worked.  We were put into a tough spot of having to review a large volume of code that emulated unfamiliar devices.  The Triforce was mostly a black box to us at the beginning of this effort, and it still is in many ways.</p>
<p>To get Triforce emulation to the finish line, we had to work together and make <em>a lot</em> of compromises.  We did not want to let perfect be the enemy of good, but it still had to be good enough to not hinder further development.  <a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sepalani">sepalani</a> gave huge assists with their own fixes and clean ups to help get the Triforce pull request ready for action.  Many of our targeted clean ups focused on fixing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety">memory safety</a> bugs, removing potential game hangs, and improving the overall user experience by adding safeguards and streamlining the process of configuring Dolphin to run Triforce games.  After many months of review, cleanups, and testing within the team and the community,  Triforce emulation is finally here.  And it is here to stay.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> has been helping us with his knowledge on the Triforce for various guides and information.  He also assisted us with dumping Triforce games and provided a homebrew payload that can dump Triforce games directly over the network.  It is also possible to dump GD-ROM titles without any Triforce hardware by using a PC disc drive, but it is a more complicated process and takes several steps in order to retrieve the game from the disc.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-dolphin-for-triforce-emulation"><strong>Setting up Dolphin for Triforce Emulation</strong><a href="#setting-up-dolphin-for-triforce-emulation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Triforce is ultimately a GameCube with arcade bits attached to it.  Much like how Dolphin can automatically reconfigure itself depending on if you're booting a GameCube or Wii game, Dolphin will now become a <em>Triforce</em> when it detects a Triforce game being loaded.  However, the Triforce Baseboard options can also be manually enabled for homebrew purposes, and there are some important settings in its configuration menus.</p>
<p>The Triforce Baseboard can be found as a SP1 device in Options -&gt; Configuration -&gt; GameCube.  It has additional configuration options for various IP address redirects, which can make it easier to set up networking features of the Triforce.  There's also a shortcut here to configure Triforce controls, which can also be found as a GameCube Controller Input device in Options -&gt; Controller Settings.</p>
<p>Each game's arcade controls have already been roughly adapted to a GameCube controller, but be sure to configure the Coin, Service, and Test buttons!  Controller port 2 can optionally be set to a baseboard as well, but Dolphin will automatically translate controls when possible without this being necessary. These are the only two places where Triforce settings need to be adjusted in Dolphin.  Note that standard GameCube/Wii games should not be booted with the Baseboard set in SP1 or as a controller.</p>


<p>One other important component of the Triforce is <strong>Segaboot</strong>.  Without Segaboot, players can't access the Service Menu and the game's settings.  This means not being able to enable free play, change difficulties, calibrate controllers, and much more.  Additionally, the full boot process can only be experienced by providing a Triforce IPL <em>and</em> Segaboot combined with "Skip Main Menu".  Just be prepared for a few error popups along the way as some parts of initialization are not fully emulated.</p>
<p>Segaboot can be found on certain Triforce update discs or in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a>'s files.  You can use Dolphin's filesystem explorer to locate the "firm" folder that holds Segaboot files.  The correct file is 2MB, and in the case of <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a>, it is named <code>segaboot.img01</code>.  Renaming this file <code>segaboot.gcm</code> and placing it in the <code>Triforce</code> directory inside of the User folder will allow Dolphin to use it.</p>


<p>Some games use <em>networking</em> for certain hardware, such as <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX Monster Ride</a>'s Cycraft and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP 1</a>/<a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">2</a>'s namcam2.  In both cases, a third-party server that emulates the behavior of the original device can be used with Dolphin.  By default, Dolphin includes an IP Redirect to make the game look at localhost for these devices.</p>
<p><s>Conveniences such as save states are not yet available as Triforce emulation isn't fully integrated with all of Dolphin's features</s>.  This part of the article was originally a much longer "Limitations" section with a big list of warnings, shortcomings and potential problems for users, but some cheeky developers decided to go through and fix most of them after reading through the section.  At this point, the biggest omissions are NetPlay and TASing support only because the new Triforce input devices aren't supported by input recordings.</p>
<p>Even Android users get to join in on the fun! Triforce hardware can be enabled and configured in the Android GUI like on desktop and games will run out of the box. The only limitation is that the Coin, Test, and Service buttons have not been added to Dolphin's touchscreen controller, so users will have to map them to a real controller or a physical button on the device. One exception to this is inserting a coin, which has been mapped by default to shaking your device.</p>


<p>Regardless of whether you're playing on PC or Android, some parts of the Triforce experience are still hardcoded.  The attached JVS I/O devices for each game cannot be customized or changed in any way.  This is not particularly accurate, as real cabinets could be configured in multiple ways, with some having deluxe features not present on others.  This was a compromise, and we hope to make hardware features customizable in the future.  Dolphin also automatically generates a magcard or IC card for each game and tracks progress on it, but users cannot swap cards, eject cards, or interact with them in any way whatsoever through Dolphin's GUI.</p>
<h4 id="emulating-arcade-multiplayer"><strong>Emulating Arcade Multiplayer</strong><a href="#emulating-arcade-multiplayer" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Lastly, there is multiplayer support to talk about. Multiplayer was an important part of the arcade experience, and every Triforce game supports multiple players in some form.  Single machine multiplayer should work without issues.  This means that <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a> will all "just work".</p>
<p>Then there are the <em>multicabinet</em> games.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon</a> games, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> all had support for up to through using separate cabinets connected to a LAN (Local Area Network).  Prior to these efforts, <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> had actually implemented some networking and socket features as part of emulating the monstrosity that is <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon</a>.  Multicabinet is <em>required</em> for the Avalon games, even for single player, as they use a server/client model with each player on a client Triforce and the master Triforce hosting the game server.  Unfortunately, due to missing touchscreen support, they still aren't playable even when the instances are able to connect with each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> was on the opposite side of the spectrum and never showed any signs of life.  The game would just get stuck on searching for other instances forever. We unfortunately can't figure out the problem right now, as we don't have any packet dumps from real networked <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> cabinets.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> were the tragic pair throughout the review process.  These games could actually see other instances of Dolphin on the network for a brief moment before they gave up and reverted to single cabinet mode.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to this article's release, <a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sepalani">sepalani</a> spent some <em>very</em> late nights cleaning up parts of the networking code and hunting down regressions from those clean ups.  The namcam2 for the Mario Kart games communicates via LAN on real hardware, and was particularly problematic during the clean up process.  This was something that <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> already had working, so we <em>really</em> didn't want to break it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, testing the namcam2 only takes a couple of seconds.  The game checks for it on boot during the initial hardware checks.  But waiting for new builds to try would usually take anywhere from 10 minutes to multiple hours.  During that waiting period, one of the few testers with access to Triforce software had to be at the ready to test things or else everything would get delayed.  This led to a lot of downtime with bored testers messing with Triforce games to pass the time.  It was during one of those downtimes that a tester reported that some of the attempts to fix the namcam2 were affecting multicabinet support, as multiple instances of Dolphin could no longer find each other in Mario Kart!  Even though the effect was negative, it was still interesting and prompted more investigation.</p>
<p>After we properly fixed namcam2 support, curiosity got the best of us and we continued tinkering with various Mediaboard network commands hoping to get multicabinet working in time for launch.  It seemed hopeless at times, but after multiple nights of burning the midnight oil... this happened.</p>


<p>At the 11th hour, we were finally able to get multiple instances of Dolphin running <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> to connect to each other.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> wasn't as easy and threw out "unhandled mediaboard command" errors despite the instances seeing one another.  Thankfully, one look at the error and <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> knew exactly how to fix it.  Minutes later, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> was working just as well as its sequel.  Both games now work incredibly well and are able to survive Wi-Fi latency spikes of over 80ms with little hitching and no disconnects.</p>
<p>We plan to write a full multicabinet emulation guide on our wiki after this article launches. Please stay tuned.</p>
<h3 id="triforce-emulation-roadmap"><strong>Triforce Emulation Roadmap</strong><a href="#triforce-emulation-roadmap" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This isn't the hacked-up Triforce emulation of 2012, but there's still a lot of work to be done.  Throughout testing, a ton of features were added and many issues were addressed, but work is far from done.  In order to get this massive project merged, some items on our wishlist had to be put off for later.  He's a rundown of some of the bigger things we really want.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better IC/Magnetic Card Interface:</strong>  Currently, Dolphin automatically inserts a card that matches the current game ID in supported titles.  This lets players easily play games and save without any extra setup. While this is nice, it isn't always what a player wants.  We want to add the ability to buy, eject, swap, and insert cards like players could do at a real arcade.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Cabinet Configurations:</strong> Each game has its own hardcoded set of JVS I/O devices at the moment.  While this means that games will always boot up with a valid configuration, it also means that alternative configurations can't easily tested, such as a cabinet without a magcard reader.</li>
<li><strong>Make The Key of Avalon Games Playable:</strong> These games are monsters to emulate, thanks to their specialized hardware.  Even with multicabinet support working, there is still so much more to be done before Dolphin can bring this arcade experience home.  The biggest fires to put out are the lack of touchscreen emulation and limited support for deck scanning.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Force Feedback Hardware:</strong>  There are many bits and pieces on various Triforce cabinets that Dolphin can't currently handle.  For example, force feedback motors are not generally supported. Only <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a>'s steering wheel motors can be mapped at all, but even if you do map them, some forces are incorrectly interpreted.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Controller Configuration GUI:</strong>  The Triforce Baseboard SI device reuses the GameCube controller configuration GUI and adapts that to each game as best as it can.  In the long term, we want players to see each game's control devices and their layouts so that they can configure a controller without having to guess what each input does.</li>
<li><strong>Hook up TAS Tools and NetPlay</strong>: Dolphin's input recording tools don't support Triforce input devices, breaking these features.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in Support For namcam2/Cycraft</strong>:  Currently, third-party programs are required in order to emulate Cycraft and namcam2.  In order to make using third-party servers easier, Triforce games can be told to look at any address, including localhost, for these devices.  In the future, an emulated option alongside real servers would be preferrable, somewhat like how Emulated USB Devices are currently handled.</li>
<li><strong>Continue Fixing Crashes/Hangs:</strong>  Triforce emulation performed extremely well during our extensive testing, but to say everything is perfect would be a stretch.  Given the rarity of Triforce games, not every revision of every game has been tested and some may not work.  <s>One common hang is that the Mario Kart titles get stuck when trying to eject the magcard after play.  This doesn't result in any loss of data, but does mean the game has to be reset.</s>  <strong>Edit</strong>: The magcard eject hang was fixed just before this article was launched.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is by no means exhaustive, but we wanted to give an idea of how much work is still left to be done.  Triforce emulation works incredibly well right now, but will continue to be a work-in-progress for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h3 id="wrapping-things-up"><strong>Wrapping Things Up</strong><a href="#wrapping-things-up" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly being thrust into Triforce emulation after all of these years was quite the experience for everyone involved.  We can confidently say that this esoteric hardware is full of surprises.  Just emulating these games and trying to test them was a distinct challenge far removed from anything we experienced with the GameCube and Wii!  Each game has so many unique quirks, revisions, and sometimes even hardware configurations!  </p>
<p>This couldn't have happened without <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a>.  Going into this, most Dolphin developers knew almost nothing about Triforce emulation, and without the decade plus of knowledge he had built up while maintaining his fork, we would have stood no chance.</p>
<p>With everything that's been done, there was one final challenge.  Our goal was for Dolphin's Triforce emulation to be good enough to drive hobbyist arcade cabinets and preserve the arcade experience these games were meant for. So we gave it a try. We built a hobbyist <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> cabinet kit, set up a PC with Dolphin, and let family and friends have at it.  And it was a blast for everyone involved.</p>


<p>When we first started on this journey, most of us hadn't had the opportunity to play any of the Triforce games on an original cabinet. The best we could do was buy the core systems and games and try to get them running with what we had.  The experience on bare hardware was rarely good and never great, but that was not how they were meant to be played.  Triforce games were designed to be a part of an arcade experience, with a cool cabinet, interesting features, and unique control schemes. Through emulation, we were able to bring some of that arcade magic back to these games that no longer have a cabinet to call home.</p>
<p>But through all of those trials, it's finally here.  Maybe a <s>few</s> <em>dozen</em> years later than anyone expected.  However, there are still a lot of exciting changes still on the horizon, so be sure to check in for more development articles about Dolphin - the GameCube, Wii, and <strong>Triforce</strong> emulator!</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Agent Skills are structured packages of procedural knowledge that augment LLM agents at inference time. Despite rapid adoption, there is no standard way to measure whether they actually help. We present SkillsBench, a benchmark of 86 tasks across 11 domains paired with curated Skills and deterministic verifiers. Each task is evaluated under three conditions: no Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated Skills. We test 7 agent-model configurations over 7,308 trajectories. Curated Skills raise average pass rate by 16.2 percentage points(pp), but effects vary widely by domain (+4.5pp for Software Engineering to +51.9pp for Healthcare) and 16 of 84 tasks show negative deltas. Self-generated Skills provide no benefit on average, showing that models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they benefit from consuming. Focused Skills with 2--3 modules outperform comprehensive documentation, and smaller models with Skills can match larger models without them.

<p dir="auto">I like the concept of apps like <a href="https://wisprflow.ai/" rel="nofollow">Wispr Flow</a>, <a href="https://superwhisper.com/" rel="nofollow">Superwhisper</a>, and <a href="https://www.monologue.to/" rel="nofollow">Monologue</a> that use AI to add accurate and easy-to-use transcription to your computer, but they all charge fees of ~$10/month when the underlying AI models are free to use or cost pennies.</p>
<p dir="auto">So over the weekend I vibe-coded my own free version!</p>
<p dir="auto">It's called FreeFlow. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Download the app from above or <a href="https://github.com/zachlatta/freeflow/releases/latest/download/FreeFlow.dmg">click here</a></li>
<li>Get a free Groq API key from <a href="https://groq.com/" rel="nofollow">groq.com</a></li>
<li>Press and hold <code>Fn</code> anytime to start recording and have whatever you say pasted into the current text field</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">One of the cool features is that it's context aware. If you're replying to an email, it'll read the names of the people you're replying to and make sure to spell their names correctly. Same with if you're dictating into a terminal or another app. This is the same thing as Monologue's "Deep Context" feature.</p>
<p dir="auto">An added bonus is that there's no FreeFlow server, so no data is stored or retained - making it more privacy friendly than the SaaS apps. The only information that leaves your computer are the API calls to Groq's transcription and LLM API (LLM is for post-processing the transcription to adapt to context).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h3><a id="user-content-faq" aria-label="Permalink: FAQ" href="#faq"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why does this use Groq instead of a local transcription model?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I love this idea, and originally planned to build FreeFlow using local models, but to have post-processing (that's where you get correctly spelled names when replying to emails / etc), you need to have a local LLM too.</p>

<p>Macroeconomics, DIY Hardware and AI-Driven Voting Pools</p>
<p>I downloaded every Show HN post since the site was launched and ran them through a hierarchical topic model. I set out to discover what the Hacker News community finds interesting but in the process I ended up uncovering macro-economic trends, evidence of voting rings/fraud, and subtle shifts in behavior over the lifespan of the post</p>

<p>If a picture is a thousand words, I like to think this interactive treemap is at least one thousand and one. You can click into a box to dig into the year or topic group. The first thing that jumps out is just how much bigger the 2025 box is than any other year. The second is how much lighter the 2025 box is compared to the previous few years.</p>
<p>I enjoy history, but I am often told that people care much more about what is happening now. So let’s dig into specifically 2025.</p>
<section id="these-are-the-top-performing-topics-in-2025">
<h4 data-anchor-id="these-are-the-top-performing-topics-in-2025">These are the top performing topics in 2025:</h4>
<table>
<thead>

<p>Again, what sticks out to me is the discrepency between the average 2025 post’s average performance compared to the previous few years. The top performing topic in 2025 has the same likelihood of receiving 100 points as the average post in 2022. That’s a discrepency that I want to dig a bit deeper into.</p>

<p>There are three distinct groups: 2022 as the heyday of Show HN posts, 2021, 2023, &amp; 2024 as still extremely highly performing, and 2025 with a significant performance reduction. If I were to make a guess at the root cause of this difference, I would have two (not necessarily contradictory) theories.</p>
<p>The first is tied to the software job market. I can easily imagine that the combination of remote work and post-covid tech boom drove much more overall Hacker News engagement and more interesting Show HN projects. The job market and remote work receded a little in ’23 and ’24 but morale seems to have cratered in 2025. Which leads to my second theory.</p>
<p>AI has driven much more content, by both aiding in its creation and creating a cohort of startups and companies chasing a piece of the pie. This AI-driven content tends to be more shallow, and its noise makes it harder to discover genuine, interesting content. There is some evidence for this theory in the expontential growth in the quantity of hacker news posts from 2022 onwards.</p>
<p>These are both guesses. I don’t have an easy avenue to dig into the economic theory, but I do want to dig a bit deeper into the composition of posts in 2025.</p>
</section>
<section id="digging-into-2025">
<h2 data-anchor-id="digging-into-2025">Digging into 2025</h2>
<p>The first thing I want to dig into is the change in topics of viral posts. Take a look at this <em>slope plot</em>, which shows the change in content of all posts between 2024 and 2025. Each side of the plot lists topics by rank, and a line connects their 2024 position to their 2025 position; topics which decreased in prominence have negative slopes, shown in <em>red</em>. Topics which surged in prominence have positive slopes, shown in <em>blue</em>.</p>


    
<p><br> You can see a spike in topics related to AI such as “Agent Connectivity”, “AI Coding”, &amp; “AI Automation”, which lends credence to at least my theory that AI related posts grew more common in Show HNs. However, I’m curious to dig into not just how often topics were posted in 2025, but how successful each topic was.</p>


    
<p><br> This plot shows that, outside of the “AI Automation” topic, which saw slightly higher represented in viral posts than it’s overall prevalence, AI related Show HN posts underperform expectations. The majority of the bottom right “quadrant of death” is AI related topics. Topics such as “AI Coding” and “AI Image Generation” see noticable drops as well. It is interesting to me that “Document Ingestion and Retrieval” strongly overperforms expectations as a tool that supports a lot of these other AI topics (something about selling pick-axes?). But standing above all, the deep blue line shooting like Superman across the sky is DIY Hardware IoT Projects. I confess that I am a sucker for these posts, as it appears all of Hacker News is as well. These tends to be extremely authentic, lack any sort of commercial viability and just have a lot of soul put into them.</p>
<p>The last thing I wanted to dig into is the audience segmentation aspect of Hacker News. There’s two distinct audiences viewing posts. The first is the much more hardcore technical readers that view the “New” and “Show” pages. The second is the more mass market crowd that goes on the front page.</p>


    

<p>So some takeaways I have is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The real heavy-lifting for the performance of “DIY Hardware” projects is really coming from the first wave of Hacker News readers (though it does get a sizeable boost from the front page audience as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Nearly every AI related topic does worse once it clears the 10 point threshold than any other category. This means that either the people looking through the New and Show sections are disporportionately interested in AI. This is very possible, but from my interaction with this crowd from my posts, these users tend to be more technically minded (think DIY hardware, rather than landing-page builders).</p>
<p>However, my Spidey-sense is going off a little bit. AI has received a massive wave of funding for startups and enterprises have carved out budget space to invest in solutions. This is obviously not hard evidence, but circumstantially, it looks like there is a evidence that some level of voting rings are on within this AI posts.</p>
<p>However, either explanation would explain why 2025 is such a challenging year for viral Show HN posts. There exists this set of topics that are more frequent than ever, that quickly garner early points, but do not resonate with the broader audience. Beyond that is speculation on my part.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="whats-the-best-time-to-post">
<h2 data-anchor-id="whats-the-best-time-to-post">What’s the best time to post?</h2>
<p>Ah the question you really wanted to know. This was actually the first question I asked as well. I did a simple SQL query estimate. However, Mike McCourt saw a chance to apply a Gelman-style hierarchical mixed-effects model to better leverage the data to answer this question. I won’t spoil his analysis but I’ll leave you with a little preview …</p>

For the last hundred years, we have privileged it as the focal point for investigation into human nature and behavior.</p><blockquote><p><em>Exercise</em></p><p><em>If you close your eyes, and point to where you feel you are in your body, where do you point? Do you have a focal point?</em></p><p><em>Most of us locate ourselves in our head, somewhere behind the eyes.</em></p></blockquote><p>Much of the neuro-centric cognitive revolution that started with Minsky and Chomsky with the first ENIAC still dominates many of the human sciences. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Melzack’s neuromatrix model of pain, even Pain Reprocessing Therapy — all have this (in my view undue) emphasis on the brain.</p><p>Is human consciousness in the brain?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">
    
    <time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2026-02-15T00:00:00+00:00">Published on 15 February 2026</time>

    <p>
      The Internet is almost anonymous and privacy-preserving by design. I mean,
      unless some administrator actively tries to track you, there is no
      built-in identity layer. What breaks both properties is the centralization
      of communication onto closed platforms, where identification becomes
      possible either by the hosting company itself, or by governments
      compelling them to cooperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      After recent events, it is time for us to start using protocols again
      instead of services.
    </p>

    <h2>Services are easy targets</h2>

    <p>
      A government that wants to identify users, censor content, or enforce
      compliance only needs to send one letter to one company. One subpoena, one
      court order, one regulatory demand: the service likely complies or faces
      fines, lawsuits, or bans.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is happening right now. Governments worldwide are passing laws that
      require platforms to verify the age of their users. Discord is voluntarily
      rolling out mandatory "teen-by-default" settings until proof of majority
      (by submitting a face scan or, God forbid, a government-issued ID), likely
      anticipating future regulatory obligations.
    </p>

    <p>
      None of this could happen with a protocol. You cannot require age
      verification on IRC, XMPP,
      <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>,
      <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a>, or
      <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>, because there is no single
      entity to compel. Each server operator makes their own decisions. A
      government would need to individually pressure thousands of independent
      operators across dozens of jurisdictions, which is a legislative and
      enforcement impossibility. And even if one server complied, users would
      simply move to another.
    </p>

    <h2>Switching services solves nothing</h2>

    <p>
      After Discord's announcement, the instinct is to migrate to another
      service. This is pointless. The new service will either operate under the
      same jurisdiction and face the same rules, or it will be offshore and
      eventually blocked or pressured once it becomes large enough to matter.
      You are just moving from one regulable entity to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual solution is to stop depending on a specific commercial service
      and start using a protocol. This is not a radical idea. We already do it
      with email. SMTP is a protocol. You can switch providers, self-host, or
      use any combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Email may not seem to be the best example since it has become an oligopoly
      where Google, Microsoft, and maybe also Apple control the vast majority of
      the email infrastructure. But actually, this is a good example to show how
      protocols are resilient. Let's say Google bans your account, then you can
      move to another provider and still reach every Gmail user. In a more
      extreme scenario, let's even say Google and Microsoft discontinue their
      service (in your specific region, for example), even block any inbound
      message from you. Not ideal, but <em>SMTP implementations still exist and
        they still work</em> even in a very degraded mode. You'd need to migrate
      (as well as some of your connections), but there is absolutely no need to
      reimplement anything. That is the difference with a service like Discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a centralized service, if your account is deleted or banned, you are
      gone for good.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Use protocols
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every time we choose a service over a protocol, we opt into a system where
      a single company can be compelled to <strong>identify us, restrict us, or
        hand over our data</strong>, to their profit or out government's
      advantage.

    <p>I realize it's gauche to blog about some shit you saw on bluesky but yesterday I saw a post that encapsulated so much of what has been bumming me out about the rise of coding agents over the last year. this dread had been slowly rising from seeing blogs about using claude code from your phone while getting ready for work, while commuting, while waiting to pick your kids up from school, but it's come to a head.</p>

<p>now <em>obviously</em> the opinions of founder-brained SF social bubble weirdos should be immediately discounted; they are the spiders georg of this industry. but at the same time they are playing into the dreams of management, the worker that never stops working, that's always online, that's infinitely Productive, always shipping, always wants to get back to work. I imagine this archetype exists in other industries but my experience is limited to tech so I will stick to that.</p>
<p>my fear is that this will become the norm. anecdotal evidence<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> tells me that more and more companies are adopting AI for their engineers to use, encouraging (and in some cases requiring) its use in an effort to boost productivity, despite no actual evidence pointing to these improvements<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> and <em>Anthropic-funded</em> research indicating that AI usage reduces skill retention<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>so where does this lead us? we know that some <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/26/nx-s1-5567995/why-the-996-schedule-is-capturing-the-interest-of-silicon-valley-leadership">US tech companies are starting to embrace the "996" schedule</a> popularized in China's tech industry. enforced usage of coding agents makes that push even easier—is it really work if all you're doing is telling the computer what to do and then reviewing it to make sure it didn't do anything wrong and also babysitting it all hours of the day?<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>many have already observed that coding agents, which require constant attention and often generate low-quality code with (by design) random results, are a slot machine. they are loot boxes. they are gambling. you are constantly pulling the lever and hoping you get the SSR SaaS Passive Income product. you will not get this, but <em>maybe</em> you will. just one more prompt, one more pull, one more revision, one more go at being Absolutely Right<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>if you suffer from token anxiety, you have a gambling addiction. I'm sorry that it's not being formally treated as such, but you can take some solace in the fact that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/for-many-players-lootboxes-are-a-crisis-thats-already-here/">novel forms of gambling often take time to be recognized</a><sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>now we can put our thinking caps on and follow a pretty easy chain of events. coding agents can trigger our gambling instincts with slot machine-like behavior; tech companies are pushing engineers to work more and encouraging or enforcing the use of coding agents to get there; gambling is addictive; heavy users of coding agents self-report symptoms of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>you see where this is going, right? by enforcing the use of inherently addictive technology in the workplace, employers are (whether intentionally or not) making their workers addicted to work. this seems bad!</p>
<p>one has to wonder how common this will become. will this become the norm? obviously there will be companies with a shred of ethics and empathy for their workers that choose to buck this trend, but if they become the minority there will be fewer and fewer jobs for those who value having free time. we've already reached a point where trying to get a job in this industry requires a gradual erosion of ethics and standards, how much worse does that get?</p>
<p>all I know is that if we keep down this road, I'm gonna bail out to get HVAC certified and make youtube videos about fucked up commercial systems. I can't do this shit forever.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" tabindex="-1"><article><!--[--><img src="https://joshcollinsworth.com/images/post_images/slop.jpg" alt="" width="16" height="9"><!--]-->   <!----><p>A while back, in a slightly earlier era of AI<footnote><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-link-1">1</a>, a project was making the rounds which would read your GitHub profile, and create a personalized roast based on the contents.</footnote></p> <p>It was intended, I assume, as a harmless, lighthearted novelty. I wanted to join in on the fun, so I put my profile in and tried it out.</p> <p>I didn’t laugh at my roast.</p> <p>It wasn’t clever, or funny, or even particularly unexpected. A tech-savvy stranger on Fiverr probably could’ve done better.</p> <p>But more than that: I remember being surprised at how <em>mean</em> it was. Little of what the model produced even felt like a joke; instead, it just read as a slew of very personal insults.</p> <p>And <em>then</em> I remember being surprised that the artificial cruelty actually <em>affected</em> me.</p> <p>Despite knowing this was all a soulless (and as it turns out, humorless) machine making a poor attempt at comedy—one that nobody else even saw!—reading those words hurt. Bizarrely, I suppose, AI actually managed to <em>hurt</em> me.</p> <p>And that was the first time I remember thinking about what AI was going to do to my <em>children</em>.</p> <p>If I—a grown man with thick skin, hardened by decades of internet usage—can still be susceptible to highly personalized online bullying, what will it be like for my son, when some mean kid inevitably gets their hands on this technology and decides to put it to malicious use?</p> <p>By the time my kids encounter <em>real</em> bullying, I’m sure derogatory jokes will be about the <em>least</em> harmful form of antagonism AI will be empowering. Imagine the damage one bad kid could cause using deepfakes, for example. Forget the days of starting a nasty rumor and spreading it around the school; now you can share a video of it happening.</p> <p>Imagine the shame, intimidation, harassment, and trauma AI might enable a cruel juvenile to inflict—<em>particularly</em> once the tech has had another few years to improve. (To say nothing, of course, of what it might enable for an unethical adult.)</p> <p>Imagine how absolutely unmitigable the damage would be.</p> <!----> <p>My reaction wasn’t laughter; my reaction was horror at the realization that we’re racing to build the perfect bullying tool.</p><!----><!----> <p>I was never exactly an optimist when it comes to AI. But that was the first time I realized exactly how dark the future I foresaw actually was.</p> <hr> <p>Although it’s not an entirely correct description, I’ll use the term “AI optimist” a lot in this post, as it’s at least a serviceable label for a general group of people.</p> <p>That group, to be a bit more descriptive, is made up of people who are excited about AI. This might include future developments, but they’re particularly excited about AI in the present and near term, and how they can use it right now. You might call them enthusiasts, or even believers, maybe. But in any case, they’re generally enthusiastic about AI, and aren’t overly concerned with costs or downsides.</p> <p>You almost certainly know at least one or two of these people. Maybe you even <em>are</em> one. (If so: I’m not naive enough to think I’ll change your mind with this post, but I hope I’ll at least give you some things to think about.)</p> <p>It seems to me that to be in this group—to regard AI, as it exists currently, with optimism and enthusiasm—requires at least a certain degree of privilege. Hence, the somewhat blunted title of this post.</p> <p>I had long struggled to put the thought into words. But once it crystallized into this post’s titular sentence, I felt as though a great deal around me suddenly shifted into perspective.</p> <p>So, that’s why I wrote this post; to share that perspective. It is my own, and it comes from my own experiences (and yes, through the lens of my own substantial privileges, class and otherwise). You can take it, or not, as you like.</p> <hr> <p>It’s late 2025, and so you don’t need me to tell you how extreme opposing views on AI can be. <em>Everyone</em> has an opinion of AI, and the overwhelming majority fall to one far end of the spectrum or the other. There’s a vast divide between the sides, each fiercely passionate in their own entirely opposite ways.</p> <p>For my part, I’m decidedly on the pessimist side of the chasm, for many reasons. Some I’ll get into here; others, I’ll mostly pass over, as they’ve been well covered elsewhere.</p> <p>But for now, suffice to say: when I look around me at the impact AI is <em>currently</em> having, I see little reason for enthusiasm—let alone the little-questioned, quasi-religious belief that this fundamentally flawed technology might one day soon bring about some sort of economic, societal, and/or scientific revolution all on its own.</p> <p>Come to think of it, “religious” might be a good word to describe how AI optimism feels, from the outside. It has fervent believers, prophecies from prominent figures to be taken on faith, and—of course, as with any religion—a central object of worship which can at all times be offered as The Answer, no matter what the question might happen to be.</p> <p>In fairness: that’s not all AI optimists. I’m mostly describing the extreme ones.</p> <p>Even among the more moderate optimists, though—ordinary people who just like the tech—the enthusiasm has always seemed…disproportionate, let’s say.</p> <p>It was always perplexing to me that so many of my peers seemed so eager to be across the divide from me; that they were so much more impressed with AI than I was, and so indifferent to what I felt were alarming flaws and drawbacks.</p> <p>They didn’t seem particularly different than me. In fact, many were my friends, connections, and people I looked up to.</p> <p>We were looking at the same tech, with the same outcomes, and drawing entirely different conclusions. What was I missing?</p> <p>The answer eventually hit me:</p> <p>They see themselves as the ones benefiting from AI, and not as the ones it might cost.</p> <hr> <p>I concede AI can occasionally be helpful for certain tasks, and I can understand the enthusiasm, as far as that goes. I don’t use it often, but admittedly some. (I do still write every word of every post on my own, however, hand-typed em dashes and all.)</p> <p>I sometimes find AI helpful for generating reference images to use as starting points for illustrations, and occasionally for ideating, as a “rubber duck” of sorts. I also use it once in a while to compensate for my own color vision deficiency. But mostly, it helps me with code.</p> <p>In full disclosure of all the mundane details: I mostly only use code completion suggestions in VS Code, even though they’re often hit and miss. I rarely use chat mode, and when I do, it tends to be mostly for rote tasks like format conversion or pattern matching. That’s pretty much it. Every time I’ve tried giving AI more responsibility than that, it’s let me down pretty spectacularly.</p> <p>I’m deeply skeptical that AI offers a net productivity boost in general<footnote><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-link-2">2</a>, but particularly that it’s capable of high-quality frontend code. I theorize good frontend is just too subjective, too visual, balances too many concerns, and is too underrepresented in training data.  (That might explain why developers in other specialties seem to report better results.)</footnote></p> <p>I can already hear the enthusiasts scoffing and getting up to leave, because I don’t use AI “the right way,” by vibe-coding with Cursor agentic MCP, or whatever the flavor of the week is. And it’s true; I’ve never gone that deep with it.</p> <p>That’s partly because I’ve heard too many horror stories about leaked secrets, deleted databases, and wiped hard drives. I don’t like the idea of giving a non-deterministic black box full control of my machine and/or production.</p> <p>But it’s also because I <em>like</em> using my brain. Any passion I have for what I do comes largely from the process of ideating, building, and creatively solving a problem. Having a machine do all that for me and skipping to the result is as unsatisfying as a book full of already-completed sudoku puzzles, or loading up a save file where somebody else already played the first two thirds of a video game. I don’t do these things just because I want the <em>result</em>; I also do them because I want the <em>experience</em>.</p> <p><em>I</em> want to improve! And it’s hard to imagine how that might happen if I’m not actually putting skills into practice.</p> <p>All of that’s mostly beside the point anyway, though; my issues with AI have little to do with its level of effectiveness.</p> <hr> <p>Even if my new coding buddy is severely prone to overconfidence, it’s still admittedly exciting when it makes tasks that would’ve been previously time-consuming and/or challenging quick and easy.</p> <p>In order to be an AI optimist about this, however: that’s where I would have to stop thinking about it.</p> <p>I would be forced to ignore what <em>else</em> my little coding buddy is getting up to when I’m not looking; the <em>other</em> impacts he’s having on <em>other</em> people’s lives.</p> <p>Let’s take layoffs as an example.</p> <p>In order to be an AI optimist, it seems to me you’d have to believe yours is not among the jobs at risk of being automated or downsized, and that you aren’t among the countless workers staring down displacement. (Or at least: not at risk of AI taking over the interesting and fulfilling parts of your work, as your role is reduced to acting as its manager.) After all, how could you feel enthusiastic about a threat to your own livelihood?<footnote><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-link-3">3</a></footnote></p> <p>You’d need to be high enough in the org chart; far enough up the pyramid; advanced enough along the career ladder.</p> <p>To be an AI optimist, I’m guessing you must not be worried about where your next job might come from, or whether you can even find one. The current dire state of the job market, I have to assume, doesn’t scare you. You must feel secure.</p> <p>Maybe it’s because you’ve already made a name for yourself. Maybe you’re known at conferences, or on podcasts. Maybe you’re just senior enough that your résumé opens doors for you.</p> <p>Or maybe you’ve been promoted into leadership. Maybe you spend your days in important meetings.</p> <p>Maybe this is all a lot easier to be optimistic about with the right charts and graphs in front of you.</p> <p>You almost certainly aren’t a junior, though, or an intern, or somebody trying to break into the field. You must not be near the rising tide engulfing entry-level workers across my industry and a wide range of others. Because, infamously, <em>nobody</em> is hiring juniors anymore.<footnote><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-link-4">4</a></footnote></p> <!----> <p>It seems fairly safe to assume you aren’t in the first group against the wall, if you’re excited about the thing putting them there.</p><!----><!----> <p>You probably aren’t a contractor, either, or working at a consultancy. And for that matter: you almost <em>certainly</em> aren’t an artist, or illustrator, or writer. You probably haven’t watched client dollars funnelled upwards, with the bitter knowledge that this thing eroding your income is only possible because it brazenly plagiarized you and a million other people who do what you do.</p> <p>AI optimism probably means you’re in a position where nobody is stealing <em>your</em> work, or bulldozing <em>your</em> entire career field.</p> <!----> <p>That’s the thing about being bullish on AI: to focus on its benefits to you, you’re forced to ignore its costs to others.</p><!----><!----> <p>AI optimism requires believing that you (and your loved ones) are not among those who will be driven to psychosis, to violence, or even to suicide by LLM usage. At the very least, this means you feel secure in your own mental health; likely, it also means you have a wider and more substantial support system propping up your wellbeing.</p> <p>(Not to put too fine a point on it, but: those things are otherwise known as privileges.)</p> <p>AI optimism requires you to believe that, whoever will be impacted by the sprawling data centers, the massive electricity demands, the water consumption, and the other environmental hazards of the AI boom<footnote><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-link-5">5</a>, it won’t be you. Whatever disaster might happen, your neighborhood will be safe from it. Probably far away from it.</footnote></p> <hr> <p>The harms of AI aren’t a standalone issue; as AI becomes a part of <em>other</em> technologies, systems, and parts of society, it’s exacerbating their existing problems, and accelerating damage already being done elsewhere.</p> <p>I have to believe scammers are enthusiastic about AI; there’s likely never been a more helpful tool for fraud. Criminals and con artists have always been around, of course, but they’ve never had such powerful instruments at their disposal. After all, it’s much easier to rob somebody’s unsuspecting grandma when you can simply conjure a video of that person out of thin air, or perfectly imitate their voice on a phone call.<footnote><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-link-6">6</a></footnote></p> <p>But that’s a relatively small scale of harms, aimed at individuals. The broader harms come from AI interacting with <em>systems</em>, like governments and their substructures.</p> <p>Malicious state actors (both in and outside of the US) are wielding AI as a ruthlessly efficient propaganda machine, disseminating disinformation that’s more convincing than ever, faster than ever previously possible. Much of what’s being produced serves to dehumanize and victimize vulnerable groups, like immigrants, refugees, queer people, and political dissidents. Mainly (but not exclusively), this is to bolster authoritarian power.</p> <p>It’s hard to imagine how one could be optimistic about the technology empowering such horrors, but I suppose knowing it probably won’t affect you must help.</p> <p>I doubt I could feel very good about the tech helping me write emails faster if I knew that same tech was helping to make me, or people close to me, a target of violence.</p> <p>Even when the intent might be good, however, AI often amplifies existing harms.</p> <p>In the rush to shove AI into everything possible, we’ve now injected it into parts of the justice system, too. It’s in everything from facial recognition and surveillance tech to data and administrative work. It’s even in the legal system.</p> <p>In theory, this is an efficiency boost. In <em>theory</em>, a machine should be less biased than humans.</p> <p>In reality, not only do these models make mistakes at a rate that is utterly unacceptable in this context; they mimic and amplify the inherent racism present in their own training data. (Tech is always a mirror of its creators; it is never neutral.) Compounding this problem, AI is non-deterministic, and something of a black box, offering little to no way to inspect, challenge, or appeal its results.</p> <p>Needless to say, this deployment of AI has already had profoundly devastating impact on real people’s lives—damage which shows no signs of slowing.</p> <p>Forgive me, but I can’t imagine being excited that this technology which is rapidly accelerating inequality is also helping me save a little time on writing code.</p> <p>I have to imagine such excitement would require me to think none of this could happen to <em>me</em>, or to anybody who matters to me.</p> <p>Or, at the very least: that it’s all undeniably unfortunate, but ultimately, in service to some greater good. A justifiable tradeoff; a glitch to be ironed out.</p> <!----> <p>AI optimism requires you to see the lives of at least some of your fellow humans as worthwhile sacrifices; bug reports in a backlog.</p><!----><!----> <p>But even when there’s no larger system behind it, and even with no broader goal or agenda at all—malicious or otherwise—AI can still amplify existing harms.</p> <p>One example at the top of my mind: Facebook was recently flooded with AI-generated videos of women being violently strangled. There was no apparent deeper purpose behind this horrifying wave of misogynistic terrorism, however; it just happened to be what the algorithm rewarded. That content generated engagement, and that engagement generated more of the same content.</p> <p>A similar thing happened recently on TikTok, but this time it was videos of immigrants being ruthlessly brutalized that struck a nerve and triggered a proliferation of objectionable content across the platform.</p> <p>Sometimes this effect is more or less benign (see: Shrimp Jesus); other times, a machine built to provoke a reaction will inevitably hit paydirt in the horrifying, the traumatizing, the inhumane, and the unacceptable.</p> <p>AI isn’t just harmful on its own; it’s a force multiplier for existing harms. The intent behind it, if one even exists, is irrelevant; the impact is the same.</p> <hr> <p>I think all of this is why so many of us are so pessimistic about AI; we can see very clearly the many ways it represents a threat to us, and to the things we care about.</p> <p>For so many, AI stands to take away something important from us and those around us—safety, stability, creativity—and replace it with benefits for somebody else; productivity and profit, going mainly to those above us.</p> <!----> <p>I think so many people are against AI because they see how it functions as a system for taking away from those with the least, to give even more to the already highly privileged.</p><!----><!----> <p>This is why the promise of AI fixing everything and empowering workers is so important; it’s the linchpin of the whole operation. It’s required to get buy-in from the people who stand to lose the most.</p> <p>So let’s talk about that next.</p> <hr> <p>Some might argue I’m missing the entire point here, by focusing so much on the present. Optimism isn’t about what’s happening right now, they might say; it’s about the future!</p> <p>Forget what AI actually is <em>currently</em>; the models will get better, the data centers more energy-efficient, the tokens cheaper, the mistakes rarer, the harms mitigated, and so on, until we have something that changes the world for the better; an actual benevolent technology that solves our problems, in whatever way. Maybe it even is, or leads to, AGI (actual human-level artificial intelligence; the thing AI used to mean before 2022).</p> <p>I take issue with these predictions, for several reasons:</p> <ul><li><p>While I’m sure the technology and its costs will continue to improve, it’s hard to see how that would mitigate most of these harms. Many would just as likely be <em>intensified</em> by greater speed, efficiency, and affordability.</p></li> <li><p>I’m wary of predictions in general,<footnote><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-link-7">7</a> but particularly those that bear little to no resemblance to observed
reality. Absent a clear evidential link, prediction tends to be based purely on hype and speculation, and there’s a wild overabundance of both around AI.</footnote></p> <p>It’s reasonable to believe the tech will improve. It seems much less reasonable to think it might suddenly change into something new, develop presently impossible capabilities, or take us somewhere far distant with absolutely no clear path or connection between here and there.</p></li> <li><p>Most of the utopian visions of AI center on the idea that AI is sentient, which it categorically, factually, <em>is not</em>. Language and statistics can simply mimic cognition easily, and our human brains are overly eager to anthropomorphize anything that vaguely imitates human behavior. Thinking and reasoning are very different than statistically emulating communication.<footnote><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-link-8">8</a></footnote></p></li> <li><p>Many LLM experts, including prominent researchers from OpenAI and Meta, tell us the models are already approaching their realistic ceiling, and cannot practically scale further beyond this plateau, for several reasons (not least of which: the exhaustion of training data that isn’t already tainted by AI). Several also tell us LLMs are a dead end when it comes to achieving AGI, and most generally agree it’s literally impossible to stop LLMs from making things up. (Really: actual people from OpenAI publicly admitted LLMs will never stop “hallucinating.” It’s an un-fixable bug, because it’s a core component of how LLMs work.)</p> <p>So if you believe LLMs are intelligent, or eventually will be, you’re fighting a lot of people who know a lot more than you do from every angle.</p></li> <li><p>Even if we ignore all the technical limitations, or find ways around them: new advancements simply don’t work that way. They never have. (The equitable, worker-liberating way, that is.) Tech doesn’t free workers; it forces them to do more in the same amount of time, for the same rate of pay or less.</p> <p>If you become twice as productive, you don’t get twice the pay or twice the time off; you just get twice the workload—likely because somebody else doing the same job just got laid off, and now you’re doing their work, too.</p> <p>This sort of technology distributes instability to the many at the bottom, while consolidating benefit at the top—and there has arguably never been a more efficient mechanism for this than AI. I see absolutely no reason to believe this time will be different, <em>especially</em> because:</p></li> <li><p>AI models exist in the consolidated hands of a precious few huge companies, which are themselves quite obviously happy to do away with as many of their own workers as they possibly can. AI will serve, and is already serving, corporate interests first and foremost—<em>especially</em> as these models continue to replace core infrastructure, like web search, and can be manipulated however the companies please.<footnote><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-link-9">9</a></footnote></p></li> <li><p>Regardless, even if you naively believe in the tech: you’re <em>still</em> willing to put up with all the harms and dangers of AI until that imagined potential future arrives—which brings us back to the original point.</p></li></ul> <p>Some might also point to positive use cases for AI. Accessibility is a popular one. (In fact, it’s <em>so</em> popular that online AI apologists have realized all they need to do is invoke the word “ableist” to shut down any discussion.)</p> <p>Yes, there are good use cases for AI. I don’t think most reasonable people would argue with that. Like I said: I sometimes even use it myself, to compensate for my own physical inability. But calling out such cases tends to be a bad-faith attempt to justify all of AI’s other harms by <em>using</em> disabled people and others who might benefit from AI, rather than reckoning with the damage and rethinking our deployment of AI in order to maximize good and minimize harm for <em>everyone</em>. We don’t have to accept every use of AI and all of its impacts just because some of them might be beneficial.</p> <p>Finally, let me take a moment to address anyone who might be thinking: <em>sure, AI is being used for some bad things, but I’m not personally using it that way. What’s wrong with me just focusing on the good parts and enjoying the benefits to me</em>?</p> <p>My friend, that’s privilege. You are literally describing privilege.</p> <hr> <p>Let me close this post the same way it began; with a personal example from my own family.</p> <p>I have a newborn daughter.</p> <p>I began writing this post before she was born, and mostly because of her, I’m now finishing it up several weeks later. (I’ve fit most of this writing into her nap schedule, typing as she sleeps beside me.)</p> <p>And I can’t shake the thought that I’m welcoming her into a world where so much of the potential malicious misuse of AI could one day be directed at her.</p> <p>Looking beyond all the things we’ve already talked about: technology in general has made things like stalking and abuse easier than ever. But AI goes even further. I live knowing AI will allow any degenerate pervert with an internet connection to create deepfakes of this little girl—up to and including pornography—without any consent at all, at barely the click of a button.</p> <p>If this sounds like a horrifying, disturbed thought: it is! <em>It absolutely is</em>! But I’m not coming up with this on my own; this is already happening to untold numbers of women, many of whom are school-aged girls.</p> <p>To be an AI optimist, I would need to turn away from this. Ignore it. Consider it all just part of the plan; a price to be casually paid (hopefully by somebody else) in exchange for…what? Writing software a little bit faster?</p> <p>Optimism would require me to believe that my children probably won’t have that kind of experience, or any others I’ve described here.</p> <p>To believe they’ll be in better schools. Better neighborhoods. Have better friends. Better support systems.</p> <p>Won’t ever attract the attention of the wrong guy, or piss off the wrong girl.</p> <p>Won’t ever live in the wrong places. Won’t ever find themselves in the wrong part of the system.</p> <p>Won’t end up on the wrong side of the accelerated inequality.</p> <!----> <p>AI optimism requires you to see yourself and your loved ones as safe from AI; as the passengers in the self-driving car, and not as the pedestrians it might run over.</p><!----><!----> <p>I don’t know how you see yourself that way without a great deal of class privilege.</p> <p>The rest of us?</p> <p>I guess it’s hard to see the convenience as worth the price—let alone exciting—when you know you could be among the ones paying for it.</p> <!---->  <!--[--> <!--]--></article><!----></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>When I got my first real job, I used to get so nervous about writing emails to my boss. I would run spellcheck, triple-check the grammar, read over it again and again to make sure my tone sounded professional and mature and not young and stupid. After painstakingly revising the email for 30 minutes, I would send it to my boss, who would respond right away with a message that looked like:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>K  let circle back nxt week bout it . thnks </p><p> <em>Sent from my iPhone</em></p></div>

<p>I had another job where my bosses were heavy emoji users. I would send them super professional emails, trying so hard to overcompensate for how young I was, and they would respond back with a single sentence punctuated with multiple cryface emojis (😂). To this day, I think of that emoji as "corporate" since professionals love to use it for whatever reason. I'm used to it now, but a decade ago I thought it was so odd. I thought we were supposed to be professionals? And professionals are supposed to write with good grammar, right?</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about this ever since the latest Epstein document dump.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> People have been uploading screenshots of emails between Epstein and Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Richard Branson. And besides all the upsetting and salacious details everyone is discussing, the thing that also surprises me is how <em>bad</em> everyone's grammar is.</p>
<p>It reminded me so much of emails from bosses in my life: short, blunt (almost rude?), typos galore, weird formatting, bad grammar, "sent from iPhone", etc. It's almost as if, once you get to a certain level of power, you no longer need to try. Because the only reason people spend time crafting a well-written email is to look powerful, mature, professional. But if you're already a powerful professional, I guess technically you don't need to make an effort. And if there's no other boss above you, you can do whatever you want.</p>
<p>It reminds me of another email leak, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Sony_Pictures_hack" target="_blank">2014 Sony Pictures hack</a>. While everyone ooed and ahhed over a bunch of executives talking crap about celebrities, the main thing I remember from that whole scandal was how <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/greatest-hits-leaked-sony-emails-angelina-jolie-aloha-david-fincher/" target="_blank">sloppy and unprofessional</a> emails from executives looked like. I remember reading over those emails with almost a sense of jealousy. If <em>I</em> had sent out an email with even a quarter of the typos they had, I probably would've lost my job.</p>
<p>I know words like "privilege" gets thrown around a lot, and I think we all understand monetary privileges and power privileges and race privileges, but grammar privilege? That's certainly a first.</p>

      <p>I’m sitting on a lānai in a hotel in Waikiki beach, writing this article, and wondering if the job I am starting nine days from now will be my last.</p>

<p>This is a unique situation for me in a few ways—I’ve never been to Hawaii before, I think the five minutes it’s taken me to come up with that opening sentence is the somehow the most time I’ve ever spent on a hotel balcony, and this is the first time I’ve actually followed through on the “I should delay my start date to take a vacation” idea I’ve had every time I’ve switched jobs.
There’s one difference, however, that looms larger in my mind.
It’s not the “wondering if the new job will be my last” thing.
I’ve worked exclusively in startups, and while the primary reason I’ve done so has been because I enjoy the agency and impact you can have at early-stage companies, I’d be lying if the idea of cashing in cheap ISOs into early retirement wasn’t a factor in each job offer I accepted.
The difference here is <em>why</em> I’m wondering that.
Previously, it was wondering if I would <em>need</em> a job after this one.</p>

<p>Now, it’s wondering if I’ll be able to <em>acquire</em> a job after this one, or if AI is going to completely take over my profession and ruin my career.</p>

<h2 id="not-the-first-time">Not the first time</h2>

<p>I’m not the first human to have anxiety about technological development.
Change is scary, and technology changes a lot of stuff.
In my opinion, these changes are mostly for the better—but that’s not an opinion everybody shares.</p>

<p>The classical cultural example is the Luddites, a social movement that failed so utterly that its name because a common metaphor for stubborn morons who are terrified of technological innovation that helps everybody.
Deservedly so, to be clear—while it’s true that textile experts did suffer from the advent of mechanical weaving, their loss was far outweighed by the gains the rest of the human race received from being able to afford more than two shirts over the average lifespan.</p>

<p>The other example that comes to mind is the (possibly apocryphal) stories around the rollout of ATMs, where many supposedly predicted that the number of bankers in the US would collapse now that you could withdraw $20 in singles to leave tips without talking to a person.
The exact opposite happened, of course.
Being able to easily interact with banks, without waiting in a line that’s too long for the dum-dum you get at the end to be a real consolation, made people use banks <em>more</em>.
And suddenly tellers became loan managers, and account advisors, and the machine that was supposed to destroy banking employment wound up supercharging it.</p>

<p>I could go on, but <a href="https://qz.com/1681832/the-history-of-the-future-of-work">somebody else already has</a>, so there’s not much point in it.
Technology changes things, and sometimes it hurts people in the short-term, but every invention from fire to mRNA vaccines has wound up generally increasing human welfare.
I’ve long taken the view that this trend will continue.
I remember arguing with people who would link GCP Gray’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">“Humans need not apply”</a> video (which has apparently been retitled “humans are becoming horses”) about how wrong they were about AI.
In that era, nearly a decade before “Attention is all you need” would be published and usher in the LLM age, I was <em>so</em> confident that any developments in AI would be for the better.</p>

<p>I am now a little less confident than I was.</p>

<h2 id="not-a-hater">Not a hater</h2>

<p>I don’t hate AI.
Earlier today I was asking Gemini to find me a nearby bar that would optimize for price, tastiness of drinks, and “not making me feel lonely as a solo traveler on Valentine’s day.”
Gemini did include a speed-dating event at a local hotel as a response to that prompt, which I am choosing to interpret as it having supreme confidence in my charisma, rather than it making fun of me.
It’s also been helpful doing various tasks on <a href="https://www.github.com/AnthonySuper/noided-web">the weird little Haskell framework</a> I’m working on, and at my former place of employment, and I plan on using it at my newest place of employment.</p>

<p>If I’m to believe the boosters, like Sam Altman or obscure indie filmmaker <a href="https://youtu.be/m2IV0BajqAk?t=3213">Neil Breen</a>, AI could be humanity’s last invention, a machine we can hand the keys to and let it solve literally all of our problems.
And to some extent, that does kind of appeal.
It would be great if I could type “how can I be happy” in a prompt console somewhere and get back a step-by-step process to achieve enlightenment.
And we could also cure cancer, or whatever.
Sounds nice, right?</p>

<p>So why is this blog post titled “I guess I kinda get why people hate AI” as opposed to “AI haters are stupid and wrong?”</p>

<h2 id="the-people-in-charge-of-ai-keep-telling-me-to-hate-it">The people in charge of AI keep telling me to hate it</h2>

<p>Before I get into concerns I’ve found on my own, let me get the most blatantly obvious and infuriating reason that people might hate AI out of the way: <em>the people inventing it are telling me I should hate it</em>.
I’ve never seen this with any technological development, ever, in my life.
Henry Ford did not market the Model T as “a machine that will eventually cause environmental destruction, social isolation via car dependency, and health issues from pollution.”
The guy who invented penicillin didn’t say “one day this will lead to MRSA.”
People generally try to market new technologies by telling you their upsides, not their downsides.</p>

<p>But Microsoft’s AI CEO is saying <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-white-collar-tasks-automation-prediction-2026-2">AI is going to take everybody’s job</a>.
And Sam Altman is saying that AI will <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/sam-altman-says-openai-poised-130000116.html">wipe out <em>entire categories</em> of jobs</a>.
ANd Matt Shumer is saying that AI is currently like <a href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/2021256989876109403">Covid in January 2020</a>—as in, “kind of under the radar, but about to kill millions of people”.</p>

<p>I legitimately feel like I am going insane when I hear AI technologists talk about the technology.
They’re supposed to market it.
But they’re instead saying that it is going to leave me a poor, jobless wretch, a member of the “permanent underclass,” as the meme on Twitter goes.
Half the videos and blog posts I see about new models boil down to somebody running it through a benchmark, then saying “chat we’re cooked, might as well end it all now.”
This isn’t just a strange way of marketing a product, it is a completely psychotic one.</p>

<p>That’s not the only way people are talking about it, of course.
I liked Anthropic’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDNkDBNR7AM">superbowl ad for Claude</a>, and not just because it used “ALL CAPS” by MF DOOM as the backing track.
The idea of AI as an exterminator of human problems is much more appealing than AI as the exterminator of, you know, the career of me and everybody else on Earth.
But, somehow, “AI is good and will help you” is a less common marketing tactic than “AI will ruin you life” among <em>people in charge of AI companies</em>.</p>

<p>It’s completely fucking baffling to me.
I can’t understand it, unless all those AI marketing materials are really meant for the ultra-wealthy, and not for me.
“Fund this and you can become a permanent overclass and have millions of enslaved serfs bowing to your machine-god” is, I suppose, an appealing tactic to some kinds of people.
Or maybe the real message is “you should panic because if you don’t invest all your money in my company right now you’ll be a peasant like everybody else” is the real pitch.
I don’t know.
I’m not rich enough to be in that target demographic.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-they-believe-it">What if they believe it?</h2>

<p>The counter-argument to this is that people aren’t marketing, they’re just expressing their view of reality.
Microsoft’s AI CEO doesn’t <em>want</em> AI to ruin millions of lives, but it’s going to, so he has to be honest.</p>

<p>Okay, fine.
If that’s the case, I would encourage AI companies to lobby, right now, for world governments to pass legislation to deal with the problem they see on the horizon.
Now, obviously it would be a bit premature to enact a UBI right now, <em>before</em> AI takes over all work, but you don’t actually have to: you can pass a law with a trigger condition.
If unemployment rises above a certain percent while GDP is still growing, have additional taxes start kicking in, used to fund job training or UBI or whatever else you think is needed to prevent the “permanent underclass” from forming in the first place.
If AI doesn’t actually take everybody’s jobs, and it winds up being more similar to other technologies, great—the trigger conditions never kick in, and the law stays inactive.
If the AI jobpocalypse <em>does</em> happen, you don’t need to scramble to get anything done, the laws to deal with it (or at least help) are already on the books.</p>

<p>I’ve not seen a single AI CEO propose anything like this.
Various people have speculated that we might need laws, eventually, after AI takes over everybody’s jobs.
But if we’re actually two years out from <em>every office worker being automated</em>, which is <a href="https://www.dpeaflcio.org/factsheets/the-professional-and-technical-workforce-by-the-numbers">57.8% of the workforce</a>, we need to start legislating <em>right now</em> to have any hope of this not being a total disaster.
I can only think of three reasons why nobody is proposing this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They are actually far, <em>far</em> less confident than they say that AI will actually get that good.</li>
  <li>They lack the imagination to think of the idea of passing a law with a trigger condition.
Such laws <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_stabilizer">do exist</a> but aren’t super well-publicized.
So this is actually a possibility.</li>
  <li>They don’t actually care about what their products may do to society—they just want to be sure they win the AI race, damn the consequences.</li>
</ol>

<p>To me, none of these are a good look.</p>

<h2 id="ai-right-now-has-a-few-huge-downsides">AI right now has a few huge downsides</h2>

<p>I have a friend who is a new TA at a university in California.
They’ve had to report <em>several students</em>, every semester, for basically pasting their assignments into ChatGPT.</p>

<p>They didn’t find this out via careful analysis, or use of any of the dubious AI detector tools.
The students didn’t even try to hide their use of ChatGPT—sometimes they literally left in the “would you like me to also do (related thing)?” that every AI puts at the end of their responses in the essays they submitted.
Total laziness, but laziness that these students presumably got away with in high school.
To my friend, their primary experience with AI is seeing students rob themselves of the opportunity to learn, so they can…
I dunno, hit the vape and watch Clavicular get framemogged, or whatever the hell Gen Z does.</p>

<p>In my own personal experience, my dad enthusiastically sent me a video about Elon’s new “smart house” initiative.
I realized, right away, that the video was AI generated, but I assumed it was a generated summary of some real press release.
Nope!
Every component of it was made up.
It was a top-to-bottom scam.
I researched this for like ten minutes, just to be sure, before gently telling my dad that it was fake.
He handled it well, apologized, and was clearly embarrassed.
But why should he be?
The video had graphics, good narration, music—things that used to be a sign of some degree of effort or sincerity.
Now, all of those signals are totally worthless.
AI is able to slop out fake content just as easily.</p>

<p>Then—and this is petty—I’ve also been subjected to “slop” myself, in the form of bizarre <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/18/ai-has-created-a-new-breed-of-cat-video-addictive-disturbing-and-nauseatingly-quick-soap-operas">cat soap opera</a> videos that appeared in my TikTok feed.
Besides being unpleasant to look at, these shorts have weird racial undertones that are deeply, deeply strange and unsettling to me.
And even though I do the entire “long press and select ‘show less’” thing TikTok provides, they still sneak in, and they frankly irritate me to an irrational degree.</p>

<p>Then I hear about <code>cURL</code> having to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46701733">stop their bug bounty program</a> because of so many AI submissions that hallucinate fake bugs.
Or I look at RAM prices, which have gone completely nuclear, largely because AI companies are buying so much of it.</p>

<p>I get that every technology has friction as its adopted.
I’m sure the first machine-made textiles were of vastly lower quality than anything you could get from even the worst hand-weaver.
AI, however, currently occupies a zone where it’s sometimes very helpful for doing high quality work, but <em>always</em> helpful for doing bullshit slop.
People could always write false press releases about smart houses, but it required them to actually <em>write</em> it.
People could always buy an Elsa costume and a Spiderman suit and make weirdly sexual slop videos, but at least they had to go to party city and buy a Sony camcorder and an SD card.
People could always hire a cheating service to write essays for them, but at least <em>somebody</em> would write the essay.
AI has lowered the barrier to entry for all of these things to the point where they’re effectively free.
Garbage, but free to produce.
And that does make some people’s primary interaction with the technology profoundly negative.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that there <em>aren’t</em> solutions.
Websites could use government IDs to verify that people are human, so spambots can stay out.
After selecting the “please stop showing me videos of anthropomorphic orange tabby cats being cuckolded by black-furred anthropomorphic cats” button on TikTok it eventually wised up and stopped showing me similar content.
Eventually somebody else is going to open up a RAM plant when you can get such stupidly high margins on sticks of DDR5.</p>

<p>But all of these solutions are <em>irritating</em>, difficult, and, frankly, a lot of work.
In some cases they’re even actively dangerous—considering how often companies <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">leak information</a>, giving your ID to a website to verify you’re not a slop-bot severely increases your data privacy risks.
Technology is supposed to save you from working.
For many, AI isn’t doing that.
It’s doing the opposite.</p>

<h2 id="so-i-guess-i-get-it">So I guess I get it.</h2>

<p>To be clear, I think AI will be ultimately extremely helpful.
I still am using it on my projects.
I am going to use it at my next job.
I, <em>personally</em>, don’t hate AI.</p>

<p>But I can’t deny that the vibes right now are <em>awful</em>.</p>

<p>Not just bad, <em>awful</em>.
It’s not just the “chat we’re cooked you’re the permanent underclass” stuff influencers say.
It’s not just the “everybody is fucked” hyperbole CEOs sprout.
It’s the actual, day-to-day experience with the technology.
I’m a programmer—AI actually helps me a <em>lot</em>.
But for normal people, their interactions are profoundly more negative, and none of the people behind this technology seem to care.</p>

<p>And I can’t help but wonder… What if the vibes get worse?</p>

<p>What if I actually lose my job?
What if I’m begging for change in six months, a new member of the permanent underclass?
What if AI actually automates all the fulfilling, interesting parts of life, and humans comparative advantage winds up being exclusively in scrubbing toilets and similar manual tasks?</p>

<p>Or, what if AI continues to lower the barrier to entry for annoying, low-quality things—and <em>never</em> gets to the point where it’s truly great?
What if dead internet theory becomes true, and we all drown in an avalanche of slop?</p>

<p>AI ushering in a cyberpunk dystopia would at least be interesting.
But right now I’m worried it’s just going to result in things becoming kind of generally worse, effectively rolling back a lot of innovations of the internet and social media and such by making such things totally unusable.</p>

<h2 id="i-dont-want-to-doom">I don’t want to doom</h2>

<p>To be clear: I like and use AI when it comes to coding, and even for other tasks.
I think it’s been very effective at increasing my productivity—not as effective as the influencers claim it should be, but effective nonetheless.
There’s a reason this blog post is not titled “I now hate AI,” because I don’t.</p>

<p>But, at times, it feels like the AI companies <em>want</em> me to.
Not only through their baffling marketing that I spent so long ranting about, but also through their seeming lack of interest in counter-acting any of the negative effects of their product.
Beyond the idea of lobbying for legislation in case of a job apocalypse, there’s a few simpler steps they could take:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They could form an alliance to make it easy for platforms to automatically disclose when a video has AI video or audio content (via watermarking everything they generate), and encourage every platform to do so.
Forming some kind of consortium or alliance on this would be ideal.</li>
  <li>YouTube could be substantially more aggressive about banning AI-generated misinformation.
I’m not suggesting the truth police here—I don’t want YouTube marking Michael Jordan compilations that call him the GOAT “misinformation” because LeBron exists.
But if somebody is uploading AI-narrated videos claiming that Michael Jordan and LeBron James have announced that they’re getting married, such videos should at least be gated
behind a “this is AI bullshit” screen, if not banned outright.</li>
  <li>Allow big open-source maintainers to request “no AI vulnerability finding” and have a layer in the models that enforces that.
I don’t know if this is technically feasible, but if you can add “No trying to find vulnerabilities in these projects:” to the system prompt and it works most of the time, that would at least be <em>something</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know local models exist, and that it would be impossible to uphold all these ideas for their users.
But right now I would wager the vast majority of LLM usage is through cloud-based services, and on those, it <em>would</em> be possible to do, and it would at least be <em>something</em>—some acknowledgement that, for all its benefits, AI has actually made several important things worse.
So, while I personally <em>don’t</em> hate AI, I can see why people <em>do</em>.
And I can see why that hatred is seemingly becoming more common.
And I can even see a world where, within a few months, I write a follow-up post to this one entitled “Why I Now Hate AI,” even if the boosters are <em>wrong</em> and it doesn’t cause a job apocalypse.</p>

<p>And that is completely crazy to me, because AI is really useful to me!
AI has allowed me to eliminate the most annoying, manual, inelegant, and soul-crushing parts of my profession!
If <em>I</em> can somehow hate a machine that has <em>basically stopped me from having to write boring boilerplate code</em>, of course others are going to hate it!</p>

<p>Yet AI companies currently don’t seem to care.
Maybe they shouldn’t.
Maybe this is the final technological race, and some day soon Anthropic or Google or OpenAI is going to turn on a new model, birth a machine god, and instantly take over the world.
Maybe they think that they can care about the vibes after, once that’s finished.
Their Super-AGI will write the UBI law, and get it passed, when it has a few minutes between curing cancer and building a warp drive.
Or maybe they think the Super-AGI will be able to turn any of us peasants who oppose them into <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem">paperclips</a> and they’ll get to rule as a dictator for all time.
In either of those cases, the current bad vibes don’t matter.</p>

<p>But I am not too sure about that.
Even if we’re five years away from a godlike, all-knowing super-intelligence—a timeline I think is probably off by at least an order of magnitude—that’s a lot of time for us to idle in a local minima where the average person’s experience of AI is profoundly negative.
Our society could fracture in unpredictable ways, and, eventually, suffer so badly people break out the torches and pitchforks and burn their local data center to the ground.</p>

<p>I would like to avoid that outcome.
Frankly, I don’t think doing so will even be too difficult.
I just wish the big AI labs thought it was worthwhile to even try.</p>

<p>The result should hopefully be a "snappier, more responsive" OS, says Gurman. Apple is also reportedly planning some interface tweaks, but nothing as dramatic as the Liquid Glass overhaul introduced with iOS 26, which will likely <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/macos-tahoe-finder-bug-slipping-ui-polish/">comfort some users</a>.</p>
<p>Code-named "Rave" internally, iOS 27 will also include efficiency improvements that Apple hopes will translate into tangible battery gains for users, says Gurman. However, it's unclear whether Apple would market those improvements or simply let users discover them on their own.</p>
<p>Gurman says getting the software into good shape is especially important as Apple prepares to launch new device categories, including a touchscreen MacBook Pro and its first foldable iPhone, both of which are expected in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>The cleanup effort comes alongside Apple's other major iOS 27 priority of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/siri-ios-26-launch-confirmed-apple/">improving its AI capabilities</a>. The revamped, chatbot-style Siri that Apple announced in June 2024 has been repeatedly delayed, and some of its features are now expected to arrive in iOS 27 rather than iOS 26, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/">reports Gurman</a>.</p>

            <p>
Discord have belatedly confirmed that they're working with Persona, an identity detection firm backed by a fund directed by Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, as part of Discord's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">new global age verification system rollout</a>. The collaboration is described as an "experiment" involving people in the UK specifically, whereby Persona will store user information on their servers for up to seven days. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Always good when your personal data forms part of an "experiment", isn't it? Never mind that Discord <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-promise-they-wont-force-everybody-to-do-a-face-scan-following-outrage-at-new-age-verification-policy">assured us earlier</a> that "identity documents submitted to our vendors are deleted quickly--in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." Discord haven't yet said what the "experiment" is supposed to explore or prove. I'm sure it's fine, though. It's not like Thiel joints have a track record of working with any bloodthirsty snoops.
</p>
<p>
Following the announcement of Discord's new age verification policy - already in force in the UK and Australia, with a global rollout beginning in early March - social media users <a href="https://x.com/GiveMeBanHammer/status/2021851054519001133">shared screengrabs</a> of prompts to consent to Persona collecting their data over the weekend. Discord then sought to calm the flames by updating <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">their site FAQ</a> with the below disclaimer:
</p>
<blockquote>"If you're located in the UK, you may be part of an experiment where your information will be processed by an age-assurance vendor, Persona. The information you submit will be temporarily stored for up to 7 days, then deleted. For ID document verification, all details are blurred except your photo and date of birth, so only what's truly needed for age verification is used."</blockquote>
<p>
Many Discord users were already hopping mad about the new "age assurance" system, which involves face scan videos and a machine learning model, and the revelation of Persona's involvement only made them madder, with critical coverage appearing in <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951">Kotaku</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-advises-uk-users-that-they-may-be-part-of-an-experiment-where-instead-of-their-age-verification-data-never-leaving-their-phone-it-will-now-actually-leave-their-phone">Eurogamer</a> and cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">PCGamer</a>. The FAQ disclaimer has now vanished (here's an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260214070331/https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">older version</a> preserved by the Wayback Machine).
</p><p>
As PCGamer note, Persona's lead investors during two recent rounds of venture capital funding were The Founders Fund, who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion">valued them at $1.5 billion</a> in 2021. The Founders Fund were co-founded by Peter Thiel in 2020. Aside from being a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/peter-thiel-lectures-antichrist">well-heeled Doomsday cultist</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">frequent Epstein correspondent</a>, Peter Thiel is one of the moneymen behind omni-payment platform Paypal and, more recently, Palantir, a godawful work of Saruman fan fiction that specialises in using AI for government and military surveillance. 
</p>
<p>
Palantir have, among other things, worked extensively with the USA's Immigration and Customs Enforcement, aka ICE, to track undocumented migrants, amid allegations of human rights breaches that include the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr571qg4m61o">killing of an ICU nurse</a>. The UK government have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/12/nhs-deal-with-ai-firm-palantir-called-into-question-after-officials-concerns-revealed">commissioned</a> Palantir to make a patient database for the NHS, despite much opposition from doctors. I know children aren't responsible for the sins of their parents, but it doesn't seem wholly irrelevant here that Palantir's UK division is headed by Oswald Mosley's grandson.
</p>
<p>
All told, I would prefer not to participate in any identity verification "experiment" bearing Thiel's fingerprints, particularly not one that uses machine learning to check your identity in the background. And this is before we get into Discord's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/07/discord-data-breach-proof-of-age-id-leaked">recent history of privacy breaches involving third parties</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.dmcc.io/journal/2026-bluetooth-privacy-bluehood/">https://blog.dmcc.io/journal/2026-bluetooth-privacy-bluehood/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47035560">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Building Bluehood, a Bluetooth scanner that reveals what information we leak just by having Bluetooth enabled on our devices.</p><section><p>If you’ve read much of this blog, you’ll know I have a <a href="https://blog.dmcc.io/privacy">thing for privacy</a>. Whether it’s <a href="https://blog.dmcc.io/journal/tor-relay-onion-location/">running my blog over Tor</a>, <a href="https://blog.dmcc.io/journal/tailscale-adguard-dns/">blocking ads network-wide with AdGuard</a>, or <a href="https://blog.dmcc.io/journal/proton-pass-cli-linux-secrets/">keeping secrets out of my dotfiles with Proton Pass</a>, I tend to think carefully about what data I’m exposing and to whom.</p><p>Last weekend I built <a href="https://github.com/dannymcc/bluehood">Bluehood</a>, a Bluetooth scanner that tracks nearby devices and analyses their presence patterns. The project was heavily assisted by AI, but the motivation was entirely human: I wanted to understand what information I was leaking just by having Bluetooth enabled.</p><p>The timing felt right. A few days ago, researchers at KU Leuven disclosed <a href="https://whisperpair.eu/">WhisperPair</a> (CVE-2025-36911), a critical vulnerability affecting hundreds of millions of Bluetooth audio devices. The flaw allows attackers to hijack headphones and earbuds remotely, eavesdrop on conversations, and track locations through Google’s Find Hub network. It’s a stark reminder that Bluetooth isn’t the invisible, harmless signal we treat it as.</p><h2 id="the-problem-nobody-talks-about">The Problem Nobody Talks About</h2><p>We’ve normalised the idea that Bluetooth is always on. Phones, laptops, smartwatches, headphones, cars, and even medical devices constantly broadcast their presence. The standard response to privacy concerns is usually “nothing to hide, nothing to fear.”</p><p>But here’s the thing: even if you have nothing to hide, you’re still giving away information you probably don’t intend to.</p><p>From my home office, running Bluehood in passive mode (just listening, never connecting), I could detect:</p><ul><li>When delivery vehicles arrived, and whether it was the same driver each time</li><li>The daily patterns of my neighbours based on their phones and wearables</li><li>Which devices consistently appeared together (someone’s phone and smartwatch, for instance)</li><li>The exact times certain people were home, at work, or elsewhere</li></ul><p>None of this required any special equipment. A Raspberry Pi with a Bluetooth adapter would do the job. So would most laptops.</p><h2 id="devices-you-cant-control">Devices You Can’t Control</h2><p>What concerns me most isn’t that people choose to have Bluetooth enabled. It’s that many devices don’t give users the option to disable it.</p><p>Hearing aids are a good example. Modern hearing aids often use Bluetooth Low Energy so audiologists can connect and adjust settings or run diagnostics. Pacemakers and other implanted medical devices sometimes broadcast BLE signals for the same reason. The user can’t simply turn this off.</p><p>Then there are vehicles. Delivery vans, police cars, ambulances, logistics fleets, and trains often have Bluetooth-enabled systems for fleet management, diagnostics, or driver assistance. These broadcast continuously, and the drivers have no control over it.</p><p>Even consumer devices aren’t always straightforward. Many smartwatches need Bluetooth to function at all. GPS collars for pets require it to communicate with the owner’s phone. Some fitness equipment won’t work without it.</p><p>What’s interesting is that some of the most privacy-focused projects actually require Bluetooth to be enabled.</p><p><a href="https://briarproject.org/">Briar</a> is a peer-to-peer messaging app designed for activists and journalists operating in hostile environments. It doesn’t rely on central servers, and when the internet goes down, it can sync messages via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi mesh networks. It’s a genuinely useful tool for maintaining communications during internet blackouts or in areas with heavy surveillance.</p><p><a href="https://bitchat.free/">BitChat</a> takes this even further. It’s a decentralised messaging app that operates entirely over Bluetooth mesh networks—no internet required, no servers, no phone numbers. Each device acts as both client and relay, automatically discovering peers and bouncing messages across multiple hops to extend the network’s reach. The project explicitly targets scenarios like protests, natural disasters, and regions with limited or censored connectivity.</p><p>Both are genuinely excellent projects solving real problems. But to use them, you need Bluetooth enabled. And every device with Bluetooth enabled is broadcasting its presence to anyone nearby who cares to listen.</p><p>This creates a strange tension. Tools designed to protect privacy often require a feature that compromises privacy in other ways.</p><p>People often underestimate what patterns reveal. A bad actor with a Bluetooth scanner doesn’t need to know your name. They just need to observe behaviour over time.</p><p>Consider what someone could learn by monitoring Bluetooth signals in a residential area for a few weeks:</p><ul><li>When is the house typically empty?</li><li>Does someone visit every Thursday afternoon?</li><li>Is there a regular pattern that suggests shift work?</li><li>When do the children come home from school?</li><li>Which homes have the same delivery driver, suggesting similar shopping habits?</li></ul><p>If there’s damage to your property, you could potentially go back through the logs and see which devices were in range at that time. A smartwatch on a dog-walker passing by. A phone in someone’s pocket. A vehicle with fleet tracking.</p><p>These might seem like edge cases, but they illustrate a broader point: we’re constantly leaving digital breadcrumbs we don’t even think about.</p><h2 id="what-bluehood-actually-does">What Bluehood Actually Does</h2><p>Bluehood is a Python application that runs on anything with a Bluetooth adapter. It continuously scans for nearby devices, identifies them by vendor and BLE service UUIDs, and tracks when they appear and disappear.</p><p>The key features:</p><ul><li><strong>Passive scanning</strong>: It only listens. It doesn’t try to connect or interact with any device.</li><li><strong>Device classification</strong>: Phones, audio devices, wearables, vehicles, IoT devices, and more, identified by BLE fingerprints.</li><li><strong>Pattern analysis</strong>: Hourly and daily heatmaps, dwell time tracking, and detection of correlated devices.</li><li><strong>Filtering</strong>: Randomised MAC addresses (used by modern phones for privacy) are detected and hidden from the main view.</li><li><strong>Web dashboard</strong>: A simple interface for monitoring and analysis.</li></ul><p>You can run it in Docker or install it directly. It stores data in SQLite and optionally sends push notifications via <a href="https://ntfy.sh/">ntfy.sh</a> when watched devices arrive or leave.</p><h2 id="running-it">Running It</h2><p>The simplest way to try Bluehood is with Docker:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/dannymcc/bluehood.git
<span>cd</span> bluehood
docker compose up -d
</code></pre></div><p>The dashboard is available at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p><p>If you prefer a manual install:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils python-pip  <span># Arch</span>
sudo apt install bluez python3-pip           <span># Debian/Ubuntu</span>

pip install -e .
sudo bluehood
</code></pre></div><p>Bluetooth scanning needs elevated privileges. You can either run as root, grant capabilities to Python, or use the included systemd service for always-on monitoring.</p><h2 id="the-point-of-all-this">The Point of All This</h2><p>Bluehood isn’t a hacking tool. It’s an educational demonstration of what’s possible with commodity hardware and a bit of patience.</p><p>I built it because I wanted to see for myself what I was broadcasting. The results were sobering. Even with no malicious intent, anyone with basic technical knowledge could learn a lot about my household just by sitting in their car and running a script.</p><p>This isn’t about paranoia. It’s about understanding the trade-offs we make when we leave wireless radios enabled on our devices. For some use cases, Bluetooth is essential. For others, it’s just convenience. Being aware of what you’re exposing is the first step to making informed decisions about which category your devices fall into.</p><p>If you try Bluehood and it makes you think twice about your own Bluetooth habits, it’s done its job.</p><hr><p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/dannymcc/bluehood">GitHub</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You can't open a feed today without having AI boosters fling word salad like "agentic engineering" or "openclaw" into your beautiful but disapproving face. I'm terrible at predicting the future—you should ask me about selling NVIDIA stock in early 2022 some time—but one thing seems abundantly clear at this point.</p>
<p>There's a wonderful Swedish proverb called "elda för kråkorna" (building a fire for the crows) that evokes the futility of someone lighting a nice warm fire indoors and then throwing the doors wide open, inviting the snow and sleet. Are you one of the thousands of developers with dreams of building a little SaaS on the side? Something you've been thinking about for a while, hacking away at on evenings and weekends, dreaming of the day you can have a couple of hundred paying customers giving you $19.99 a month?</p>

<p>Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but that dream's dead. Doornail. Dodo. <em>Parrot</em>.</p>

<p>Every minute you put into that thing, be it your own time or your LLM agent's, is a minute for the crows. Imagine that beautiful but fragile little idea of yours curled up in a freshly-dug pit in your backyard, Claude and Gemini standing over it, chuckling and high-fiving each other.</p>

<p>Listen: every idea you've ever had, every single one, some cocaine-addled sales critter has had too. <em>And they're better than you at SEO</em>.</p>

<p>What's that you're saying? Yours actually works and is higher quality, because you know about things like TTFP and INP and "not putting your Supabase god-token in the client"? Oh, you sweet summer child: I take no pleasure in this but I need to tell you that these things don't matter anymore. Quality is not a metric anyone cares about in 2026. We've all been conditioned to accept <a href="https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2023/02/17/what-to-expect-from-your-framework/" target="_blank">tombstone spinners on first load</a> or purchase flows that straight-up <a href="https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2024/02/28/care/" target="_blank">don't work</a>, and there are walled gardens and tollbooths everywhere you look. React ate the web, Safari kneecapped it, Google stopped linking to it, and none of the Zaibatsu US corporations who hold the cards want you to succeed. The future, if there is a future in software, lies in high-touch enterprise sales. There are a select few companies allowed to make money on the Internet today, and if you have any sense of self-preservation you need to glom onto one of those and hold it like the Dickens. Give up those childish dreams of independence.</p>

<p>If you're a hopeful SaaS builder you may be first in line, but you can at least take grim satisfaction in the fact that the sloptimists, the hype-men, the breathless agents-are-working-while-I-sleep people, they're equally fucked when this all comes home to roost. The marginal value of code today is—well, possibly not zero, since the people selling spades for this frantic gold rush are doing okay for now—but it's dropping like a lead balloon. Josh Collinsworth <a href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/sloptimism" target="_blank">has it right</a>, AI boosterism is a class privilege. But rest assured that this revolution, too, will end up eating its own. They fancy themselves the masters of mighty bot armies, an unstoppable force at their fingertips that will build them a software empire. But nobody will find it, nobody will pay for it, and all those tokens will have been burned for someone else's gain, a sad bonfire offering to the datacenter and GPU crows cawing overhead.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Notes from setting up Prosody in Docker for federated messaging, with file sharing, voice calls, and end-to-end encryption.</p><section><p>About a year ago I <a href="https://blog.dmcc.io/journal/2025_my_privacy_reboot/">moved my personal messaging to Signal</a> as part of a broader push to take ownership of my digital life. That went well. Most of my contacts made the switch, and I’m now at roughly 95% Signal for day-to-day conversations. But Signal is still one company running one service. If they shut down tomorrow or change direction, I’m back to square one.</p><p>XMPP fixes that. It’s federated, meaning your server talks to other XMPP servers automatically and you’re never locked into a single provider. Your messages live on your hardware. The protocol has been around since 1999 and it’s not going anywhere. I’d tried XMPP years ago and bounced off it, but the clients have come a long way since then. <a href="https://monal-im.org/">Monal</a> and <a href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a> are genuinely nice to use now.</p><p>This post covers everything I did to get a fully working XMPP server running with <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a> in Docker, from DNS records through to voice calls.</p><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><ul><li>A server with Docker and Docker Compose</li><li>A domain you control</li><li>TLS certificates (Let’s Encrypt works well)</li></ul><h2 id="dns-records">DNS records</h2><p>XMPP uses SRV records to let clients and other servers find yours. You’ll need these in your DNS:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">_xmpp-client._tcp.xmpp.example.com  SRV  0 5 5222 xmpp.example.com.
_xmpp-server._tcp.xmpp.example.com  SRV  0 5 5269 xmpp.example.com.
</code></pre></div><p>Port 5222 is for client connections, 5269 is for server-to-server federation. You’ll also want an A record pointing <code>xmpp.example.com</code> to your server’s IP.</p><p>If you want HTTP file uploads (I’d recommend it), add a CNAME or A record for <code>upload.xmpp.example.com</code> pointing to the same server. Same for <code>conference.xmpp.example.com</code> if you want group chats with a clean subdomain, though Prosody handles this internally either way.</p><h2 id="tls-certificates">TLS certificates</h2><p>Prosody won’t start without certificates. I use Let’s Encrypt with the Cloudflare DNS challenge so I don’t need to expose port 80:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">docker run --rm <span>\
</span><span></span>  -v ~/docker/xmpp/certs:/etc/letsencrypt <span>\
</span><span></span>  -v ~/docker/xmpp/cloudflare.ini:/etc/cloudflare.ini:ro <span>\

</span><span></span>  --dns-cloudflare <span>\
</span><span></span>  --dns-cloudflare-credentials /etc/cloudflare.ini <span>\
</span><span></span>  -d xmpp.example.com
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>cloudflare.ini</code> file contains your API token:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>dns_cloudflare_api_token</span> <span>=</span> <span>your-cloudflare-api-token</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After certbot runs, fix the permissions so Prosody can read the certs:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">chmod -R <span>755</span> ~/docker/xmpp/certs/live/ ~/docker/xmpp/certs/archive/
chmod <span>644</span> ~/docker/xmpp/certs/archive/xmpp.example.com/*.pem
</code></pre></div><p>Set up a cron to renew monthly:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>0</span> <span>3</span> <span>1</span> * * docker run --rm -v ~/docker/xmpp/certs:/etc/letsencrypt <span>\
</span><span></span>  -v ~/docker/xmpp/cloudflare.ini:/etc/cloudflare.ini:ro <span>\
</span><span></span>  certbot/dns-cloudflare renew <span>\

}
</code></pre></div><p>The ones I found matter most for a good mobile experience: <code>carbons</code> syncs messages across all your devices instead of delivering to whichever one happened to be online. <code>smacks</code> (Stream Management) handles flaky connections gracefully, so messages aren’t lost when your phone briefly drops signal. <code>cloud_notify</code> enables push notifications so mobile clients don’t need a persistent connection, which is essential for battery life. And <code>mam</code> (Message Archive Management) stores history server-side for search and cross-device sync.</p><h3 id="security-settings">Security settings</h3><div><pre><code data-lang="lua">c2s_require_encryption <span>=</span> <span>true</span>

authentication <span>=</span> <span>"internal_hashed"</span>
allow_registration <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
</code></pre></div><p>All connections are encrypted and registration is disabled since I create accounts manually with <code>prosodyctl</code>. I’ve enabled <code>s2s_secure_auth</code>, which means Prosody will reject connections from servers with self-signed or misconfigured certificates. You’ll lose federation with some poorly configured servers, but if you’re self-hosting for privacy reasons it doesn’t make much sense to relax authentication for other people’s mistakes.</p><h3 id="omemo-encryption">OMEMO encryption</h3><p>TLS encrypts connections in transit, but the server itself can still read your messages. If you’re self-hosting, that means you’re trusting yourself, which is fine. But if other people use your server, or if you just want the belt-and-braces approach, OMEMO adds end-to-end encryption so that not even the server operator can read message content.</p><p>OMEMO is built on the same encryption that Signal uses, so I’m comfortable trusting it. There’s nothing to configure on the server side either. OMEMO is handled entirely by the clients. Monal, Conversations, and Gajim all support it, and in most cases it’s enabled by default for new conversations. I’d recommend turning it on for everything and leaving it on.</p><h3 id="message-archive">Message archive</h3><div><pre><code data-lang="lua">archive_expires_after <span>=</span> <span>"1y"</span>
default_archive_policy <span>=</span> <span>true</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Prosody serves HTTP on port 5280 internally. I leave HTTPS to my reverse proxy (Caddy), which handles TLS termination. The <code>http_external_url</code> tells Prosody what URL to hand clients when they upload files.</p><h3 id="virtual-host-and-components">Virtual host and components</h3><div><pre><code data-lang="lua">VirtualHost <span>"xmpp.example.com"</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The MUC (Multi-User Chat) component gives you group chats with message history via <code>muc_mam</code>. I restrict room creation to local users so random federated accounts can’t spin up rooms on my server.</p><p>The file share component handles image and file uploads. A 10 MB limit and 30-day expiry keeps disk usage under control.</p><h2 id="reverse-proxy-for-file-uploads">Reverse proxy for file uploads</h2><p>Prosody’s HTTP port needs to be reachable from the internet for file uploads to work. I use Caddy:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">xmpp.example.com {
    reverse_proxy xmpp:5280
}
</code></pre></div><p>When a client sends an image, Prosody hands it a URL like <code>https://xmpp.example.com/upload/...</code> and the receiving client fetches it over HTTPS.</p><h2 id="creating-accounts">Creating accounts</h2><p>With registration disabled, accounts are created from the command line:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">docker <span>exec</span> -it xmpp prosodyctl adduser danny@xmpp.example.com
</code></pre></div><p>It prompts for a password. Done. Log in from any XMPP client.</p><h2 id="firewall">Firewall</h2><p>Open the XMPP ports:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo ufw allow <span>5222</span> comment <span>'XMPP client'</span>
sudo ufw allow <span>5269</span> comment <span>'XMPP federation'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Port 80/443 for the reverse proxy if you haven’t already. If your server is behind a router, forward 5222 and 5269.</p><h2 id="voice-and-video-calls">Voice and video calls</h2><p>Text and file sharing work at this point. Voice and video calls need one more piece: a TURN/STUN server. Without it, clients behind NAT can’t establish direct media connections.</p><p>I run <a href="https://github.com/coturn/coturn">coturn</a> alongside Prosody. The two share a secret, and Prosody generates temporary credentials for clients automatically.</p><p>Generate a shared secret:</p><p>The coturn <code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>services</span>:<span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>It runs with <code>network_mode: host</code> because TURN needs real network interfaces to handle NAT traversal. Docker’s port mapping breaks this.</p><p>The <code>turnserver.conf</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">listening-port=3478

Push notifications work well. On Android, <a href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a> seems to be the go-to. On desktop, <a href="https://gajim.org/">Gajim</a> covers Linux and Windows, and Monal has a macOS build.</p><p>All of them support OMEMO encryption, file sharing, group chats, and voice/video calls.</p><h2 id="verifying-your-setup">Verifying your setup</h2><p>Prosody has solid built-in diagnostics:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">docker <span>exec</span> xmpp prosodyctl check
</code></pre></div><p>This checks DNS records, TLS certificates, connectivity, and module configuration. Fix anything it flags. The error messages are genuinely helpful.</p><p>The <a href="https://compliance.conversations.im/">XMPP Compliance Tester</a> is worth running too. Mine scored above 90% after getting the config right.</p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2><p>The whole setup runs in two small Docker containers and a reverse proxy entry. Prosody, file uploads, message archive, push notifications, group chats, voice calls.</p><p>I still use Signal for most day-to-day conversations and I’m not planning to stop. But having my own XMPP server means I’m not entirely dependent on any single service. I can message anyone on any XMPP server, not just people who signed up to the same one. It’s a nice fallback to have.</p><p>If you’re already running Docker on a server somewhere, it’s a good weekend project.</p></section></div>]]></description>
