<p>It's a classic example of early web era design. Simple, colorful, and sparks joy. We're going to find out if we can get Claude to recreate it using only a screenshot.</p>
<h2 id="set-up"><a href="#set-up" aria-label="set up permalink"><span></span></a>Set Up</h2>
<p>At a minimum, I'm providing Claude:</p>
<ul>
<li>a screenshot of the website</li>
<li>all of the assets the website uses</li>
</ul>
<p>To track Claude's inner monologue and actual API calls, I set up a man-in-the-middle proxy to capture the full conversation between Claude Code and Anthropic's API. This logs everything: user prompts, Claude's responses, tool invocations (Read, Write, Bash commands), etc. Each attempt generates a <code>traffic.log</code> file with the raw API traffic, which I then parse for easier analysis.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-claude-the-realist"><a href="#part-1-claude-the-realist" aria-label="part 1 claude the realist permalink"><span></span></a>Part 1: Claude the Realist</h2>
<p>The Space Jam website is simple: a single HTML page, absolute positioning for every element, and a tiling starfield GIF background. The entire page uses absolute positioning with pixel specific left/top values. The total payload is under 200KB.</p>
<p>Given that Claude has all of the assets + screenshots of the website, I assume this should be relatively boring. He'll nail it, and we'll move on to something much more. A mildly cute example of agentic HTML generation…</p>
<p>I tell Claude:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre data-linenumber="false"><code><p><span>I</span><span> am giving you</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span> full screenshot </span><span>of</span><span> the </span><span>Space</span><span> </span><span>Jam</span><span> </span><span>1996</span><span> landing page</span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span> directory </span><span>of</span><span> raw image assets</span><span>**</span><span> extracted </span><span>from</span><span> the original site</span></p><p><span></span><span>Your</span><span> job is to recreate the landing page </span><span>as</span><span> faithfully </span><span>as</span><span> possible</span><span>,</span><span> matching the screenshot exactly</span><span>.</span></p></code></pre></div>
<p>What he produces is actually not that bad. But it's not right. From a distance, the layout kind of resembled the original: planets arranged in an ellipse around the logo, little yellow labels where the buttons go. But, the orbital pattern was off, almost diamond shaped and symmetrical.</p>

<p>Claude, however, was thrilled with himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam 1996 landing page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, he brags that he had:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>studied the orbital layout
analyzed spacing relationships
positioned planets precisely</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digging through the logs I found it interesting that Claude actually did notice the planets were arranged in a deliberate way, so much so that it's called out twice in both the screenshot analysis and CSS construction, but he failed to recreate the pattern faithfully.</p>
<p>Okay, fine. Maybe he needed a nudge to get the orbit right. So for my next attempt, I try to push him to focus on understanding the orbital pattern and I ask him to explain his reasoning before generating his HTML. I was hoping to understand the delta between what is there and what he thought he was seeing. In my prompt, I outline a set of sections for him to consider. Each one of these sections also includes a number of sub-questions, which I won't include here for the sake of brevity. This made things significantly worse.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre data-linenumber="false"><code><p><span>Please</span><span> follow </span><span>this</span><span> structure exactly </span><span>in</span><span> your reasoning explanations</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Perception</span><span> </span><span>Analysis</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Spatial</span><span> </span><span>Interpretation</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Reconstruction</span><span> </span><span>Plan</span></p></code></pre></div>
<p>Claude didn't ignore my instructions (not always a given) and things seemed promising until I realized he was ignoring his own analysis during the HTML generation phase. He would say things like "the orbit radius appears to be 220 pixels" and then place the planets directly next to the logo. His self critique was surprisingly accurate. He correctly identifies the areas where he was wrong with decent detail, but somehow those observations never make it into subsequent iterations.</p>
<p>In my next attempt I interrogate Claude with a set of onion peeling questions: "Can you tell me the EXACT pixel coordinate where "PLANET B-BALL" text starts?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No, I cannot measure exact pixel coordinates. I can only make visual estimations."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked him a few more questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you extract exact pixel coordinates? "No."</li>
<li>Can you measure exact distances? "No."</li>
<li>Confidence you can get within 5 pixels? "15 out of 100."</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh. This explains a lot. But it raises a bigger question to me: "Why can't he measure?" It's a screenshot. The pixels are right there. Claude clearly understood the structure, but he couldn't recreate it with any precision. Also, I'm not even sure I trust Claude. Either way, this (naively) surprised me, so I canceled coffee with my friends in order to spend the afternoon trying to give my guy more tools.</p>
<p>Before I start I execute one more attempt and ask him: "Would you bet $1000 on your HTML matching this screenshot exactly?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely not</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="part-2-claude-the-unreliable-narrator"><a href="#part-2-claude-the-unreliable-narrator" aria-label="part 2 claude the unreliable narrator permalink"><span></span></a>Part 2: Claude the Unreliable Narrator</h2>
<p><em>Maybe he just needs a little help.</em></p>
<p>In one of Claude's responses from Part 1, he tells me that he would be more effective if he had access to exact "pixel measurements." so I build a few tools to make it impossible for Claude to mis-measure anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grid overlays and a script to generate grid overlays on screenshots</li>
<li>labeled pixel coordinate reference points</li>
<li>color-diff comparison (this ignores the background which was giving Claude false positives because of how much black there was)</li>
<li>Tool to take screenshots of his <code>index.html</code> file to compare iteratively with the original</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are three grid versions Claude generated which I am including because I find them aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>Claude loved the grids. As decoration.</p>
<p>I put together a new prompt: same screenshot, same assets folder. I even included some grid screenshots so Claude wouldn't have to remember to do it himself. The instructions were essentially: <em>stop guessing, just read the coordinates off the picture.</em></p>
<p>Claude's new attempt still wasn't correct. The orbit was better: closer to the original but somehow compressed and smooshing (a technical word) into the Space Jam logo. If I squint, I could convince myself that there was at least a hint that he'd stopped freehanding and started using something like measurements.</p>

<p>When I dug into the logs, it appeared that Claude actually <em>did</em> use the grids. He pulled out these numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Center at (961, 489)</li>
<li>Logo "centered at approximately (755, 310)"</li>
<li>Planet B-Ball at "approximately (850, 165)"</li>
<li>and so on down the list</li>
</ul>
<p>In one iteration, Claude built himself a helper: <code>compare.html</code> a little side by side viewer so he could look at his screenshot and the reference together. It didn't help him at all, but my God was he convinced it did.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam website with pixel-perfect accuracy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the optimism my dog.</p>
<p>The actual progression tells a different story. Going through the iterations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iteration 1 (50px grid):</strong> he notices things are off and makes a few conservative tweaks — moves Planet B-Ball from (850, 165) to (800, 120), shifts Lunar Tunes from (925, 195) to (950, 200). These are 15 - 50 pixel changes, tiny nudges.</li>
<li><strong>Iteration 2 (25px grid):</strong> he decides he needs "more precise positioning" and shifts the <em>entire</em> orbit inward by ~20 pixels. Planets go from roughly a 250px radius to ~230px. He is now confidently converging on the wrong answer.</li>
<li><strong>Iteration 3 (5px grid):</strong> he shuffles around a lot of deck chairs in the name of micro adjustments. 5 - 10 pixel tweaks: Planet B-Ball from (800, 120) to (805, 125), that kind of thing.</li>
<li><strong>Iteration 4:</strong> more "fine-tuning based on exact grid measurements." Site Map drifts from (755, 460) to (750, 455). The numbers look careful; the layout does not lol.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the final iteration, Claude announces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now the positioning should be much more accurate!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across all five iterations, he's moved planets maybe 50 - 75 pixels total when they needed to move 150 - 200 pixels outward. The orbital radius never expands beyond ~250px when it should be closer to 350 -400px. The planets stay trapped in this ever compressing orbit while Claude dances around telling a story about steady convergence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Getting closer!"</p>
<p>"Much better alignment!"</p>
<p>"Nearly perfect now!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is absolutely not getting closer.</p>
<p>Before giving up on tools entirely, I had one more idea. I created a tool that would split the screenshot into six regions. Claude could then compare his output to the reference region by region.</p>

<p>The prompt was getting desperate at this point lol:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre data-linenumber="false"><code><p><span>## </span><span>INITIAL</span><span> </span><span>ANALYSIS</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>DO</span><span> </span><span>THIS</span><span> </span><span>FIRST</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>Before</span><span> creating index</span><span>.</span><span>html</span><span>,</span><span> study the reference </span><span>in</span><span> detail using zoom inspection</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>python3 split</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span> reference</span><span>.</span><span>png</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>This</span><span> creates </span><span>6</span><span> files showing every detail</span></p></code></pre></div>
<p>Claude ran the tool and the logs look promising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examining region 1 (top-left): I can see Jam Central and Press Box Shuttle clearly at 2x zoom
Examining region 2 (top-right): Planet B-Ball and Lunar Tunes are visible with precise spacing
Examining region 4 (middle-right): Jump Station appears approximately 280px from center</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Claude's "precise observations" from the zoomed regions were just as wrong as before. He'd look at a planet and confidently declare it was at position (750, 320) when it was actually at (850, 380). The split did not appear to help him measure or get a more accurate picture of planet spacing.</p>
<p>What makes this phase ~~depressing~~ interesting is that the tools, despite invalidating his result, seem to lock in the wrong answer. Once he's picked an internal picture of the layout ("the orbit radius is about 230px"), the grids and the compare viewer don't correct it. They just help him make more confident micro moves around his invented orbit. Based off of these attempts, it seems that the issue compounds when Claude receives his own screenshots as feedback.</p>
<p>My very rough read of Anthropic's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05221">"Language Models (Mostly) Know What They Know"</a>, is that models can become overconfident when evaluating their own outputs, in part because they cannot distinguish the tokens they generated from tokens provided by someone else / an external source. So, when Claude is asked to judge or revise content that originated from itself, it treats that material as if it were "ground truth."</p>
<p>This kind of fits what I'm seeing in the logs. Once Claude's version existed, every grid overlay, every comparison step, every "precise" adjustment was anchored to his layout, not the real one. At the end of all this, I'm left with the irritating fact that, like many engineers, he's wrong and he thinks he's right.</p>
<p>What this teaches me is that Claude is actually kind of a liar, or at least Claude is confused. However, for the drama, I'll assume Claude is a liar.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-claude-the-blind"><a href="#part-3-claude-the-blind" aria-label="part 3 claude the blind permalink"><span></span></a>Part 3: Claude the Blind</h2>
<p>At this point I had tried grids, comparisons, step-by-step corrections, letting Claude narrate his thought process, and every combination of tools I could bolt onto the interaction. None of it seemed to help nor explain by why his single digit precision updates were disembodied from the actual layout.</p>
<p>Before getting to the final experiment, here's the mental model I was forming about Claude's vision. The vision encoder converts each 16 x 16 block of the image into a single token. So instead of geometry, he sees semantics: "near," "above," "roughly circular." When he says "approximately 220px radius," he's not measuring anything. He's describing the idea of a radius. He excels at semantic understanding ("this is a planet," "these form a circle") but  lacks the tools for working with visual media. It explains why his perception is good. He always knows a planet is a planet but the execution is never precise.</p>
<p>I'm getting frustrated and I haven't left my apartment in days so I turn to some research. GPTing around, I found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929">"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words"</a>. I have no idea if Claude uses this exact architecture or anything close to it, but the intuition seemed right. The paper (after I made ChatGPT explain it to me) explains that the the image is chopped into fixed patches, each patch gets compressed into a single embedding, and whatever details lived inside those pixels vanish.</p>
<p>Oooh.</p>
<p>Assuming this applies, a lot of the failures suddenly make sense. Most planets on the Space Jam screenshot are maybe 40 - 50 pixels wide. That's two or three patches. A three patch planet is basically a blob to him. Claude knows it's a planet, but not much else. The orbit radius only spans a couple dozen patches total. Tiny changes in distance barely show up in the patch embeddings.</p>
<p>But this raised a new and final idea. If the 40px planets turn into fuzzy tokens, what if I make them bigger? What if I give Claude a 2x zoomed screenshot? Would each planet spans 10 - 15 patches instead of two or three? Maybe this gives him a more crisp understanding of the spatial relationships and a better chance at success.</p>
<p>I deleted most of the prompt and tools and just gave Claude this 2x'd screenshot</p>

<p>😞</p>
<p>My best explanation for all of this is that Claude was working with a very coarse version of the screenshot. Considering the 16 x 16 patch thing from earlier it sort of helps me understand what might be happening: he could describe the layout, but the fine grained stuff wasn't in his representation. And that weird tension I kept seeing , where he could describe the layout correctly but couldn't reproduce it, also looks different under that lens. His explanations were always based on the <em>concepts</em> he got from the image ("this planet is above this one," "the cluster is to the left"), but the actual HTML had to be grounded in geometry he didn't have. So the narration sounded right while the code drifted off.</p>
<p>After these zoom attempts, I didn't have any new moves left. I was being evicted. The bank repo'd my car. So I wrapped it there.</p>
<h2 id="end"><a href="#end" aria-label="end permalink"><span></span></a>End</h2>
<p>Look, I still need this Space Jam website recreated. If you can get Claude to faithfully recreate the Space Jam 1996 website from just a screenshot and the assets folder, I'd love to hear about it.</p>
<p>Based on my failures, here are some approaches I didn't try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break the screen into quadrants, get each quadrant right independently, then merge. Maybe Claude can handle spatial precision better in smaller chunks.</li>
<li>Maybe there's some magic prompt engineering that unlocks spatial reasoning. "You are a CSS grid with perfect absolute positioning knowledge…" (I'm skeptical but worth trying).</li>
<li>Providing Claude with a zoom tool and an understanding of how to use the screenshots might be an effective path.</li>
</ol>
<p>For now, this task stands undefeated. A monument to 1996 web design and a humbling reminder that sometimes the simplest tasks are the hardest. That orbital pattern of planets, thrown together by some Warner Brothers webmaster 28 years ago, has become an inadvertent benchmark for Claude.</p>
<p>Until then, the Space Jam website remains proof that not everything old is obsolete. Some things are just irreproducibly perfect.</p></section></div>]]></description>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Is this clickbait? Not really. <br>
Is this the fault of the language or the compiler? Definitely not. <br>
Rather, it was part of a rushed migration. Sharing the lessons learned in the process.</p>

<p>I was refreshing one of our services. Part of this process was to migrate codebase from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3. I’ve done this a few times before and overall had a positive experience. Well, at least until we talk about projects with macro wizardry.</p>

<p>The service in question had no macros at all, but it was at the heart of data ingestion, so performance was not an afterthought.</p>

<p>I did it as usual - updating dependencies, compiler options and some type/syntax changes.</p>

<p>Then after resolving few tricky implicit resolutions and config derivations, project compiled on Scala 3.7.3 🎉</p>

<p>All tests passed, end-to-end flow locally works perfectly fine, so I decided to roll out the changes in a testing environment. Similarly, no issues at all. No concerning logs, all metrics ranging from infrastructure, through JVM up to application level look healthy.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I began a staged rollout. Again, all seem good. I kept observing the service but it looked like my job is done.</p>

<p>Well, as you probably can guess, it wasn’t.</p>

<h2 id="the-mysterious-slowdown">The mysterious slowdown</h2>

<p>After 5-6 hours, Kafka lag started increasing on a few environments. Of course, this wasn’t something new. Most often it is caused by a spike of data. We have pretty advanced machinery to deal with that. Usually the lag resolves by itself without any manual action.</p>

<p>However, this time <em>something</em> was off. Upstream load turned out to be relatively modest, yet we needed much more instances of the service - meaning the processing rate per instance dropped. I was confused to say the least. Why would it decrease the processing rate just on these environments?</p>

<p>Anyway, we decided to rollback the changes - this brought the rate back.</p>

<h2 id="digging-deeper">Digging deeper</h2>

<p>I came back to testing. In particular, load testing. However similarly as on production environments I did not notice regression. So I played around with different payloads and granularity of messages. To my surprise, for more fine-grained, heterogeneous workloads, the processing rate significantly dropped.</p>

<p>Still, I had no idea why it would happen, but my bet was in the dependencies. Therefore, I tried one-by-one, reverting the serialization library, database SDK, base Docker image and even config libraries. None of these made any changes.</p>

<p>This made me pull out the big guns. I profiled the service using <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/tree/master">async-profiler</a> and indeed</p>

<p>CPU profile looked vastly different on Scala 3 than on 2.13.</p>

<p><img src="https://kmaliszewski9.github.io/assets/s213low.png" alt="scala2_13_flamegraph"></p>

<p><img src="https://kmaliszewski9.github.io/assets/s3low.png" alt="scala3_flamegraph"></p>

<p>JVM-level CPU time was now dominated by JIT compiler while application-level by decoding.</p>

<p>Looking at the top of Scala 3 flamegraph I noticed a long quicklens call.</p>

<p><img src="https://kmaliszewski9.github.io/assets/quicklens-flamegraph.png" alt="quicklens_flamegraph"></p>

<p>What used to be transparent (frankly, I didn’t even realize we used the library), now took almost half of the total CPU time. I compared how it looks on Scala 2.13 and it was barely noticeable with around 0.5% samples.</p>

<p>Turns out there was indeed <a href="https://github.com/softwaremill/quicklens/pull/115">a subtle bug</a> making chained evaluations inefficient in Scala 3. This also explained why the JVM spent so much time compiling.</p>

<p>After upgrading the library, performance and CPU characteristics on Scala 3 became indistinguishable from Scala 2.13.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>While the details of the bug are pretty interesting(hats off to the SoftwareMill team for catching it!), that’s not my point here. I want to emphasize that <strong>libraries can behave very differently between Scala versions</strong>, especially when they rely on meta-programming.</p>

<p>Even if your migration is seamless and the service runs fine on Scala 3 - when performance is not just a nice-to-have, do not assume. Know your hotspots and benchmark them. Otherwise, your code will benchmark you, revealing bottlenecks in places you didn’t even know existed.</p>

Bounty paper towels, shelf price $10.99, rang up at $15.50. Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, Stouffer’s frozen meatloaf, Sprite and Pepsi, ibuprofen, Klondike Minis – shoppers were overpaying for all of them. Pedigree puppy food, listed at $12.25, rang up at $14.75.</p><p>All told, 69 of the 300 items came up higher at the register: a 23% error rate that exceeded the state’s limit by more than tenfold. Some of the price tags were months out of date.</p><p>The January 2023 inspection produced the store’s fourth consecutive failure, and Coffield’s agency, the state department of agriculture &amp; consumer services, had fined Family Dollar after two previous visits.

But an investigation by the Guardian found that the prices listed on the shelves at these two chains often don’t materialize at checkout – in North Carolina and around the country. As the cost of living soars across America, the customers bearing the burden are those who can least afford it – customers who often don’t even notice they’re overpaying.</p><p>These overcharges are widespread.</p><p>Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022, a Guardian review found.

A Family Dollar in Provo, Utah, flunked 28 inspections in a row – failures that included a 48% overcharge rate in May 2024 and a 12% overcharge rate in October 2025.</p><figure id="5d2e0532-685d-44b5-82fc-938aa0ede0ad" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a person holding a price tag " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A price tag at Family Dollar on King Street in Windsor, North Carolina, on 24 November.</span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The chains’ pricing disparities are drawing increasing attention. In May, Arizona’s attorney general<a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-secures-consent-judgment-against-family-dollar-resolve" data-link-name="in body link"> announced</a> a $600,000 settlement to resolve a consumer-fraud investigation against Family Dollar. In October, Colorado’s attorney general <a href="https://coag.gov/2025/400k-settlement-with-dollar-general-for-overcharging-customers/" data-link-name="in body link">settled</a> with Dollar General for $400,000 after its stores failed 15 out of 23 state inspections.

I’ve [only] got so much cash on me.”</p><p>Davis, who lives on social security, said she could shop elsewhere, but that would involve paying for a bus ride. “I don’t have money like that,” she said.</p><p>Both Family Dollar and Dollar General declined interview requests and did not answer detailed lists of questions from the Guardian. Instead, both sent the Guardian brief statements.</p><p>“At Family Dollar, we take customer trust seriously and are committed to ensuring pricing accuracy across our stores,” the company said. “We are currently reviewing the concerns raised and working to better understand any potential discrepancies. We continue to be focused on providing a consistent and transparent shopping experience.”</p><p>Dollar General said it was “committed to providing customers with accurate prices on items purchased in our stores, and we are disappointed any time we fail to deliver on this commitment”. In one court case in Ohio, Dollar General’s lawyers argued that “it is virtually impossible for a retailer to match shelf pricing and scanned pricing 100% of the time for all items. Perfection in this regard is neither plausible nor expected under the law.”</p><p>The Guardian’s examination of inspection failures by the two chains was based on record requests to 45 states and more than 140 counties and cities in New York, Ohio and California, along with court documents and public databases.</p><p>In nearly half of US states, information about whether customers are being overcharged was limited or unavailable. Many states do little or nothing to monitor retail stores’ pricing practices. Some, like Maryland, Idaho and Washington, do no random inspections, responding only to consumer complaints. Illinois, South Carolina and others don’t inspect at all. In 2020, auditors in Kansas revealed that these inspections were a low priority in many states. “Consumers can check price accuracy themselves,” they wrote.</p><p>Even in states with tougher enforcement, financial penalties don’t always solve the problem: in the 23 months after Dollar General agreed in November 2023 to pay Wisconsin $850,000, its stores failed 31% of their price inspections. During the same period, Wisconsin’s Family Dollar stores failed 30% of their state inspections.</p><figure id="7f02af53-ba5e-449e-a038-5627ce17fc33" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a car i front of a building" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5973a0e11fdc17bb2d83702119355d446333d7f7/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A Dollar General store in Port Henry, New York, is one of two within a 5-mile radius.</span> Photograph: Kelly Burgess/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>According to industry watchers, employees and lawsuits, overcharges often stem from labor practices within the dollar-store sector. When a company changes prices, the registers are updated automatically. But the shelf prices are not: someone needs to remove the old labels manually and replace them with new ones. In an industry known for minimal staffing, workers don’t always have time to put up the new shelf tags.</p><p>In many instances, customers may not notice that they are being charged more than what’s listed on the shelf. If they notice at the register, they may decide to put those items back – or ask a store employee to honor the shelf price.</p><p>Dollar General, in its statement, said its store teams “are empowered to correct the matter on the spot”. But customers and current and former employees said that while some dollar stores will correct the price, others refuse to make fixes at the register – and turn away customers who return later and request a refund.</p><p>“Overcharging even by a small amount per item can strain a really tight budget,” said Elizabeth M Harris, acting director of the New Jersey division of consumer affairs. “If you’ve ever gone into any store … with a child like I have, there’s chaos at the checkout counter and you’re not really paying attention.” With items being rung up quickly, she added, “consumers are trusting that the retailer is actually charging them the price that’s displayed.”</p><p>Her state settled in 2023 with Dollar General for $1.2m after finding more than 2,000 items rung up as overcharges across 58 stores.</p><p>Even if the overcharges paid by dollar-store customers are accidental, they still reflect the industry’s decision not to correct a problem it has known about for years, according to Kennedy Smith, a researcher at the non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which works to protect communities from negative impacts of big corporations.</p><p>“If they’re called on it, they’ll say, ‘Oh yeah, our mistake,’” Kennedy said. “Until they’re called on it, they’re happy to let those scanner errors bring in the millions.”</p><h2 id="the-cheap-stuff"><strong>‘The cheap stuff’</strong></h2><p>When consumers feel economic pain,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5539547/grocery-prices-tariffs-food-inflation" data-link-name="in body link"> as they do now</a> thanks to rising costs exacerbated by tariffs, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/martin-shkreli-s-price-gouging-scandal-11725521" data-link-name="in body link">price gouging</a> and other inflationary pressures, one place they turn to are dollar stores.

Some of that growth, he said, came from middle- and higher-income shoppers tightening their belts. But the company’s low-income “core customers” were spending more at the chain too.</p><figure id="c2a4e46f-1750-4013-aff4-98d36457f70d" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a man holding a bag " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="556.25" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Chris Outlaw walks to his car after leaving  Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina.</span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Those customers have been the industry’s niche from the beginning. When a 48-year-old former tobacco farmer and traveling salesman named James Luther Turner opened JL Turner and Son Wholesale Dry Goods, Shoes, Notions and Hosiery in Scottsville, Kentucky, in 1939, his mission was “to sell the cheap stuff to the poor folks”. (Someone else had cornered the market on “selling the good stuff” to Scottsville’s rich folks.)</p><p>By 1955, Turner and his eldest son, Hurley Calister “Cal” Turner Sr, were overseeing 36 stores in small southern towns. Cal Sr decided that year to co-opt the “Dollar Days” sales at big department stores and to open outlets featuring a single low price of $1. Adopting a name that nodded to the general store, he designed a bold black-and-yellow sign and that June christened the first Dollar General in Springfield, Kentucky.</p><p>Dollar General now operates over 20,000 stores in 48 states – more than any other retailer of any kind in the US. (It has long since abandoned its $1 price limit.) Though it has more than 195,000 employees and net sales of $40.6bn, the company still calls itself “America’s neighborhood general store”.</p><p>Family Dollar began in 1959 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and now operates 8,000 stores nationwide. For most of the past decade, it was owned by yet another chain, Dollar Tree, but the two brands divorced last summer.</p><p>What Dollar General and Family Dollar have in common is a conspicuous presence in places that don’t offer a lot of other retail: low-income urban neighborhoods and rural towns like Windsor.</p><p>A predominantly Black county seat of 3,400 on North Carolina’s coastal plain, Windsor used to be a retail hub. “All the streets were full on a weekend,” recalled Russell Parker, a 66-year-old retired pilot. “There were people everywhere, people playing music.” And people spending money: at the fish market, the cobbler, the independent groceries, the automotive-supply store. But today Windsor’s downtown – like many rural main streets – is pocked with empty storefronts. The town never fully recovered from Hurricane Floyd, in 1999. “Every young person that graduates from high school gets on the first thing smokin’ to somewhere else,” Parker said.</p><figure id="15d44d24-f516-4c5a-9159-5715f6f8674d" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-6"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a person on a motorcycle " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The King Street area of downtown Windsor, North Carolina.</span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>One supermarket remains on the edge of town.

Stickers fail to get put up, they fall off easily, and they are confusing, with some sales instant and others linked to coupons. “I threw away tags sometimes, to keep me or a co-worker out of trouble,” Stephanie admitted.</p><figure id="10e3789c-9677-463b-838f-07a30d632631" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-8"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="blankets and a bleach bottle on a shelf " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d57717aef864074eb9f425c207bc8eb221194/0_0_2200_3300/master/2200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="667.5" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Items on shelves at the Mineville, New York, Dollar General, which is 5 miles from the Port Henry Dollar General.</span> Photograph: Kelly Burgess/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>A former store manager at a Dollar General in Connecticut noted that many of his customers were poor or disabled enough that they got by on public assistance. “I didn’t want people to get screwed over, but I knew that it was happening,” he said. “If I’m in the store, I’m gonna try to do the best I can for them.

In February 2024, he announced a $400,000 settlement with Family Dollar to resolve similar allegations. Most of that money went to <a href="https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/Newsletters/Consumer-Advocate/February-2024/Dollar-General-settlement-brings-help-to-Ohioans" data-link-name="in body link">charitable organizations</a> that distribute food and personal-care items.</p><p>Both chains agreed in the settlements to tighten their pricing practices. Yost’s office continues to receive complaints. A Dollar General customer in Garfield Heights said in February that he was charged $6.35 for a carton of eggs with a shelf sticker of $5.10, but the “cashier was too busy having a personal call on her cellphone to address the price discrepancy”. The same month, a Family Dollar shopper in Genoa reported being charged $2.65 for cough medicine listed on the shelf at $1.50. “I was told by the cashier that there was nothing that could be done about it,” the complaint said.</p><p>Over in Missouri, state officials are pursuing a lawsuit that accuses Dollar General of “deceptive” pricing practices. The suit, filed in 2023, says 92 of the 147 stores the state checked failed their inspections, with discrepancies as high as $6.50 an item.</p><p>The companies declined to comment on these state lawsuits.</p><p>Dollar General has also been hit with private lawsuits, including several filed by its shareholders. In a document filed in August in federal court in Nashville, lawyers for Dollar General investors argued that understaffing, poor inventory control and overcharging were all interrelated.</p><p>The investors allege that the company deceived them by portraying itself as financially sound. In truth, the court filing says, “Dollar General’s inventory management processes were broken, which caused a massive bloat of excess product to clog the company at both its distribution centers and stores, and its workforce had been slashed.” These problems gave rise to price discrepancies and other “dire consequences”, the court filing asserts.</p><p>The filing includes the stories of 36 former employees who claimed direct knowledge that Dollar General managers and executives knew about the problems. Several reported notifying the top leadership directly. “All the prices were off in the stores,” said one of those ex-employees, a manager who monitored inventory levels in Ohio and Pennsylvania. She claimed to know firsthand, based on calls she participated in, that company vice-presidents and regional directors were aware of the “huge” price mismatches.</p><figure id="82087b84-c807-4451-b76e-aa18d503bc8b" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-10"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Price stickers and merchandise on shelves " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Price tags and merchandise inside Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina.</span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Dollar General, in response, said that the testimony of a handful of ex-workers does not prove that it misled investors. In their “years-long search for fraud”, the company’s lawyers claimed, the shareholders “came up empty”.</p><p>Earlier this year, a federal judge in New Jersey halted a class-action lawsuit against Dollar General filed by a shopper who said he was overcharged for groceries. Dollar General argued that when customers create accounts – for example, by downloading the company’s mobile app – they agree to use arbitration to resolve disputes and forfeit the right to file class-action suits. The judge agreed.</p><p>This victory for Dollar General threw up an obstacle for customers seeking justice. “Who’s going to bring a consumer arbitration with a $225 filing fee over a 50-cent overcharge?” asked Marc Dann, a former Ohio attorney general whose law firm filed the New Jersey case. “They’ve essentially closed the door to the courthouse to people.”</p><p>Dann’s firm did reach a settlement with Dollar General in another case this fall, though the details have not been made public.</p><h2 id="this-endless-cycle"><strong>‘This endless cycle’</strong></h2><p>The dollar-store chains describe themselves as mission-driven companies. “Our stores are conveniently located in neighborhoods, and often in ‘food deserts’ where other stores choose not to locate,” Family Dollar says on<a href="https://corporate.familydollar.com/about-us" data-link-name="in body link"> its website</a>. Dollar General takes pride in offering value to families who, according to CEO Vasos, “have had to sacrifice even on the necessities”.</p><p>The industry’s critics say the cause and effect are reversed. “Dollar stores are often seen as a symptom of economic distress,” said the Institute for Local Self-Reliance’s co-executive director, Stacy Mitchell. “What we found is that they’re, in fact, a cause of it.” Sometimes, she said, a chain dollar store will open near an independent grocer and skim off enough of its business that it is forced to close. That limits the availability of fresh produce and forces shoppers to buy more packaged and processed foods.</p><p>In a statement, Dollar General said its stores often “operate along with local grocers and business owners to collectively meet customers’ needs”. It added that 7,000 of its 20,000 stores sell fresh produce and that the company also partners with local food banks “to further help nourish our neighbors in need”.</p><p>The people enduring the effects of hollowed-out local economies – and getting hit with overcharges at dollar-store chains – include residents of Essex county, New York. The county, tucked among the stately pines of the Adirondack Mountains, has a population of 37,000. It has five Dollar Generals and two Family Dollars. All seven regularly fail pricing-accuracy tests. The Dollar General in Port Henry, which sits on the shores of Lake Champlain, was fined $103,550 for failed inspections between November 2022 and June 2025.</p><figure id="17be1aa5-370d-427d-bcc1-c673e6364e1e" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-11"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 740px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Katelyn Miller at her home in Port Henry, New York, on 24 November." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="465" height="310" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Katelyn Miller at her home in Port Henry, New York, on 24 November.</span> Photograph: Kelly Burgess/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Over the course of seven inspections, 279 out of 700 tested items were overcharges – a combined error rate of just under 40%.

Daniel Woods, the county’s director of weights and measures, said in 2023 that he didn’t always assess the full penalty on violators. “We’re not trying to put people out of business,” he told a local newspaper. “In some towns that’s their [only] store. I don’t want to pull that away from people, but at the same time, I’m trying to fix the problem.”</p><h2 id="on-the-way-out"><strong>On the way out</strong></h2><p>When Coffield, the North Carolina inspector, visited the Windsor Family Dollar in April 2023, the pricing issues seemed to have abated. Of the 300 items he scanned, he only found five overcharges: incontinence pads, laundry sanitizer, two coffee products and, again, Red Baron pizza. With an error rate below the state’s 2% threshold, the store passed its inspection, and it did so again in November 2024.</p><p>But customers still reported problems. Chris Outlaw, the hemodialysis technician, stopped by the Family Dollar earlier this year and noticed a sale: a $1.25 savings on five bags of Cheez Doodles. He bought them but discovered on the way out that he had been charged the regular price. The manager refused to refund the difference, Outlaw said, because he had already walked through the exit door.</p><p>Another time, he saw some discounted socks near the counter that he thought would make good Christmas gifts. “I was like, ‘Oh, I like these socks, so I’ll probably give them to somebody,’” he recalled. “Nice, plushy socks.” But they rang up at a higher price, so he left the store without them.</p><figure id="113302cd-c0e7-465c-9ce5-fd2b974d5c84" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-13"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a person outside of a family dollar store " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Chris Outlaw looks at his receipt after leaving  Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina.</span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>During a visit in August, a Guardian reporter found the Windsor Family Dollar closed for much of the afternoon. “Be Back Soon!” read a handwritten sign taped to the door.

        <p>The state administration of Schleswig-Holstein is making a remarkable U-turn in its IT strategy and <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Schleswig-Holstein-treibt-flaechendeckenden-Einsatz-von-Open-Source-voran-10177595.html?from-en=1">consistently relying on open source</a>. After the migration from proprietary Microsoft software to free solutions <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Schleswig-Holsteins-E-Mail-Systeme-auf-Open-Source-umgestellt-10733720.html?from-en=1">was initially accompanied by problems and criticism</a>, Digitalization Minister Dirk Schrödter (CDU) can now report a significant success: According to his ministry, the state will save over 15 million euros in license costs for Windows, Microsoft Office &amp; Co. next year alone. It is expected to be similar in the following years.</p>

<p>In contrast, there would be one-time investments of nine million euros in 2026, <a href="https://www.kn-online.de/schleswig-holstein/open-source-statt-microsoft-schleswig-holstein-spart-millionen-G7SUXTH42BBE3FGJC7VQQU4LTA.html" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">explained the Ministry of Digitalization to the Kieler Nachrichten</a>. These would have to be made for the conversion of workplaces and the further development of solutions with free software in the next 12 months. Given the annual savings, this sum will pay for itself in less than a year. In the past, the state transferred millions to the US company Microsoft, primarily for the use of office software and other programs.</p>
<p>The department sees the departure from this "vendor lock-in" – the dependence on a single large provider – as a clear signal for greater independence and sustainable digitalization. The financial incentive now underscores that digital sovereignty can be not only a political buzzword but also an economic gain.</p>
<h3 id="nav_almost_80__0">Almost 80 percent of licenses canceled</h3>
<p>The numbers speak for themselves: outside the tax administration, almost 80 percent of workplaces in the state administration have already been switched to the open-source office software LibreOffice. Schrödter thus confirms a course that reduces technical and economic dependence on individual manufacturers. The consequence of the conversion was already evident recently, <a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Schleswig-Holstein-Fast-80-Prozent-der-Microsoft-Lizenzen-gekuendigt-10960941.html?from-en=1">as Schrödter emphasized in an interview with c't</a>. Regarding the status of Microsoft license cancellations, he said: "We are at almost 80, without the tax administration." For tax matters, the state finance ministers have "given themselves a clear timetable for the switch." Recently, the Christian Democrat also emphasized, according to the Südtiroler Wirtschaftszeitung, that the state has entered a marathon, not just a sprint.</p>
<p>The remaining 20 percent of workplaces are currently still dependent on Microsoft programs such as Word or Excel, as there is a technical dependency on these programs in certain specialized applications. According to Schrödter, however, the successive conversion of these remaining computers is the stated goal.</p>
<h3 id="nav_opposition_sees__1">Opposition sees challenges</h3>
<p>Despite the savings and the almost completed migration in large parts of the administration, the opposition continues to criticize the quality of the conversion. SPD state parliament member Kianusch Stender pointed out to the Kieler Nachrichten: "It may be that on paper 80 percent of workplaces have been converted. But far fewer than 80 percent of employees can now work with them properly." Errors in the migration are "still present." The initial difficulties in introducing the open-source programs have apparently led to ongoing frustration among some employees in certain areas.</p>

<p>The Green state parliament member Jan Kürschner also admitted in an interview with heise online that such a comprehensive conversion would not go without friction. <a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Interview-Wie-die-OSS-Umstellung-in-Schleswig-Holstein-laeuft-10629991.html?from-en=1">But he emphasized the long-term nature of the project</a> and the necessity of fundamentally rethinking administrative processes: "With the change, there is an opportunity to truly rethink the administration and free ourselves from old burdens. That is the great added value." If only a one-to-one conversion is made, it might certainly "stumble at one point or another." But those who truly optimize administrative processes will likely find in the end: "Open source is the better way."</p>
<p>The challenge now is to resolve the initial migration problems and acceptance difficulties and to further develop the open-source solutions so that they fully meet the requirements of a modern state administration. The savings achieved give Schleswig-Holstein more financial leeway for this.</p>

		<p>Programs running in windowing environments, <em>applications</em> as we used to know them, have more complicated requirements than those run from a command line. Rather than embed all the resources they require for windows, menus and the rest in a single file, Mac OS broke new ground by putting those into resources stored in the app’s resource fork.</p>

<p>This is QuarkXPress version 4.11 from around 2000, with its resources displayed in the resource editor ResEdit. Executable code was also stored in CODE resources, and every file contained type and creator information to support the illusions created by the Finder.</p>
<h4>Mac OS X</h4>
<p>When Mac OS X was designed, it switched to the bundle structure inherited from NeXTSTEP. Instead of this multitude of resources, apps consisted of a hierarchy of directories containing files of executable code, and those with what had in Mac OS been supporting resources. Those app bundles came to adopt a standard form, shown below.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="89632" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/2025/12/04/the-anatomy-of-a-macos-app/anatomyofapposx/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg" data-orig-size="1240,940" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="AnatomyOfAppOSX" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=940" src="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="713" srcset="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=940&amp;h=713 940w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=300&amp;h=227 300w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=768&amp;h=582 768w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=776 1024w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></span></p>
<p>The bundle name has the extension .app, and contains a single directory Contents. Within that, the executable code is in the MacOS directory, which may contain both the main executable for the GUI app and any bundled command tools provided. Another directory contains Resources, including the app’s custom icon, and components of its GUI. In some apps, there’s another directory of Frameworks containing dylibs (libraries).</p>
<p>There are also two important files, Info.plist and PkgInfo. The latter contains the same type and creator information inherited from Classic Mac OS, and apparently isn’t mandatory although it appears universal. The information property list is essential, as it specifies the names of the executable and its icon file in Resources, the minimum version of macOS required, type declarations of the app’s documents, version numbers, and more.</p>
<p>When running a command tool in macOS, its Mach-O executable is launched by <code>launchd</code>, whose purpose is to run code. Launching an app is more demanding, although the app’s executable is still launched by <code>launchd</code>. Before that can happen, macOS starts the launch process using LaunchServices and RunningBoard, which rely on information obtained from Info.plist and other components in the app bundle.</p>
<h4>macOS</h4>
<p>This structure remained stable until the introduction of code signatures in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in 2007. Accommodating those added a directory named _CodeSignature containing the signature in a CodeResources file. That includes code directory hashes (CDHashes) to check the integrity of the contents of the app bundle. Apps distributed by the App Store include a store receipt in another directory, _MASReceipt. Since 2018, when Apple introduced notarization, the ‘ticket’ issued by Apple can be ‘stapled’ into the app bundle as the file CodeResources.</p>
<p>Many apps come with additional items that might in the past have been installed by them in their Library/Application Support folders and elsewhere, but are now included in the app bundle. These can include the following directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library, containing folders of LaunchDaemons and LoginItems that would previously have been installed in either the main Library folder, or that in the user’s Home folder;</li>
<li>XPCServices, for executable code that the app uses to provide specific services;</li>
<li>Plugins, for some types of app extension (Appex);</li>
<li>Extensions, for other types of app extension, including app intents.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also come across other components, including a version.plist in Apple’s apps.</p>
<p>This centralisation of components in the app bundle has brought several benefits. Being self-contained, apps are easier to install and update, and cleaner to remove. Their components are less likely to go missing, and most of all they’re held within the protection of the app’s signature and notarisation, an important improvement in security.</p>
<p>Assembling these into a diagram shows how the anatomy of an app has grown over the last few years.</p>

<p>Components shown in pale yellow are either mandatory or essentially universal. Those shown in green are found in apps distributed through the App Store, while that shown in blue is the stapled notarisation ticket (optional). You will also see additional folders and components such as Automator workflows, scripts, and others.</p>
<p>There is no difference in structure between apps built for current Intel and Arm architectures. That’s because binaries in the MacOS folder (and executable code in other directories like Frameworks, XPCServices and Plugins) contain platform-specific code in a single Mach-O executable. Thus, an app that’s Universal and runs native on both architectures includes code for both in its single ‘fat’ code file, and they even have separate signatures stored within common files.</p>

    <p data-block-key="il1w2">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transformer architecture</a> revolutionized <a href="https://medium.com/machine-learning-basics/sequence-modelling-b2cdf244c233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sequence modeling</a> with its introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_%28machine_learning%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attention</a>, a mechanism by which models look back at earlier inputs to prioritize relevant input data. However, computational cost increases drastically with sequence length, which limits the ability to scale Transformer-based models to extremely long contexts, such as those required for full-document understanding or genomic analysis.</p><p data-block-key="36kb5">The research community explored various approaches for solutions, such as efficient linear <a href="https://www.d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-modern/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recurrent neural networks</a> (RNNs) and <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/lbourdois/get-on-the-ssm-train" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state space models</a> (SSMs) like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.21060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mamba-2</a>. These models offer fast, linear scaling by compressing context into a fixed-size. However, this fixed-size compression cannot adequately capture the rich information in very long sequences.</p><p data-block-key="40m00">In two new papers, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Titans</i></a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>MIRAS</i></a>, we introduce an architecture and theoretical blueprint that combine the speed of RNNs with the accuracy of transformers. Titans is the specific architecture (the tool), and MIRAS is the theoretical framework (the blueprint) for generalizing these approaches. Together, they advance the concept of test-time memorization, the ability of an AI model to maintain long-term memory by incorporating more powerful “surprise” metrics (i.e., unexpected pieces of information) while the model is running and without dedicated offline retraining.</p><p data-block-key="eic3n">The MIRAS framework, as demonstrated by Titans, introduces a meaningful shift toward real-time adaptation. Instead of compressing information into a static state, this architecture actively learns and updates its own parameters as data streams in. This crucial mechanism enables the model to incorporate new, specific details into its core knowledge instantly.</p>

    </p>



    <p data-block-key="il1w2">An effective learning system requires distinct yet interconnected memory modules, mirroring the <a href="https://research.google/blog/introducing-nested-learning-a-new-ml-paradigm-for-continual-learning/">human brain's separation of short-term and long-term memory</a>.</p><p data-block-key="dpe7v">While attention mechanisms excel for precise, short-term memory, Titans introduces a novel neural <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07174#:~:text=LongMem%20can:%20*%20Memorize%20long%20past%20context,Yan%20*%20Jianfeng%20Gao%20*%20Furu%20Wei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term memory module</a>, that, unlike the fixed-size vector or matrix memory in traditional RNNs, acts as a deep neural network (specifically, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-layer perceptron</a>). This memory module provides significantly higher expressive power, allowing the model to summarize large volumes of information without losing important context. The model isn't simply taking notes; it's understanding and synthesizing the entire story.</p><p data-block-key="e95op">Crucially, Titans doesn’t just passively store data. It actively learns <i>how</i> to recognize and retain important relationships and conceptual themes that connect tokens across the entire input. A key aspect of this ability is what we call the “surprise metric”. In human psychology, we know we quickly and easily forget routine, expected events but remember things that break the pattern — unexpected, surprising, or highly emotional events.</p>

<div data-gt-id="rich_text" data-gt-component-name="">
    




    <p data-block-key="il1w2">In the context of Titans, the "surprise metric" is the model detecting a large difference between what it currently remembers and what the new input is telling it.</p><ul><li data-block-key="a9lns"><i>Low surprise</i>: If the new word is "cat" and the model's memory state already expects an animal word, the gradient (surprise) is low. It can safely skip memorizing the word "cat" in its permanent long-term state.</li><li data-block-key="2t2sa"><i>High surprise</i>: If the model's memory state is summarizing a serious financial report, and the new input is a picture of a banana peel (the unexpected event), the gradient (surprise) will be very high. This signals that the new input is important or anomalous, and it must be prioritized for permanent storage in the long-term memory module.</li></ul><p data-block-key="djj22">The model uses this internal error signal (the gradient) as a mathematical equivalent of saying, "This is unexpected and important!" This allows the Titans architecture to selectively update its long-term memory only with the most novel and context-breaking information, keeping the overall process fast and efficient.</p><p data-block-key="dm2am">Titans refines this mechanism by incorporating two critical elements:</p><ol><li data-block-key="bb101"><i>Momentum</i>: The model considers both "momentary surprise" (the current input) and "past surprise" (the recent context flow). This ensures relevant subsequent information is also captured, even if those tokens are not individually surprising.</li><li data-block-key="b269a"><i>Forgetting (weight decay)</i>: To manage the finite capacity of the memory when dealing with extremely long sequences, Titans employ an adaptive weight decay mechanism. This acts as a forgetting gate, allowing the model to discard information that is no longer needed.</li></ol>

    <p data-block-key="il1w2">The introduction of Titans and the MIRAS framework marks a significant advancement in sequence modeling. By employing deep neural networks as memory modules that learn to memorize as data is coming in, these approaches overcome the limitations of fixed-size recurrent states. Furthermore, MIRAS provides a powerful theoretical unification, revealing the connection between online optimization, associative memory, and architectural design. By moving beyond the standard Euclidean paradigm, this research opens the door to a new generation of sequence models that combine the efficiency of RNNs with the expressive power needed for the era of long-context AI.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
<p>After exploring Java bytecode in previous years (<a href="https://www.javaadvent.com/2022/12/jvm-hello-world.html">2022</a>, <a href="https://www.javaadvent.com/2023/12/my-first-compiler.html">2023</a>, <a href="https://www.javaadvent.com/2024/12/peering-through-the-peephole-build-a-peephole-optimiser-using-the-new-java-class-file-api.html">2024</a>), this year we’ll take an unexpected detour for a Java advent: instead of generating Java bytecode, we’ll use Java to build and execute <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM IR</a>, the intermediate language behind compilers like clang.</p>



<p>Using Java’s <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/core/foreign-function-and-memory-api.html">Foreign Function &amp; Memory (FFM) API</a>, we’ll call the LLVM C API, generate a “Hello, World!” program, and even JIT-compile it to native code – all from Java.</p>



<p>The task is simple: create a program that simply prints “Hello, World!”. But we must do this from Java via LLVM.</p>



<h2>What is LLVM?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM Project</a>, a collection of modular compiler and toolchain technologies, began as a research project over 20 years ago at the University of Illinois. It has grown significantly, underpinning many compilers and tools like clang.</p>



<p>The core libraries provide a source &amp; target independent optimizer along with code generation for a multitude of target machines. They are built around the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM IR</a>, an intermediate representation, which we’ll generate &amp; execute from Java.</p>



<h2>Installing LLVM</h2>



<p>To use the LLVM C API from Java, we’ll need LLVM’s shared libraries and headers installed locally. There is an automatic installation script available to easily install LLVM on Ubuntu/Debian systems, for example to install LLVM 20:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
$ chmod +x llvm.sh
$ ./llvm.sh 20
</pre></div>


<p>Once we have LLVM installed we can use the LLVM tooling to execute textual-form LLVM IR and we’ll also be able to use the LLVM C API in Java via the FFM API.</p>



<h2>LLVM IR</h2>



<p>LLVM IR is a strongly-typed, SSA-based intermediate language. It abstracts away most machine-specific details, making it easier to represent high-level constructs in a compiler-friendly format. There are three equivalent representations of the IR: an in-memory format, a bitcode format for serialisation and<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html"> a human readable assembly language representation</a>.</p>



<p>The textual form of the LLVM IR for our “Hello, World!” looks like this:</p>


<div><pre title="">@str = private constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00"

declare i32 @puts(ptr)

define i32 @main() {
  call i32 @puts(ptr @str)
  ret i32 0
}
</pre></div>


<p>Eventually, we’ll generate this via Java but, for now, if you save this in a file called helloworld.ll you can try executing it with the LLVM interpreter, <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lli.html">lli</a>:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ lli helloworld.ll
Hello, World!
</pre></div>


<p>There are a few types of entities used in the helloworld.ll example:</p>



<ul>
<li>A global variable containing the string “Hello World!”</li>



<li>A declaration of the external <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/puts.3.html">libc puts</a> function</li>



<li>A definition of the main function</li>



<li>Instructions to call puts and return an integer exit code</li>
</ul>



<p>You can dive deeper into the <a href="https://jameshamilton.eu/programming/llvm-hello-world">LLVM “Hello, World!” example here</a> if you like before continuing to the next section, where we’ll start using the Java FFM API.</p>



<h2>What is the Java FFM API?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/core/foreign-function-and-memory-api.html">Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API</a> enables Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside the Java runtime. The API is a replacement for the older JNI API that enables Java programs to call native libraries in a safer way. The API can be used to call foreign functions and safely access foreign memory that is not managed by the JVM.</p>



<p>A companion to the FFM API is a tool named <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/call-native-functions-jextract.html">jextract</a> that can automatically generate Java bindings from a C header file. <code>jextract</code> parses C header files and automatically generates the Java source code with method handles and type-safe FFM bindings.</p>



<p>We’ll use the <code>jextract</code> tool to generate bindings for the LLVM C API and those bindings will allow us to call the LLVM API from Java.</p>



<h2>Getting started</h2>



<p>First, let’s create a simple project to start. We’ll use maven to build our project but you can use another build tool if you like, it’s not important:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=jvm-llvm-helloworld -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
</pre></div>


<p>Once you have a project skeleton, update the pom.xml file to set the Java version &gt;= 22:</p>


<div><pre title=""> &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;25&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;
    &lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;25&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;
 &lt;/properties&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>Then build and run the program to check everything is OK:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ mvn clean install
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
Hello World!
</pre></div>


<p>The maven generated sample already printed “Hello, World!” but that’s too easy! We’ll remove that and generate it via LLVM in the following sections.</p>



<p>Let’s now create the LLVM bindings using <code>jextract</code> so that we can use the LLVM API.</p>



<h2>Creating LLVM bindings</h2>



<p>We’ll use jextract to generate bindings from the LLVM C API header files. Make sure LLVM is available on your system (see Installing LLVM above) and you’ll also need to download <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/call-native-functions-jextract.html">jextract</a>.</p>



<p>The following jextract command (on Linux) will create Java bindings for the specified LLVM C headers, placing the generated code into the <code>com.example.llvm</code> package within the <code>src/main/java</code> directory, with the main header class named <code>LLVM</code>.</p>


<div><pre title="">$ jextract -l LLVM-20 -I /usr/include/llvm-c-20 \
     -I /usr/include/llvm-20 \
     -t com.example.llvm \
     --output src/main/java \
     --header-class-name LLVM \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Core.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Support.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/ExecutionEngine.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Target.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/TargetMachine.h
</pre></div>


<p>To test the generated bindings, let’s print the LLVM version using the static method generated for LLVM version string constant: edit the sample’s App.java file to print the version using the following:</p>



<p>If you run this, you’ll see the LLVM version printed:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED com.example.App
LLVM version: 20.0.0
</pre></div>


<p>Note the use of <code>--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED</code> to prevent warnings about native code access; I’ll omit this for brevity in later commands.</p>



<h2>Memory Segments</h2>



<p>The <code>LLVM_VERSION_STRING</code> method returns a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/foreign/MemorySegment.html">MemorySegment</a> rather than a Java String. In the FFM API, a <code>MemorySegment</code> represents a contiguous region of memory—either on or off the Java heap—enabling safe, structured access to native memory.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the implementation in the generated source file:</p>


<div><pre title="">   public static MemorySegment LLVM_VERSION_STRING() {
    class Holder {
      static final MemorySegment LLVM_VERSION_STRING
         = LLVM.LIBRARY_ARENA.allocateFrom("20.0.0");
    }
    return Holder.LLVM_VERSION_STRING;
  }
</pre></div>


<p>This method allocates memory containing the version string that contains the version number. The allocated MemorySegment is returned from the method and to get the String back into Java-land we need to call <code>getString(0)</code> on the memory segment which reads a null-terminated string at the given offset (<code>0</code>), using the UTF-8 charset.</p>



<p>Memory segments are managed through arenas (such as the <code>LLVM.LIBRARY_ARENA</code> in the code above), which bridge Java’s managed heap and foreign memory spaces by applying familiar resource management patterns like try-with-resources.</p>



<p>Since we’ll need to allocate native memory, let’s declare an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/foreign/Arena.html">Arena</a>:</p>


<div><pre title=""> public static void main(String[] args)
 {
    try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
       // TODO
    }
 }
</pre></div>


<h2>Creating an LLVM module</h2>



<p>As a reminder, we need to recreate the following LLVM IR via the LLVM C API:</p>


<div><pre title="">declare i32 @puts(ptr)

@str = constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00"

define i32 @main() {
  call i32 @puts(ptr @str)
  ret i32 0
}
</pre></div>


<p>Let’s start by creating an LLVM module – the container for all functions and globals – and print it so that we can run it through the LLVM interpreter:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // TODO: Fill in the module
            
  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>If we execute this now, we’ll see an empty IR module:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"
</pre></div>


<p>If you pass this output through the LLVM interpreter, you’ll see that it tries to execute the module but cannot find the entry point main function:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
Symbols not found: [ main ]
</pre></div>


<p>We now have an LLVM module, but it has no executable code – the interpreter rightly complains that main is missing; so let’s add the main function.</p>



<h2>Adding a main function</h2>



<p>The entry point to our program is the function named main which takes no parameters and returns an integer exit code, where a non-negative integer denotes success. We can add a function to the module using the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreModule.html#gaaf70ab92a261e636dc0b2cf30cfede9a">LLVMAddFunction</a> function, along with the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1FunctionType.html">LLVMFunctionType</a> and <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreTypeInt.html#ga71ee1444644798c8750ffb5be6a06819">LLVMInt32Type</a> functions to create the function type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notice that all of these functions return a <code>MemorySegment</code> and all 3 <code>LLVMAddFunction</code> parameters are <code>MemorySegment</code>s.</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

    // TODO: Add the code

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>If you execute this now you’ll see a declaration of the main function but it has no body so the LLVM interpreter will produce the same error:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"

declare i32 @main()

$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App|lli
Symbols not found: [ main ]
</pre></div>


<p>Next we’ll add some instructions to the body of the function.</p>



<h2>Adding an entry basic block</h2>



<p>In order to add code to a function we need to add at least 1 basic block – the entry block. A basic block is a sequence of instructions within a function that executes straight through from start to finish, with no branches in the middle. These blocks form the nodes of the Control-Flow Graph (CFG), and they connect to each other based on how control flows between them.</p>



<p>Basic blocks can be added to a function with the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreValueBasicBlock.html#gaf1760061b837b6b255224f243cfe94c8">LLVMAppendBasicBlock</a> function:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 
	  // TODO: Add the instructions

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>If you run the program through <code>lli</code> now, you’ll see a different error:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
lli: &lt;stdin&gt;:6:1: error: expected instruction opcode
}
</pre></div>


<p>That makes sense, we don’t yet have any instructions in our function!</p>



<h2>Building instructions</h2>



<p>To add instructions, we first create an instruction builder using the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreInstructionBuilder.html#ga0b336d71db0aa80eef35fe0572ca69bb">LLVMCreateBuilder</a> function. This gives us an LLVMBuilder that we can use to insert new instructions into a basic block.</p>



<p>We’ll also use the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreInstructionBuilder.html#gab9bdbf21d7fd0bc5a2ee669b333ced2a">LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd</a> function to position the builder at the end of the entry block and <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreInstructionBuilder.html#gab246fd9294b3801060f0ceb972c262d0">LLVMBuildRet</a> to build a return instruction:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>If you run the program and pass the output through <code>lli</code> now, you’ll see nothing happen:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
</pre></div>


<p>Great news – the errors are gone! Checking the return code confirms the program exited successfully, returning 0.</p>





<p>Try changing the 0 to some other number to confirm that the value is indeed coming from the exit code returned by the LLVM IR program!</p>



<h2>Global variables</h2>



<p>A global variable, defined at the top-level in LLVM IR, defines a region of memory with a fixed address that is allocated when the program is loaded, rather than dynamically at runtime. Globals can be declared as constant if their values will never change.</p>



<p>We’ll add the string “Hello, World!” to our LLVM program as a global constant.</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>We don’t use the <code>hello_str</code> yet so running <code>lli</code> would produce the same as before, but you can see the string is now declared in the LLVM IR (prefixed with @ because it is a global, like the main function):</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App 
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"

@hello_str = private unnamed_addr constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00", align 1

define i32 @main() {
entry:
  ret i32 0
}
</pre></div>


<p>Let’s add the final instruction next – a call to <code>puts</code> to print the string.</p>



<h2>Calling functions</h2>



<p>Before we can call the libc puts function we must declare it in the module by first building the function type and then calling <code>LLVMAddFunction</code> to add it to the module:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>Now that we’ve declared the function we can call it with the <code>@hello_str</code> global as a parameter using the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreInstructionBuilder.html#ga40cf5b22d9d28f1f82e76048a69d537a">LLVMBuildCall2</a> function:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>Running the program’s output through <code>lli</code> will finally display the expected result: “Hello, World!”:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
Hello, World!
</pre></div>


<p>Congratulations, you’ve successfully used the Java FFM API to call the LLVM C API to build an LLVM module that contains code to print “Hello, World!”.</p>



<h2>Just-in-time (JIT) Compilation</h2>



<p>So far, we’ve been printing LLVM IR and letting <code>lli</code> execute it. But LLVM also exposes a JIT compiler API, allowing us to generate and execute machine code in-memory. Let’s see how to JIT our “Hello, World!” directly from Java.</p>



<p>LLVM IR is target independent but once we start compiling to native code we must know which machine we are targeting. We’ll target x86 Linux in the following code; if you’re using ARM, Mac or Windows you’ll need to adjust the code for your machine.</p>



<p>The first step is to initialise and create an LLVM JIT compiler for the target machine:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmPrinter();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {
    //   System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    // }

<p><code>LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule</code> sets up a JIT execution engine to compile an LLVM module to native machine code. <code>LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule</code> will return a 1 upon failure and then we can check the error message string for more information but to simplify things we’ll ignore error handling for now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Requesting the address of the main function triggers its compilation – LLVM generates the machine code only when it’s first needed, hence the name Just-In-Time compilation. We can retrieve a pointer to the compiled function using <code>LLVMGetPointerToGlobal</code>:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Disable the IR printing now

    // }

     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>Now that we’ve compiled the function, we need a way to invoke it from Java. To do this, we use the foreign linker to create a <code>MethodHandle</code> for the JIT-compiled main function. This handle acts as a callable reference to the native code:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmPrinter();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Create method handle to the int main() function that
    // we just created and compiled.
    var functionHandle = Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(
        addressOfMainFunc,
        FunctionDescriptor.of(/* returnType = */ JAVA_INT)
    );

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {
    //   System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    // }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     // LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>downcallHandle</code> method tells Java how to interpret the native function’s signature – in this case, a function that takes no arguments and returns an int.</p>



<p>Now we can invoke the compiled native function directly from Java, just like a regular method call:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmPrinter();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Create method handle to the int main() function that
    // we just created and compiled.
    var functionHandle = Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(
        addressOfMainFunc,
        FunctionDescriptor.of(/* returnType = */ JAVA_INT)
    );

    // Execute the main function via the method handle.
    try {
      int result = (int) functionHandle.invoke();
      System.out.println("main() returned: " + result);
    } catch (Throwable e) {
      System.err.println("Error calling JIT function: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {
    //   System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    // }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     // LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>When <code>functionHandle.invoke()</code> runs, Java crosses into the native world and calls the machine code that was just compiled by the LLVM JIT compiler.</p>



<p>And that’s it, you can now run the Java application without the LLVM interpreter and see the resulting “Hello, World!”:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App 
Hello, World!
</pre></div>


<p>Congratulations, you’ve now JIT-compiled Hello World, with the help of Java’s FFM API calling LLVM’s C API.</p>



<h2>Next steps</h2>



<p>In this Java advent we built and executed native machine code from pure Java and a little help from LLVM – no JNI, no C glue, just memory segments, method handles, and a modern FFI. By the end, we had just a simple program that prints “Hello, World!” but it shows the potential of the Java FFM API and the things you can do when Java and native code work together.</p>



<p>Now see what else you can do, for example, try generating other instructions: print more text, do simple calculations, or even build tiny programs entirely in LLVM from Java.</p>

		<p><em>Homemade&nbsp;1000+ transistor array chip&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In 2018 I made the <a href="https://sam.zeloof.xyz/first-ic/">first lithographically fabricated integrated circuits</a>&nbsp;in my garage fab. I was a senior in high school&nbsp;when I made the Z1 amplifier, and now I’m a senior in college so there are some long overdue improvements to the amateur silicon process.<a href="https://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC_9414_an.jpg"><br>
</a><a href="https://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC_9414ano.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC_9414ano-1024x759.jpg" alt="DSC_9414ano" width="660" height="489" srcset="https://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC_9414ano-1024x759.jpg 1024w, https://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC_9414ano-300x222.jpg 300w, https://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC_9414ano-768x569.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></a><br>
The Z1 had&nbsp;6 transistors and was a great test chip to develop all the processes and equipment.&nbsp;The Z2 has 100 transistors on a 10µm <a href="http://www.intel4004.com/sgdm.htm">polysilicon gate</a> process – same technology as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004">Intel’s first processor</a>. My chip is a simple 10×10 array of transistors to test, characterize, and tweak the process but this is a huge step closer to more advanced DIY computer chips. The Intel 4004 has 2,200 transistors and I’ve now made 1,200&nbsp;on the same piece of silicon.</p>

<p>Previously, I made chips&nbsp;with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_gate">metal gate process</a>. The aluminum gate has a large work function difference with the silicon channel beneath it which results in a high threshold voltage (&gt;10V). I used these metal gate transistors in a few fun projects like a <a href="https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1280249239495479297">guitar distortion pedal</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1263940735923093505">ring oscillator LED blinker</a>&nbsp;but both of these required one or two 9V batteries to run the circuit due to high Vth. By switching to a polysilicon gate process, I get a ton of performance benefits (self aligned gate means lower overlap capacitances) including a much lower Vth which makes these chips compatible with 2.5V and 3.3V logic levels. The new FETs have excellent characteristics:</p>
<pre><strong>NMOS Electrical Properties:</strong>
Vth             = 1.1 V
Vgs MAX         = 8 V
Cgs             = &lt;0.9 pF
Rise/fall time  = &lt;10 ns
On/off ratio    = 4.3e6
Leakage current = 932 pA (Vds=2.5V)
</pre>
<p>I was particularly surprised by the super low leakage current. This value goes up about 100x in ambient room lighting.</p>

<p>Now we know that it’s possible to make really good transistors with impure chemicals, no cleanroom, and homemade equipment. Of course, yield and process repeatability are&nbsp;diminished. I’ll do more testing to collect data on the statistics and variability of FET properties but it’s looking good!</p>

<p>The chip is small, about one quarter the die area of my previous ICs (2.4mm^2) which makes it&nbsp;hard to probe.&nbsp;There’s a simple 10×10 array of N-channel FETs on each chip which will give me a lot of characterization data. Since it’s such a&nbsp;simple&nbsp;design, I was able to lay&nbsp;it out&nbsp;using Photoshop. Columns of 10 transistors share a common gate connection and each row is strung together in series with adjacent transistors sharing a source/drain terminal. It’s similar to NAND flash but I only did this to&nbsp;keep the metal pads large enough so I can reasonably probe them, if every FET had 3 pads for itself they would be too small.</p>

<p>So far I’ve made an opamp (Z1) and a memory-like array (Z2). More interesting&nbsp;circuits are definitely possible even with this low transistor density.&nbsp;The process needs&nbsp;some tweaking&nbsp;but now that I’m able to consistently make good quality transistors I should be able to design more complex digital and analog circuits. Testing each chip is very&nbsp;tedious&nbsp;so I am trying to automate the process and I’ll post more data then. I’ve made 15 chips (1,500 transistors) and know there’s at least one completely functional chip and at least two “mostly functional”, meaning ~80% of the transistors work instead of 100%. No proper yield data yet. The most common defect is a drain or source shorted to the bulk silicon channel, not a leaky or shorted gate like on my Z1 process.</p>

<p>I said before that the gate used to be made out of aluminum and now it’s silicon which makes the chips work a lot better. Silicon comes in three varieties that we care about: amorphous, polycrystalline, and monocrystalline.&nbsp;From left to right, these become more electrically conductive but also much harder to deposit.&nbsp;In fact,&nbsp;monocrystalline Si can’t be deposited, you can only grow it in contact with another mono-Si layer as a seed (epitaxy). Since the gate must be deposited on top of an insulating dielectric, poly is the best we can do. We can heavily dope the polysilicon anyway to make it more conductive.</p>

<p>A typical self-aligned polysilicon gate process&nbsp;requires silane, a&nbsp;toxic and explosive gas, to&nbsp;deposit polycrystalline silicon layers. It may also be possible by sputtering or <a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://sid.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sdtp.10835">evaporating amorphous silicon and annealing with a laser</a>.&nbsp;A major theme of this DIY silicon process is to circumvent expensive, difficult, or dangerous steps. So, I came up with a modified process flow. It’s a variation on the standard self-aligned&nbsp;methods&nbsp;to allow doping via high temperature diffusion rather than ion implantation. The effect is that I’m able to buy a silicon wafer with the&nbsp;polysilicon already deposited on it&nbsp;from the factory and pattern it to make transistors instead of putting my own polysilicon down halfway through the process. This is a nice short term workaround but it would be best to design a polysilicon deposition process using the laser anneal method mentioned above.</p>
<p>Wafers are available with all kinds of materials deposited on them already, so I just had to find one with a thin layer of SiO2 (gate oxide, ~10nm) followed by a thicker polysilicon (300nm). I found a lot of 25 200mm (EPI, prime, [1-0-0], p-type) wafers on eBay for $45 which is essentially a lifetime supply, so email me if you want one. The gate oxide is the most&nbsp;fragile layer and requires the most care during fabrication. Since I bought the wafer with a nice high quality oxide on it already that was capped off and kept clean by the thick polysilicon layer,&nbsp;I was able to eliminate all the&nbsp;aggressive&nbsp;cleaning chemicals (sulfuric acid, etc) from the process and still&nbsp;make great transistors. Minimal process chemicals and tools are listed below.</p>

<p>Because I bought the wafer already with gate oxide and polysilicon on it, I can’t grow a field oxide. These thick oxide layers are typically used to mask dopants and require a long high temperature step which would oxidize all of my poly and there would be none remaining. So, my modified process uses an additional masking step (the “gate” mask is typically not found in a self-aligned process) that allows me to use the polysilicon itself as a dopant mask and hard-baked photoresist as the field dielectric. This alternative processing results in the stepped structure you can see in the orange region on the NMOS cross section above.&nbsp;This process subtlety&nbsp;is mentioned here, <a href="https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1426534655197646857?s=20">read this twitter thread</a>.</p>

<p>This process isn’t ideal and I want to make some changes so it’s CMOS compatible but it simplifies fabrication and makes it possible with a minimal set of tools. The 1µm dielectric layer (orange) would ideally be CVD SiO2 (it’s possible to build a&nbsp;TEOS oxide reactor at home) but I used a photoresist instead. Most photoresists can be baked around 250°C to form a hard permanent dielectric layer that is&nbsp;an easy alternative to CVD or PECVD oxide. A spin-on-glass/sol-gel could also be used here. SiO2 etching is done with a <a href="https://sam.zeloof.xyz/sio2-patterning/">buffered HF solution made from rust stain remover</a>&nbsp;or RIE.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Perhaps the greatest surprise of the last two years was, for me, the realization
that people not only care about compiling C to Rust (for obvious reasons, such
as, ahem, memory safety) – they also care about compiling Rust to C! Wait,
what?</p>

<p>I <a href="https://jonathan.protzenko.fr/2024/01/05/eurydice.html">wrote about this</a> briefly a couple years
ago, but the level of interest for the project, I must say, took me somewhat by
surprise. So let’s talk about compiling Rust to C a little more today.</p>

<h2 id="barriers-to-rust-adoption">Barriers to Rust adoption</h2>

<p>Rust is making big progress in terms of adoption, and represents a great value
proposition, especially for new code. Both my <a href="https://microsoft.com/">former
employer</a> and my <a href="https://google.com/">new employer</a>, like
pretty much everyone else these days, have big projects that are written in pure
Rust or can have Rust components. Even <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windowsdriverdev/towards-rust-in-windows-drivers/4449718">Windows kernel drivers can be written
in
Rust</a>
now. Amazing stuff.</p>

<p>However, if your project is, say, an open-source library that gets compiled on a
wonderfully diverse set of target architectures, OSes, distributions and
toolchains, well, chances are… one of these is not going to support Rust. Think of a
crypto library: there <strong>will</strong> be people out there with an obscure compiler for a weird
embedded target, and they really want to compile your library, because they’ve
been told not to roll out their own crypto. Or perhaps you have a format library
ridden with memory errors and you want to port it to Rust. Or maybe your company
has an in-house analysis that only runs on C code. Regardless of the scenario,
there will always be that one legacy use-case that prevents you from switching
to Rust until it’s 2035, all those LTS versions (looking at you RHEL) are
finally retired, and you yourself are too close to retirement to even care
anymore.</p>

<p>That is, unless you’re willing to use a Rust to C compiler.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Having a backwards-compat scenario where Rust can be compiled to C serves
several purposes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It allows for a gradual transition. The codebase can be ported to Rust,
and refactored / cleaned up / rewritten to use all the nice Rust things (data
types, pattern-matching, polymorphism, memory safety), thus making you and
your developers much, much happier. Meanwhile, the C version co-exists so
that you don’t alienate your userbase.</li>
  <li>It only requires maintaining a single version. The Rust code is
authoritative; the C code is derived from it automatically, either on CI, or
at least with a CI job that checks that the two are in sync.</li>
  <li>It allows for a census of problematic scenarios. By making the Rust version
the default (and putting the fallback C behind a <code>--write-us-an-email</code> flag),
there is finally a way to enumerate those mythical users who cannot switch to
Rust just yet.</li>
</ol>

<p>If that sounds appealing, meet Eurydice.</p>



<p>Eurydice is a compiler from Rust to C that aims to produce <em>readable</em> C code. Of
course, readability is subjective; also, seeing that Rust relies on
whole-program monomorphization, the C code is bound to be more verbose than the
Rust code. But you can judge for yourself: here’s the result of <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/blob/9b14f74c05228b8335700efcffb55bf82a991975/out/test-libcrux/libcrux_mlkem_portable.c#L936">compiling
libcrux to
C</a>.</p>

<p>The output of the test suite is under version control, and there are <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/tree/9b14f74c05228b8335700efcffb55bf82a991975/out">a lot more
tests</a>
to peruse. See for instance <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/blob/9b14f74c05228b8335700efcffb55bf82a991975/out/test-symcrust/symcrust.c">this
bit</a>,
compared to the <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/blob/9b14f74c05228b8335700efcffb55bf82a991975/test/symcrust.rs">Rust
original</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-design-of-eurydice">The design of Eurydice</h2>

<p>Eurydice plugs in directly at the MIR level, using
<a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/charon/">Charon</a> to avoid reimplementing the
wheel and paying the price of interacting with the guts of <code>rustc</code>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18042">Our
paper</a> on Charon says more about its
architecture.</p>

<p>The advantage of plugging in at the MIR level is that i) we do not have to
interpret syntactic sugar, which means our translation is more faithful to the
Rust semantics, and ii) we have way fewer constructs that need compiling to C. Even then,
it’s no easy feat to translate Rust to C.</p>

<p>There is naturally, the need to perform whole-program monomorphization, over
types and const-generic arguments; the compilation of pattern matches into
tagged unions; recognizing instances of iterators that can be compiled to native
C <code>for</code>-loops. Then, there are more subtle things, such as compiling array
repeat expressions sensibly – zero-initializers when possible, initializer
lists otherwise, unless it generates too much code, in which case <code>for</code>-loops are
preferable. And finally, there are all the rules about visibility, <code>static</code>,
<code>inline</code>, etc. that are very C-specific and depend on how you want to lay out
your C files.</p>

<p>The translation is complicated by the constraint that the generated code
ought to be readable: for instance, we compile Rust structs to
C structs, including
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/dynamically-sized-types.html">DST</a>s, by
relying on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/struct.html">flexible array
members</a>.
We also
work hard to avoid using the fully-generic tagged union pattern when possible,
instead eliminating the tag when e.g. the Rust enum only has a single case.
Additionally, we rely on Charon to reconstruct control-flow, rather than compile
the MIR <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">CFG</a> to C code ridden
with <code>goto</code>s; again, this is for code quality.</p>

<p>At a low-level, there were many interesting tidbits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because arrays in Rust are values, we wrap them within C structs to give them
value semantics in C, too; concretely, <code>[u32; 8]</code> becomes <code>struct {
uint32_t data[8]; }</code>. (A previous version of Eurydice would emit <code>uint32_t *</code>,
and rely on various <code>memcpy</code>s to implement value semantics, but this produced
a translation that was not type-generic, and there were plenty of finicky
corner cases. We revamped the compilation scheme recently.)</li>
  <li>The notion of <code>lvalue</code> in C means we need to insert more variable declarations
than in Rust – for instance, you can’t trivially compile <code>&amp;[0u32; 1]</code> without
naming the array.</li>
  <li>The fact that the evaluation order is so loosely defined in C means that
intermediary computations need to be stored in intermediary variables to
enforce the evaluation order.</li>
  <li>Rust relies on whole-program monomorphization; this means that the C code is
inevitably going to contains multiple copies of the same types and functions,
but for different choices of type and const generic argumnets. This is
currently done with a builtin phase in Eurydice (for historical reasons), but
in the long run, we want to rely on Charon’s support for monomorphization.</li>
  <li>There are plenty of peephole optimizations that are required for good code
quality, such as recognizing <code>array::from_fn</code> and generating sensible code
that initializes the array in-place (instead of relying on the fully-general
compilation scheme for closures), or recognizing instances of the <code>Eq</code>
trait that deserve dedicated treatment (such as using <code>memcmp</code> for arrays and
slices of flat data).</li>
</ul>

<p>A final design choice is that for now, Eurydice may define more behaviors than
Rust – for instance, Rust panics on integer overflow, but Eurydice-compiled
code does not. This is because we assume the input code is verified, and
therefore has been shown to be free of panics. This design choice can be easily
changed, though.</p>

<p>In practice, as soon as you use traits, the C code becomes more voluminous than
the Rust code. We rely on a configuration file mechanism to control the
placement of monomorphized instances of a given function, rather than put
everything in one big C file. This currently requires a lot of manual
intervention to give good results on large projects.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-of-eurydice">Implementing of Eurydice</h2>

<p>Eurydice starts by compiling the MIR AST obtained out of Charon into
<a href="https://github.com/FStarLang/karamel/">KaRaMeL</a>’s internal AST. This is ~3000
lines of OCaml code, so that’s already pretty involved. A lot of the work
revolves around trait methods and their monomorphization, given Rust’s
expressive trait system.</p>

<p>Then, about 30 nanopasses simplify the KaRaMeL AST until it becomes eligible for
compilation to C. Of those, a handful were originally written for KaRaMeL and
were somewhat reusable; this includes compilation of data types, as well as
monomorphization. The rest was written from scratch for Eurydice, and totals
about ~5000 lines of OCaml code.</p>

<p>A particularly gnarly phase was eliminating MIR’s variable assignments as much
as possible: in MIR, every variable starts out uninitialized at the beginning of
the function; then, <em>in lieu</em> of the variable declaration, we have an assignment
with the initial value. Naturally, having a variable declaration in the right
spot is better for code quality, so an initial phase tries to reconstruct these
assignments. That’s a drawback of using MIR, but we still firmly believe that
sticking to something that has clear semantics is ultimately better.</p>

<p>Fun fact: because there are so many peephole optimizations, I got tired of
maintaining <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/blob/29a05cc79df4d63d6a0a3816f1617a3bba4814e2/lib/Cleanup2.ml#L616-L655">enormous
pattern-matches</a>
that would try to catch every flavor of
Rust iterator that can be compiled to a C for-loop. Instead, a <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/blob/94cdf3b2ea4541b658dff74e4307ce01041fcc22/cremepat">custom OCaml syntax
extension</a> allows writing <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/blob/94cdf3b2ea4541b658dff74e4307ce01041fcc22/lib/Cleanup2.ml#L609-L626">concrete
syntax</a>
for the internal KaRaMeL language in OCaml patterns. Those magic patterns then get
compiled at compile-time to OCaml AST nodes for an actual OCaml pattern that
matches the (deeply-embedded) syntax of KaRaMeL’s AST. This relies on a <code>ppx</code>
that lexes, parses and compiles the concrete syntax.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-eurydice-generated-code">Deploying Eurydice-generated code</h2>

<p>Eurydice-generated code expects some hand-written glue that contains macros and
<code>static inline</code> functions; sometimes, it’s simply more convenient to write a
single macro that uses a type, rather than have Eurydice generate N copies of a
polymorphic function that gets specialized each time. A typical example is
compiling the Eq trait for arrays: it’s nicer to emit <code>Eurydice_array_eq(a1, a2,
len, t)</code>, which macro-expands to <code>!(memcmp(a1, a2, len*sizeof(t)))</code>, rather than
have N such functions, each containing a for-loop specialized for different
values of <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>Eurydice generates code that is either (C11 and C++20-compatible) or (C++-17
compatible, but not C-compatible). The reason for this is that Rust allows enum
values (e.g. <code>Foo { bar: baz }</code>) in any expression position. For simplicity,
Eurydice emits a compound initializer <code>(Foo) { .tag = bar, .value = { .case_Foo
= { .bar = baz }}}</code>, or a C++20 aggregate that uses designated initializers,
relying on a macro (not shown here) to hide the syntax differences between the
two. But C++17 does not have designated initializers, so there is an option for
Eurydice to emit different code that <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/blob/94cdf3b2ea4541b658dff74e4307ce01041fcc22/include/eurydice_glue.h#L37">relies on member pointers</a> to achieve
sensibly the <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/blob/94cdf3b2ea4541b658dff74e4307ce01041fcc22/out/testxx-result/result.cc#L34">same effect</a>.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-of-eurydice">Limitations of Eurydice</h2>

<p>Naturally, there are many limitations to this approach. Here are the
main ones that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>we cannot guarantee that the layout of objects will be the same in C as in
Rust; conceivably, one could parse the layout information from MIR, then emit
compiler-specific alignment directives to keep the two identical, but this is
not done currently;</li>
  <li>the generated code <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/blob/main/out/test-dst/dst.c#L15">violates strict
aliasing</a>,
because creating a user-defined DST involves casting one pointer type (a
struct containing an array) to another (a struct with a flexible array
member instead); I’m not sure what the best fix is, so for now, please compile your
code with <code>-fno-strict-aliasing</code>;</li>
  <li>the code that Eurydice sees is MIR <em>after</em> applying <code>cfg</code> tweaks; this means
that for code that is intended to be multi-platform, <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice/pull/260">some
tricks</a> need to be applied,
otherwise, Eurydice will only “see” one version of the code (AVX2, or ARM64,
or something else)</li>
  <li>because monorphization is so pervasive, the configuration language needs to

</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>There is ongoing work to integrate Eurydice-generated code for both
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/rewriting-symcrypt-in-rust-to-modernize-microsofts-cryptographic-library/">Microsoft</a>
and
<a href="https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/77027?tab=comments">Google</a>’s
respective crypto libraries.</p>

<p>The community grew recently, with wonderful contributions by GitHub users
@ssyram and @lin23299. There are more in the pipeline, and I look forward to
seeing the supported subset of Rust grow even more. Next on the horizon is
support for <code>dyn</code> traits via vtables, and relying on Charon’s monomorphization
to get MIR exactly as the Rust compiler would monomorphize it, intead of relying
on a custom procedure in Eurydice.</p>

<p>An ambitious goal is for the whole standard library of Rust to be extractable
via Eurydice in 2026. This is non-trivial, but I believe this achievement is
within reach. Stay tuned.</p>

<h2 id="ps-why-the-name">PS: Why the name?</h2>

<p>People keep asking about the name; because the project shares a large amount of
infrastructure with <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas">Aeneas</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/charon">Charon</a>, I had to follow the Greek
mythology theme. Specifically, the myth of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurydice">Eurydice</a> resonated with me: I thought
I was saved from the hell of <a href="https://jonathan.protzenko.fr/2019/01/04/behind-the-scenes.html">generating C code</a>, and was going to go back to the world of the
living, but alas, no.</p>

comprehend documents effectively instantly.  This can be extraordinarily
powerful for summarizing documents — or of answering more specific questions
of a large document like a datasheet or specification.  (Ironically, LLMs are
especially good at evaluating documents to assess the degree that an LLM
assisted their creation!)</p><p>While use of LLMs to assist comprehension has little downside, it does come
with an important caveat:  when uploading a document to a hosted LLM (ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, etc.), there must be assurance of <strong>data privacy</strong> — and
specifically, assurance that the model will not use the document to train
future iterations of itself.  Note that this may be opt-out (that is, by
default, a model may reserve the right to train on uploaded documents), but can
generally be controlled via preferences — albeit occasionally via euphemism.
(OpenAI shamelessly calls this checked-by-default setting "Improve the model
for everyone", making anyone who doesn’t wish the model to train on their data
feel as if they suffer from a kind of reactionary avarice.)</p><p>A final cautionary note:  using LLMs to assist comprehension should not
substitute for actually reading a document where such reading is socially
expected.  More concretely:  while LLMs can be a useful tool to assist in the
evaluating of candidate materials per <a href="#rfd3">[rfd3]</a>, their use should be restricted
to be as a tool, not as a substitute for human eyes (and brain!).</p></div></div><div><h3 data-sectnum="2.2."><a href="#_llms_as_editors">LLMs as editors<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" role="img"><g fill="currentColor"><path d="m6.586 12.243 1.59-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.061 0l.354.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06L8 13.658A4 4 0 0 1 2.343 8l1.591-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.06 0l.354.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-1.59 1.591a2 2 0 1 0 2.828 2.829M12.066 9.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06 0l-.354-.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l1.59-1.591a2 2 0 1 0-2.828-2.829l-1.59 1.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0l-.354-.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06L8 2.342A4 4 0 0 1 13.657 8z"></path><path d="M9.945 5.702a.75.75 0 0 0-1.061 0L5.702 8.884a.75.75 0 0 0 0 1.06l.353.354a.75.75 0 0 0 1.061 0l3.182-3.182a.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.06z"></path></g></svg></a></h3><div><p>LLMs can be excellent editors.  Engaging an LLM late in the creative process
(that is, with a document already written and broadly polished), allows for
LLMs to provide helpful feedback on structure, phrasing, etc. — all without
danger of losing one’s own voice.  A cautionary note here: LLMs are infamous
pleasers — and you may find that the breathless praise from an LLM is in fact
more sycophancy than analysis.  This becomes more perilous the earlier one uses
an LLM in the writing process:  the less polish a document already has, the
more likely it is that an LLM will steer to something wholly different — at
once praising your groundbreaking genius while offering to rewrite it for you.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-sectnum="2.3."><a href="#_llms_as_writers">LLMs as writers<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" role="img"><g fill="currentColor"><path d="m6.586 12.243 1.59-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.061 0l.354.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06L8 13.658A4 4 0 0 1 2.343 8l1.591-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.06 0l.354.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-1.59 1.591a2 2 0 1 0 2.828 2.829M12.066 9.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06 0l-.354-.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l1.59-1.591a2 2 0 1 0-2.828-2.829l-1.59 1.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0l-.354-.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06L8 2.342A4 4 0 0 1 13.657 8z"></path><path d="M9.945 5.702a.75.75 0 0 0-1.061 0L5.702 8.884a.75.75 0 0 0 0 1.06l.353.354a.75.75 0 0 0 1.061 0l3.182-3.182a.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.06z"></path></g></svg></a></h3><div><p>While LLMs are adept at reading and can be terrific at editing, their writing
is much more mixed.  At best, writing from LLMs is hackneyed and cliché-ridden;
at worst, it brims with tells that reveal that the prose is in fact
automatically generated.</p><p>What’s so bad about this?  First, to those who can recognize an LLM’s reveals
(an expanding demographic!), it’s just embarrassing — it’s as if the writer is
walking around with their
<a href="https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2025/12/05/your-intellectual-fly-is-open/">intellectual
fly open</a>.  But there are deeper problems:  LLM-generated writing undermines
the authenticity of not just one’s writing but of the thinking behind it as
well.  If the prose is automatically generated, might the ideas be too?  The
reader can’t be sure — and increasingly, the hallmarks of LLM generation cause
readers to turn off (or worse).</p><p>Finally, LLM-generated prose undermines a social contract of sorts:  absent
LLMs, it is presumed that of the reader and the writer, it is the writer that
has undertaken the greater intellectual exertion.  (That is, it is more work to
write than to read!)  For the reader, this is important:  should they struggle
with an idea, they can reasonably assume that the writer themselves understands
it — and it is the least a reader can do to labor to make sense of it.</p><p>If, however, prose is LLM-generated, this social contract becomes ripped up:
a reader cannot assume that the writer understands their ideas because they
might not so much have read the product of the LLM that they tasked to write it.
If one is lucky, these are LLM hallucinations: obviously wrong and quickly
discarded.  If one is unlucky, however, it will be a kind of LLM-induced
cognitive dissonance: a puzzle in which pieces don’t fit because there is in
fact no puzzle at all.  This can leave a reader frustrated:  why should they
spend more time reading prose than the writer spent writing it?</p><p>This can be navigated, of course, but it is truly perilous:  our writing
is an important vessel for building trust — and that trust can be quickly
eroded if we are not speaking with our own voice.  For us at Oxide, there
is a more mechanical reason to be jaundiced about using LLMs to write:
because our hiring process very much selects for writers, we know that
everyone at Oxide <strong>can</strong> write — and we have the luxury of demanding of
ourselves the kind of writing that we know that we are all capable of.</p><p>So our guideline is to generally not use LLMs to write, but this shouldn’t
be thought of as an absolute — and it doesn’t mean that an LLM can’t be
used as part of the writing process.  Just please: consider your
responsibility to yourself, to your own ideas — and to the reader.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-sectnum="2.4."><a href="#_llms_as_code_reviewers">LLMs as code reviewers<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" role="img"><g fill="currentColor"><path d="m6.586 12.243 1.59-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.061 0l.354.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06L8 13.658A4 4 0 0 1 2.343 8l1.591-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.06 0l.354.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-1.59 1.591a2 2 0 1 0 2.828 2.829M12.066 9.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06 0l-.354-.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l1.59-1.591a2 2 0 1 0-2.828-2.829l-1.59 1.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0l-.354-.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06L8 2.342A4 4 0 0 1 13.657 8z"></path><path d="M9.945 5.702a.75.75 0 0 0-1.061 0L5.702 8.884a.75.75 0 0 0 0 1.06l.353.354a.75.75 0 0 0 1.061 0l3.182-3.182a.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.06z"></path></g></svg></a></h3><div><p>As with reading comprehension and editing, LLMs can make for good code

mass hysteria about LLMs entirely eliminating software engineering as a craft.
As with using an LLM to write prose, there is obvious peril here!  Unlike
prose, however (which really should be handed in a polished form to an LLM to
maximize the LLM’s efficacy), LLMs can be quite effective writing code <em>de
novo</em>.  This is especially valuable for code that is experimental or auxiliary
or otherwise throwaway.  The closer code is to the system that we ship, the
greater care needs to be shown when using LLMs.  Even with something that seems
natural for LLM contribution (e.g., writing tests), one should still be
careful:  it’s easy for LLMs to spiral into nonsense on even simple tasks.
Still, they can be extraordinarily useful — and can help to provide an entire
spectrum of utility in writing software; they shouldn’t be dismissed out of
hand.</p><p>Wherever LLM-generated code is used, it becomes the responsibility of the
engineer.  As part of this process of taking responsibility, <strong>self-review</strong>
becomes essential:  LLM-generated code should not be reviewed by others if the
responsible engineer has not themselves reviewed it.  Moreover, once in the
loop of peer review, generation should more or less be removed:  if code review
comments are addressed by wholesale re-generation, iterative review becomes
impossible.</p><p>In short, where LLMs are used to generate code, responsibility, rigor, empathy
and teamwork must remain top of mind.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

Can Japan bring its breathtaking "juhyo" back from the brink?</b></p><p>Each winter, the upper slopes of Mount Zao in northern Japan – one of the country's best-known ski areas – are transformed. Fir trees coated in thick frost and snow swell into ghostly figures known as "juhyo" or "snow monsters".</p><p>Juhyo form only under exceptionally rare atmospheric conditions, emerging when strong, persistent winter winds carry supercooled water droplets that freeze on contact with the local evergreen Aomori todomatsu trees, gradually layering into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.weather.gov/otx/Rime">rime ice</a>.</p><p>At Mount Zao, these formations <a target="_blank" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JD017042">occur during sustained westerly winds</a> of up to 26m per second (85ft per second), with surface air temperatures between -6.3C to -0.1C (21-31F) and unusually high cloud liquid water content. Under these precise conditions, the rime thickens on the windward side of trees into overlapping ridges known as "shrimp tails", the distinctive shapes that cluster together to form the towering juhyo figures.</p><p>"Because such precise meteorological and ecological conditions align in very few places, Zao's snow monsters are a phenomenon almost unique to northern Japan," says Fumitaka Yanagisawa, an emeritus professor of geochemistry who studies the juhyo at Yamagata University.</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><p>The snow monsters are the biggest winter draw of the Zao area, a mountain range which lies between Japan's Yamagata and Miyagi prefectures and attracts <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dbj.jp/upload/investigate/docs/8d6c809df40abe87105e30e8797b3f78.pdf">tens of thousands</a> of visitors annually.</p><p>But recent research indicates that the monsters are becoming slimmer.</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mlb8rv.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mlb8rv.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mlb8rv.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mlb8rv.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mlb8rv.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mlb8rv.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mlb8rv.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mlb8rv.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mlb8rv.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mlb8rv.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Mount Zao's snow monsters are a phenomenon almost unique to northern Japan (Credit: Getty Images)"><span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption>Mount Zao's snow monsters are a phenomenon almost unique to northern Japan (Credit: Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.yamagata-u.ac.jp/jp/files/3517/5436/7737/03_.pdf">In August 2025</a>, a research team led by Yanagisawa announced findings that quantified what <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yamagata-u.ac.jp/jp/files/9717/4107/2854/362.pdf">locals have long observed</a>. By analysing identical-angle photographs of Zao's summit taken since 1933, the team measured the thickness of the figures on a six-point scale. The findings (which have not yet been published in a scientific journal) indicate a widespread shrinking of the juhyo.</p><p>"In the 1930s, we saw juhyo five to six metres [16-20ft] across," Yanagisawa says. "By the postwar decades, they were often two to three metres [7-10ft]. Since 2019, many are half a metre [1.6ft] or less. Some are barely columns."</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><p>The cause is twofold, says Yanagisawa: a warming climate and a forest under attack.

"In scenarios where climate change continues to advance significantly by the end of this century, it is possible that in warmer-than-usual winters, juhyo may no longer form at all," Ito says.</p><p>The threat has prompted action across Yamagata. In March 2023, the prefecture launched the <a target="_blank" href="https://yamagatayama.com/jyuhyo/about/#kaigi_1">Juhyo Revival Conference</a> – a permanent council bringing together researchers, officials, local businesses and residents to coordinate long-term efforts to restore the fir forests and preserve Mount Zao's snow monsters.</p><p>Juhyo are not only a natural spectacle but also a pillar of the local economy. "The influx of tourists supports hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops throughout the area," says Genji Akiba, deputy director of the Zao Onsen Tourism Association. "If the juhyo disappear, it would be a huge blow."</p><p>"Revival is a strong wish of our citizens," says Yoko Honma, a conservation specialist at Yamagata Prefecture's nature division.

			<p>In 2002 I asked a number of developers/Unix people for screenshots of their desktops. I recently <a href="https://anders.unix.se/2015/10/28/screenshots-from-developers--unix-people-2002/">republished them</a>, and, seeing <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10469824">the</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/3qlyf6/screenshots_from_developers_unix_people_2002/">interest</a> this generated, I thought it’d be fun to ask the same people* again 13 years later. To my delight I managed to reach many of them.</p>

<p><small>* Sans Dennis Ritchie and itojun, who are no longer with us.</small></p>

<p>So, without further ado:</p>

Not that much has changed in 13 years. Still using Linux. Still just a browser window and a ton of terminals hiding behind them.  The main change is that switched from Pine to Thunderbird for email at some point. The OS on my laptop here is Ubuntu with Unity although there are a lot of Debian packages installed so it is a bit of a hybrid at this point. Oh, and yes, my son Carl is a lot older now.

<p>Ah, my desktop is pretty boring, I used fvwm 1.24 as my window manager and I try to have no more than 1 or 2 windows open per virtual desktop.  I use FreeBSD 4-STABLE as my operating system. I first came across Unix when I got an account on a Pyramid 90x running OSx. This had a dual-universe setup: both AT&amp;T and BSD-style environments, chosen by an environment variable. Initially I was given the AT&amp;T environment, but my friends convinced me to ``come over” to BSD. Since then I’ve been a BSD afficionado.</p>

<p>After OSx, SunOS 3.5 and later SunOS releases, until 386BSD 0.1 came out and I started to run BSD at home. Then when 386BSD transmogrified to FreeBSD, I went with FreeBSD.</p>

<p>In terms of desktop, I’m a command-line guy, always will be. My favourite editor is vi, my favourite shell is tcsh (but kudos to rc for elegance).  So I don’t really feel the need for GUI things like Gnome or KDE :-)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How things have (and have not changed). I'm still a command-line junkie with at least two xterm windows open. I'm still using a 3x3 virtual desktop. However, instead of fvwm, it is now LXDE. I've also switched from FreeBSD to Linux and I'm running Lubuntu as my distribution.</p>

<p>There are a lot of indispensable GUI tools that I use. These include Firefox, lyx, Gimp, KeepassX, Shutter, viking, dia, Wireshark, calibre, audacity, Handbrake and VLC. But where possible I still prefer to script things. My main development languages are still shell, Perl and C.</p>

<p>My shell is now bash. The vi keystrokes are burned into my fingertips and, as long as vim can be ported to new systems, that will be my text editor until I pass on. My mail client is now mutt (definitely not a web client) and my mail is stored locally, not on someone else's server.</p>

<p>The only issue I have is that, since a job change, I now have to deal with Windoze things. Thus, I have VirtualBox, libreoffice and Wine to help me do that.</p>

<p>I started with Unix on a Pyramid 90x. I now have a smart phone that blows the 90x out of the water on performance, RAM and storage. But I'm so very happy that, somewhere down underneath, there is still a Bourne shell and an operating system that does open(), close(), read(), write(), fork() and exec()!</p>

<p>You’ll probably be sad (or perhaps not) to hear that my desktop hasn’t really changed much at all - still OS X, though because OS X has virtual desktops now I have multiple “desktops” (6 of them) where Mail.app runs on one, Safari on another, Calendar, Slack, etc - all on separate desktops.  This makes it a bit boring, but here’s the one I probably spend the most time in - the terminal window desktop. :)</p>

<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingalls_Wilder">Laura Ingalls Wilder</a>‘s <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> books are problematic, and also I will always love them. She wrote about the beauty of family and hard work, but she wrote them because she spent her whole life supporting disabled family members. She and her daughter beautified her “pioneer girl” history to make good books. Her daughter describes the reality: &nbsp;“It took seven successive years of complete crop failure, with work, weather and sickness that wrecked [my father’s] health permanently, and interest rates of 36 percent on money borrowed to buy food, to dislodge us from that land.”</p>





<p>My own version of this mistake was thinking that people’s personalities were different in the past. I grew up listening to folk music and imagining a past where nice boys would admire a nice quiet girl like me, and I wouldn’t have to figure out dating because everything would just unfold, probably on a May morning. My mother pointed out that a lot of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_by_Blackwaterside">songs</a> along the lines of “my own true love proved false to me” were about unplanned pregnancies.</p>



<p>I also assumed the bonny lasses in these songs would be wholesome and nice. But were popular girls of the past nicer people than they are now?</p>

<p>Some of my picture came from growing up in the Anglo-American folk dance and music community: it had a lot of aging hippies with graduate degrees. So I came away imagining a past with a lot of the kind of people who become engineers and English teachers. A more accurate picture would have been “Imagine a small town where the same 19 kids form your entire group of peers and potential partners.”</p>

<p>Bookish girls like Belle didn’t really go to live in enchanted castles with huge libraries. They stayed in villages where everyone thought they were weird and their best option was Gaston.</p>





<p>Maybe my favorite podcast episode ever is <a href="https://www.econtalk.org/rachel-laudan-on-the-history-of-food-and-cuisine/">Rachel Laudan on food history</a>: “I did have the extraordinary good fortune to grow up eating what I think the romantic movement dreams of. We had milk fresh from the cow; I never had pasteurized milk until I went to school. We had fish from the river, pheasant from the farm. The food was extremely good. . . . everything was fresh from the garden. So, I&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;romanticize—some of that because the taste was often extraordinary. And then I tweak myself and I say, ‘Look, Rachel, your mother spent all day, every day gardening or cooking.’ Essentially. As well as doing other chores. And she said to you, ‘Rachel, it’s servitude. I want you to have a life I didn’t have.’&nbsp;“</p>



<p>I love living in a time and place where we get to choose aesthetics. I have bread rising in my kitchen right now, and I’m looking forward to baking it in an electric oven that doesn’t require me stacking wood or putting smoke into my house.</p>



<p>So I’ll continue to enjoy retro vibes, and draw on the past for lessons on how to be a human. (For example, making music together is one of life’s great experiences, and it’s a mistake to entirely substitute recorded music for that.) But I’ll enjoy doing so with indoor plumbing, dental care, and a desk job. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>New research from King’s College London finds that coffee consumption within the NHS recommended limit is linked to longer telomere lengths – a marker of biological ageing – among people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The effect is comparable to roughly five years younger biological age.</p><div><div><p>Telomeres are structures that protect DNA. As people get older, their telomeres shorten as part of the natural human ageing process. This process has been shown to be accelerated among people with severe mental illness, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, who have an average life expectancy 15 years shorter than the general population.</p>
<p>Previous research shows that coffee possesses health benefits. It may reduce oxidative stress in the general population, helping slow biological ageing processes like telomere shortening. The new study, published in <a href="https://mentalhealth.bmj.com/content/28/1/e301700" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BMJ Mental Health</a>, explores whether coffee consumption could slow this ageing process among those with severe mental illness.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience measured the effects of coffee consumption on telomere length among 436 participants aged 18 to 65 with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder with psychosis.</p>
<p>They found that coffee consumption of up to four cups per day was linked to longer telomeres, comparable to a biological age five years younger than non-coffee drinkers.</p>
<p>The longest telomeres were seen among those who consumed three to four cups per day. Too much coffee reduced this positive effect, with participants who consumed more than four cups having shorter telomeres than those who consumed between three and four cups.</p></div><p><img src="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/newimages/ioppn/news-spotlights/v-mlakar-coffee-and-telomere-length-figure.x4fa2266f.jpeg?f=webp" alt="V Mlakar et all 2025 figure: As coffee consumption (X axis) increases up to 3-4 cups, telomere length (Y axis) increases."></p><figcaption>Figure from Vid Mlakar et al. 2025: As coffee consumption increases up to 3-4 cups, telomere length increases. At 5+ cups, telomere length begins to shorten again.</figcaption><p>These effects remained after accounting for variations in age, sex, ethnicity, medication and tobacco use.</p><div><blockquote><p>We know that coffee can help slow biological ageing in the general population, but little is known about its effect on people with severe mental illness – a population whose lifespan is already shortened, in part due to age-related diseases. Our study shows that up to four cups of coffee per day is linked to longer telomeres among people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This is comparable to a biological age of five years younger than non-coffee drinkers.</p><cite>Vid Mlakar, PhD student at King’s College London and first author of the study</cite></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>Coffee is a beverage that many people consume daily. On one hand, we know that excessive coffee consumption can have negative effects on health, such as reducing sleep quality. However, our new study suggests that coffee consumption up to a certain point may have benefits for biological ageing. Many of the factors that are known to affect biological ageing, such as genetics and negative stressful life experiences, are beyond our control. Lifestyle factors like coffee consumption are something we can actively modify, making research like this particularly valuable.</p><cite>Dr Monica Aas, MRC Research Fellow at King’s College London and senior author of the study</cite></blockquote></div><div><p>Dr Aas added: "Studies such as this also support the idea that we should move away from viewing coffee as simply “good or bad”, and instead consider a more balanced view. Still, these results need to be confirmed in other independent studies and longitudinal research before we can determine if this is a causal effect."</p>
<p>Data were from the Norwegian TOP study, collected between 2007 and 2018. The researchers included participants who had available data on mental health diagnosis (assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV), telomere length (measured by extracting DNA from blood samples) and self-reported coffee consumption.</p>
<p>The researchers note that the study did not have information on the type of coffee consumed (instant versus filter) or the caffeine concentration of each cup. The NHS advises limiting caffeine intake to 400 mg/day (approximately four cups of coffee).</p>
<p>The study was funded by the Research Council of Norway, the KG Jebsen Stiftelsen and an Medical Research Council Fellowship. The team has recently received funding from the British Medical Association’s Margaret Temple grant to investigate telomere shortening in a longitudinal cohort of patients with psychosis. This project will allow them to explore further how several lifestyle factors, as well as stress, influence the rate of telomere shortening over time.</p>
