Hello Linux-kernel community,

I am sure you have already heard the news caused by the recent Greg' commit
6e90b675cf942e ("MAINTAINERS: Remove some entries due to various compliance
requirements."). As you may have noticed the change concerned some of the
Ru-related developers removal from the list of the official kernel maintainers,
including me.

The community members rightly noted that the _quite_ short commit log contained
very vague terms with no explicit change justification. No matter how hard I
tried to get more details about the reason, alas the senior maintainer I was
discussing the matter with haven't given an explanation to what compliance
requirements that was. I won't cite the exact emails text since it was a private
messaging, but the key words are "sanctions", "sorry", "nothing I can do", "talk
to your (company) lawyer"... I can't say for all the guys affected by the
change, but my work for the community has been purely _volunteer_ for more than
a year now (and less than half of it had been payable before that). For that
reason I have no any (company) lawyer to talk to, and honestly after the way the
patch has been merged in I don't really want to now. Silently, behind everyone's
back, _bypassing_ the standard patch-review process, with no affected
developers/subsystem notified - it's indeed the worse way to do what has been
done. No gratitude, no credits to the developers for all these years of the
devoted work for the community. No matter the reason of the situation but
haven't we deserved more than that? Adding to the GREDITS file at least, no?..

I can't believe the kernel senior maintainers didn't consider that the patch
wouldn't go unnoticed, and the situation might get out of control with
unpredictable results for the community, if not straight away then in the middle
or long term perspective. I am sure there have been plenty ways to solve the
problem less harmfully, but they decided to take the easiest path. Alas what's
done is done. A bifurcation point slightly initiated a year ago has just been
fully implemented. The reason of the situation is obviously in the political
ground which in this case surely shatters a basement the community has been built
on in the first place. If so then God knows what might be next (who else might
be sanctioned...), but the implemented move clearly sends a bad signal to the
Linux community new comers, to the already working volunteers and hobbyists like
me.

Thus even if it was still possible for me to send patches or perform some
reviews, after what has been done my motivation to do that as a volunteer has
simply vanished. (I might be doing a commercial upstreaming in future though).
But before saying goodbye I'd like to express my gratitude to all the community
members I have been lucky to work with during all these years. Specifically:

NTB-folks, Jon, Dave, Allen. NTB was my starting point in the kernel upstream
work. Thanks for the initial advices and despite of very-very-very tough reviews
with several complete patchset refactorings, I learned a lot back then. That
experience helped me afterwards. Thanks a lot for that. BTW since then I've got
several thank-you letters for the IDT NTB and IDT EEPROM drivers. If not for you
it wouldn't have been possible.

Andy, it's hard to remember who else would have given me more on my Linux kernel
journey as you have. We first met in the I2C subsystem review of my DW I2C
driver patches. Afterwards we've got to be frequently meeting here and there -
GPIO, SPI, TTY, DMA, NET, etc, clean/fixes/features patch(set)s. Quite heat
discussions in your first reviews drove me crazy really. But all the time we
managed to come up with some consensus somehow. And you never quit the
discussions calmly explaining your point over and over. You never refused to
provide more detailed justification to your requests/comments even though you
didn't have to. Thanks to that I learned how to be patient to reviewers
and reviewees. And of course thank you for the Linux-kernel knowledges and all
the tips and tricks you shared.

* Andy, please note due to the situation I am not going to work on my DW DMAC
fixes patchset anymore. So if you ever wish to have DW UART stably working with the
DW DMA-engine driver, then feel free to pick the series up:
Link: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/dmaengine/20240911184710.4207-1-fancer.lancer@gmail.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/dmaengine/20240911184710.4207-1-fancer.lancer@gmail.com/</a>

Linus (Walleij), after you merged one of my pretty much heavy patchset in you
suggested to me to continue the DW APB GPIO driver maintaining. It was a first
time I was asked to maintain a not-my driver. Thank you for the trust. I'll
never forget that.

Mark, thank you very much for entrusting the DW APB SSI driver maintenance to
me. I've put a lot of efforts into making it more generic and less errors-prune,
especially when it comes working under a DMA-engine control or working in the
mem-ops mode. I am sure the results have been beneficial to a lot of DW
SPI-controller users since then.

Damien, our first and last meeting was at my generic AHCI-platform and DW AHCI
SATA driver patches review. You didn't make it a quick and easy path. But still
all the reviews comments were purely on the technical basis, and the patches
were eventually merged in. Thank you for your time and experience I've got from
the reviews.

Paul, Thomas, Arnd, Jiaxun, we met several times in the mailing list during my
MIPS P5600 patches and just generic MIPS patches review. It was always a
pleasure to discuss the matters with such brilliant experts in the field. Alas
I've spent too much time working on the patches for another subsystems and
failed to submit all the MIPS-related bits. Sorry I didn't keep my promise, but
as you can see the circumstances have suddenly drawn its own deadline.

Bjorn, Mani, we were working quite a lot with you in the framework of the DW
PCIe RC drivers. You reviewed my patches. I helped you to review another patches
for some time. Despite of some arguing it was always a pleasure to work with
you.  Mani, special thanks for the cooperative DW eDMA driver maintenance. I
think we were doing a great work together.

Paolo, Jakub, David, Andrew, Vladimir, Russell. The network subsystem and
particularly the STMMAC driver (no doubt the driver sucks) have turned to be a
kind of obstacle on which my current Linux-kernel activity has stopped. I really
hope that at least in some way my help with the incoming STMMAC and DW XPCS
patches reviews lightened up your maintainance duty. I know Russell might
disagree, but I honestly think that all our discussions were useful after all,
at least for me. I also think we did a great work working together with Russell
on the DW GMAC/QoS ETH PCS patches. Hopefully you'll find a time to finish it up
after all. 

Rob, Krzysztof, from your reviews I've learned a lot about the most hardwary part
of the kernel - DT sources and DT-bindings. All your comments have been laconic
and straight to the point. That made reviews quick and easy. Thank you very
much for that.

Guenter, special thanks for reviewing and accepting my patches to the hwmon and
watchdog subsystems. It was pleasure to be working with you.

Borislav, we disagreed and argued a lot. So my DW uMCTL2 DDRC EDAC patches even
got stuck in limbo for quite a long time. Anyway thank you for the time
you spent reviewing my patches and trying to explain your point.

* Borislav, it looks like I won't be able to work on my Synopsys EDAC patchsets
anymore. If you or somebody else could pick them up and finish up the work it
would be great (you can find it in the lore archive). The patches convert the
mainly Zynq(MP)-specific Synopsys EDAC driver to supporting the generic DW
uMCTL2 DDRC. It would be very beneficial for each platform based on that
controller.

Greg, we met several times in the mailing lists. You reviewed my patches sent
for the USB and TTY subsystems, and all the time the process was straight,
highly professional, and simpler than in the most of my other case.
Thank you very much for that.

Yoshihiro, Keguang, Yanteng, Kory, Cai and everybody I was lucky to meet in the
kernel mailing lists, but forgot to mention here. Thank you for the time spent
for our cooperative work on making the Linux kernel better. It was a pleasure to
meet you here.

I also wish to say huge thanks to the community members trying to
defend the kicked off maintainers and for support you expressed in
these days. It means a lot.

A little bit statics of my kernel-work at the end:

Signed-off patches:		518
Reviewed and Acked patches:	253
Tested patches:			80

You might say not the greatest achievement for seven years comparing to some
other developers. Perhaps. But I meant each of these tags, be sure.

I guess that's it. If you ever need some info or consultation regarding the
drivers I used to maintain or the respective hardware or the Synopsys IP-cores
(about which I've got quite comprehensive knowledge by this time), feel free to
reach me out via this email. I am always willing to help to the community
members.

Hope we'll meet someday in more pleasant circumstances and drink a
couple or more beers together. But now it's time to say good bye.
Sorry for a long-read text. I wish good luck on your Linux-way.

Best Regards,
-Serge(y)

Hello Serge!
I do not have many contributions to show to give it extra weight nor do
I actually know you.
Nevertheless I still wanted to say thank you for your nice message even if
it is for a sad occasion, and share your sentiment of hoping
for more pleasant circumstances.

Best regards,
Reimar

(and apologies if anyone is annoyed by the wide CC list, but I think it's
important for at least some thank yous to be public and nobody else seems
to have written one yet)

&gt; Rob, Krzysztof, from your reviews I've learned a lot about the most hardwary part
&gt; of the kernel - DT sources and DT-bindings. All your comments have been laconic
&gt; and straight to the point. That made reviews quick and easy. Thank you very
&gt; much for that.
&gt; 
&gt; Guenter, special thanks for reviewing and accepting my patches to the hwmon and
&gt; watchdog subsystems. It was pleasure to be working with you.
&gt; 
&gt; Borislav, we disagreed and argued a lot. So my DW uMCTL2 DDRC EDAC patches even
&gt; got stuck in limbo for quite a long time. Anyway thank you for the time
&gt; you spent reviewing my patches and trying to explain your point.
&gt; 
&gt; * Borislav, it looks like I won't be able to work on my Synopsys EDAC patchsets
&gt; anymore. If you or somebody else could pick them up and finish up the work it
&gt; would be great (you can find it in the lore archive). The patches convert the
&gt; mainly Zynq(MP)-specific Synopsys EDAC driver to supporting the generic DW
&gt; uMCTL2 DDRC. It would be very beneficial for each platform based on that
&gt; controller.
&gt; 
&gt; Greg, we met several times in the mailing lists. You reviewed my patches sent
&gt; for the USB and TTY subsystems, and all the time the process was straight,
&gt; highly professional, and simpler than in the most of my other case.
&gt; Thank you very much for that.
&gt; 
&gt; Yoshihiro, Keguang, Yanteng, Kory, Cai and everybody I was lucky to meet in the
&gt; kernel mailing lists, but forgot to mention here. Thank you for the time spent
&gt; for our cooperative work on making the Linux kernel better. It was a pleasure to
&gt; meet you here.
&gt; 
&gt; I also wish to say huge thanks to the community members trying to
&gt; defend the kicked off maintainers and for support you expressed in
&gt; these days. It means a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; A little bit statics of my kernel-work at the end:
&gt; 
&gt; Signed-off patches: 518
&gt; Reviewed and Acked patches: 253
&gt; Tested patches: 80
&gt; 
&gt; You might say not the greatest achievement for seven years comparing to some
&gt; other developers. Perhaps. But I meant each of these tags, be sure.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess that's it. If you ever need some info or consultation regarding the
&gt; drivers I used to maintain or the respective hardware or the Synopsys IP-cores
&gt; (about which I've got quite comprehensive knowledge by this time), feel free to
&gt; reach me out via this email. I am always willing to help to the community
&gt; members.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope we'll meet someday in more pleasant circumstances and drink a
&gt; couple or more beers together. But now it's time to say good bye.
&gt; Sorry for a long-read text. I wish good luck on your Linux-way.
&gt;

<span>&gt; Hello Linux-kernel community,
&gt; 
&gt; I am sure you have already heard the news caused by the recent Greg'
&gt; commit
&gt; 6e90b675cf942e ("MAINTAINERS: Remove some entries due to various
&gt; compliance
&gt; requirements."). As you may have noticed the change concerned some of
&gt; the
&gt; Ru-related developers removal from the list of the official kernel
&gt; maintainers,
&gt; including me.
&gt; 
&gt; The community members rightly noted that the _quite_ short commit log
&gt; contained
&gt; very vague terms with no explicit change justification. No matter how
&gt; hard I
&gt; tried to get more details about the reason, alas the senior
&gt; maintainer I was
&gt; discussing the matter with haven't given an explanation to what
&gt; compliance
&gt; requirements that was. I won't cite the exact emails text since it
&gt; was a private
&gt; messaging, but the key words are "sanctions", "sorry", "nothing I can
&gt; do", "talk
&gt; to your (company) lawyer"... I can't say for all the guys affected by
&gt; the
&gt; change, but my work for the community has been purely _volunteer_ for
&gt; more than
&gt; a year now (and less than half of it had been payable before that).
&gt; For that
&gt; reason I have no any (company) lawyer to talk to, and honestly after
&gt; the way the
&gt; patch has been merged in I don't really want to now. Silently, behind
&gt; everyone's
&gt; back, _bypassing_ the standard patch-review process, with no affected
&gt; developers/subsystem notified - it's indeed the worse way to do what
&gt; has been
&gt; done. No gratitude, no credits to the developers for all these years
&gt; of the
&gt; devoted work for the community. No matter the reason of the situation
&gt; but
&gt; haven't we deserved more than that? Adding to the GREDITS file at
&gt; least, no?..
&gt; 
&gt; I can't believe the kernel senior maintainers didn't consider that
&gt; the patch
&gt; wouldn't go unnoticed, and the situation might get out of control
&gt; with
&gt; unpredictable results for the community, if not straight away then in
&gt; the middle
&gt; or long term perspective. I am sure there have been plenty ways to
&gt; solve the
&gt; problem less harmfully, but they decided to take the easiest path.
&gt; Alas what's
&gt; done is done. A bifurcation point slightly initiated a year ago has
&gt; just been
&gt; fully implemented. The reason of the situation is obviously in the
&gt; political
&gt; ground which in this case surely shatters a basement the community
&gt; has been built
&gt; on in the first place. If so then God knows what might be next (who
&gt; else might
&gt; be sanctioned...), but the implemented move clearly sends a bad
&gt; signal to the
&gt; Linux community new comers, to the already working volunteers and
&gt; hobbyists like
&gt; me.
</span>
I'm also quite shocked and even baffled about how this has been
handled. This is not how leaders should communicate difficult or big
decisions. It's the most disappointing event I have witnessed in the
project.

There is the form and there is the content â about the content one
cannot do much, when the state he or his organization resides in gives
an order.

But about the form one can indeed do much. No "Thank you!", no "I hope
we can work together again once the world has become sane(r)"... srsly,
what the hell.

No idea why they felt the need to do it that way, but it certainly is
not the open source way, neither is it decent or honorable.


That said, thank you for all your work, Serge!

I believe that nothing that has been accomplished with a candid mindset
and decent intentions is ever done for nothing, although it often pays
off way differently than expected.
So I hope this will be the case for you, too.

Take care,
Philipp


<span>&gt; 
&gt; Thus even if it was still possible for me to send patches or perform
&gt; some
&gt; reviews, after what has been done my motivation to do that as a
&gt; volunteer has
&gt; simply vanished. (I might be doing a commercial upstreaming in future
&gt; though).
&gt; But before saying goodbye I'd like to express my gratitude to all the
&gt; community
&gt; members I have been lucky to work with during all these years.
&gt; Specifically:
&gt; 
&gt; NTB-folks, Jon, Dave, Allen. NTB was my starting point in the kernel
&gt; upstream
&gt; work. Thanks for the initial advices and despite of very-very-very
&gt; tough reviews
&gt; with several complete patchset refactorings, I learned a lot back
&gt; then. That
&gt; experience helped me afterwards. Thanks a lot for that. BTW since
&gt; then I've got
&gt; several thank-you letters for the IDT NTB and IDT EEPROM drivers. If
&gt; not for you
&gt; it wouldn't have been possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Andy, it's hard to remember who else would have given me more on my
&gt; Linux kernel
&gt; journey as you have. We first met in the I2C subsystem review of my
&gt; DW I2C
&gt; driver patches. Afterwards we've got to be frequently meeting here
&gt; and there -
&gt; GPIO, SPI, TTY, DMA, NET, etc, clean/fixes/features patch(set)s.
&gt; Quite heat
&gt; discussions in your first reviews drove me crazy really. But all the
&gt; time we
&gt; managed to come up with some consensus somehow. And you never quit
&gt; the
&gt; discussions calmly explaining your point over and over. You never
&gt; refused to
&gt; provide more detailed justification to your requests/comments even
&gt; though you
&gt; didn't have to. Thanks to that I learned how to be patient to
&gt; reviewers
&gt; and reviewees. And of course thank you for the Linux-kernel
&gt; knowledges and all
&gt; the tips and tricks you shared.
&gt; 
&gt; * Andy, please note due to the situation I am not going to work on my
&gt; DW DMAC
&gt; fixes patchset anymore. So if you ever wish to have DW UART stably
&gt; working with the
&gt; DW DMA-engine driver, then feel free to pick the series up:
&gt; Link:
&gt; <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/dmaengine/20240911184710.4207-1-fancer.lancer@gmail.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/dmaengine/20240911184710.4207-1-fancer.lancer@gmail.com/</a>
&gt; 
&gt; Linus (Walleij), after you merged one of my pretty much heavy
&gt; patchset in you
&gt; suggested to me to continue the DW APB GPIO driver maintaining. It
&gt; was a first
&gt; time I was asked to maintain a not-my driver. Thank you for the
&gt; trust. I'll
&gt; never forget that.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark, thank you very much for entrusting the DW APB SSI driver
&gt; maintenance to
&gt; me. I've put a lot of efforts into making it more generic and less
&gt; errors-prune,
&gt; especially when it comes working under a DMA-engine control or
&gt; working in the
&gt; mem-ops mode. I am sure the results have been beneficial to a lot of
&gt; DW
&gt; SPI-controller users since then.
&gt; 
&gt; Damien, our first and last meeting was at my generic AHCI-platform
&gt; and DW AHCI
&gt; SATA driver patches review. You didn't make it a quick and easy path.
&gt; But still
&gt; all the reviews comments were purely on the technical basis, and the
&gt; patches
&gt; were eventually merged in. Thank you for your time and experience
&gt; I've got from
&gt; the reviews.
&gt; 
&gt; Paul, Thomas, Arnd, Jiaxun, we met several times in the mailing list
&gt; during my
&gt; MIPS P5600 patches and just generic MIPS patches review. It was
&gt; always a
&gt; pleasure to discuss the matters with such brilliant experts in the
&gt; field. Alas
&gt; I've spent too much time working on the patches for another
&gt; subsystems and
&gt; failed to submit all the MIPS-related bits. Sorry I didn't keep my
&gt; promise, but
&gt; as you can see the circumstances have suddenly drawn its own
&gt; deadline.
&gt; 
&gt; Bjorn, Mani, we were working quite a lot with you in the framework of
&gt; the DW
&gt; PCIe RC drivers. You reviewed my patches. I helped you to review
&gt; another patches
&gt; for some time. Despite of some arguing it was always a pleasure to
&gt; work with
&gt; you.&nbsp; Mani, special thanks for the cooperative DW eDMA driver
&gt; maintenance. I
&gt; think we were doing a great work together.
&gt; 
&gt; Paolo, Jakub, David, Andrew, Vladimir, Russell. The network subsystem
&gt; and
&gt; particularly the STMMAC driver (no doubt the driver sucks) have
&gt; turned to be a
&gt; kind of obstacle on which my current Linux-kernel activity has
&gt; stopped. I really
&gt; hope that at least in some way my help with the incoming STMMAC and
&gt; DW XPCS
&gt; patches reviews lightened up your maintainance duty. I know Russell
&gt; might
&gt; disagree, but I honestly think that all our discussions were useful
&gt; after all,
&gt; at least for me. I also think we did a great work working together
&gt; with Russell
&gt; on the DW GMAC/QoS ETH PCS patches. Hopefully you'll find a time to
&gt; finish it up
&gt; after all.

<p dir="auto">This project is an RF Signal Scanner built using an ESP32, AD8317 RF detector, and various other components. It's designed to detect and measure RF signals in the environment and display the signal strength on an OLED display. It's useful to find hidden cameras, wiretapping devices, and other RF-enabled devices.</p>

<p dir="auto">This video had V3 which required a 9V battery and an external USB Power Supply. V4 here snaps together with zero tools, has space in the bottom for a battery, and a charge controller, and in place of the 9V batter you have a boost converter.  Now you only need 1 battery, and it should last weeks or months depending on usage cycles.</p>

Making art is hard. But art is mostly about surfacing the inner world, and only in part about skill. Itâs unfortunate that art selects so strongly for skill. Can we decorrelate the two? It seems so. Cheap interpolative* creativity used by 8 billion non-artists surely surfaces new views of the world.</p><p>For these reasons and since I suck at art Iâve been very excited about the various AI-driven art forms popping up. A couple of months ago I started playing with real-time diffusion of my webcam feed using <a href="https://github.com/cumulo-autumn/StreamDiffusion">StreamDiffusion</a>. Specifically, with the intent of generating pretty visuals and hoping to elicit new/interesting feelings. Although itâs very fun, the laptop form-factor breaks the illusion. It feels all temporary and geeky. So, I recently built an LCD frame that can be hanged to a wall with minimal illusion breakers. What I really like about this setup is that making it a proper object opens up new channels of interaction. Itâs no longer just a screen, it has permanence. You can leave it there, come back to it at a different time, in a different mood, with different lighting, objects, friends, etc.</p><div><video width="300" height="550" object-fit="fill" controls="">

<p>21st October 2024</p>



<p>Iâm a huge fan of Claudeâs <strong>Artifacts</strong> feature, which lets you prompt <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> to create an interactive Single Page App (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and then view the result directly in the Claude interface, iterating on it further with the bot and then, if you like, copying out the resulting code.</p>
<p>I was digging around in my <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9450526-how-can-i-export-my-claude-ai-data">Claude activity export</a> (I built a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-to-sqlite">claude-to-sqlite</a> tool to convert it to SQLite I could explore it in <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>) and decided to see how much Iâd used artifacts <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-to-sqlite/issues/2#issuecomment-2425658909">in the past week</a>. It was more than I expected!</p>
<p>Being able to spin up a full interactive applicationâsometimes as an illustrative prototype, but often as something that directly solves a problemâis a remarkably useful tool.</p>
<p>Hereâs most of what Iâve used Claude Artifacts for in the past seven days. Iâve provided prompts or a full transcript for nearly all of them.</p>

<h4 id="url-to-markdown-with-jina-reader">URL to Markdown with Jina Reader</h4>
<p>I got frustrated at how hard it was to copy and paste the entire text of a web page into an LLM while using Mobile Safari. So I built a simple web UI that lets me enter a URL, calls the <a href="https://jina.ai/reader">Jina Reader API</a> to generate Markdown (which uses Puppeteer under the hood) and gives me that Markdown with a convenient âCopyâ button.</p>
<p>Try it out: <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/jina-reader">https://tools.simonwillison.net/jina-reader</a> (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/jina-reader.html">Code</a>)</p>

Then a box showing Markdown extracted from the page with a Copy to Clipboard button. Then a frame showing a preview of the rendered Markdown."></p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/14/my-jina-reader-tool/?uu">more about that project here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="sqlite-in-wasm-demo">SQLite in WASM demo</h4>
<p>A Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41851051#41851788">conversation about SQLiteâs WASM build</a> lead me to the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm">@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm</a> package on NPM, and I decided to knock together a quick interactive demo.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/sqlite-wasm.jpg" alt="Pelican Sightings in Half Moon Bay - a textarea with select * from pelican sightings, an execute query button and a table displaying 5 matching rows."></p>

<p>I found myself wanting to extract all of the underlying URLs that were linked to from a chunk of text on a web page. I realized the fastest way to do that would be to spin up an artifact that could accept rich-text HTML pastes and use an HTML parser to extract those links.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/extract-urls.jpg" alt="Extract URLs tool. Content pasted. URLs extracted. Shows a list of extracted URLs."></p>

<h4 id="clipboard-viewer">Clipboard viewer</h4>
<p>Messing around with a tool that lets you paste in rich text reminded me that the browser clipboard API is a fascinating thing. I decided to build a quick debugging tool that would let me copy and paste different types of content (plain text, rich text, files, images etc) and see what information was available to me in the browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/clipboard-viewer.jpg" alt="Clipboard format viewer. Paste here or anywhere on the page. Shows text/html with a fragment of HTML, text/plain with some text and Clipboard Event Information showing event type paste and formats available text/html and text/plain"></p>

<h4 id="pyodide-repl">Pyodide REPL</h4>
<p>I didnât put a lot of effort into this one. While poking around with Claude Artifacts in the browser DevTools I spotted this CSP header:</p>
<p><code>content-security-policy: default-src https://www.claudeusercontent.com; script-src 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.claudeusercontent.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/; connect-src https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/; worker-src https://www.claudeusercontent.com blob:; style-src 'unsafe-inline' https://www.claudeusercontent.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src blob: data: https://www.claudeusercontent.com; font-src data: https://www.claudeusercontent.com; object-src 'none'; base-uri https://www.claudeusercontent.com; form-action https://www.claudeusercontent.com; frame-ancestors https://www.claudeusercontent.com https://claude.ai https://preview.claude.ai https://claude.site https://feedback.anthropic.com; upgrade-insecure-requests; block-all-mixed-content</code></p>
<p>The <code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/</code> in there caught my eye, because it suggested that the Anthropic development team had deliberately set it up so <a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a>âPython compiled to WebAssemblyâcould be loaded in an artifact.</p>
<p>I got Claude to spin up a very quick demo to prove that this worked:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/pyodide-repl.jpg" alt="Pyodide Python REPL -   3 + 4 returns 7. A textarea to enter python code and a Run button."></p>
<p><a href="https://claude.site/artifacts/a3f85567-0afc-4854-b3d3-3746dd1a37f2">https://claude.site/artifacts/a3f85567-0afc-4854-b3d3-3746dd1a37f2</a></p>
<p>Iâve not bothered to extract this one to my own <code>tools.simonwillison.net</code> site yet because itâs purely a proof of concept that Pyodide can load correctly in that environment.</p>
<h4 id="photo-camera-settings-simulator">Photo Camera Settings Simulator</h4>
<p>I was out on a photo walk and got curious about whether or not JavaScript could provide a simulation of camera settings. I didnât get very far with this one (prompting on my phone while walking along the beach)âthe result was buggy and unimpressive and I quickly lost interest. It did expose me to the <a href="http://fabricjs.com/">Fabric.js</a> library for manipulating canvas elements though.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/photo-settings.jpg" alt="Photo Camera Settings Simulator. An image has been selected - but only the corner of the image displays with some buggy broken resize handles. Three sliders at the bottom show Exposure, Contrast and SAturation."></p>

<h4 id="llm-pricing-calculator">LLM pricing calculator</h4>
<p>This one I <em>did</em> finish. I built this pricing calculator as part of my experiments with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/17/video-scraping/">Video scraping using Google Gemini</a>, because I didnât trust my own calculations for how inexpensive Gemini was! Here are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/17/video-scraping/#bonus-calculator">detailed notes</a> on how I built that.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/llm-pricing-calculator.jpg" alt="Screenshot of LLM Pricing Calculator interface. Left panel: input fields for tokens and costs.

<h4 id="yaml-to-json-converter">YAML to JSON converter</h4>
<p>I wanted to remind myself how certain aspects of YAML syntax worked, so I span up a quick YAML to JSON converter tool that shows the equivalent JSON live as you type YAML.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/yaml-json.jpg" alt="YAML to JSON converter. In the top textarea is YAML. Below it is pretty-printed JSON output."></p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/d861edb70a3572cb03de6f98a0caf3bc">Claude transcript</a></p>
<h4 id="openai-audio">OpenAI Audio</h4>
<p>This is my most interesting artifact of the week. I was exploring OpenAIâs new Audio APIs and decided to see if I could get Claude to build we a web page that could request access to my microphone, record a snippet of audio, then base64 encoded that and send it to the OpenAI API.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/18/openai-audio/">the full details on how I built this tool</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/openai-audio-card.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the OpenAI Audio tool. A start recording button is visible, and a 00:00 timer, and a playback audio element. There is a textarea for a prompt and a Submit to API button."></p>
<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/openai-audio">https://tools.simonwillison.net/openai-audio</a></p>
<p>Claude Artifacts canât make API requests to external hosts directly, but it can still spin up enough of a working version that itâs easy to take that, move it to different hosting and finish getting it working.</p>
<p>I wrote more about this API pattern in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/26/gemini-bounding-box-visualization/">Building a tool showing how Gemini Pro can return bounding boxes for objects in images</a>.</p>
<h4 id="qr-code-decoder">QR Code Decoder</h4>
<p>I was in a meeting earlier this week where one of the participants shared a slide with a QR code (for joining a live survey tool). I didnât have my phone with me, so I needed a way to turn that QR code into a regular URL.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/qr.gif" alt="QR Code Decoder  Uses jsQR by Cosmo Wolfe  Upload, drag and drop, or paste a QR code image: Select a file or drag and drop here  I drag on a QR code and the box says:  Decoded content: https://simonwillison.net/"></p>

<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/qr">https://tools.simonwillison.net/qr</a></p>
<p>Knocking up this QR decoder in Claude Artifacts took just a few seconds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build an artifact (no react) that lets me paste in a QR code and displays the decoded information, with a hyperlink if necessary</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ ... ]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>have a file open box that also lets you drag and drop and add a onpaste handler to the page that catches pasted images as well</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c2b0c42cd1541d6ed6bfe5c17d638039">Full conversation here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="image-converter-and-downloader">Image Converter and Page Downloader</h4>
<p>Another very quick prototype. On Hacker News someone demonstrated a neat idea for a tool that let you drop photos onto a page and it would bake them into the page as base64 URLs such that you could âsave as HTMLâ and get a self-contained page with a gallery.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41876750#41880857">suggested they could add</a> a feature that generated a âDownload linkâ with the new page baked inâuseful on mobile phones that donât let you âSave as HTMLââand got Claude to knock up a quick prototype:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/image-converter-and-downloader.jpg" alt="Image converter and page downloader - I've selected an image and there is now a Download Page link below that image."></p>
<p>In this case I shared the code in <a href="https://gist.github.com/egeozcan/b27e11a7e776972d18603222fa523ed4">a Gist</a> and then used the new-to-me <code>https://gistpreview.github.io/?GIST_ID_GOES_HERE</code> trick to render the result:</p>
<p><a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?14a2c3ef508839f26377707dbf5dd329">https://gistpreview.github.io/?14a2c3ef508839f26377707dbf5dd329</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gistpreview/gistpreview.github.io">gistpreview</a> turns out to be a really quick way to turn a LLM-generated demo into a page people can view.</p>

<h4 id="html-entity-escaper">HTML Entity Escaper</h4>
<p>Another example of on-demand software: I needed to escape the HTML entities in a chunk of text on my phone, so I got Claude to build me a tool for that:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/html-entities.jpg" alt="HTML entity escaper. In the input box I have typed in text with some double quotes. The output box has those correctly escaped, and a copy to clipboard button."></p>
<p><a href="https://claude.site/artifacts/46897436-e06e-4ccc-b8f4-3df90c47f9bc">https://claude.site/artifacts/46897436-e06e-4ccc-b8f4-3df90c47f9bc</a></p>
<p>Hereâs the prompt I used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build an artifact (no react) where I can paste text into a textarea and it will return that text with all HTML entities - single and double quotes and less than greater than ampersand - correctly escaped. The output should be in a textarea accompanied by a "Copy to clipboard" button which changes text to "Copied!" for 1.5s after you click it. Make it mobile friendly</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/10/you-can-use-text-wrap-balance-on-icons/">Terence Eden</a> I decided to do a quick experiment with the <code>text-wrap: balance</code> CSS property. I got Claude to build me an example nav bar with a slider and a checkbox. I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/20/you-can-use-text-wrap-balance-on-icons/">wrote about that here</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Animated demo. A navigation menu with 13 items - things like Home and About and Services and a products. These are wrapped on four lines with 4, 4, 4 and then 1 item.

<p>I was volunteering as a HAM radio communications operator for <a href="https://hmbpumpkinfest.com/featured-exhibits/great-pumpkin-run.html">the Half Moon Bay Pumpkin Run</a> and got nervous that Iâd mess up using the phonetic alphabetâso I had Claude build me this tool:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/phonetic-alphabet.jpg" alt="ARES PHonetic Alphabet Converter. I have entered the text Cleo is a lobster. After clicking the Convert button I get the output Charlie Lima Echo Oscar (Space) India Sierra (Space) Alpha (Space) Lima Oscar Sierra Tango Echo Romeo"></p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6ad4133c93e22df4c0ce731fdd7a2a91">Claude transcript here</a>. Amusingly it built it in Python first, then switched to JavaScript after I reminded it that I wanted âan interactive web appâ.</p>
<h4 id="this-is-so-useful-and-so-much-fun-">This is so useful, and so much fun!</h4>
<p>As you can see, Iâm a <em>heavy</em> user of this featureâI just described 14 projects produced in a single week. Iâve been using artifacts since they were released <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/20/claude-35-sonnet/">on 20th June</a> (alongside the excellent Claude 3.5 Sonnet, still my daily-driver LLM) and Iâm now at a point where I fire up a new interactive artifact several times a day.</p>
<p>Iâm using artifacts for idle curiosity, rapid prototyping, library research and to spin up tools that solve immediate problems.</p>
<p>Most of these tools took less than five minutes to build. A few of the more involved ones took longer than that, but even the OpenAI Audio one took <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0a4b826d6d32e4640d67c6319c7ec5ce">11:55am to 12:07pm</a> for the first version and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a04b844a5e8b01cecd28787ed375e738">12:18pm to 12:27pm</a> for the second iterationâso 21 minutes total.</p>
<p>Take a look at my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">claude-artifacts</a> tag for even more examples, including <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/6/svg-to-jpg-png/">SVG to JPG/PNG</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/21/markdown-and-math-live-renderer/">Markdown and Math Live Renderer</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/26/image-resize-and-quality-comparison/">Image resize and quality comparison</a>.</p>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/dashboard-tools/">dashboard</a> of every post that links to my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> site, and the underlying <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">simonw/tools</a> GitHub repo includes more unlisted tools, most of which link to their Claude conversation transcripts in their commit history.</p>
<p>Iâm beginning to get a little frustrated at their limitationsâin particular the way artifacts are unable to make API calls, submit forms or even link out to other pages. Iâll probably end up spinning up my own tiny artifacts alternative based on everything Iâve learned about them so far.</p>
<p>If youâre <em>not</em> using artifacts, I hope Iâve given you a sense of why theyâre one of my current favourite LLM-based tools.</p>

Times have changed, and it wonât be easy for Sony as it faces fierce competition from cheap gadgets that do more than just make phone calls.</p><p>The new analysis of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/">this series</a> dives into the contemporary technology behind Sonyâs new delivery. Do expect to find recognisable circuitry - perhaps too familiar. Even so, Sony made clear efforts to steer away from any resemblance to the smartphone market.</p><h3 id="models-and-variants">Models and variants</h3><p>As the console sat on store shelves, Sony revisited its product strategy multiple times, leading to three variants of the PSVita being shipped throughout its lifecycle:</p><ul><li>The <strong>original</strong> PSVita (sometimes called the âFatâ model) is the series debut.</li><li>The <strong>Slim</strong> revision retains the same architecture, but exchanges the OLED screen for an LCD to reduce costs. Furthermore, it doesnât offer a 3G-capable variant anymore. It does, however, feature a bigger eMMC chipâ¦ only 52 MB larger! For some strange reason, that was enough to provide an internal 1 GB memory card. In any case, Iâll explain more in the âGamesâ section.</li><li>The <strong>PlayStation TV</strong> is just a Slim motherboard adapted for the non-portable setting.</li></ul><p>As you can see, the information in this article will easily apply to all three models, although I will dedicate extra paragraphs to talk about the puzzling eMMC changes of the last two variants.</p><h3 id="a-new-publishing-model">A new publishing model</h3><p>Until now, my delivery model involved finishing the whole analysis and then publishing a complete article at once. However, as I continue studying the 8th generation, my articles have considerably grown in complexity. They tend to take almost a year to finish, and the review process has become too cumbersome. Thus, for a change, Iâd like to try a new phased approach where I publish by sections instead, starting with the CPU. This will also make the reviewing stage more efficient.</p><p>Having said that, letâs start with the first section.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Sony had been an avid adopter of MIPS technology since the original PlayStation. Even at times when SGI/MIPS was losing market share in the late 90s, Sony shipped a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/">successful product</a> carrying MIPSâ <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#mips-after-the-turn-of-the-century">revamped line</a>. However, the next decade proved bitter: ARM managed to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-ds/#turning-points">monopolise</a> the mobile market and MIPSâ adoption only diminished. Thus, Sony ultimately put their faith in an ARM CPU instead, and Toshiba (Sonyâs close manufacturing <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-2/#a-special-order-for-sony">partner</a>) would now play the role of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy-advance/#tab-1-2-a-new-cpu-venture">ARM licensee</a>.</p><p>The resulting motherboard only houses a handful of integrated circuits, but they package a mix of designs authored by different companies. The main chip is called <strong>Kermit</strong> <sup id="bibref:1"><a href="#bib:cpu-kermit" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></sup> (a name borrowed from âThe Muppetsâ), it features the largest amount of circuitry, and itâs where the main CPU resides.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/psvita/photos/kermit.eacea19e5654107edd286da36949155f606f9545d2ad9d8820542bb5e36b65b7.webp"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/psvita/photos/kermit.eacea19e5654107edd286da36949155f606f9545d2ad9d8820542bb5e36b65b7.webp"><img alt="Image" width="846" height="582" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/psvita/photos/_hu8cb4d5a93629ee790fbf786b462ec175_52358_e8af1d0c10002cb199314cd254d1e253.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>The Kermit chip in the original PSVita model. This tiny block houses multiple CPUs, GPUs and ~640 MB of RAMâ¦ how far weâve come!</figcaption></figure><p>Now, while Kermit is considered a <strong>System-On-Chip</strong> (SoC), it exceptionally manages to combine large amounts of memory and processors within the same package. This is thanks to Toshibaâs <strong>Stacked Chip SoC</strong> (SCS) fabrication model <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:cpu-scs" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup>. Within it, circuitry is piled on top of others - as opposed to being externally connected side-by-side. The direct consequence is an increase of bandwidth and a reduction of surface footprint, at the cost of a more complex heat dissipation design.</p><p>In any case, SCS fabrication enabled Sony and Toshiba to fit cutting-edge technology while maintaining an energy-efficient profile, just look at all the components Kermit houses:</p><ul><li>The <strong>main CPU</strong>, a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore.</li><li>The <strong>main GPU</strong>, a PowerVR SGX543MP4+ by Imagination Technologies.</li><li>Many <strong>accelerators</strong> (some proprietary, others off the shelf), including an âAVC Decoderâ, <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#taking-over-the-cpu">DMA Controllers</a>, a large DSP and security blocks (which includes hidden ROM space).</li><li><strong>Around 640 MB of RAM</strong> (split into multiple types).</li><li>Last but not least, <strong>legacy PlayStation Portable circuitry</strong> (the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#cpu">MIPS CPU</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#graphics">Graphics Engine</a>).</li></ul><p>â¦and throughout this article weâll take a look at each of those!</p><h3 id="the-main-cpu">The main CPU</h3><p>Our new study subject is the <strong>ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore</strong>, a very mature processor from ARM Ltd.&nbsp;</p><p>To make this study captivating and help understand all the technological progress since <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-3ds/#cpu">my last analysis</a> of the ARM11 CPU, Iâd like to begin with an overview of the new âCortexâ line.

At the same time, competitors across the pond <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#the-end-of-the-line">chose to avoid any mobile venture</a>.</li><li>The subsequent <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-ds/#arms-new-territories">StrongARM/ARM9</a> line granted the company a spot in the performance sector.</li><li><a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#the-end-of-the-line">As the competition faded</a>, the new <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-3ds/#cpu">ARM11 line</a> demonstrated this CPU could now partake on 3D applications.</li></ul><p>The next achievement would become <strong>Cortex</strong>: a new brand carrying a revised instruction set and processor line. This time, ARM would adopt practices traditionally found in the desktop/workstation market, eventually coming heads-to-head with Intelâs x86. Curiously enough, Cortexâs marketing strategy is very similar to Intelâs Pentium, in the sense that the name âCortexâ ultimately becomes an ambiguous term to hide the complicated identifications and variants of all its chips.</p><h5 id="the-cortex-line-up">The Cortex line-up</h5><p>With the announcement of Cortex as a brand, ARMâs product line diversified into three distinguishable sectors: <strong>industrial</strong>, <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>embedded</strong>. Thus, any Cortex CPU would be fitted into a âprofileâ (Cortex-R, Cortex-A and Cortex-M, respectively), each targeting one of these markets. For this study, weâll focus on the <strong>Cortex-A</strong> line, which focused on performance or âapplicationsâ (in other words, user devices); and made a profound impact on smartphones.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/psvita/cortexa8_phones.fce29b750612bf9558672988bda179ca1b946360bd89775cd85d61b65e454ac1.webp"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/psvita/cortexa8_phones.fce29b750612bf9558672988bda179ca1b946360bd89775cd85d61b65e454ac1.webp"><img alt="Image" width="1100" height="452" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/psvita/_hu544632fc7cf0c5975b0f2f30a9ae9eb1_48164_ad8fc51f938953fa3abeb0fad37f0e61.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>Some smartphones from the Cortex-A8 generation. From left to right: iPhone 3GS (2009), Nokia N900 (2009), Palm Pre (2009) and Nexus S (2010)</figcaption></figure><p>ARMâs first delivery for âapplicationsâ was the <strong>Cortex-A8</strong> CPU. It shipped in 2005, but it wasnât until four years later that smartphones started adopting it. The <strong>iPhone 3GS</strong>, <strong>Motorola Droid</strong> and <strong>Nokia N900</strong> were its debuting flagship carriers. Be as it may, the CPU canât work by itself, so these devices relied on Samsung and Texas Instruments to package all the necessary modules into a SoC (combining the CPU with the GPU, modem and other I/O).</p><p>Itâs worth mentioning that the Cortex CPU was also a decisive choice for manufacturers finally making the jump from <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-ds/#turning-points">Intelâs XScale</a>, such as RIM and its Blackberry line. On the other side, certain smartphones like the Toshiba TG01 and the HTC HD2 only adopted Cortexâs technology partially (they implement the same instruction set, but its microarchitecture was designed by Qualcomm instead).</p><p>Notice that these devices also coincide with a certain time when users considerably changed their attitude towards smartphones: these were initially trusted for trivial tasks such as text messages and e-mail, but now they were starting to provide access to bank accounts, with only a few years behind bringing contactless payments.</p><h5 id="more-news">More news</h5><p>Along the Cortex-A8 came the <strong>ARMv7</strong> instruction set. This is the continuation of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-3ds/#new-dialects">ARMv6 ISA</a> by expanding its multi-processing and SIMD capabilities <sup id="bibref:3"><a href="#bib:cpu-thomas_v7" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></sup>.</p><p>ARMv7 is the longest-living 32-bit ISA from ARM, but also the last one. Its wide-spread adoption would still be highly <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-3ds/#and-a-fragmented-distribution">fragmented</a>, mainly due to the split of Cortex into the aforementioned profiles (spawning different subsets of the ISA), existing adoption of the ARMv6 (i.e.&nbsp;the first Raspberry Pi and Nokiaâs Symbian platform only supported ARMv6) and the enlargement of Thumb. To avoid making this topic too dense, Iâve dedicated different sections further down to discuss these.</p><h4 id="the-core">The core</h4><p>So far Iâve talked about the Cortex-A8, thatâs the first Cortex CPU. But the PSVita actually bundles the succeeding CPU, the <strong>Cortex-A9</strong> (released two years later, in 2007). Itâs curious to see that this console was just a few months apart from the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-3ds/">Nintendo 3DS</a>, a console designed with horizontal innovation in mind.</p><p>Moving on, the full name of the PSVitaâs CPU is <strong>ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore</strong>. Overall, this means the CPU is a cluster made of <strong>multiple Cortex-A9 cores</strong>, <strong>four</strong> in this case. It runs at a clock speed of <strong>up to 500 MHz</strong> <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-psdev_cpu" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup>, an underwhelming number considering contemporary adopters of the quad-core A9, such as the Samsung Galaxy S III, reached speeds of 1.4 GHz <sup id="bibref:5"><a href="#bib:cpu-galaxy" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></sup>. Itâs possible that battery life was the main priority here. Nevertheless, clock speed is not the only decisive measurement, the inner workings of the CPU are as important.</p><p>Speaking of which, the new cores share many characteristics with their predecessor, the Cortex-A8, which includes <sup id="bibref:6"><a href="#bib:cpu-cortexa8_reference" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>The next-generation instruction set called <strong>ARMv7-A</strong>, I explain more details further on.</li><li><strong>64 KB of L1 cache</strong> which inherently follows the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-ds/#arms-new-territories">Harvard architecture</a>. Consequently, itâs divided into <strong>32 KB for data</strong> and <strong>32 KB for instructions</strong>.<ul><li>Cache coherency among the cores is automatically handled by the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-3ds/#tab-3-3-the-axi-bus">Snoop Control Unit</a>, previously featured in the ARM11MpCore.</li></ul></li><li><strong>2-issue superscalar</strong>: For the first time, ARM has brought <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#an-alternative-solution">instruction-level parallelism</a>. This means that, as long as there are no <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#delay-galore">hazards</a>, the CPU will try to execute two instructions using two separate pipelines. This increases the amount of instructions executed per clock cycle. <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-2/#tab-1-1-outperforming-success">MIPS</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/dreamcast/#the-offering">SuperH</a> brought this a decade before, but the two suffered a quick demise, so itâs now ARMâs turn to carry it forward.</li><li><strong>Dynamic branch prediction</strong>: The CPU now predicts the execution path by relying on two dedicated buffers while fetching instructions. The first anticipates whether an upcoming instruction will be a branch, and the next buffer maps the previous flow of the program. Finally, the latter is used to predict whether upcoming branches will be taken or not <sup id="bibref:7"><a href="#bib:cpu-cortexa8_imp" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></sup>.<ul><li>Itâs worth mentioning that this unit <strong>only predicts branching instructions</strong>, omitting other optimisation techniques such as <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy-advance/#commanding-the-cpu">conditionals</a> or the <code>IT</code> instructionâ¦ Maybe thatâs a hint about the future of the ARM ISA.</li></ul></li><li>A <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#memory-management">Memory Management Unit</a> (MMU) with a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). This is already typical on most CPUs.<ul><li>By the way, in the case of the Cortex brand, only the âCortex-Aâ profile includes this package (the âCortex-Râ bundles an <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-vita/#focused-memory-management">MPU</a> instead and the âCortex-Mâ includes neither).</li></ul></li><li><strong>TrustZone</strong>: A new security subsystem that adds a dimension to the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-vita/#focused-memory-management">privilege levels</a> of the MMU. Itâs implemented on both the hardware level (by segregating buses between non-secure and secure peripherals) and the software level (by executing a secondary and isolated operating system that handles confidential data). The special OS is called <strong>Trusted Execution Environment</strong>.<ul><li>The OS model of TrustZone reminds me of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3/#cells-privileged-security">isolated SPU of Cell</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>NEON Media Processing Engine</strong> (MPE), a new co-processor that carries out vector and floating-point operations. Weâll dive more into it in the next sections.</li></ul><p>Now, the Cortex-A9 (found in the PSVita) improves the original design by applying significant enhancements <sup id="bibref:8"><a href="#bib:cpu-cortexa9_mpcore" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li><strong>Multi-core support</strong>. This is most evident by looking at Sonyâs choice of a quad-core package.<ul><li>As a side note, this also explains why portable devices like the iPad 2 and iPhone 4s (both carrying an A9) managed to debut a dual-core CPU.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Out-Of-Order execution</strong> through the use of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#revisiting-old-paradigms">register renaming</a>. This is a huge step for ARM in further scaling its <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#an-alternative-solution">Instruction level parallelism</a>, considering other chips like PowerPC were forced to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#revisiting-old-paradigms">abandon it</a>.<ul><li>This will also have a profound effect on the evolution of the ARM instruction set. You will see this in a future analysis of the Nintendo Switch.</li></ul></li><li>A <strong>variable-length pipeline</strong>, between <strong>8 and 11 stages</strong> depending on the operation. The total number may also increase if execution continues in the multimedia co-processor (explained in the next section).</li></ul><p>Moreover, Sony customised the package by adding one of ARMâs upgrades called <strong>Primelink Level 2 Cache Controller</strong> along with <strong>2 MB of L2 cache</strong> shared among all cores <sup id="bibref:9"><a href="#bib:cpu-primelink_l2" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></sup>. Primelink is a flexible cache subsystem which can be programmed with different types of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox-360/#shared-cache">cache associations</a>, from direct mapping to 16-way. If you are curious, years later ARM renamed the Primelink brand to âCoreLinkâ <sup id="bibref:10"><a href="#bib:cpu-corelink_l2" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></sup>.</p><h4 id="the-grown-up-isa">The grown-up ISA</h4><p>The ARMv7 instruction set in the Cortex-A9 features a multitude of extensions. The majority of changes will be in the form of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/dreamcast/#special-work">SIMD capabilities</a> and multiprocessing, youâll notice this when we take a closer look into the novelties of the ARMv7.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-a-quick-glance-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-a-quick-glance">A quick glance</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-overshadowing-features-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-overshadowing-features">Overshadowing features</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-a-quick-glance"><h5 id="tab-2-1-a-quick-glance">A quick glance</h5><p>ARMv7 is a superset of the ARMv6 ISA. Its additions can be grouped into four areas: VFPv3, NEON, Security Extension and multi-processing. I explain each further down.</p><p>Moreover, the alternative <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy-advance/#tab-2-3-squeezing-performance">Thumb ISA</a> (previously enhanced with <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-ds/#tab-1-2-arm946e-s">Thumb v2</a>) has undergone a major revision called <strong>Thumb-2</strong>. Truth to be told, it already debuted on embedded ARMv6 CPUs (implementing the ARMv6T2 variant), but it has now become a standard on the Cortex-A line.</p><p>On the other side, itâs worth mentioning that <strong>Thumb-2EE</strong>, the successor of the deprecated <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#the-hidden-co-processor">Jazelle</a>, has been left unused or even excluded from many Cortex-A CPUs. I donât think the Vitaâs SoC even bothers implementing this. If you want an idea of its adoption back in the day, let me tell you that Dalvik (Androidâs Java interpreter, to put it simply) didnât even bother using Jazelle/Thumb-2EE at all. That tells you the general attitude towards ARMâs Java efforts.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-overshadowing-features"><h5 id="tab-2-2-overshadowing-features">Overshadowing features</h5><p>Back to the interesting bit, Thumb-2 is a significant revamp of Thumb because it <strong>adds 32-bit instructions</strong> <sup id="bibref:11"><a href="#bib:cpu-thomas_thumb" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></sup>. Considering Thumb originally only bundled 16-bit opcodes, it now has filled all the missing gaps when compared to the master ISA (ARM). Now, in contrast with ARM, Thumb-2 offers greater density and is only missing the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy-advance/#commanding-the-cpu">conditionals</a>. Even so, Thumb-2 manages to bridge this functionality by including an exclusive <code>IT</code> instruction.</p><p>Nevertheless, Thumbâs renovation unfortunately means more fragmentation and confusion, eventually to the point assembler developers canât decide which instruction set to use. âLuckyâ for them, ARM also devised a specification called <strong>Unified Assembler Language</strong> (UAL) that aimed to consolidate all ISAs in a single codebase that can target both ARM and Thumb-2 ISAs. This allows programs written in UAL to be assembled for all variants of Cortex CPUs (some of which implement ARM and Thumb-2 ISA while others only support Thumb-2). Behind the scenes, UAL is just the union of ARM and Thumb-2 opcodes, the assembler then skips opcodes based on the target CPU. For instance, when it comes to writing a branching subroutine, programmers must write the two types of branching opcodes in the same routine (ARMâs conditionals and Thumb-2âs <code>IT</code> instruction) - effectively âduplicatingâ code. However, the assembler then decides which opcodes to parse based on the target processor.</p><p>In the case of using programming languages (C, Objective-C, C++, etc.), the decision is much simpler, <strong>compilers default to Thumb-2 for assembly generation</strong> <sup id="bibref:12"><a href="#bib:cpu-uni_fund" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></sup>, mainly due to its efficient code density and rare performance penalties. Thus, smartphone apps and, by extension, applications for the PSVita, are mainly compiled into Thumb-2 instead of ARM.</p></div></div></div><h5 id="more-accelerators">More accelerators</h5><p>The most notable component of the Cortex-A9, in particular for the PSVita, is the <strong>Media Processing Engine</strong> (MPE). This is ARMâs new coprocessor for 3D applications. Itâs been engineered in a very convoluted way, however, as it executes two different but related instruction sets:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Vector Floating-Point v3</strong> (VFPv3): A continuation of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-3ds/#tab-3-1-the-original-mpcore">VFPv2</a> for floating-point capabilities. Itâs IEEE-754 compliant and now extended to provide instructions like <code>VCVT</code> (to convert between fixed-point and floating-point values) and <code>VMOV</code> (to transfer values between the CPU and the FPU register file). This is helpful since <strong>the VFP only understands 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point values</strong>.<ul><li>The exact variant included in the Cortex-A9 is called âVFPv3-D32â, meaning it includes <strong>thirty-two 64-bit registers</strong>.</li><li>Even though this ISA contains the word âvectorâ, ARMv7 deprecated the use of the vector instructions and the Cortex-A9 includes none <sup id="bibref:13"><a href="#bib:cpu-cortexa9_mpe" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></sup>. <em>So much for being called a âvector FPUââ¦</em></li></ul></li><li>The <strong>NEONv1</strong>, also known as âARMv7 Advanced SIMDâ, is the <em>real</em> vector instruction set, enabling to operate multiple scalars at once. NEON provides <strong>sixteen 128-bit registers</strong>, which can be also split into thirty-two 64-bit or 32-bit âvirtualâ registers. The integers being operated may be as big as 64 bits, while floating-point types canât surpass 32 bits.<ul><li>Itâs worth reminding that <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#coprocessors">Sonyâs predecessor vector unit</a> provided the immense amount of 128 registers, albeit 32-bit instead. If we do the math, the Cortex-A9 MPCore manages to match that number. Although, only 16 registers are accessible per core, and forget about the matrix-type addressing that made the VFPU special and efficient. On the bright side, perhaps thereâs a new optimisation opportunity by having multiple cores compute SIMD instructions in parallel.</li></ul></li></ul><p>NEON and VFPv3 share the same register file, but theyâre still considered separate ISAs. Considering ancestral processors like the SH-4 delivered SIMD operations <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/dreamcast/#special-work">by simply extending its FPU</a>, one can only wonder why ARM ended up producing two distinct ISAs. Well, the explanation is simple: <strong>neither is feature-complete</strong>. Particularly, <strong>VFPv3 doesnât support fixed-point</strong> while <strong>NEON is not compliant with the IEEE 754 standard</strong> <sup id="bibref:14"><a href="#bib:cpu-johnston" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></sup>. So, as an intermediate solution, the circuitry was segregated.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/psvita/axim.2a01779d1fb8a57e6be9e8da7700b6d1f53a6daced1f632cfcc592ad7ddda29a.webp"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/psvita/axim.2a01779d1fb8a57e6be9e8da7700b6d1f53a6daced1f632cfcc592ad7ddda29a.webp"><img alt="Image" width="819" height="1000" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/psvita/_hu60b5a6ff262668fe2c1190207efeefa9_33220_e3f5313e7bddc82982e9b95f94e256f2.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>The Dell Axim X51v (2005).<br>This high-end PDA carried an Intel XScale PXA270 CPU, compatible with the ARMv5 ISA but also bundles proprietary SIMD extensions, which were only available on Intelâs CPU line.

In my opinion, I believe NEON was rushed to rapidly counter <strong>Wireless MMX</strong> (Intelâs proprietary SIMD extension for the XScale, released a year before) as ARM didnât enjoy seeing Intel bundling exclusive instructions only available on the XScale <sup id="bibref:15"><a href="#bib:cpu-mmx" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></sup>. This is also complemented by the fact the official documentation on Cortexâs timings was hurried as well <sup id="bibref:16"><a href="#bib:cpu-timings" role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="the-master-bus">The master bus</h3><p>Another popular product from ARM, the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#the-hidden-co-processor">AMBA protocol</a> designed for interconnecting components, carries forward with the Cortex-A9.

The Cortex-A series was broken down into <strong>four more categories</strong>, ranging from the top performer to the most energy-efficient.

This is a complete and separate CPU package designed by Sonyâs close partner, Toshiba, for image and sound processing <sup id="bibref:17"><a href="#bib:cpu-toshiba_press" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></sup>. With functionality closer to a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), Venezia was also sold as a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy-advance/#tab-1-2-a-new-cpu-venture">synthesisable chip</a> for multimedia appliances (i.e.&nbsp;DVD players) <sup id="bibref:18"><a href="#bib:cpu-mep" role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a></sup>. Consequently, Sony selected it to accelerate multimedia tasks, so you could say itâs the spiritual successor of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#multimedia-cpu">Media Engine</a>.</p><p>Similarly to the MPCore, Venezia is a cluster, this time made of <strong>eight âMedia Processing Engineâ (MPE) cores</strong> operating at <strong>266.7 MHz</strong>. Notice that its naming confusingly overlaps with ARMâs vector accelerators, but they are different silicon. That being said, each of Toshibaâs MPEs houses <sup id="bibref:19"><a href="#bib:cpu-venezia" role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>A proprietary <strong>âMedia-embedded Processorâ (MeP) CPU</strong>. Particularly, a fifth revision called âMeP-c5â. This features a 32-bit RISC-based architecture.</li><li><strong>32 KB L1 cache</strong>, split into 16 KB for instructions and 16 KB for data.</li><li><strong>64 KB</strong> of general-purpose memory. This is where the MeP CPU executes its main program.</li><li>A <strong>DMA controller</strong> for transferring between internal and external memory.</li><li>An <strong>âImage Processingâ co-processor</strong> that executes 64-bit SIMD instructions. It can operate different packs of data, from eight 8-bit integers to two 32-bit ones.</li></ul><p>The cluster also features <strong>256 KB of L2 cache</strong>, but its main selling point is found in its instruction set, which is based on the <strong>Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) model</strong>. Essentially, a single line can encode multiple instructions at once. In the case of Venezia, three instructions (two for the image coprocessor and one for the CPU) <sup id="bibref:20"><a href="#bib:cpu-berkeley_dsp" role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></sup>. This requires a very clever compiler capable of packing instructions efficiently, however.</p><p>Interestingly enough, CPU designers once experimented with VLIW implementations back in the 90s when it was thought to be the future of mainstream CPUs. This led to Broadcomâs Firepath, the Transmeta Crusoe and, of course, the Intel Itanium - to name a few. However, the concept didnât gain traction outside particular uses, as the resulting benchmarks proved disappointing. Thus, interests soon shifted to other parallelism techniques, such as <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-2/#tab-1-1-outperforming-success">out-of-order execution</a>, which transferred the burden back to the CPU.</p><p>Be as it may, Venezia is only accessible through an abstract API called âCodec Engineâ <sup id="bibref:21"><a href="#bib:cpu-venezia" role="doc-biblioref">[21]</a></sup>, which implements different kinds of image and audio encoding/decoding tasks.</p></div><div id="tab-3-2-avc-decoder"><h4 id="tab-3-2-avc-decoder">AVC Decoder</h4><p>Next, weâve got the <strong>AVC Decoder</strong>. This is a relatively simpler DSP that, as the name indicates, only does one job: decompress video data encoded with âAdvanced Video Codingâ (AVC) <sup id="bibref:22"><a href="#bib:cpu-onscripter" role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a></sup>.</p><p>The decoder then outputs an uncompressed stream the GPU understands.</p></div></div></div><h3 id="memory-available">Memory available</h3><p>Enough about CPU talk! Letâs now take a look at the memory bundled within the PSVita.</p><p>As itâs customary with portable consoles, there are multiple memory types in this system.</p><h4 id="main-memory">Main memory</h4><p>To start with, at the top of Kermitâs stack, we find a large block that houses <strong>512 MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM</strong> and is used as the main working area. In case you are now wondering âI get the â512 MBâ part, but whatâs with all those initials?â, youâre not alone.</p><p>Thereâs a lot of terminology to unpack here, letâs start by breaking down the âLPDDR2 SDRAMâ name into two groups, from right to left, and then inspecting whatâs inside each:</p><ol><li><strong>SDRAM</strong> means âSynchronous Dynamic RAMâ.<ul><li>Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is the opposite of âStatic RAMâ (SRAM). DRAM is cheaper to produce but exhibits more latency. Thatâs why CPU cache is made of SRAM while external general-purpose memory is made of DRAM.</li><li>Synchronous DRAM (<a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#memory-layout">SDRAM</a>) means transfers are synchronised on par with the CPU clock, improving its throughput.</li></ul></li><li><strong>LPDDR2</strong> means âLow Power Double Data Rate 2â.<ul><li>Double Data Rate (DDR) states that transfers encode twice the information per cycle.</li><li>Low Power (LP) is a novelty here. This is not typical DDR, but a distinct variant called âLow Powerâ. It was initially conceived as a modification of DDR SDRAM, then became its own brand alongside others (as it happened with <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wiiu/#gddr3-or-ddr3">GDDR</a>). While DDR evolves to increase the bandwidth, new revisions of LP focus on reducing its operating voltage. As you may guess, its main adopters are phones and laptops.</li><li>The â2â at the end signifies itâs the second revision of LPDDR. Its specification was published in 2009 and, among other improvements, it only needs 1.2 Volts to work (compared to 1.35 V for DDR3).</li></ul></li></ol><h4 id="other-memory">Other memory</h4><p>Thereâs another large block of <strong>128 MB of Cached DRAM (CDRAM)</strong> predominantly connected to the GPU. CDRAM is yet-another type of RAM that combines the traditional (and cheap/slower) DRAM with a bit of SRAM <sup id="bibref:23"><a href="#bib:cpu-mitsu_cdram" role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></sup>. The latter acts as cache to speed up frequent memory access.</p><p>Last but not least, the SoC also fits <strong>16 KB of SRAM</strong>, but itâs reserved for system functions <sup id="bibref:24"><a href="#bib:cpu-memory" role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></sup>. You may want to know that itâs the exact amount of SRAM also found in the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#memory-available">PlayStation Portable</a>, youâll soon see why.</p><h3 id="one-last-cpu">One last CPU</h3><p>Last but not least, thereâs an additional CPU inside Kermit: The old <strong><a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/#the-new-portable-cpu">MIPS32 4k</a></strong> (the same one bundled with the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/">PlayStation Portable</a>) <sup id="bibref:25"><a href="#bib:cpu-trinity" role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a></sup>. The intention was to provide backwards compatibility with <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-portable/">PlayStation Portable</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/">PlayStation 1</a> games.

Thus, the functions of that co-CPU are replicated through Venezia instead.</p><p>For the remaining I/O, MIPS is not physically connected to the rest of the hardware, only the Cortex-A9 is. Thus, the PSP emulation software (running on the MIPS CPU) requests services to the ARM CPU by following a protocol called âRemote Procedure Callâ (RPC) <sup id="bibref:27"><a href="#bib:cpu-trinity" role="doc-biblioref">[27]</a></sup> <sup id="bibref:28"><a href="#bib:cpu-davee_kermit" role="doc-biblioref">[28]</a></sup>.</p><p>Finally, 64 MB of CDRAM are also reserved for this service.

Separately, Apple will pay the CFPB $25 million for its role in marketing and servicing the Apple Card.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->"Apple and Goldman Sachs illegally sidestepped their legal obligations for Apple Card borrowers," CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement, noting that the alleged misconduct affected hundreds of thousands of Apple Card customers.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The CFPB is banning Goldman from launching a new credit card unless it "can demonstrate that it can actually follow the law," Chopra added.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure><div> <p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==" alt="U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Rohit Chopra testifies before a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on " loading="eager" height="631" width="960"></p></div> <figcaption><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) director Rohit Chopra, in 2023.

The companies proceeded anyway.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->That prompted millions of dollars in expenses to consumers due to failures within the card program to share and investigate customer disputes, properly convey payment plan details through marketing and refunds through account servicing.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <figure><div> <p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAAQABAAACAUwAOw==" alt="CHINA - 2024/04/22: In this photo illustration, a Goldman Sachs logo is displayed on the screen of an iPhone.

    <p><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds"><em>Science</em></a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03464-x"><em>Nature</em></a>, two leading science journals, have revealed a growing problem: an alarming rise in fraudulent research papers produced by shady <a href="https://blog.mdpi.com/2022/05/09/paper-mills/">paper mill companies</a>. This  wave of fake studies is creating a major headache for the academic world, putting the integrity of global academic research at risk.</p>

<p><a href="https://publicationethics.org/publishers-perspective-paper-mills">Paper mill companies</a> offer authorship services to researchers, academics, and students who want their names listed as an author of a scientific article published in reputable scientific journals.</p>

<p>By paying around <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">â¬180 to â¬5000</a> (approximately US$197 - $5472), a person can have their name listed as the author of research paper, without having to painstakingly do research and write the results. No doubt, some experts refer to these paper mills as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514363/">illegal and criminal organizations</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">A 2023 research highlights</a> a dramatic increase in fraudulent scientific artiles traced back to paper mills. In just five years, the numbers of retractions soared <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">jumped</a> from 10 in 2019 to 2,099 in 2023.</p>

<p>Paper mills have also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00159-9">extremely overwhelmed</a> major scientific journal publishers. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/05/wiley-and-hindawi-to-retract-1200-more-papers-for-compromised-peer-review/">Hindawi and Wiley, publishers of open access journals in the UK</a>, for example, retracted around 1,200 paper mill articles in 2023. <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/15/journal-retracts-122-papers-at-once/">SAGE, a global publisher of books, journals and academic library resources</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/28/exclusive-elsevier-retracting-500-papers-for-shoddy-peer-review/">Elsevier, a scholarly publisher in the Netherlands</a> also retracted hundreds of paper mill articles in 2022.</p>

<p>Paper mills are found operating in countries whose research policies incentivise researchers to produce as many scientific articles as possible, such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5">China</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">Russia</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/03/the-situation-has-become-appalling-fake-scientific-papers-push-research-credibility-to-crisis-point">India</a> and <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/04/02/karimipour-saga-i-setting-boundaries/">Iran</a>.</p>

<p>However, their customer profile is quite diverse, from both developed and developing countries, including <a href="https://majalah.tempo.co/read/nasional/171351/academic-misconduct-guru-besar">Indonesia</a>, <a href="https://cen.acs.org/policy/publishing/Malaysia-wont-pay-researchers-publish/101/i35">Malaysia</a>, <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/12/14/german-authorities-on-papermills-and-whistleblowing/">Germany</a>, and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/meeting/house/115022/documents/HHRG-117-SY21-20220720-SD002.pdf">the United States (US)</a>.</p>

<p>Based on research data and investigative journalist reports from the last five years, I summarise how these paper mills operate and how to detect them.</p>

<h2>The paper mill playbook: tactics and oddities</h2>

<p><strong>1. Problematic articles</strong></p>

<p>Paper mills generally manipulate <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-022-06198-9">the process of publishing scientific articles</a>. These articles usually <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9759E2D516E7F26C9064ACF2CD3E6D#1">plagiarise other published articles</a>, contain <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C289EF83FBEC1823EACF837A600198#4">false</a> and stolen data, or include engineered and duplicated images.</p>

<p>They also offer <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/1DAA212C13697D91953FC9835DEB61">to rewrite scientific articles</a> using generative artificial intelligence tools, such as <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://quillbot.com/">Quillbot</a>, or to translate published articles from other languages into English.</p>

<p><strong>2. A promised path to publication</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9703783/">some cases</a>, paper mills  offer authorship slots before an article is accepted for publication. </p>

<p>In other cases, they offer authorship slots after the article is ready to be published by the journal.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is not uncommon for paper mills to sell authorship slots <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">with a guarantee</a> that the article will definitely be published. In fact, according to the conventions generally accepted in the academic community, no well-run journal can <a href="https://www.editage.com/insights/how-can-i-get-an-acceptance-letter-for-my-paper">give such a guarantee</a>.</p>

<p>Publishing decisions are normally made only after editors have considered the feedback from peer reviewers. This means, there is no possibility for a manuscript to secure acceptance before passing the peer review process.</p>

<p><strong>3. Fake reviews and corrupt deals</strong></p>

<p>Paper mills also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9703783/">offer a wide range of additional services</a>. For example, they offer <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ddns/2023/9784576/">fake peer review</a> services to convince potential buyers that the offered articles have passed rigorous review.</p>

<p>To smooth the way for their operations, some paper mills even operate like a cartel, bribing rogue journal editors to ensure publication. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">A 2024 investigation by a <em>Science</em> journalist</a> revealed that some scientific journal editors were offered as much as $20,000 to cooperate with these schemes. This investigation resulted in <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">more than 30 editors of reputable international journals</a> identified as involved in paper mill activities.</p>

<p><strong>4. Unusual collaboration patterns</strong></p>

<p>One of the peculiarities of paper mill articles is its strange mix of authors. <a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bjb/a/PDxQbGtKWvNw8Y9vdn78TrD/#">An article on the activity of ground beetles attacking crops in Kazakhstan</a>, for example, is written by authors who are neither affiliated with institutions in Kazakhstan nor experts in insects or agriculture. The authorsâ backgrounds are suspiciously heterogeneous, ranging from anaesthesia, dentistry, to biomedical engineering.</p>

<p><strong>5. Anonymous co-authors</strong></p>

<p>Prospective customers of paper mill services usually have to agree to the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/leap.1574">rules of confidentiality</a>. By agreeing to this rule, buyers have no idea which journal their article will target or who their co-authors will be. Often, the authors listed on the same paper donât even know each other.</p>

<h2>Spotting the red flags: how to detect paper mills articles</h2>

<p>Detecting scientific articles produced by paper mills often begins with analyzing retraction patterns carried out by journals. </p>

<p>This can be done in two ways: by tracking post-publication peer reviews on platforms like <a href="https://pubpeer.com/">PubPeer</a>, or by checking the <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?">Retraction Watch database</a>, a website that documents retractions of problematic scientific articles.</p>

<p>However, journals rarely state outright that a retraction is due to paper mill fraud. Instead, articles are typically pulled for reasons like <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1285126/full">improper inclusion of the name and order of authors</a>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08927022.2023.2267407">inclusion of many irrelevant citations or references</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/275AA93D2422B4E8B30B74DA0310FE#4">plagiarism</a>, or <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/12/26/one-image-duplicated-eight-papers-yes-eight/">inclusion of manipulated or duplicated images</a>.</p>

<p>The proportion of scientific articles retracted for being associated with paper mills is much smaller than the estimated total number of paper mill articles currently in circulation. </p>

<p>Retraction Watch data, as of May 2024, <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx">only recorded</a> 7,275 retractions of articles related to the <em>paper mill</em> out of a total of 44,000 retractions recorded. In fact, it is estimated that up to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03464-x">400,000 <em>paper mill</em> articles</a> have infiltrated scientific literature over the past two decades. </p>

<p>Despite significant efforts from <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/paper-mills-see-the-wood-for-the-trees-part-3">publishers</a> and the academic community through organizations such as <a href="https://united2act.org/signatories/">United2Act</a>, a <a href="https://united2act.org/about/">global alliance</a> initiated by <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a> and <a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/">STM</a>, these attempts are barely enough.</p>

<h2>How paper mills hurt the public</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-mills-bribing-editors-scholarly-journals-science-investigation-finds">UK Research Integrity Office</a>âan independent UK charity that offers support to the public, researchers and organisations to promote good academic research practiceâestimates that the paper mill industry has gained around $10 million globally.  </p>

<p>For example, a Russian paper mill could earn <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/russian-website-peddles-authorships-linked-reputable-journals">$6.5 million</a> if they sold all the authorship of scientific articles it produced from 2019 to 2021. </p>

<p>In Indonesia, this financial loss directly impacts the public. Public universities rely on the state budget, funded largely by taxpayers, and tuition fees from students to cover operational expenses, including research grants and publication incentives. </p>

<p>Though the exact financial toll of these paper mills is hard to pin down, it is clear that the public <a href="https://theconversation.com/pelanggaran-akademis-di-indonesia-masih-marak-merusak-ekosistem-riset-dan-menyalahgunakan-uang-rakyat-224516">are footing the bill</a> for fraudulent research practices, siphoning resources away from enuin academic advancements.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://benhouston3d.com/blog/risc-v-in-2024-is-slow">https://benhouston3d.com/blog/risc-v-in-2024-is-slow</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41925511">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After watching the rise of ARM displace Intel from most of my personal and server computing, I've been following the RISC-V architecture with intense interest. It's an exciting open-source ISA that has the potential to reshape the CPU landscape, but there's an important caveat: <strong>RISC-V is currently quite slow compared to modern CPUs in 2024</strong>. It is even slow compared to Raspberry PI boards.</p>
<h2>How Slow is RISC-V?</h2>
<p>You can start with these Geekbench performance scores for various RISC-V processors: <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=RISC-V">https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=RISC-V</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't seen any single threaded scores above 150 and no multi-threaded scores higher than 1500. The best result I've seen is the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/6945146">Sophgo Mango</a>'s score of 147 single threaded and 1300 multi-threaded. And the average score for RISC-V CPUs in Geekbench is around 80 single threaded and 400 multi-threaded.</p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8224953">Apple's M4</a> series is seeing scores around 3800 single-threaded and 15000 multi-threaded. A more fair comparison would be the Raspberry Pi series of CPUs, but even then it isn't close. The <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8448431">Raspberry Pi 5</a> scores around 1000 single-threaded and 2200 multi-threaded, while the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8443919">Raspberry Pi 4</a> scores 300 single-threaded and 739 multi-threaded.</p>
<p>So in that context, the fastest RISC-V CPU I could find is 25x slower than a top-of-the-line Apple M-series chip and ~7x slower than a Raspberry Pi 5 and 2x slower than a Raspberry Pi 4 for single-threaded performance. Those that say that RISC-V is a viable replacement for x86 or ARM in the near term are kidding themselves.</p>
<h2>Why Is RISC-V So Slow?</h2>
<p>RISC-V implementations in the wild lack advanced features that modern CPUs rely on for speed, including sophisticated pipelining mechanisms, out-of-order execution capabilities, advanced branch prediction, and multi-tiered cache hierarchies. Most commercial RISC-V chips remain in-order processors, meaning they execute instructions sequentially rather than optimizing their order for performance. This architectural simplicity creates a fundamental performance ceiling that's difficult to overcome without significant architectural changes.</p>
<h2>RISC-V is Great for Embedded Systems</h2>
<p>But even with slow performance, RISC-V is gaining significant traction in <strong>embedded applications</strong> where <strong>performance isn't the primary concern</strong>. In these contexts, cost and power efficiency are mort important than raw speed. A great example is Espressif's SoC lineup, which has largely moved to RISC-V. They demonstrate that RISC-V is ideal for IoT devices and other embedded systems where low power consumption is critical.</p>
<h2>Current Path to High Performance</h2>
<p>Several initiatives are working to address RISC-V's performance limitations. The <a href="https://github.com/riscv-boom/riscv-boom">Berkeley SonicBOOM</a> project has developed an experimental core featuring out-of-order execution and more advanced architectural features, though it hasn't yet reached mainstream usage. Similarly, <a href="https://tenstorrent.com/">Tenstorrent</a>, a company founded by legendary chip designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Keller_(engineer)">Jim Keller</a> (known for his work on AMD's Zen architecture), is working on high-performance RISC-V processors. While we haven't yet seen these chips in mainstream benchmarks, Tenstorrent's involvement suggests serious effort toward making RISC-V competitive in high-performance computing.</p>
<h2>ARM's Path as a Historical Reference</h2>
<p>ARM's trajectory provides an interesting context for understanding RISC-V's current position. ARM began in low-power embedded systems, initially facing similar performance limitations. Through years of architectural improvements and ecosystem development, ARM gradually expanded into mobile devices, then servers, and now even high-performance desktop systems. Today, ARM's success has contributed to Intel's market plateau, demonstrating how an initially limited architecture can evolve to challenge established players. However, it's important to note that this evolution took decades of sustained development and investment.</p>
<p>Looking at today's landscape, if you're building something that needs raw performance, RISC-V simply isn't ready. While there are promising developments in research labs and startups, the current generation of commercially available RISC-V processors remains significantly behind modern x86 and ARM implementations in terms of raw computational power.</p>

</ul>

<p>Async/await, or "async IO", is a new-ish<span>â<label for="sidenote-new_ish"></label><span>Rust added async/await in 2019. For comparison, C# added it in
2012, Python in 2015, JS in 2017, and C++ in 2020.</span></span> language feature that lets
our programs do more than one thing at a time. It's sort of an alternative to
multithreading, though Rust programs often use both. Async is popular with
websites and network services that handle many connections at once,<span>â<label for="sidenote-lots"></label><span>"Many" here conventionally means ten thousand or more. This is
sometimes called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">"C10K problem"</a>, short for 10,000 clients or
connections.</span></span>
because running lots of "futures" or "tasks" is more efficient than running
lots of threads.</p>

<p>This series is an introduction to futures, tasks, and async IO in Rust. Our
goal will be to get a good look at the machinery, so that async code doesn't
feel like magic. We'll start by translating ("desugaring") async examples into
ordinary Rust, and gradually we'll build our own async "runtime".<span>â<label for="sidenote-runtime"></label><span>For now, a "runtime" is a library or framework that we use to write
async programs. Building our own futures, tasks, and IO will gradually make
it clear what a runtime does for us.</span></span>
I'll assume that you've written some Rust before and that you've read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book">The Rust
Programming Language</a> ("The Book") or similar.<span>â<label for="sidenote-ch20"></label><span>The multithreaded web server project in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html">Chapter&nbsp;20</a> is
especially relevant.</span></span></p>

<p>Let's get started by doing more than one thing at a time with threads. This
will go well at first, but we'll run into trouble as the number of threads
grows. Then we'll get the same thing working with async/await, to see what all
the fuss is about. That'll give us some example code to play with, and in <a href="https://jacko.io/async_futures.html">Part
One</a> we'll start digging into it.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="threads">Threads</h2>

<p>Here's an example function <code>foo</code> that takes a second to run:</p>

<pre><code><div><p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2021&amp;code=use+std%3A%3Athread%3B%0Ause+std%3A%3Atime%3A%3ADuration%3B%0A%0Afn+foo%28n%3A+u64%29+%7B%0A++++println%21%28%22start+%7Bn%7D%22%29%3B%0A++++thread%3A%3Asleep%28Duration%3A%3Afrom_secs%281%29%29%3B%0A++++println%21%28%22end+%7Bn%7D%22%29%3B%0A%7D%0A%0Afn+main%28%29+%7B%0A++++let+mut+thread_handles+%3D+Vec%3A%3Anew%28%29%3B%0A++++for+n+in+1..%3D10+%7B%0A++++++++thread_handles.push%28thread%3A%3Aspawn%28move+%7C%7C+foo%28n%29%29%29%3B%0A++++%7D%0A++++for+handle+in+thread_handles+%7B%0A++++++++handle.join%28%29.unwrap%28%29%3B%0A++++%7D%0A%7D">Playground #1</a></p></div><span>fn </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>: </span><span>u64</span><span>) {</span><br><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>start </span><span>{n}</span><span>"</span><span>);</span><br><span>    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(</span><span>1</span><span>));</span><br><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>end </span><span>{n}</span><span>"</span><span>);</span><br><span>}</span><br></code></pre>

<p>If we want to make several calls to <code>foo</code> at the same time, we can spawn a
thread for each one. Click on the Playground button to see that this takes one
second instead of ten:<span>â<label for="sidenote-threads_order"></label><span>You'll probably also see the "start" and "end" prints appear

<h2 id="async">Async</h2>

<p>Let's try the same thing with async/await. For now we'll just type it out and
run it on the Playground without explaining anything. Our async <code>foo</code> function
looks like this:<span>â<label for="sidenote-tokio"></label><span>The async examples in this introduction and in most of <a href="https://jacko.io/async_futures.html">Part One</a>

Rust, but the differences between them aren't important for this series.
Tokio is the most popular and the most widely supported.</span></span></p>

<p>Making a few calls to <code>foo</code> one-at-a-time looks like this:<span>â<label for="sidenote-tokio_main"></label><span>In Parts Two and Three of this series, we'll implement a lot of
what <code>#[tokio::main]</code> is doing. Until then we can just take it on faith

<p>The first thing that's different about async functions is that we declare them
with the <code>async</code> keyword, and we write <code>.await</code> when we call them. Fair enough.</p>

<p>Making several calls to <code>foo</code> at the same time looks like this:<span>â<label for="sidenote-async_order"></label><span>Unlike the version with threads above, you'll always see this
version print its start messages in order, and you'll <em>usually</em> see it

returns a "future", which we collect in a <code>Vec</code>, kind of like the <code>Vec</code> of
thread handles above. But <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/future/fn.join_all.html"><code>join_all</code></a> is very different from the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.join"><code>join</code></a>

<h2 id="important_mistakes">Important Mistakes</h2>

<p>We can get some hints about how async works if we start making mistakes. First,
let's try using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.sleep.html"><code>thread::sleep</code></a> instead of <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/time/fn.sleep.html"><code>tokio::time::sleep</code></a> in our

<p>Oh no! Everything is one-at-a-time again. It's an easy mistake to make,
unfortunately.<span>â<label for="sidenote-detect_blocking"></label><span>There have been <a href="https://async.rs/blog/stop-worrying-about-blocking-the-new-async-std-runtime/">attempts</a> to
automatically detect and handle blocking in async functions, but that's led
to <a href="https://tokio.rs/blog/2020-04-preemption#a-note-on-blocking">performance problems</a>, and it hasn't been possible
to handle <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ebfj3x/stop_worrying_about_blocking_the_new_asyncstd/fb4i9z5/">all cases</a>.</span></span> As we work through <a href="https://jacko.io/async_futures.html">Part One</a>, it'll become
clear how <code>thread::sleep</code> gets in the way of async. For now, we might guess
that these <code>foo</code> functions running "at the same time" are actually all running
on one thread.</p>

<p>We can also try awaiting each future in a loop, the same way we originally
joined threads in a loop:</p>

<pre><code><div><p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?edition=2021&amp;code=use+std%3A%3Atime%3A%3ADuration%3B%0A%0Aasync+fn+foo%28n%3A+u64%29+%7B%0A++++println%21%28%22start+%7Bn%7D%22%29%3B%0A++++tokio%3A%3Atime%3A%3Asleep%28Duration%3A%3Afrom_secs%281%29%29.await%3B%0A++++println%21%28%22end+%7Bn%7D%22%29%3B%0A%7D%0A%0A%23%5Btokio%3A%3Amain%5D%0Aasync+fn+main%28%29+%7B%0A++++println%21%28%22These+jobs+don%27t+run+at+the+same+time...%22%29%3B%0A++++let+mut+futures+%3D+Vec%3A%3Anew%28%29%3B%0A++++for+n+in+1..%3D10+%7B%0A++++++++futures.push%28foo%28n%29%29%3B%0A++++%7D%0A++++for+future+in+futures+%7B%0A++++++++future.await%3B+%2F%2F+Oops%21%0A++++%7D%0A%7D">Playground #6</a></p></div><span><span>#[</span><span>tokio</span><span>::</span><span>main</span><span>]</span></span><br><span><span>async </span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span><br><span><span>    </span><span>let </span><span>mut</span><span> futures </span><span>= Vec</span><span>::new();</span></span><br><span><span>    </span><span>for</span><span> n </span><span>in </span><span>1</span><span>..=</span><span>10 </span><span>{</span></span><br><span><span>        futures.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>(n));</span></span><br><span><span>    }</span></span><br><span>    </span><span>for</span><span> future </span><span>in</span><span> futures {</span><br><span>        future.await; </span><span>// Oops!</span><br><span>    }</span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br></code></pre>

<p>This also doesn't work! What we're seeing is that futures don't do any work "in

<a href="https://jacko.io/async_tasks.html">Part Two</a>.</span></span> Instead, they do their work when we <code>.await</code> them. If
we <code>.await</code> them one-at-a-time, they do their work one-at-a-time. But somehow
<code>join_all</code> lets us <code>.await</code> all of them at the same time.</p>

<p>Ok, we've got a lot of mysteries here. Let's start solving them.</p>

This indicates that Apple now has a sufficient number of Vision Pro units in its inventory to meet demand for the device's remaining lifespan through to next year.</p>
<p>The Vision Pro is widely reported to have seen weak demand due to insufficient content and its high price point. <em>The Information</em> says that Vision Pro suppliers have now produced enough components for between 500,000 to 600,000 headsets. Some factories suspended production of Vision Pro components as early as May based on Apple's weak sales forecasts, and warehouses remain filled with tens of thousands of undelivered parts.</p>
<p>Apple is said to have recently told Luxshare, a Chinese company that serves as the Vision Pro's assembler, that it may need to wind down production in November. Luxshare is currently making around 1,000 Vision Pro headsets per day, which is half that being produced at its peak. Apple will still be able to resume Vision Pro production if sales pick up since the production lines are not yet due to be dismantled.</p>
<p>Moreover, Apple has apparently suspended work on the second-generation Vision Pro for at least a year to focus on developing a lower-cost headset. Interestingly, Apple has told suppliers to prepare to build four million low-cost headsets over the entire lifespan of the future product. This is half the total number of Vision Pros that Apple told suppliers to produce, suggesting that sales expectations are even lower for the cheaper headset.</p>
<p>Although Apple's work on the second-generation Vision Pro has apparently stalled, there are some indications that the company could release "an incremental update to the product with limited changes to its physical design," such as a chip upgrade. This would allow Apple to use up the considerable number of excess components in its supply chain.</p>

<p>T-Mobile promised users who bought certain mobile plans that it would never raise their prices for as long as they livedâbut then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/t-mobile-imposes-5-monthly-price-hike-on-customers-using-older-plans/">raised their prices</a> this year. So it's no surprise that 2,000 T-Mobile customers complained to the government about a price hike on plans that were advertised as having a lifetime price lock.</p>
<p>"I am still alive and T-Mobile is increasing the price for service by $5 per line. How is this a lifetime price lock?" one customer in Connecticut asked the Federal Communications Commission in a complaint that we obtained through a public records request.</p>
<p>"I am not dead yet," a customer in New York wrote bluntly, saying they had bought a plan with a "guarantee for life."</p>
<p>Both of those customers said they purchased T-Mobile's senior plan marketed to people aged 55 and up. While the price hikes apply to customers on various plans regardless of their age, many of the complaints to the FCC came from people in the 55+ age group. Some pointed out that if T-Mobile simply waits long enough, the carrier won't have to serve 55-and-up customers forever.</p>
<p>"What happened to my price lock GUARANTEE?" a Massachusetts resident wrote. "You can charge more to new customers, but do not change the terms of our contract!! Eventually we will age out..." A California resident on the 55+ plan, who reported being a T-Mobile customer for over 18 years, wrote, "We want that rate back for the remainder of our lives."</p>
<p>Many customers have two or more lines. Some people complaining to the FCC even reported having 8, 9, or 10 lines, all of which get the price increase. "I got a text message stating my monthly rate will increase $5 per line, that is [a] $50 increase because I have 10 lines," a New York resident wrote.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A Pennsylvania resident told the FCC that T-Mobile "straight up lied to millions of people." A North Carolina resident wrote, "This is not the deal we signed up for and to change our price after guaranteeing it would be locked for life is fraudulent and a direct breach of contract."</p>
<h2>FCC says it got over 2,000 complaints</h2>
<p>An FCC spokesperson told Ars on September 28 that the agency had "received over 2,000 complaints" about the T-Mobile price hikes of $2 to $5 per line. The agency declined to comment on whether it is conducting a formal investigation.</p>
<p>"If this is allowed to stand, then words have no meaning, businesses are able to lie directly and blatantly to the American people, and the FCC is apparently unable to protect the citizen[s] of this county from the unethical practices of business[es] they are charged with regulating," an Indiana resident told the FCC.</p>
<p>A Texas resident who said they used to work in T-Mobile customer service said in a complaint that the "company's attempt to backtrack on their promises through obscure caveats in FAQs should not be allowed to stand. As a former employee and long-time customer, I feel deeply betrayed by T-Mobile's conduct and strongly advocate for regulatory intervention to protect consumers."</p>
<p>The FCC complaints started right after T-Mobile, which has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/t-mobile-att-oppose-unlocking-rule-claim-locked-phones-are-good-for-users/">said</a> it is "passionate about winning customers for life," announced the rate increase in late May. We sent a Freedom of Information Act request to the FCC on June 24, seeking all of the complaints.</p>
<p>The FOIA process often takes months, and the results, which are based on searches for keywords identified in the records request, can be unpredictable. But in the end, we received over 900 of the roughly 2,000 complaints filed to the FCC, with names redacted. You can <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/T-Mobile-complaints-to-FCC.pdf">read all of them here</a>, and we will quote more of them in this article.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>We also obtained <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/T-Mobile-FTC-complaints.xlsx">about 60</a> complaints regarding T-Mobile's price hike to the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces laws against deceiving consumers. The FTC declined to comment on any potential investigation.</p>

<h2>US agencies could take action</h2>
<p>The FCC and FTC have both punished T-Mobile for other kinds of violations, so it's possible that the agencies could intervene. Earlier in 2024, the FCC fined T-Mobile <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/t-mobile-pays-16-million-fine-for-three-years-worth-of-data-breaches/">for data breaches</a> and for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-fines-big-three-carriers-196m-for-selling-users-real-time-location-data/">selling users' real-time location data</a>. In 2014, T-Mobile <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2014/12/t-mobile-pay-least-90-million-including-full-consumer-refunds-settle-ftc-mobile-cramming-case">agreed to pay at least $90 million</a> to settle an FTC lawsuit over unwanted third-party charges as part of a deal that included <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2017/02/ftc-returns-nearly-20-million-additional-refunds-t-mobile-customers">refunds to customers</a>.</p>
<p>State attorneys general could also take action. Nearly every US state was involved in a lawsuit that alleged the big three carriers falsely advertised wireless plans as "unlimited" and phones as "free." The carriers settled the lawsuit this year, with T-Mobile <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/big-three-carriers-pay-10m-to-settle-claims-of-false-unlimited-advertising/">agreeing to pay</a> $4.1 million. (Verizon also agreed to pay $4.1 million, while AT&amp;T agreed to pay a little over $2 million.)</p>
<p>If the government doesn't take action, there's at least one other potential avenue of recourse. A <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.551616/gov.uscourts.njd.551616.1.0.pdf">class-action lawsuit</a> filed against T-Mobile in July <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/lawsuit-t-mobile-must-pay-for-breaking-lifetime-price-guarantee/">is seeking</a> "restitution of all amounts obtained by Defendant as a result of its violation," plus interest, along with statutory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>The class action in US District Court for the District of New Jersey seeks to represent T-Mobile users nationwide and was filed on behalf of plaintiffs by law firm <a href="https://nagelrice.com/">Nagel Rice</a>. T-Mobile is <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.551616/gov.uscourts.njd.551616.11.1.pdf">asking the court</a> to force the lead plaintiff into arbitration and dismiss the claims of other plaintiffs because they don't live in New Jersey.</p>
<h2>âT-Mobile will never change the price you payâ</h2>
<p>We explained in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/t-mobile-users-thought-they-had-a-lifetime-price-lock-guess-what-happened-next/">previous coverage</a> that in January 2017, T-Mobile brought its "Un-contract" promise to T-Mobile One plans. "Now, T-Mobile One customers keep their price until THEY decide to change it. T-Mobile will never change the price you pay for your T-Mobile One plan," the company said in a pledge that enticed many people to switch plans or even switch from another carrier to T-Mobile.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>In a separate FAQ, T-Mobile revealed a caveat that essentially nullified the price-lock promise. The FAQ described the Un-contract as "our commitment that only you can change what you pay and we mean it! To show just how serious we are, we have committed to pay your final month's recurring service charges if we were to raise prices and you choose to leave. Just let us know within 60 days." That big caveat wasn't mentioned in the primary announcement.</p>

<p>The Un-contract was introduced for other plans in 2015, and marketing of the supposedly price-locked plans went on for years. "We're the Un-carrier. Everything the carriers do, we un-do," T-Mobile's then-CEO John Legere <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/uncontract-carrier-freedom">said in March 2015</a>. "The other guys have been throwing out all kinds of desperate, short-term promotions to suck you in and lock you downâonly to jack up rates later. We're not playing that game. The Un-contract is our promise to individuals, families and businesses of all sizes, thatâwhile your price may go downâit won't go up."</p>
<p>T-Mobile discontinued the Un-contract in 2022 but makes the <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans/price-lock-faqs">same pledge</a> about currently offered plans with what it calls "Price Lock." Just like the Un-contract, T-Mobile's Price Lock only gives customers the right to cancel and get a refund for one month if the price rises.</p>
<p>Last year, T-Mobile <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/t-mobile-switches-users-to-pricier-plans-and-tells-them-its-not-a-price-hike/">notified some customers</a> that it would automatically switch them to newer, more expensive plans unless the customers called the company to opt out of the change. T-Mobile customer service reps were instructed to tell users, "We are not raising the price of any of our plans; we are moving you to a newer plan with more benefits at a different cost."</p>
<p>T-Mobile <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/after-uproar-t-mobile-wont-automatically-switch-users-to-pricier-plans/">backtracked on that unpopular 2023 move</a> within weeks but has stood firm on this year's price hike on price-locked plans. T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<h2>T-Mobile answered complaints with form letter</h2>
<p>The FCC complaint process can be exasperating. T-Mobile has responded to complaints with a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/T-Mobile-response.pdf">form letter</a> explaining the limits of the price guarantee, in which it claims there was never a promise to never raise prices.</p>
<p>"With <em>Un-contract</em>, T-Mobile committed to its customers that if we were to increase prices and customers chose to leave as a result, T-Mobile would pay the customers' final month's recurring service charge, as long as we are notified within 60 days... Customers simply need to request reimbursement within 60 days of the price increase," the letter said.</p>
<p>Customers aren't buying that explanation. Some of the FCC complaints quoted Legere's promise and other statements in which T-Mobile made what seemed to be a clear guarantee that prices would never be raised.</p>
<p>"I am under the T-Mobile One Plan which was marketed to me as a guaranteed rate lock plan," a New Jersey resident told the FCC. "I just received information that my plan would increase by $25 per month ($5 per line x 5 lines). How can this price increase happen if the plan was guaranteed and 'price locked'? This is marketing deception at the highest level and a flat out lie to consumers. Please help!"</p>
<p>"They are reeling in customers like me with a promise to never raise the monthly rate, but then they... raise my rate? If this is not fraud, I don't know what is," a Wyoming resident wrote.</p>
<p>Another person complained about T-Mobile not honoring the final-bill promise. The complainant, a Kansas resident, said they had eight lines that were all getting $5 price increases. There is "not enough wireless provider competition for me to switch" and "even if I switch, they refuse to pay the final bill," the FCC complaint said.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<h2>Customer: T-Mobile response âfactually incorrectâ</h2>
<p>We heard recently from T-Mobile customer John Bradshaw, who lives in Maryland. After getting T-Mobile's response to his complaint, he wrote to the FCC that "T-Mobile has not addressed my specific issue in the complaint but rather submitted a general letter of explanation that is factually incorrect."</p>
<p>Bradshaw's email to the FCC on October 2, which he shared with Ars, points to terms of conditions that were <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/legal/terms-and-conditions-aug-2018">active when he signed up in February 2019</a>. He quoted a section that said, "If you are on a price-lock guaranteed Rate Plan, we will not increase your monthly recurring Service charge ('Recurring Charge') for the period that applies to your Rate Plan, or, if no specific period applies, for as long as you continuously remain a customer in good standing on a qualifying Rate Plan."</p>
<p>Contrary to T-Mobile's response, "there is nothing in the Ts &amp; Cs stating that T-Mobile could increase prices, and if I chose to leave, they would pay the final month's service charge," Bradshaw told the FCC. "We remain in good standing (we use their auto-pay service) and have remained on our original plan since we first signed up with T-Mobile. Therefore, T-Mobile cannot raise our prices nor can they terminate our service and pay our final month."</p>
<p>Bradshaw, who has a T-Mobile One business plan, said he has called T-Mobile each month and convinced an agent to credit his account for the amount of the price increase. This has allowed him to pay the previous price of $215 instead of $232 on his four-line plan, he told Ars.</p>
<p>"I've had to call T-Mobile each billing cycle to have them credit my account for the difference (which after time and escalation to a supervisor they have done) and intend to stand firm that I will not pay the increase nor will I terminate service and accept their final month payment as 'settlement,'" he told us.</p>

<h2>Customers blast T-Mobile/Sprint merger</h2>
<p>Numerous FCC complaints said T-Mobile's behavior was enabled by its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/t-mobile-completes-sprint-merger-john-legere-leaves-ceo-job-a-month-early/">2020 acquisition of Sprint</a>, a merger that was approved by the FCC and other regulators. "This is what happens when the government lets companies swallow the completion (the latest being Sprint). We have antitrust laws in the country that are being ignored and ultimately the consumer loses," a New York resident told the FCC.</p>
<p>A California resident wrote that T-Mobile is guilty of false advertising and that the price hike shows "why Sprint never should have been allowed to merge with T-Mobile." The person asked the FCC to "re-investigate the merger and require one or more of the current mobile telecom corporate behemoths to split up."</p>
<p>A Texas resident wrote, "This is what happens when mergers are not blocked; T-Mobile never should have been allowed to acquire Sprint. Now, they have no lower-price competitors... T-Mobile lied out of pure greed, and false advertising cannot be allowed to go uncorrected."</p>
<p>Many complaints described how the users contacted T-Mobile customer service after receiving notification of the price increase. An Ohio resident who signed up for the 55+ plan in 2020 wrote, "When I spoke with a customer service rep, I was told that the price lock was a special program that began in 2022 and was time-limited. This is obviously bull puckey, but the company seems quite satisfied with its revisionist history."</p>
<p>A California resident who reported getting a $20 price increase ($5 over four lines) wrote, "I talked to T-Mobile and they said it's because my plan is a 'retired' plan, which makes no sense. All that means is that I am not on of their more expensive plans. The T-Mobile buyout of Sprint has created a monopoly in the market and they are taking advantage of customers by raising prices, knowing customers have fewer choices."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A Colorado resident wrote, "I called customer service and was told by a rep and the rep's supervisor that they made such a promise, but their board and CEO have decided to no longer honor the promise. I told them this is fraudulent."</p>
<p>An Idaho resident told the FCC, "I spoke to T-Mobile and they recognized that these price lock promises do exist and were advertised to customers but that T-Mobile is increasing rates anyway, with the justification of 'we have raised rates less than other carriers.'"</p>
<h2>Users feel trapped by device payment plans</h2>
<p>Some customers feel locked into T-Mobile because they agreed to device installment plans. A T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/account/cancel-service#:~:text=If%20there%20is%20an%20active,full%20on%20your%20final%20bill.">support page</a> says that if a customer closes an account, the entire device installment plan "will be charged in full on your final bill."</p>
<p>"I was told that we had T-Mobile's Price Lock Guarantee and now I'm being told that my price will go up by $5 per line for a total of $35/mo. for the exact same service I'm currently getting," a Utah resident told the FCC. "This is dishonest and deceptive marketing and should not be allowed. I can't even switch carriers because I have device installment plans and T-Mobile will require me to pay off the phones before leaving."</p>
<p>A Utah resident wrote, "My husband is a Disabled Veteran. I am his caregiver. We live on an incredibly fixed income. We signed up for the Magenta Military plan years ago. I would love to switch to a different provider, but we just bought phones with T-Mobile in November on an EIP [Equipment Installment Plan] promo for 24 months. We feel trapped and discouraged."</p>
<p>T-Mobile's explanation that it's raising rates because the company's costs have risen hasn't appeased customers. "I am in my late 70s and my Social Security already doesn't come close to covering my monthly expenses, let alone the continual price increases on all fronts. Is there any recourse with T-Mobile?" a New Mexico resident wrote.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<h2>âImmoral, deceitful, and illegalâ</h2>
<p>A South Carolina resident urged the FCC to rule that the price guarantee is "an irrevocable contract from which they cannot remove themselves, nor can they breach that contract by changing my plan at all."</p>
<p>"I called reps at T-Mobile and they confirmed that the 'forever prices' that they promised us was, in fact, untrue," the customer's complaint said. "One representative actually said that the price lock promise was true at the time, but now they find it necessary to raise the price!"</p>
<p>Some customers who complained about the price hike are also mad about a previous decision to <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/account/autopay">require</a> a debit card or linked bank account to set up automatic payments and receive the company's AutoPay discount. The requirement is worrying to users in light of T-Mobile's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/t-mobile-pays-16-million-fine-for-three-years-worth-of-data-breaches/">history of data breaches</a>.</p>
<p>"I signed up with T-Mobile based on their advertisement that they would never raise rates on my plan. Now they have raised rates twiceâonce charging me if I don't leave a debit card on file and once again simply just raising my bill by $10. I don't appreciate their false advertising," a Colorado resident told the FCC.</p>
<p>One North Carolina resident stated that T-Mobile will "get a little more from the millions of customers (that will add up to big profits) and deal with the few complaints and loss of customer base. In the end, what they will profit will outweigh the loss. So sadâand immoral, deceitful, and illegal."</p>
<h2>No relief for people we interviewed in June</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/t-mobile-users-enraged-as-un-carrier-breaks-promise-to-never-raise-prices/">June 27 article</a>, we detailed the experiences of three T-Mobile customers who contacted Ars and filed complaints with the FCC and other regulators. We reached out to them again before writing this article.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>One of them, Rhode Island resident Kathleen Odean, told us that she had several recent conversations with a T-Mobile employee who "seems to have been appointed to contact people who filed complaints with the FCC and/or their state attorney general. During our contacts, her argument kept changing and finally settled on telling me that the press release [announcing the Un-contract deal in 2017] was essentially a broad overview and not to be taken literally."</p>
<p>In 2017, Odean and her husband switched from Verizon to get the T-Mobile price-lock deal that cost a total of $60 a month for two lines. Odean said they are still on the same plan but added, "I will look around at other options once I have the energy and accept that they won't keep their promise."</p>
<p>Another customer we spoke to for the previous article, Georgia resident Michael Moody, had switched his business and family accounts from T-Mobile to Verizon upon learning of the price hikes. Moody tried to get T-Mobile to cover his final month's bill, but the carrier told him that he didn't act fast enough. An email from T-Mobile to Moody said the carrier wouldn't pay the final bill because "notification of cancellation from your end came after the cancellation had already been processed."</p>
<p>Moody told us recently that T-Mobile never changed its stance and has "continue[d] to deny and deflect, including in their response to the BBB." On the plus side, Moody is satisfied with his new carrier.</p>
<p>"I'm very glad I switched to Verizon. Their customer service has been far more responsive, and they uphold their commitments, unlike T-Mobile," Moody told us.</p>
<h2>Customerâs goal: âMake T-Mobile feel the painâ</h2>
<p>We also previously talked to T-Mobile customer John Schlatter in South Carolina, who filed complaints with the FCC and FTC. He told us on September 23 that he hasn't received any further follow-up from T-Mobile and isn't going to change carriers "because of the hassle involved."</p>
<p>"I figure if the [class-action] suit is successful, I'll get some communication about a settlement," Schlatter said. "I'm not interested in money, although it would be nice if they're forced to roll back the price increase. My goal has always been to make T-Mobile feel the pain for their shady actions."</p>
<p>Although T-Mobile hasn't reversed the price hike yet, Schlatter said the many complaints to federal regulators and the class-action lawsuit should inflict "a good bit of pain."</p>

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN, we are Chris and Chris from MobileBoost (<a href="https://mobileboost.io/">https://mobileboost.io/</a>). Weâre building GPT Driver, an AI-native approach to create and execute end-to-end (E2E) tests on mobile applications. Our solution allows teams to define tests in natural language and prevents test flakiness by taking a visual approach paired with LLM (Large Language Model) reasoning. This helps achieve E2E test coverage with a fraction of the usual effort.</p><p>You can watch a brief product walkthrough here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Ge2fqdlxc" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Ge2fqdlxc</a></p><p>In terms of trying the product out: since the service is resource-intensive (we provide hosted virtual/real phone instances), we don't currently have a playground available. However, you can see some examples here <a href="https://mobileboost.io/showcases">https://mobileboost.io/showcases</a> and book a demo of GPT Driver testing your app through our website.</p><p>Why we built this: working at previous startups and scaleups, we saw how as app teams grew, QA teams would struggle to ensure everything was still working. This caused tension between teams and resulted in bugs making it into production.</p><p>Youâd expect automated tests to help, but these were a huge effort because only engineers could create the tests, and the apps themselves kept changingâbreaking the tests regularly and leading to high maintenance overhead. Functional tests often failed not because of actual app errors, but due to changes like copy updates or modifications to element IDs. This was already a challenge, even before considering the added complexities of multiple platforms, different environments, multilingual UIs, marketing popups, A/B tests, or minor UI changes from third-party authentication or payment providers.</p><p>We realized that combining computer vision with LLM reasoning could solve the common flakiness issues in E2E testing. So, we launched GPT Driverâa no-code editor paired with a hosted emulator/simulator service that allows teams to set up test automation efficiently. Our visual + LLM reasoning test execution reduces false alarms, enabling teams to integrate their E2E tests into their CI/CD pipelines without getting blocked.
Some interesting technical challenges we faced along the way:
(1) UI Object Detection from Vision Input: We had to train object detection models (YOLO and Faster R-CNN based) on a subset of the RICO dataset as well as our own dataset to be able to interact accurately with the UI. 
(2) Reasoning with Current LLMs: We have to shorten instructions, action history, and screen content during runtime for better results, as handling large amounts of input tokens remains a challenge. We also work with reasoning templates to achieve robust decision-making. 
(3) Performance Optimization: We optimized our agentic loop to make decisions in less than 4 seconds. To reduce this further, we implemented caching mechanisms and offer a command-first approach, where our AI agent only takes over when the command fails.</p><p>Since launching GPT Driver, weâve seen adoption by technical teams, both with and without dedicated QA roles. Compared to code-based tests, the core benefit is the reduction of both the manual work and the time required to maintain effective E2E tests. This approach is particularly powerful for apps which have a lot of dynamic screens and content such as Duolingo which we have been working with since a couple of months. Additionally, the tests can now also be managed by non-engineers.</p><p>Weâd love to hear about your experiences with E2E test automationâwhat approaches have worked or didnât work for you? What features would you find valuable?</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>Not long ago, the ability to digitally track someoneâs daily movements just by knowing their home address, employer, or place of worship was considered a dangerous power that should remain only within the purview of nation states. But a new lawsuit in a likely constitutional battle over a New Jersey privacy law shows that anyone can now access this capability, thanks to a proliferation of commercial services that hoover up the digital exhaust emitted by widely-used mobile apps and websites.</p>
<div id="attachment_69282"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69282" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone.png" alt="" width="748" height="756" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone.png 893w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone-768x776.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone-782x790.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69282">Image: Shutterstock, Arthimides.</p></div>
<p>Delaware-based<strong> Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</strong> helps its users remove their personal information from the clutches of consumer data brokers, and from <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=people+search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people-search services online</a>. Backed by millions of dollars in litigation financing, Atlas so far this year has sued 151 consumer data brokers on behalf of a class that includes more than 20,000 New Jersey law enforcement officers who are signed up for Atlas services.</p>
<p>Atlas alleges all of these data brokers have ignored repeated warnings that they are violating <strong>Danielâs Law</strong>, a New Jersey statute allowing law enforcement, government personnel, judges and their families to have their information completely removed from commercial data brokers. Danielâs Law was passed in 2020 after the death of 20-year-old <strong>Daniel Anderl</strong>, who was killed in a violent attack targeting a federal judge â his mother.</p>
<p>Last week, Atlas invoked Danielâs Law in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.18_Babel_Street_Compl_w_Summons-Case_Info_-_4874-8628-4017_-_1__1_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lawsuit</a> (PDF) against <strong>Babel Street</strong>, a little-known technology company incorporated in Reston, Va. Babel Streetâs core product allows customers to draw a digital polygon around nearly any location on a map of the world, and view a slightly dated (by a few days) time-lapse history of the mobile devices seen coming in and out of the specified area.</p>
<p>Babel Streetâs <strong>LocateX</strong> platform also allows customers to track individual mobile users by their <strong>Mobile Advertising ID</strong> or <strong>MAID</strong>, a unique, alphanumeric identifier built into all Google Android and Apple mobile devices.</p>
<p>Babel Street can offer this tracking capability by consuming location data and other identifying information that is collected by many websites and broadcast to dozens and sometimes hundreds of ad networks that may wish to bid on showing their ad to a particular user.</p>
<div id="attachment_69280"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69280" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque.jpeg" alt="" width="1448" height="990" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque.jpeg 1448w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque-768x525.jpeg 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque-782x535.jpeg 782w" sizes="(max-width: 1448px) 100vw, 1448px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69280">This image, taken from a video recording Atlas made of its private investigator using Babel Street to show all of the unique mobile IDs seen over time at a mosque in Dearborn, Michigan. Each red dot represents one mobile device.</p></div>
<p>In an interview, Atlas said a private investigator they hired was offered a free trial of Babel Street, which the investigator was able to use to determine the home address and daily movements of mobile devices belonging to multiple New Jersey police officers whose families have already faced significant harassment and death threats.</p>
<p>Atlas said the investigator encountered Babel Street while testing hundreds of data broker tools and services to see if personal information on its users was being sold. They soon discovered Babel Street also bundles people-search services with its platform, to make it easier for customers to zero in on a specific device.</p>
<p>The investigator contacted Babel Street about possibly buying home addresses in certain areas of New Jersey. After listening to a sales pitch for Babel Street and expressing interest, the investigator was told Babel Street only offers their service to the government or to âcontractors of the government.â</p>
<p>âThe investigator (truthfully) mentioned that he was contemplating some government contract work in the future and was told by the Babel Street salesperson that âthatâs good enoughâ and that âthey donât actually check,ââ Atlas shared in an email with reporters.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity was one of five media outlets invited to review screen recordings that Atlas made while its investigator used a two-week trial version of Babel Streetâs LocateX service. References and links to reporting by other publications, including <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-u-s-government-bought-tool-that-can-track-phones-at-abortion-clinics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>404 Media</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/security/2024-10-23/ty-article-magazine/.premium/00000192-b90c-dc97-a593-f96f50800000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Haaretz</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.notus.org/technology/cell-phone-tracking-law-enforcement-abortion-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NOTUS</strong></a>, and <strong>The New York Times</strong>, will appear throughout this story.</p>
<p>Collectively, these stories expose how the broad availability of mobile advertising data has created a market in which virtually anyone can build a sophisticated spying apparatus capable of tracking the daily movements of hundreds of millions of people globally.</p>
<p>The findings outlined in Atlasâs lawsuit against Babel Street also illustrate how mobile location data is set to massively complicate several hot-button issues, from the tracking of suspected illegal immigrants or women seeking abortions, to harassing public servants who are already in the crosshairs over baseless conspiracy theories and increasingly hostile political rhetoric against government employees.</p>
<h2>WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE</h2>
<p>Atlas says the Babel Street trial period allowed its investigator to find information about visitors to high-risk targets such as mosques, synagogues, courtrooms and abortion clinics. In one video, an Atlas investigator showed how they isolated mobile devices seen in a New Jersey courtroom parking lot that was reserved for jurors, and then tracked one likely jurorâs phone to their home address over several days.</p>
<p>While the Atlas investigator had access to its trial account at Babel Street, they were able to successfully track devices belonging to several plaintiffs named or referenced in the lawsuit. They did so by drawing a digital polygon around the home address or workplace of each person in Babel Streetâs platform, which focused exclusively on the devices that passed through those addresses each day.</p>
<div id="attachment_69273"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69273" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="648" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple.jpeg 1446w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple-768x664.jpeg 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple-782x676.jpeg 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69273">Each red dot in this Babel Street map represents a unique mobile device that has been seen since April 2022 at a Jewish synagogue in Los Angeles, Calif. Image: Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</p></div>
<p>One unique feature of Babel Street is the ability to toggle a ânightâ mode, which makes it relatively easy to determine within a few meters where a target typically lays their head each night (because their phone is usually not far away).</p>
<p>Atlas plaintiffs <strong>Scott</strong> and <strong>Justyna Maloney</strong> are both veteran officers with the Rahway, NJ police department who live together with their two young children. In April 2023, Scott and Justyna became the target of intense harassment and death threats after Officer Justyna responded to a routine call about a man filming people outside of the Motor Vehicle Commission in Rahway.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfEZWtC9bdI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">man filming</a> the Motor Vehicle Commission that day is a social media personality who often solicits police contact and then records himself arguing about constitutional rights with the responding officers.</p>
<p>Officer Justynaâs interaction with the man was entirely peaceful, and the episode appeared to end without incident. But after a selectively edited video of that encounter went viral, their home address and unpublished phone numbers were posted online. When their tormentors figured out that Scott was also a cop (a sergeant), the couple began receiving dozens of threatening text messages, including specific death threats.</p>
<p>According to the Atlas lawsuit, one of the messages to Mr. Maloney demanded money, and warned that his family would âpay in bloodâ if he didnât comply. Sgt. Maloney said he then received a video in which a masked individual pointed a rifle at the camera and told him that his family was âgoing to get [their] heads cut off.â</p>
<p>Maloney said a few weeks later, one of their neighbors saw two suspicious individuals in ski masks parked one block away from the home and alerted police. Atlasâs complaint says video surveillance from neighboring homes shows the masked individuals circling the Maloneyâs home. The responding officers arrested two men, who were armed, for unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
<div id="attachment_69289"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69289" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg.png" alt="" width="748" height="437" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg.png 1457w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg-768x449.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg-782x457.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69289">According to Google Maps, Babel Street shares a corporate address with Google and the consumer credit reporting bureau TransUnion.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said their investigator was not able to conclusively find Scott Maloneyâs iPhone in the Babel Street platform, but they did find Justynaâs. Babel Street had nearly 100,000 hits for her phone over several months, allowing Atlas to piece together an intimate picture of Justynaâs daily movements and meetings with others.<span id="more-69216"></span></p>
<p>An Atlas investigator visited the Maloneys and inspected Justynaâs iPhone, and determined the only app that used her deviceâs location data was from the department store <strong>Macyâs</strong>.</p>
<p>In a written response to questions, Macyâs said its app includes an opt-in feature for geo-location, âwhich allows customers to receive an enhanced shopping experience based on their location.â</p>
<p>âWe do not store any customer location information,â Macyâs wrote. âWe share geo-location data with a <a href="https://www.macys.com/ads.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited number of partners</a> who help us deliver this enhanced app experience. Furthermore, we have no connection with Babel Streetâ [link added for context].</p>
<p>Justynaâs experience highlights a stark reality about the broad availability of mobile location data: Even if the person youâre looking for isnât directly identifiable in platforms like Babel Street, it is likely that at least some of that personâs family members are. In other words, itâs often trivial to infer the location of one device by successfully locating another.</p>
<p>The terms of service for Babel Streetâs Locate X service state that the product âmay not be used as the basis for any legal process in any country, including as the basis for a warrant, subpoena, or any other legal or administrative action.â But Scott Maloney said heâs convinced by their experience that not even law enforcement agencies should have access to this capability without a warrant.</p>
<p>âAs a law enforcement officer, in order for me to track someone I need a judge to sign a warrant â and thatâs for a criminal investigation after weâve developed probable cause,â Mr. Maloney said in an interview. âData brokers tracking me and my family just to sell that information for profit, without our consent, and even after weâve explicitly asked them not to is deeply disturbing.â</p>
<p>Mr. Maloneyâs law enforcement colleagues in other states may see things differently. In August, <strong>The Texas Observer</strong> <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-dps-surveillance-tangle-cobwebs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that state police plan to spend more than $5 million on a contract for a controversial surveillance tool called <strong>Tangles</strong> from the tech firm PenLink. Tangles is an AI-based web platform that scrapes information from the open, deep and dark web, and it has a premier feature called <strong>WebLoc</strong> that can be used to geofence mobile devices.</p>
<p>The <strong>Associated Press</strong> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-d395409ef5a8c6c3f6cdab5b1d0e27ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported last month</a> that law enforcement agencies from suburban Southern California to rural North Carolina have been using an obscure cell phone tracking tool called <strong>Fog Reveal</strong> â at times without warrants â that gives them the ability to follow peopleâs movements going back many months.</p>
<p>It remains unclear precisely how Babel Street is obtaining the abundance of mobile location data made available to users of its platform. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>
<p>But according to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2020-HQFO-01656.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a document</a> (PDF) obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request with the Department of Homeland Securityâs Science and Technology directorate, Babel Street re-hosts data from the commercial phone tracking firm <strong>Venntel</strong>.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Substack newsletter <strong>All-Source Intelligence</strong> <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_29FTC124C0060_2900_-NONE-_-NONE-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unearthed documents</a> indicating that the <strong>U.S. Federal Trade Commission</strong> has opened an inquiry into Venntel and its parent company Gravy Analytics.</p>
<p>âVenntel has also been a data partner of the police surveillance contractor Fog Data Science, whose product has been described as âmass surveillance on a budget,'â All-Sourceâs <strong>Jack Poulson</strong> <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/ftc-opened-investigation-into-commercial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. âVenntel was also reported to have been a primary data source of the controversial âLocate Xâ phone tracking product of the American data fusion company Babel Street.â</p>
<h2>MAID IN HELL</h2>
<p>The Mobile Advertising ID or MAID â the unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each mobile device â was originally envisioned as a way to distinguish individual mobile customers without relying on personally identifiable information such as phone numbers or email addresses.</p>
<p>However, there is now <a href="https://datarade.ai/data-categories/device-graph-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a robust industry</a> of marketing and advertising companies that specialize in assembling enormous lists of MAIDs that are âenrichedâ with historical and personal information about the individual behind each MAID.</p>
<div id="attachment_69270"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69270" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid.png" alt="" width="750" height="411" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid.png 1186w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid-768x420.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid-782x428.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69270">One of many vendors that âenrichâ MAID data with other identifying information, including name, address, email address and phone number.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said its investigator wanted to know whether they could find enriched MAID records on their New Jersey law enforcement customers, and soon found plenty of ad data brokers willing to sell it.</p>
<p>Some vendors offered only a handful of data fields, such as first and last name, MAID and email address. Other brokers sold far more detailed histories along with their MAID, including each subjectâs social media profiles, precise GPS coordinates, and even likely consumer category.</p>
<p>How are advertisers and data brokers gaining access to so much information? Some sources of MAID data can be apps on your phone such as <strong>AccuWeather</strong>, <strong>GasBuddy</strong>, <strong>Grindr</strong>, and <strong>MyFitnessPal</strong> that collect your MAID and location and sell that to brokers.</p>
<p>A userâs MAID profile and location data also is commonly shared as a consequence of simply using a smartphone to visit a web page that features ads. In the few milliseconds before those ads load, the website will send a â<strong>bid request</strong>â to various ad exchanges, where advertisers can bid on the chance to place their ad in front of users who match the consumer profiles theyâre seeking. A great deal of data can be included in a bid request, including the userâs precise location (the current open standard for bid requests is detailed <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p>
<p>The trouble is that virtually anyone can access the âbidstreamâ data flowing through these so-called â<strong>realtime bidding</strong>â networks, because the information is simultaneously broadcast in the clear to hundreds of entities around the world.</p>
<p>The result is that there are a number of marketing companies that now enrich and broker access to this mobile location information. Earlier this year, the German news outlet <strong>netzpolitik.org</strong> purchased a bidstream data set containing more than 3.6 billion data points, and shared the information with the German daily <strong>BR24</strong>. They concluded that the data they obtained (through a free trial, no less) made it possible to establish movement profiles â some of them quite precise â of <a href="https://interaktiv.br.de/ausspioniert-mit-standortdaten/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several million people across Germany</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Politico</strong> recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/09/23/tk-alfred-top-00180521" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a>&nbsp;startling <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941708" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> from universities in New Hampshire, Kentucky and St. Louis that showed how the mobile advertising data they acquired allowed them to link visits from investigators with the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) to insiders selling stock before the investigations became public knowledge.</p>
<p>The researchers in that study said they didnât attempt to use the same methods to track regulators from other agencies, but that virtually anyone could do it.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Sherman</strong>, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown Lawâs Center for Privacy and Technology,&nbsp;called the research a âshocking demonstration of what happens when companies can freely harvest Americansâ geolocation data and sell it for their chosen price.â</p>
<p>âPoliticians should understand how they, their staff, and public servants are threatened by the sale of personal dataâand constituent groups should realize that talk of data broker âcontrolsâ or âbest practicesâ is designed by companies to distract from the underlying problems and the comprehensive privacy and security solutions,â Sherman <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/data-brokers-and-threats-to-government-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote for Lawfare this week</a>.</p>
<h2>A BIDSTREAM DRAGNET?</h2>
<p>The Orwellian nature of modern mobile advertising networks may soon have far-reaching implications for womenâs reproductive rights, as more states move to outlaw abortion within their borders. The 2022 Dobbs decision by the U.S. Supreme Court discarded the federal right to abortion, and 14 states have since enacted strict abortion bans.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups are already using mobile advertising data to advance their cause. In May 2023, <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> <a href="https://archive.is/IZenH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that an anti-abortion group in Wisconsin used precise geolocation data to direct ads to women it suspected of seeking abortions.</p>
<p>As it stands, there is little to stop anti-abortion groups from purchasing bidstream data (or renting access to a platform like Babel Street) and using it to geofence abortion clinics, potentially revealing all mobile devices transiting through these locations.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator geofenced an abortion clinic and was able to identify a likely employee at that clinic, following their daily route to and from that individualâs home address.</p>
<div id="attachment_69272"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69272" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="1195" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg 1600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee-768x574.jpeg 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee-1536x1147.jpeg 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee-782x584.jpeg 782w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-69272">A still shot from a video Atlas shared of its use of Babel Street to identify and track an employee traveling each day between their home and the clinic.</p></div>
<p>Last year, Idaho became the first state to outlaw âabortion trafficking,â which the <strong>Idaho Capital Sun</strong> <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/08/26/helping-a-minor-travel-for-an-abortion-some-states-have-made-it-a-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> is defined as ârecruiting, harboring or transporting a pregnant minor to get an abortion or abortion medication without parental permission.â Tennessee now has a similar law, and GOP lawmakers in five other states introduced abortion trafficking bills that failed to advance this year, the Sun reports.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator used Babel Street to identify and track a person traveling from their home in Alabama â where abortion is now illegal â to an abortion clinic just over the border in Tallahassee, Fla. â and back home again within a few hours. Abortion rights advocates and providers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/nx-s1-5082217/can-alabama-prosecute-someone-for-helping-people-travel-out-of-state-for-an-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are currently suing Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall</a>, seeking to block him from prosecuting people who help patients travel out-of-state to end pregnancies.</p>
<p><strong>Eva Galperin</strong>, director of cybersecurity at the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation </strong>(EFF), a non-profit digital rights group, said sheâs extremely concerned about dragnet surveillance of people crossing state lines in order to get abortions.</p>
<p>âSpecifically, Republican officials from states that have outlawed abortion have made it clear that they are interested in targeting people who have gone to neighboring states in order to get abortions, and to make it more difficult for people who are seeking abortions to go to neighboring states,â Galperin said. âItâs not a great leap to imagine that states will do this.â</p>
<h2>APPLES AND GOOGLES</h2>
<p>Atlas found that for the right price (typically $10-50k a year), brokers can provide access to tens of billions of data points covering large swaths of the US population and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Based on the data sets Atlas acquired â many of which included older MAID records â they estimate they could locate roughly 80 percent of Android-based devices, and about 25 percent of Apple phones. Google refers to its MAID as the â<strong>Android Advertising ID</strong>,â (AAID) while Apple calls it the â<strong>Identifier for Advertisers</strong>â (IDFA).</p>
<p>What accounts for the disparity between the number of Android and Apple devices that can be found in mobile advertising data? In April 2021, Apple shipped version 14.5 of its iOS operating system, which introduced a technology called <strong>App Tracking Transparency</strong> (ATT) that requires apps to get affirmative consent before they can track users by their IDFA or any other identifier.</p>
<p>Appleâs introduction of ATT had a swift and profound impact on the advertising market: Less than a year later Facebook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclosed</a> that the iPhone privacy feature would decrease the companyâs 2022 revenues by about $10 billion.</p>
<div id="attachment_69274"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69274" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b.png" alt="" width="880" height="324" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b.png 880w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b-768x283.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b-782x288.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69274">Source: cnbc.com.</p></div>
<p>Google runs by far the worldâs largest ad exchange, known as <strong>AdX</strong>. The <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong>, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/technology/google-ad-antitrust-trial-arguments.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused Google of building a monopoly</a> over the technology that places ads on websites, estimates that Googleâs ad exchange controls 47 percent of the U.S. market and 56 percent globally.</p>
<p>Googleâs <strong>Android</strong> is also the dominant mobile operating system worldwide, with more than 72 percent of the market. In the U.S., however, iPhone users claim approximately 55 percent of the market, according to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ios-vs-android-market-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechRepublic</a>.</p>
<p>In response to requests for comment, Google said it does not send real time bidding requests to Babel Street, nor does it share precise location data in bid requests. The company added that its policies explicitly prohibit the sale of data from real-time bidding, or its use for any purpose other than advertising.</p>
<p>Google said its MAIDs are randomly generated and do not contain IP addresses, GPS coordinates, or any other location data, and that its ad systems do not share anyoneâs precise location data.</p>
<p>âAndroid has clear controls for users to manage app access to device location, and reset or delete their advertising ID,â Googleâs written statement reads. âIf we learn that someone, whether an app developer, ad tech company or anyone else, is violating our policies, we take appropriate action. Beyond that, we support legislation and industry collaboration to address these types of data practices that negatively affect the entire mobile ecosystem, including all operating systems.â</p>
<p>In a written statement shared with reporters, Apple said Location Services is not on by default in its devices. Rather, users must enable Location Services and must give permission to each app or website to use location data. Users can turn Location Services off at any time, and can change whether apps have access to location at any time. The userâs choices include precise vs. approximate location, as well as a one-time grant of location access by the app.</p>
<p>âWe believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and build privacy protections into each of our products and services to put the user in control of their data,â an Apple spokesperson said. âWe minimize personal data collection, and where possible, process data only on usersâ devices.â</p>
<p><strong>Zach Edwards</strong> is a senior threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm <strong>SilentPush</strong> who has studied the location data industry closely. Edwards said Google and Apple canât keep pretending like the MAIDs being broadcast into the bidstream from hundreds of millions of American devices arenât making most people trivially trackable.</p>
<p>âThe privacy risks here will remain until Apple and Google permanently turn off their mobile advertising ID schemes and admit to the American public that this is the technology that has been supporting the global data broker ecosystem,â he said.</p>
<h2>STATES ACT, WHILE CONGRESS DITHERS</h2>
<p>According to <strong>Bloomberg Law</strong>, between 2019 and 2023, threats against federal judges have more than doubled. Amid increasingly hostile political rhetoric and conspiracy theories against government officials, a growing number of states are <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/cops-battle-data-brokers-for-privacy-in-constitutional-clash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking to pass their own versions of Danielâs Law</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, a retired <strong>West Virginia</strong> police officer <a href="https://therecord.media/west-virginia-law-enforcement-sues-broker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a class action lawsuit</a> against the people-search service Whitepages for listing their personal information in violation of a statute the state passed in 2021 that largely mirrors Danielâs Law.</p>
<p>In May 2024, Maryland passed the <strong>Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act</strong> â named after a county circuit court judge who was murdered by an individual involved in a divorce proceeding over which he was presiding. The law allows current and former members of the Maryland judiciary to request their personal information not be made available to the public.</p>
<p>Under the Maryland law, personal information can include a home address; telephone number, email address; Social Security number or federal tax ID number; bank account or payment card number; a license plate or other unique vehicle identifier; a birth or marital record; a childâs name, school, or daycare; place of worship; place of employment for a spouse, child, or dependent.</p>
<p>The law firm <strong>Troutman Pepper</strong> <a href="https://www.troutman.com/insights/maryland-enacts-the-judge-andrew-f-wilkinson-judicial-security-act-are-more-daniels-laws-on-the-horizon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> that âso far in 2024, 37 states have begun considering or have adopted similar privacy-based legislation designed to protect members of the judiciary and, in some states, other government officials involved in law enforcement.â</p>
<p>Atlas alleges that in response to requests to have data on its New Jersey law enforcement clients scrubbed from consumer records sold by <strong>LexisNexis</strong>, the data broker retaliated by freezing the credit of approximately 18,500 people, and falsely reporting them as identity theft victims.</p>
<p>In addition, Atlas said LexisNexis started returning failure codes indicating they had no record of these individuals, resulting in denials when officers attempted to refinance loans or open new bank accounts.</p>
<p>The data broker industry has responded by having at least 70 of the Atlas lawsuits moved to federal court, and challenging the constitutionality of the New Jersey statute as overly broad and a violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the data broker industry argued in their motion to dismiss that there is âno First Amendment doctrine that exempts a content-based restriction from strict scrutiny just because it has some nexus with a privacy interest.â</p>
<p>Atlasâs lawyers responded that data covered under Danielâs Law â personal information of New Jersey law enforcement officers â is not free speech. Atlas notes that while defending against comparable lawsuits, the data broker industry has argued that home address and phone number data are not âcommunications.â</p>
<p>âData brokers should not be allowed to argue that information like addresses are not âcommunicationsâ in one context, only to turn around and claim that addresses are protectable communications,â Atlas <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/5.-PLAINTIFFS-MEMORANDUM-OF-LAW-IN-OPPOSITION-TO-DEFENDANTS-CONSOLIDATED-MOTION-TO-DISMISS-PLAINTIFFS-COMPLAINT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> (PDF). âNor can their change of course alter the reality that the data at issue is not speech.â</p>
<p>The judge overseeing the challenge is expected to rule on the motion to dismiss within the next few weeks. Regardless of the outcome, the decision is likely to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, media law experts say theyâre concerned that enacting Danielâs Law in other states could limit the ability of journalists to hold public officials accountable, and allow authorities <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/09/21/judge-declines-to-limit-daniels-law-for-reporters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pursue criminal charges against media outlets</a> that publish the same type of public and government records that fuel the people-search industry.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Ron Wyden</strong> (D-Ore.) said Congressâ failure to regulate data brokers, and the administrationâs continued opposition to bipartisan legislation that would limit data sales to law enforcement, have created this current privacy crisis.</p>
<p>âWhether location data is being used to identify and expose closeted gay Americans, or to track people as they cross state lines to seek reproductive health care, data brokers are selling Americansâ deepest secrets and exposing them to serious harm, all for a few bucks,â Wyden said in a statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, 404 Media, Haaretz, NOTUS, and The New York Times.</p>
<p>Sen. Wyden said Google also deserves blame for refusing to follow Appleâs lead by removing companiesâ ability to track phones.</p>
<p>âGoogleâs insistence on uniquely tracking Android users â and allowing ad companies to do so as well â has created the technical foundations for the surveillance economy and the abuses stemming from it,â Wyden said.</p>
<p>Georgetown Lawâs Justin Sherman said the data broker and mobile ad industries claim there are protections in place to anonymize mobile location data and restrict access to it, and that there are limits to the kinds of invasive inferences one can make from location data. The data broker industry also likes to tout the usefulness of mobile location data in fighting retail fraud, he said.</p>
<p>âAll kinds of things can be inferred from this data, including people being targeted by abusers, or people with a particular health condition or religious belief,â Sherman said. âYou can track jurors, law enforcement officers visiting the homes of suspects, or military intelligence people meeting with their contacts. The notion that the sale of all this data is preventing harm and fraud is hilarious in light of all the harm it causes enabling people to better target their cyber operations, or learning about peopleâs extramarital affairs and extorting public officials.â</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2>
<p>Privacy experts say disabling or deleting your deviceâs MAID will have no effect on how your phone operates, except that you may begin to see far less targeted ads on that device.</p>
<p>Any Android apps with permission to use your location should appear when you navigate to the Settings app, Location, and then App Permissions. âAllowed all the timeâ is the most permissive setting, followed by âAllowed only while in use,â âAsk every time,â and âNot allowed.â</p>
<p>Android users can delete their ad ID permanently, by opening the Settings app and navigating to Privacy &gt; Ads. Tap âDelete advertising ID,â then tap it again on the next page to confirm. According to the EFF, this will prevent any app on your phone from accessing the ad ID in the future. Googleâs documentation on this is <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US&amp;ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_69276"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69276" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/android-ads-optout.png" alt="" width="650" height="589"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69276">Image: eff.org</p></div>
<p>By default, Appleâs iOS requires apps to ask permission before they can access your deviceâs IDFA. When you install a new app, it may ask for permission to track you. When prompted to do so by an app, select the âAsk App Not to Trackâ option. Apple users also can set the âAllow apps to request to trackâ switch to the âoffâ position, which will block apps from asking to track you.</p>
<div id="attachment_69278"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69278" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/applerequesttotrack.png" alt="" width="575" height="390"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69278">Appleâs Privacy and Ad Tracking Settings.</p></div>
<p>Apple also has its own targeted advertising system which is separate from third-party tracking enabled by the IDFA. To disable it, go to Settings, Privacy, and Apple Advertising, and ensure that the âPersonalized Adsâ setting is set to âoff.â</p>
<p>Finally, if youâre the type of reader whoâs the default IT support person for a small group of family or friends (bless your heart), it would be a good idea to set their devices not to track them, and to disable any apps that may have location data sharing turned on 24/7.</p>
<p>There is a dual benefit to this altruism, which is clearly in the device ownerâs best interests. Because while <em>your</em> device may not be directly trackable via advertising data, making sure theyâre opted out of said tracking also can reduce the likelihood that you are trackable simply by being physically close to those who <em>are</em>.</p>
