<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Intro from Zach Rausch and Jon Haidt:</strong></p><p><span>Today, we publish our third post on what we now call the “first act” of </span><em>The Anxious Generation</em><span>: the loss of community. (The second act is the loss of the play-based childhood. The third act is the rise of the phone-based childhood.) In our </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/community-based-childhood" rel="">first post,</a><span> Zach discussed Robert Putnam’s essential work on the decline of social capital and trust, which happened in part because new individualizing technologies (such as television) emerged and participation in local and communal activities waned. As communities weakened and trust eroded, so did the play-based childhood.</span></p><p><span>In the </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/neighborhoods-that-nurture-why-thehttps://www.afterbabel.com/p/neighborhoods-that-nurture-why-thehttps://www.afterbabel.com/p/neighborhoods-that-nurture-why-the" rel="">second post</a><span>, we featured an essay by </span><a href="https://sethkaplan.org/" rel="">Seth Kaplan</a><span>, author and lecturer at Johns Hopkins who studies fragile states. In it, he argued that to restore the play-based childhood, we must first rebuild strong in-person local communities. In this post, Seth takes his argument one step further, asserting that the upstream cause of the youth mental health crisis is the loss of community. As we are offered new virtual ways to connect with one another, Seth contends that we are only growing further apart.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We note that the first generation to move its social life onto social media platforms immediately became the </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/arent-you-lonely" rel="">loneliest generation</a><span> on record. There is a spectrum of approaches that we as a society can take to address the crushing loneliness of Gen Z and Gen Alpha. On one end is doubling down on technology, typified by the recent introduction of the </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/friend-ai-pendant/" rel="">creepy AI “friend” orb</a><span>, which young people can wear around their necks so that they always have a “friend” to talk with. On the other end is to focus on strengthening the real-world human communities and neighborhoods we live in. Seth advocates for the latter and provides us with a roadmap to get there.</span></p><p><strong>— Zach and Jon</strong></p><p><span>Jonathan Haidt and Zach Rausch </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/community-based-childhood" rel="">argue</a><span> that the loss of community is one of three factors behind the deterioration in youth mental health, along with the decline of play and the emergence of phone-mediated childhood. But in this article, I argue that it’s actually the </span><em>dominant factor</em><span> since it is upstream from the other two.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The rapid spread of smartphones in the early 2010s triggered the dramatic uptick in mental distress among youth, but this happened especially in places where the social system supporting them was already hollowed out. As </span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/06/opinion/religious-teens-mental-health/" rel="">Rausch writes</a><span>, kids who live in well-rooted “real-world communities … spending more time engaging in their local community –</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moM3e_dcajEJzDR_uBK1mIs3hZ8vFZJ4MfUx7NZIx3I/edit#gid=809472783&amp;range=B35" rel=""> attending religious services, working, spending more time with trusted adults</a><span>, and spending more</span><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-generations-jean-m-twenge/18698850?ean=9781982181611" rel=""> time</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jean-twenge.html" rel=""> with their friends</a><span> in person” — are less likely to experience the harms of the phone-based childhood. Where community is strong, the impact has been softened.</span></p><p>In this post, I argue that kids need real-world community to thrive and that the weakening (and even breakdown) of neighborhood communities across many countries explains many of the problems facing youth today—from screen addiction and the decline in mental health to rising drug addiction and growing loneliness.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>The term “community” is often used, but its meaning is rarely articulated. It is sometimes conflated with a “sense of community,” which can be produced by working with a dedicated group of volunteers or in a close-knit organization. But, an actual community is more permanent and is much harder to create. A prototypical community consists of most or all of the following:</p><ul><li><p><span>A web of overlapping, affect-laden </span><strong>associations and relationships</strong><span> that crisscross and reinforce each other;</span></p></li><li><p><span>A set of </span><strong>shared values, norms, and goals</strong><span>—a common culture that unifies and constrains;</span></p></li><li><p><span>A </span><strong>common identity</strong><span>, ideally based on a common history and narrative and recognition of mutual interdependence;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Shared rituals</strong><span> that celebrate the group, its past, and future;</span></p></li><li><p><span>High levels of </span><strong>trust</strong><span>;</span></p></li><li><p><span>High levels of </span><strong>commitment</strong><span>, with limited options for (or high costs to) exit;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Recognition of and respect for common </span><strong>authority</strong><span> figures who guide the group’s decision-making;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Keystone actors and institutions</strong><span> that bridge and bond different members together;</span></p></li><li><p><span>A </span><strong>diverse range of skills and personalities</strong><span> that can contribute complementary things of value (e.g., money, time, expertise) to the group;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Role models</strong><span> who exhibit the cultural behaviors that the group should ideally replicate or at least aspire to;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Exhibiting a high degree of </span><strong>inclusiveness</strong><span> by actively seeking to encompass every member who shares the same identity or location;</span></p></li><li><p><span>Capacity to strongly encourage through moral suasion certain </span><strong>norms</strong><span> of conduct and, if necessary, sanction misconduct.</span></p></li></ul><p>As we can see from this list, a community requires a commitment to a certain social order—and usually to a place—that, by definition, must constrain some choices. In return for security, support, and belonging, members surrender some of their freedom. This explains why creating community in America today is so difficult—few want to compromise their ability to make choices. This is especially true among those with the resources and/or capacity to relocate as soon as a better opportunity beckons—the very people whose leadership and role-modeling communities can ill afford to lose.</p><p>Much of a child’s learning and formation is absorbed from the environment rather than directly taught by adults; behavior is better shaped by modeling than by lecturing. The institutions (e.g., schools, churches, and parents’ groups) and norms (e.g., regular family dinners, neighborhood play dates, and the expectation that adults will monitor streets) around us shape our kids' lives in ways we sometimes fail to consider because they are subtle. These institutions and norms determine the strength of families, interfamily networks, neighborhood relationships, and communal support systems. They shape each kid’s attitudes toward relationships, technology, and life goals. For example, when adults and older kids in my neighborhood model kindness, generosity, and responsibility to one another, my kids learn that these are the norms we should all aspire to in a way that no textbook or teacher (or parent) can instruct. When my religious neighborhood turns off technology for one day a week—on Shabbat—we are showing our kids that embodied relationships and interaction are more important than our phones and virtual networks. These institutions and the norms thus have an enormous influence on the choices parents and kids make every day, and on how vulnerable the latter are to various challenges like smartphones, drug use, and gang involvement.</p><p><span>As I documented in a</span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/neighborhoods-that-nurture-why-the" rel=""> previous essay at After Babel</a><span>, unsupervised, child-directed play was in decline long before kids had smartphones. Why? Because place-based institutions and the communities they support were in decline. Instead of spending time with peers in the neighborhood (the norm for millennia because we all lived in place-based communities), </span><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Generations/Jean-M-Twenge/9781982181611" rel="">kids</a><span> were already spending much of their time outside of school </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-free-time-became-screen-time/" rel="">at home</a><span> with </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/ppm-ppm0000203.pdf" rel="">televisions</a><span>, computers, or video games. More affluent children had many of their activities organized for them by their parents, putting them in a variety of highly structured functional groups with different kids rather than repeatedly playing freely with their neighbors. This oversupervision or “coddling”—the subject of the</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224919/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yyb49J53TZs_9w5jNGcgLCRAqGuBAc-b28AzzCCPcsdxUKlU_TTJtUu4ssi1UOK-WbEB2boDybMiuYFlsaHtpf5fZhrhsQjKSbr3NdpP-QJHw85Obxf-EpRKFsbvY1C13wwU1CWYisHPXsVTT6eCefQrwype6OZ3wttmy5GEKw5s9gR6jCboJyrP_msts2KJo9sOHHqSx1AVF_962RtI8wUPc1H3AR0mw_slivFqgoGkdUpSnDp_5sb68zWnZ2ECULJV5wZDAJ2cqz4oFkxS1m87_InfwIfk7lyZEZQcw2U.XhGIGJzOKGa_whWg772-29bt_1jJpTMutfhGOVxbwOI&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;hvadid=598729490318&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9007807&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=11718848189838980715&amp;hvtargid=kwd-280547986705&amp;hydadcr=22569_13531285&amp;keywords=coddling+of+the+american+mind&amp;qid=1717532774&amp;sr=8-1" rel=""> 2018 book</a><span> co-authored by Greg Lukianoff and Jon—made the attractions of smartphones and social media even more appealing.

We can video chat with hundreds of people simultaneously from far-flung locations. We can pursue learning largely untethered from any physical space. Based on all of this, it would be easy to assume that place doesn’t matter.</span></p><p>I disagree. Physical place actually matters far more than we realize, especially as our lives become ever more placeless.</p><p><span>As Jon writes in </span><em>The Anxious Generation</em><span>, only real-world (place-based) social relationships and interactions have the four features that have characterized human interactions for millions of years. Such interactions are embodied, they are&nbsp; synchronous, they involve one-to-one or one-to-several communications, and they have a high bar for entry and exit. In contrast, virtual interactions are typically disembodied and asynchronous, involve one-to-many communications, and have a low bar for entry and exit. The challenge today is that smartphones and other digital devices bring so many interesting experiences to children and adolescents that they cause a serious problem: </span><em>They reduce interest in all non-screen-based forms of experience</em><span>. Virtual networks are not only insufficient replacements for communities, but their proliferation makes the establishment of communities more difficult.</span></p><p>Community—and the relational security blanket it provides—is essential to the health and well-being of our children. Yet, over the last two generations, the U.S. has moved from a “townshipped” society in which neighbors regularly communicated and collaborated with each other through a host of place-based institutions to a “networked” and technologically-driven one in which local neighborhoods, schools, churches, and civic organizations are less important, and therefore they have weakened over time.&nbsp;</p><p><span>“The Quest for Community,”</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quest-Community-Background-Essential-Conservative/dp/1935191500" rel=""> in the words of Robert Nisbet</a><span>, continues unabated, but today, the term “community” is often used in ways that are aspirational and limitless (e.g., </span><a href="https://creators.facebook.com/tools/groups/?locale=en_US" rel="">many</a><span> </span><a href="https://bubble.io/community" rel="">online</a><span> </span><a href="https://training.thinkific.com/courses/thriving-communities" rel="">advertisements</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.disco.co/academy" rel="">for</a><span> </span><a href="https://community.sephora.com/" rel="">new</a><span> social networks)—quite different from the original meaning of the term. Indeed, it’s a good example of “term inflation” — the stretching of a good idea to promote values and goals quite different from what is meant.</span></p><p>Why? Perhaps fewer individuals have any experience of what community really means. Young people are marketed to and formed by the twin pursuits of convenience and choice while simultaneously being told that a person’s chief purpose is to express themselves (usually through consumption). This vision of the good life is part of the next generation’s socialization. It feels “natural” to them, and yet it does little to prepare them for the demands and delights of membership in a community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Community differs significantly from friendships, social networks, or what is experienced online. Whereas communities offer mutual support in times of good and bad and are bolstered by robust institutions and norms encouraging frequent, positive interactions, care and concern for one another, and ample opportunities to work together towards common goals, the alternatives typically fall short on these elements.&nbsp;</p><p><span>While one-to-one relationships, a string of individual 1:1 relationships, or participation in an online group can provide some benefits—including a </span><em>feeling</em><span> of connection—they fall far short of actually producing community, which requires overlapping institutions and activities, things that are very hard to achieve if you don’t share a physical place with one another.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Virtual groups are transitory and thin rather than permanent and thick. They cannot provide the dense web of supportive social ties that act like a security blanket when in need or the breadth of informal supportive daily interactions that are the lifeblood of a true community. Most online networks, for example, are instrumental, serving to connect people with a common history or interest or need together, as with </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1629740080681586" rel="">Facebook</a><span> or </span><a href="https://discord.com/creators/community-server-features-every-creator-should-know-about" rel="">Discord</a><span> Groups. They offer a stream of messages and connections, useful information, entertainment, and sometimes notes of support — from known and unknown people.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some of these sell themselves as online communities — </span><a href="https://networkconference.netstudies.org/2018OUA/2018/04/23/community-hashtags-generate-a-sense-of-belonging/" rel="">think of</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.sanctuarymg.com/academy/social-media/hashtags-build-social-community/" rel="">the</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/finding-your-community-hashtags-reboostlive/" rel="">concept</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.sarahbeststrategy.com/blog/using-hashtags-to-increase-social-media-engagement#:~:text=Community%20hashtags%20are%20hashtags%20that,build%20community%2C%20and%20gain%20followers." rel="">of</a><span> “finding or creating community” through hashtags — where users find photos and videos of other people who share like-minded views (and then they like, comment, and share those photos and videos). But these fall far short of the meaning of community. On the net, online groups are more transactional, engendering little sense of mutual responsibility, and not necessarily useful when you need help nor protective when you are vulnerable. The norms of mutual support are significantly weakened and there is little of the sense of common destiny that a place-based community produces. Who would you rather call when in trouble - a real person you see regularly down the block from you or someone online who you have never met in person?&nbsp;</span></p><p>It’s worth noting that online communities are also voluntary, with many being platforms built for expression or personal advancement. Few provide the diversity of personalities, experiences, income levels, and outlooks that were common in most neighborhoods a few decades ago. Few provide the incentives to earn recognition through the force of character rather than a performative act about oneself. Few provide multifaceted psychological and practical support when needed for members who feel vulnerable or fall into practical difficulties.&nbsp;</p><p><span>None of this is to say that online networks and relationships don’t have significant value. In some cases, the virtual world can enhance pre-existing real-world relationships and groups. In others, it can connect people who would never meet otherwise. My point, however, is that we need to recognize that they are not sufficient </span><em>replacements</em><span> for what real-world in-person relationships and communities offer and that we should have a clear view of the limitations, which are significant.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p>I moved to my current neighborhood, Kemp Mill, just north of Washington, D.C., 12 years ago to raise a family and (mostly) put an end to my nomadic wanderings. It offered something that few neighborhoods could—a real community with high levels of hospitality and social trust. It is as institutionally thick as any place I have been in America, with these institutions nurturing the deep social ties and tight web of associations that bind us together and enhance our lives in countless invisible ways. The benefits of such ties are apparent every time we face a difficulty—whether it involves safety, technology, or a pandemic.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png" width="1074" height="624" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:624,&quot;width&quot;:1074,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1321653,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f593ba2-1ee3-42e3-8117-2caddb18f1cf_1074x624.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em><strong>Images. </strong><span>The</span><strong> </strong><span>Kemp Mill neighborhood. Bake sales, kids playing, and presents from neighbors.</span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>When COVID-19 struck Kemp Mill, we found that our in-person networks had prepared us to weather such a challenge. A large number of volunteers appeared, ready to distribute food, masks, and medicine to the homebound and set up outdoor pods for kids to play. While many schools around the country went virtual for extended periods of time, ours made every effort to reopen within months by leveraging the medical talent in the neighborhood to develop nuanced procedures to safeguard everyone. Streams of volunteers supplemented what school staff could manage. Meanwhile, synagogues organized new virtual activities for kids and shifted their many programs for adults online. Neighbors hosted social gatherings in their front yards and encouraged kids to spend time together in the back yards. In sum, neighborliness and helpfulness were the default behavior. While I often hear about the negative aftereffects of COVID when meeting educators and parents elsewhere, I do not hear the same complaints from the families in our school.</p><p>I am thus not worried about social media’s impact on my kids. As a strong kids-centered community, we do not need the government’s help to restrict kids’ use of social media. Our school and the parents of our children’s classmates already carefully monitor what information children consume. Youth get their phones at a later age than elsewhere in America, and our schools do not allow them anywhere near a classroom. Moreover, most receive older-style cell phones that cannot access social media. My kids are active readers, borrowing books from the local library and subscribing to compelling magazines and book subscriptions. And they regularly spend joyful time with their classmates and neighboring kids, going hours and hours together talking, playing board games and cards, singing, competing in sports, or just walking around—with no phones in sight. In observing our faith, our whole community also regularly spends time (on the Sabbath and major holidays) with no access to any media at all. Parents model that they too know how to set their phones aside and attend to real community, in space and time.</p><p><strong>If you are a parent and want to join or build a community to enmesh your kids in, what can you do? Here are a few ideas to get started.</strong></p><p><span>First, you can select a place to live based on its </span><em>social</em><span> wealth. When my wife and I were ready to have kids, we were determined to find a supportive community to live in. We spent a year checking out half a dozen options between New York City (where we lived) and Washington, D.C. (where I was doing more work). In most cases, we visited, stayed overnight, met lots of people, and asked lots of questions. In the end, we chose the D.C. suburb where I live now—a warm, welcoming, and institutionally rich place.</span></p><p><span>Second, consider how you can befriend neighbors and other parents in your immediate vicinity. Try the </span><a href="https://neighboringmovement.org/" rel="">8 Front Door Challenge</a><span>, which helps you plan and host a Get-Together with neighbors closest to you. Participate in organizations or activities in your neighborhood. Spend time in places where people congregate locally. Organize </span><a href="https://www.edmonton.ca/residential_neighbourhoods/neighbourhoods/block-parties-play-streets" rel="">a block party or play street</a><span>. Create a </span><a href="https://www.edmonton.ca/sites/default/files/public-files/Creating_Neighbourly_Block_2.pdf?cb=1720545079" rel="">neighborly block</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Third, leverage local institutions to build neighborhood community. Schools are best placed for this because of their direct ties to local families and kids, but libraries, local businesses, houses of worship, and any other entity with strong ties to your locale can play an important role. A parents’ group based on the families from the schools in your neighborhood would not only build stronger ties between families but also provide a platform to organize activities where residents get to know each other and develop a stronger sense of mutual support and trust. Working with the local library to organize activities in or geared towards your specific neighborhood would create an opportunity for residents to meet one another. A church, synagogue, or mosque could more proactively embrace the neighborhood, as members of </span><a href="https://www.parishcollective.org/" rel="">Parish Collective</a><span> do. As for businesses, many have an active interest in building social ties with neighbors. Might they want to hold events, contribute to building community, or invest in some way to strengthen local relationships among neighbors? In general, it’s always easier if you find allies among your neighbors, build partnerships with existing institutions, and leverage the assets (cultural, environmental, educational, economic, etc.) you already have locally. Think incrementally, building momentum step by step rather than thinking there is a magic bullet.</span></p><p><span>While it is important to</span><a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/jonathan-haidt-anxious-generation/" rel=""> debate</a><span> youth use of social media, and whether the government should regulate it, what is missing from this discussion is the strength of “the little society” that kids inhabit daily. There are real tradeoffs in using social media, and external factors heavily impact the mix and balance between the positives and negatives involved. As Zach</span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/06/opinion/religious-teens-mental-health/" rel=""> writes</a><span>, kids “</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moM3e_dcajEJzDR_uBK1mIs3hZ8vFZJ4MfUx7NZIx3I/edit#gid=1666441069" rel="">rooted</a><a href="https://publicsquaremag.org/dialogue/persuasion/belonging-and-believing-in-conservative-and-liberal-religion/" rel=""> in their</a><span> real-world communities” are “</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moM3e_dcajEJzDR_uBK1mIs3hZ8vFZJ4MfUx7NZIx3I/edit#gid=1666441069" rel="">less likely</a><span> to move their lives so deeply into the virtual world.” Instead, they “continue to spend more time with friends and trusted adults in person. They are, therefore, less likely to become anxious and depressed when they trade in their flip phones for smartphones, and they are also better able to find social support, which may make online harms less painful.”</span></p><p>What matters for our kids is not online connections, but in-person relationships; not just individual friendships but the strength and abundance of neighborhood institutions. Robust communities will foster hundreds of relationships and dozens of place-based institutions engendering trust, fraternity, mutual support, and stewardship. These will shape how we raise our kids and how they will, in turn, raise their own.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-upstream-cause-of-the-youth-mental?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">The keyboard type is blackberry Q10 or Q20 keyboard. Both have the same keyboard layout.<br>
There is a red switch on the left side to decide if the keyboard controller communicates with the HackberryPi or with other device through the USBC-Port underneath.<br>
The idea about this is you can connect the keyboard with your computer and customize the keymap using <a href="https://get.vial.today/" rel="nofollow">VIAL</a> or the handheld can be used as an emergency keyboard mouse combo.<br>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q</strong>: Why is it called "ell"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A</strong>: "ell" is a combination of shell and LLM. It is a shell script to use LLM backends. "shellm" was once considered, but it was dropped because it could be misunderstood as "she llm". "ell" is shorter, easy to type and easy to remember. It does not conflict with any active software. Note that the name "shell" of shell scripts is because it is the outer layer of the operating system exposed to the user. It doesn't indicate that it is a CLI or GUI. Unfortunately it cannot be shortened to "L" which has the same pronunciation because that would conflict with too many things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q</strong>: Why is it written in Bash?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A</strong>: Because Bash is the most common shell on Unix-like systems and there is just no need to use a more complex language for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q</strong>: What is the difference between ell and other similar projects?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A</strong>: ell is written in almost pure Bash, which makes it very lightweight and easy to install. It is also very easy to extend and modify. It is pipe friendly, which means it is designed to be used in combination with other tools.</p>

Dr. Warren had long mulled over an alternative “germ theory” for ulcers, but he had scant evidence to bolster his ideas and almost no supporters.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QGBZPYNHTJAKHBW4FMULC3GCFM" data-el="text" dir="null">“Bacteria had been seen before, but these findings had been disregarded as some odd curiosities or just contaminations,” <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2005/prize-announcement/" target="_blank">said</a> Swedish microbiologist Staffan Normark at the Nobel Prize announcement in Stockholm.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IVOWMRQGTVEANADHMQXZUAGKMQ" data-el="text" dir="null">Marshall, as a young clinical researcher, watched the eyerolls at Dr. Warren during medical conferences. “He would mention these bacteria and the surgeons would be saying ‘ha ha ha, Robin’s talking about his bacteria again,’” recalled Marshall in an<a href="https://www.medicalrepublic.com.au/farewell-to-a-giant-of-pathology-and-medicine/109345" target="_blank"> interview</a> with the Medical Republic, an Australian health and science site.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HOFMN5RNKJEPRLXHUVJ4SINWY4" data-el="text" dir="null">The biopsy sample spotted by Dr. Warren gave him a tangible lead. He recruited <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2005/marshall/facts/" target="_blank">Marshall</a>, and they began studying tissue from patients with ulcers and other digestive problems. Nearly all the samples showed the presence of the same bacteria. They dubbed it Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori: “helico,” as in helicopter, for its spiral shape, and “pylori” for the pylorus valve at the bottom of the stomach.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5YZF5NXTONC4HKRMKJIJQIBXRM" data-el="text" dir="null">They announced their findings in a series of papers, including in the British journal the Lancet, in the early 1980s. The medical community remained skeptical.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VHLC2KATZNAHZLBKCLETN6FUTE" data-el="text" dir="null">“For about 100 years, or 1,000 years, the standard teaching in medicine was that the stomach was sterile and nothing grew there because of corrosive gastric juices,” Dr. Warren <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/03/health/2-australians-share-nobel-in-medicine-for-ulcer-study.html" target="_blank">said</a>. “So everybody believed there were no bacteria in the stomach.

He swilled down a bacterial broth in an attempt to draw conclusive links between H. pylori and ulcers. Test animals such as pigs and rats were immune to the bacteria. Dr. Warren already had an H. pylori infection, and they feared he could have built an immunity.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5CPCWTLQW5GJTIDNKCAQ73MI2Q" data-el="text" dir="null">“So, Barry, I think it has to be you,” Marshall <a href="https://www.medicalrepublic.com.au/farewell-to-a-giant-of-pathology-and-medicine/109345" target="_blank">recalled </a>Dr. Warren telling him.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FFLLDAYM5VHOZE6AAYU4AYFCB4" data-el="text" dir="null">After about three days, Marshall became sick. “I started vomiting. I was waking up in the middle of the night, I couldn’t eat well, I was having night sweats,” he told the Australian, a newspaper based near Sydney, in 2005. “I had the endoscopy after a week and it showed the bacteria had taken hold.”</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PCVWLHPGLJF5ZGHEI6YWBTC5BE" data-el="text" dir="null">The test revealed H. pylori around an inflamed part of his stomach. He was better after a course of antibiotics, further advancing their findings toward a cure.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V2A5RDZYEFH6VGVTYVPQNNATH4" data-el="text" dir="null">About two-thirds of the world population has been infected with H. pylori, often during childhood, but the bacteria leads to health problems in a relatively small number of people, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/helicobacter-pylori#epi" target="_blank">according to</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infections can also bring an increased risk of gastric cancers or a lymphoma known as mucosal associated-lymphoid-type, or MALT, the CDC says.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NV4JAC7QURHTDL2NENSDFLITNU" data-el="text" dir="null">The precise reason H. pylori becomes aggressive in some people is not fully understood. But when it happens, the bacteria can cause ulcers by damaging the stomach lining and making it more vulnerable to digestive fluids. H. pylori causes more than 90 percent of duodenal stomach ulcers and 80 percent of upper-intestinal ulcers, the Nobel committee said. Other causes are overuse of some drugs that can compromise the stomach lining.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="77J6UKUZ2JE7DCQMYX6MI27OQY" data-el="text" dir="null">“The idea of stress and things like that was just so entrenched nobody could really believe that it was bacteria,” Dr. Warren <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/two-australians-win-nobel-prize-medicine-flna1c9437614" target="_blank">once said</a>. “It had to come from some weird place like Perth, Western Australia, because I think nobody else would have even considered it.”</p><p data-qa="article-body"><h3 data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="TGXBJ6NJLJCHLAQSLYQGHS6XNU" data-apitype="header" level="3" id="TGXBJ6NJLJCHLAQSLYQGHS6XNU">‘10,000 unusual things’</h3></p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RH6HZOGDYVBMVDPXJRJDXNHX3Q" data-el="text" dir="null">John Robin Warren was born on June 11, 1937, in Adelaide, Australia.

He was prescribed drugs that helped control the seizures, but he could not receive a driver’s license and used his bicycle for appointments and classes. His family had discussions — without Robin’s knowledge — about whether to demand that he pass up medical school because of his condition.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AZDWB6QRUFC25DSK53PF6UAVPY" data-el="text" dir="null">“It was only years later that I came to appreciate just how much my mother had gone through to support my independence. … Apparently, mother was worried sick, but she never said a word about it,” he wrote.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJJFBYOZVREBFAV6XGY5RW2VLA" data-el="text" dir="null">After receiving a degree in medicine from the University of Adelaide in 1961, he trained in clinical pathology at the Royal Adelaide Hospital.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Support <em>nullness markers</em> on Java types to indicate that a type rejects or
deliberately allows nulls.
This is a <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">preview language feature</a>.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Enhance Java's reference types to let programmers express whether <code>null</code>
references are expected as values of the type</p></li>
<li><p>Support conversions between types with different nullness properties,
accompanied by warnings about possibly-mishandled <code>null</code> values</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibibly interoperate with traditional Java code that makes no assertions
about the <code>null</code> compatibility of its types, and support gradual adoption of
these new features without introducing source or binary incompatibilities</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that variables with types that reject <code>null</code> are initialized before
they are first read</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce types that reject <code>null</code> at run time, even when classes are compiled
separately</p></li>
<li><p>Provide the metadata and integrity guarantees necessary for run-time
optimizations (such as the flattening of <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/401" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">value objects</a>) to rely
on types that claim to exclude <code>null</code></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>It is not a goal to automatically re-interpret existing code—use of these
features should be optional and explicitly opted in to (future work will
explore mechanisms to request a bulk opt-in without needing to change
individual types)</p></li>
<li><p>It is not a goal to require programs to explicitly account for all <code>null</code>
values that might occur; unaccounted-for <code>null</code> values may cause
compile-time warnings, but not compile-time errors</p></li>
<li><p>It is not a goal to make any changes to the primitive types, such as
adding support for a nullable <code>int</code> type</p></li>
<li><p>It is not a goal (at this time) to apply the language enhancements to the
standard libraries</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>In a Java program, a variable of type <code>String</code> may hold either a reference to a
<code>String</code> object or the special value <code>null</code>. In some cases, the author
intends that the variable will always hold a reference to a <code>String</code> object;
in other cases, the author expects <code>null</code> as a meaningful value. Unfortunately,
there is no way to formally express in the language which of these alternatives
is intended, leading to confusion and bugs.</p>

<p>For example, programs often make a blanket assumption that no <code>null</code> values will
be present. But it takes extra care to state this expectation in Javadoc
specifications and to reliably enforce it in implementation code. If extra care
isn't taken, and someone fails to follow the assumed protocol, then <code>null</code>
values may end up flowing freely through implementation code, eventually
triggering an exception at some point far removed from the bug.</p>

<p>This situation can be greatly improved by giving developers tools to assert, as
part of a type, that either (1) <code>null</code> values are not supported and will be
rejected, or (2) <code>null</code> values are expected and should be properly accounted
for.</p>

<p>By default, the language can't reasonably assume either of these
interpretations. It needs developers to explicitly indicate their intent.</p>

<p>Given a clear expression of intent, the language could then introduce both
compile-time feedback and run-time checks to help developers detect
unexpected nulls earlier.</p>

<p>In the Valhalla project, a variable of a <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/401" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">value class type</a> can
be optimized with a flattened representation of its values. But this flattened
representation may need extra bits to encode <code>null</code>, negatively impacting memory
footprint and sometimes making it impossible to optimize the storage at all.
If the developer could exclude <code>null</code> from the domain of the variable, a
<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8316779" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">better encoding</a> could be achieved.</p>

<p>In the Amber project, the nullness of a pattern match candidate may influence
whether a <code>switch</code> should be considered exhaustive, and the nullness of a type
pattern may influence whether the pattern matches <code>null</code>. It would be useful for
developers to be able to control these behaviors.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The features described below are preview features, enabled with the
<code>--enable-preview</code> compile-time and runtime flags.</p>

<h3>Nullness properties and markers</h3>

<p>A reference type may optionally express <em>nullness</em>—whether <code>null</code> is intended
to be included in the value set of the type.</p>

<p>In Java syntax, a <em>nullness marker</em> is used to indicate this property.</p>

<p>The type <code>Foo!</code> is <em>null-restricted</em>: the value set excludes <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>The type <code>Foo?</code> is <em>nullable</em>: the value set deliberately includes <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>By default, the nullness of the type <code>Foo</code> is <em>unspecified</em>: a <code>null</code> may occur,
but we don't know whether its presence is deliberate.</p>



<p>The nullness of a type is an intrinsic part of the type—in other words, <code>Foo?</code>
and <code>Foo</code> are <em>different types</em>, because they have different nullness.
However, as outlined later, most language rules are defined in a way that
either ignores nullness or helpfully adapts (perhaps with a warning) between
types with different nullness.</p>

<p>Array types and their array component types may both have nullness markers.
<code>Foo?[]!</code> is a null-restricted array type, whose components are of nullable type
<code>Foo</code>. Null markers for multi-dimensional arrays may occur after each bracket
pair, and by convention are interpreted outermost to innermost, from left to
right.</p>

<p>Parameterized types and their type arguments may similarly both have nullness
markers. <code>Predicate!&lt;Foo?&gt;</code> is a null-restricted <code>Predicate</code> with nullable type
<code>Foo</code> as a type argument. The interpretation of type arguments is described in
more detail later.</p>

<p>In this JEP, nullness markers are explicit: to express a null-restricted or
nullable type, the <code>!</code> or <code>?</code> symbol must appear in source. In the future, it
may be useful, for example, for a programmer to somehow express that every
type in a class or compilation unit is to be interpreted as null-restricted,
unless a <code>?</code> symbol is present. The details of any such a feature will be
explored separately.</p>

<h3>Field and array initialization</h3>

<p>Most variables in Java must be initialized with a value of the
variable's type before they can be used. Local variables are checked
for <em>definite assignment</em> before they can be referenced; method parameters get
initial values from a method invocation expression; pattern variables are bound
in the process of pattern matching; etc.</p>

<p>Traditionally, fields and array components get special treatment: because they
can be accessed by multiple program components immediately upon creation of a
class or object, they are automatically initialized "at birth" with a <em>default
value</em>, which programmers will typically overwrite in the course of program
execution.</p>

<p>The default value of a reference type is <code>null</code>. But this is an unsuitable
initial value for a null-restricted field or array component—if someone reads
the variable before it has been written, they will observe a value that is not
of the variable's type.</p>

<p>Thus, fields and arrays with null-restricted types behave differently than other
fields and arrays: they must always be initialized by the program before they
can be read. This is enforced as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A null-restricted instance field without an initializer must be definitely
assigned before the (explicit or implicit) <code>super(...)</code> call in each of the
class's constructors. The <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8325803" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Flexible Constructor Bodies JEP</a>
allows the necessary initialization code to be written at the start of a
constructor. In this <em>early construction context</em>, the initialization logic is
not allowed to refer to <code>this</code> or risk any attempts to read the uninitialized
field.</p>

<pre><code>class Person {
private String! name;

public Person(String name) {
  this.name = name;
  super();
}
}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If a null-restricted instance field <em>has</em> an initializer, the initializer is
executed at the start of each constructor, before the <code>super(...)</code> call.
(Constructors that call <code>this(...)</code> are a special case and, as usual, do not
execute initializers at all.) Again, this means that the initialization logic
of the field occurs in an <em>early construction context</em> and may not refer to
<code>this</code> or risk any reads of the uninitialized field.</p></li>
<li><p>A null-restricted static field must be definitely assigned by the end of all
static initializers and initializer blocks of the class. Note, however, that
this rule does not prevent some other class from trying to read the field
during the class initialization process; in that case, a run time check
detects the early read attempt and throws an exception.</p>

<p>In the following example, the initialization code of field <code>Foo.s</code> has a
circular dependency. Traditionally, the circular reference to <code>Foo.s</code> would
produce the default value of <code>s</code>, <code>null</code>; with a null-restricted field type,
that is impossible and so an exception is thrown alerting the developer to
the bug.</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
public String! s = Bar.getString();
}

class Bar {
static String! getString() {
    return Foo.s; // may throw an exception
}
}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>An array with a null-restricted component type must provide an initializer for
each component in the array creation expression. This can be achieved by
explicitly listing each initial value in an array initializer, or by using
a new shorthand form (syntax TBD).</p>

<pre><code>String![] labels;<br>
labels = new String![]{ "x", "y", "z" };
labels = new String!<span>[100]</span>{ "" }; // strawman syntax
labels = new String!<span>[100]</span>{ i -&gt; "x"+i }; // strawman syntax</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h3>Expression nullness and conversions</h3>

<p>As part of type checking, the Java compiler is responsible for determining the
nullness of every expression.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The nullness of a variable reference is given by the referenced variable's
declaration (but TBD whether the Java compiler will further observe that, due
to previous uses of the variable, a <code>null</code> is known not to be present).</p></li>
<li><p>The nullness of a method invocation is given by the referenced method's return
type.</p></li>
<li><p>The type of a cast expression is explicit in the cast (but, again, TBD whether
the Java compiler takes other information into account).</p></li>
<li><p>A <code>null</code> literal is nullable (of course).</p></li>
<li><p>Most other reference-typed expressions are null-restricted. These include
literals, string concatenations, <code>this</code>, class instance and array creations,
method references, and lambda expressions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A <em>nullness conversion</em> allows an expression with one kind of nullness to be
treated as having a different nullness. Nullness conversions are permitted
in all assignment, invocation, and casting contexts.</p>

<p>The following are <em>widening nullness conversions</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Foo!</code> to <code>Foo?</code></li>
<li><code>Foo!</code> to unspecified <code>Foo</code></li>
<li><code>Foo?</code> to unspecified <code>Foo</code></li>
<li>unspecified <code>Foo</code> to <code>Foo?</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And these are <em>narrowing nullness conversions</em>:
- <code>Foo?</code> to <code>Foo!</code>
- unspecified <code>Foo</code> to <code>Foo!</code></p>

<p>Narrowing nullness conversions are analogous to unboxing conversions: the
compiler performs them automatically, while at run time they impose a dynamic
check, possibly causing a <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, the boxing and unboxing conversions can now be simplified: boxing
converts <code>int</code> to <code>Integer!</code>, potentially followed by a widening nullness
conversion to <code>Integer</code>; unboxing converts <code>Integer!</code> to <code>int</code>, possibly
preceded by a narrowing nullness conversion from <code>Integer</code> to <code>Integer!</code>.</p>

<p>It is a compile-time error to attempt to directly convert a <code>null</code> literal to a
null-restricted type.</p>

<h3>Run-time null checking</h3>

<p>At run time, if a <code>null</code> value undergoes a narrowing nullness conversion to a
null-restricted type, a <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown.</p>

<pre><code>String? id(String! arg) { return arg; }

String s = null;
Object! o1 = s; // NPE
Object o2 = id(s); // NPE
Object o3 = (String!) s; // NPE</code></pre>

<p>Some narrowing nullness conversions are not apparent in the source code, but
occur implicitly as part of run time execution. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An array that was allocated with a null-restricted component type may be given
a less specific type in the source code, but will still reject <code>null</code> values
during the usual <em>array store check</em>. The failed conversion will prompt an
<code>ArrayStoreException</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Similary, a field that was not null-restricted at compile time but was later
separately compiled to be null-restricted will reject <code>null</code> values during a
new <em>field store check</em>. The failed conversion will prompt a
<code>FieldStoreException</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When one method overrides another, the argument to an invocation of the
superclass method undergoes conversion to the parameter's invocation type,
<em>followed by</em> conversion to the type of the overriding method's parameter.
As discussed below, the nullness of these two parameter types may not be the
same.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, the return value of a method undergoes conversion to the declared
method return type, <em>followed by</em> conversion to the invocation's expected
return type.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Nullness of type variables</h3>

<p>Like other types, a type-variable type (that is, a <em>use</em> of a type variable) may
express nullness. <code>T!</code> is a null-restricted type, and <code>T?</code> is a nullable type.</p>



<p>Null-restricted and nullable type variable types (<code>T!</code> and <code>T?</code>) assert a
specific nullness within the generic code. This may be appropriate if the
generic code directly interacts with <code>null</code>. <!--Parametric nullness (<code class="prettyprint" >T*</code>), on the
other hand, leaves nullness to the use site; often, the generic code does
nothing with values of the type variable type except store them or pass them on
to non-generic code.--></p>

<pre><code>class Box&lt;T&gt; {
    boolean set;
    T? val; // nullable field

    public Box() { set = false; }
    public void set(T val) { this.val = val; set = true; }

    public T? getOrNull() { // nullable result
        return set ? val : null;
    }

    public T! getNonNull(T! alt) { // null-restricted result
        return (set &amp;&amp; val != null) ? (T!) val : alt;
    }
}</code></pre>







<p>Types used as type arguments may express nullness; null markers on type-variable
types override whatever nullness was asserted by the type argument.</p>

<pre><code>Box&lt;String!&gt; b1 = new Box&lt;String!&gt;();
b1.getOrNull(); // nullable result

Box&lt;String?&gt; b2 = new Box&lt;String?&gt;();
b2.set(null);
b2.getNonNull(""); // null-restricted result</code></pre>

<p>Of course, null restrictions cannot be enforced within the erased implementation
of a generic API. But the usual implicit casts that occur at the boundaries of
generic APIs will enforce null-restricted type arguments at run time.</p>



<h3>Type arguments and bounds</h3>

<p>As illustrated above, type arguments may express nullness, which influences the
substituted nullness of the API wherever parametric type variables occur.</p>

<p>For interoperability, nullness in type arguments is not strongly enforced, and
<em>unchecked nullness conversions</em> allow modifications to the nullness of type
arguments. For example, <code>Predicate&lt;String!&gt;</code> can be converted to
<code>Predicate&lt;String&gt;</code> or <code>Predicate&lt;String?&gt;</code>. These conversions may cause
warnings (see "Compiler warnings", below).</p>

<p>Similarly, unchecked nullness conversions allow modifications to the nullness of
array component types. TBD under what conditions these conversions are checked
at run time.</p>

<p>A type variable declaration or wildcard may have nullness markers on its bounds.
A type may satisfy the bounds via nullness conversion, though, so again these
nullness markers are not strongly enforced, but may cause warnings.</p>

<h3>Method overriding and type argument inference</h3>

<p>Nullness is ignored when determining whether two methods have the same
signature. One method may override another even if the nullness of their
parameters and returns do not match.</p>

<pre><code>class A {
    String? lookup(String! arg) { ... }
}

class B extends A {
    String lookup(String arg) { ... }
}</code></pre>

<p>Such mismatches will be common as different APIs adopt nullness markers
independently.</p>

<p>Formally, two methods are considered to have the <em>same signature</em> if each
parameter type and type parameter bound can be converted to the other via
nullness and unchecked conversions.</p>

<p>Similarly, the return type of an overriding method must be convertible to the
overridden return type via a widening reference conversion, possibly followed by
nullness and unchecked conversions.</p>

<p>If a method is generic, any parametric uses of its type parameters in the method
signature will influence the inferred nullness of type arguments. Nullness does
not influence method applicability and cannot cause type argument inference to
fail, but it can influence the nullness inferred for the method's return type.
(Details of the inference algorithm TBD.)</p>

<h3>Compiler warnings</h3>

<p>As described above, making a type null-restricted may cause new compile-time
errors if a field or array of the type is left uninitialized, or if an
attempt is made to convert a <code>null</code> literal to the type. It may also be a
compile-time error to compare a <code>null</code> literal to an expression with a
null-restricted type.</p>

<p>In other situations, nullness analysis is supplementary and does not cause
compile-time errors. However, <code>javac</code> will provide warnings to help programmers
avoid runtime errors. IDEs and other analysis tools are encouraged to do the
same. Possible sources of warnings include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Narrowing nullness conversions, especially from <code>?</code> types</p></li>
<li><p><code>?</code>-typed <!--or <code class="prettyprint" >*</code>-typed--> expressions used in member accesses or other null-hostile
operations</p></li>
<li><p>Type arguments whose nullness is inconsistent with their bounds</p></li>
<li><p>Method parameters or returns with nullness that doesn't match an overridden
method</p></li>
<li><p>Unchecked conversions that change the nullness of a type</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Compilation &amp; class file representation</h3>

<p>Most uses of null markers are erased in <code>class</code> files, with the accompanying
run-time conversions being expressed directly in bytecode.</p>

<p><code>Signature</code> attributes have an updated grammar to allow <code>!</code> and <code>?</code> <!-- and <code class="prettyprint" >*</code>--> in
types, as appropriate. Nullness is not encoded in method and
field <em>descriptors</em>.</p>

<p>However, to prevent pollution of fields, a new <code>NullRestricted</code> attribute allows
a field to indicate that it does not allow <code>null</code> values. This has the following
effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The field must also be marked <code>ACC_STRICT</code>, which indicates that it must be
"strictly-initialized". The verifier ensures that all strictly-initialized
instance fields have been assigned to at the point that a constructor makes
a <code>super(...)</code> call.</p></li>
<li><p>All attempts to write to the field check for a <code>null</code> value and, if found,
throw a <code>FieldStoreException</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Null-restricted array creation is not supported by the <code>anewarray</code> instruction,
and must be accomplished with a call to the reflection API (see below). All
attempts to write to a null-restricted array component reject <code>null</code> values
during the usual array store check.</p>

<h3>Core reflection</h3>

<p>There are no <code>Foo!.class</code> or <code>Foo?.class</code> literals, and no associated instances
of <code>java.lang.Class</code>. These types are derived from a class declaration, but
do not represent distinct classes. (Compare <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>.)</p>

<p>However, a new <code>RuntimeType</code> API describes the set of types that are enforced
by array and field store checks at run time, including a null-restricted
variant of every class and interface type. (This is a superset of
the <em>linkage types</em>, which can appear in descriptors and are represented by
the <code>Class</code> API.)</p>

<p>The <code>Field</code> API supports querying a field's <code>RuntimeType</code>, which may not be
the same as its <code>getType</code> result.</p>

<p>The <code>Array</code> API supports variations of <code>newInstance</code> that allow a component type
to be expressed with a <code>RuntimeType</code>. These variations also allow the caller to
provide initial values for the array components, and will reject attempts to
create null-restricted arrays without initial values. Another new method
reflects the <code>RuntimeType</code> of an array's components.</p>

<h3>Supplementary changes</h3>

<p>Traditional deserialization is not compatible with null-restricted fields and
arrays. A separate JEP will provide a new mechanism to support serialization
without exposing uninitialized null-restricted fields and arrays.</p>

<p>Documentation generated by <code>javadoc</code> will include nullness markers.</p>

<p>The <code>java.lang.reflect.Type</code> and <code>javax.lang.model</code> APIs will encode nullness in
their representation of types.</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>A variety of development tools in the Java ecosystem have implemented their own
compile-time tracking of nulls. These tools don't change the Java language and
so naturally have some limitations, particularly in the syntax they can use
(annotations) and the behavior they can affect (compile-time checks).</p>

<p>Other programming languages track nullness in their type systems. Many are
null-restricted by default. Many also consider it an error to assign to a
null-restricted type without an explicit null check. In the case of Java,
it's important that the feature be optional, and be something that
programmers can incrementally make use of without a monolithic migration
effort.</p>

<p>Runtime enforcement of nullness can be implemented with explicit checks or calls
to the <code>Objects.requireNonNull</code> standard API. But consistently applying these
checks is tedious, necessitates additional documentation work, and makes
programs harder to read. There's no way to apply these checks directly to
variable storage, particularly fields and arrays.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8325803" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Flexible Constructor Bodies (Second Preview)</a> allows
constructors to execute statements before a <code>super(...)</code> call and allows
assignments to instance fields in this context. These changes facilitate the
initialization requirements of null-restricted fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>Future work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8316779" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Null-Restricted Value Class Types (Preview)</a> will optimize
the encodings of null-restricted, value-class-typed fields and arrays, and
may allow some value classes to declare their own default values.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/402" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">JEP 402: Enhanced Primitive Boxing (Preview)</a> will track nullness as
it makes wider use of implicit boxing conversions in the language.</p></li>
<li><p>JVM class and method specialization (<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/218" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">JEP 218</a>, with revisions) will
allow generic classes and methods to reify and enforce the nullness of
(at least some of) their type arguments.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Other possible future enhancements building on this JEP may include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Applying nullness markers to certain parts of the standard APIs.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhancing the JVM to provide a concise, minimal-footprint way to express a
null check in bytecode.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhancing the JVM to provide stronger low-level enforcement of null-restricted
method parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Providing a mechanism in the language to assert that all types in a certain
context are implicitly null-restricted, without requiring the programmer to
use explicit <code>!</code> symbols.</p></li>

          <p>Recently at <em>Internet Archive</em> a “glitch” (<a href="https://archive.org/post/2435138/archives-removed-my-account-and-deleted-all-my-uploaded-files">their choice of word</a>) deleted a great many accounts, including my account that had been at <a href="https://archive.org/details/@gingerbeardman">https://archive.org/details/@gingerbeardman</a> since 2015.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, they are not reaching out to affected users but rather waiting for them to create new accounts and silently relinking their old uploads <em>only if the new account has same email as the old account</em>. Otherwise, all profile metadata, favourites, lists, reviews, posts, collections, web archives, and the original username are not being relinked. For me that’s a decade of data…gone.</p>

<p>The main impact of this massive data loss, that happened around mid-July, is that there are now dead links to old profiles and various old pages all across the internet, plus the additional impact of lost data that is not being recovered. It’s a real blow to the broader preservation effort to know that <em>the one place where data is supposed to be safe forever has had a massive data loss</em> and the organisation responsible are not taking proactive steps to address the issue fully.</p>

<p>The extent of the data loss and how many accounts were affected is currently unknown. And because they’re not really talking about it, it’s quite difficult to find any concrete information as to the extent or cause of the data loss. You can find <a href="https://archive.org/iathreads/forum-display.php?forum=general">more info at the <em>Internet Archive</em> forums</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetarchive/s/YFihAFXzE8">the /r/internetarchive subreddit</a>, or your choice of social media where <em>Internet Archive</em> have a presence (Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=login%20to%3Ainternetarchive&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">ref1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=account%20to%3Ainternetarchive&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">ref2</a>).</p>

<h2 id="support-up-to-a-point">Support, up to a point</h2>

<p>My support experience with <em>Internet Archive</em> was frustrating and ultimately futile. They did not adequately address my queries and requests. Instead they made changes to my account that I did not request, and in the end were pretty clear that they were not going to help me any further. This is such a disappointing stance to take with users who are simply trying to recover their data as a result of loss caused by <em>Internet Archive</em> itself.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Google Cloud is giving Y Combinator startups access to a dedicated, subsidized cluster of Nvidia graphics processing units and Google tensor processing units to build AI models. It’s part of Google Cloud’s effort to cozy up with promising early-stage AI startups, in hopes some of them will evolve into massive, compute-hungry businesses.</p>

<p>“We want to surround them with a lot of love and warmth early in their life cycle so they get familiarized with building and working on the Google Cloud Platform,” said general manager for Google Cloud’s startups and AI business, James Lee, in an interview with TechCrunch. “As they stick around, we grow as they grow, and we become a partner of theirs throughout their life cycle.”</p>

	
	


<p>Specifically, Google will provide a dedicated cluster with priority access for YC’s Summer 2024 startups, along with $350,000 in cloud credits over two years for each participating startup. The idea is that a future unicorn will fall in love with building on Google Cloud. Five percent of Y Combinator startups over the last 18 years have become unicorns with billion-dollar-plus valuations, YC group partner Diana Hu tells TechCrunch, so it’s a decent bet for Google to make on this partnership.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of excitement that the next generation of startups will probably not just unicorn, but decacorn, and they’re getting built as we speak,” said Hu. “Cloud providers are still catching up in terms of how to price them, but they do know if you catch them early on, you’re going to ride the wave with them.”</p>

<p>On the flip side, Y Combinator says it can attract more AI startups to apply by offering generous compute resources alongside its investment and guidance. For early-stage AI startups, Hu says one of the most common issues she hears is that startups are compute-restrained. Large enterprises are able to strike multi-year, massive deals with cloud providers for GPU access, but small startups are often left out to dry. She says partnerships like these go a long way, especially when you have a dedicated cluster — that’s particularly important for training AI models.</p>

<p>“For GPU and AI workloads, they’re more like high performance computing workloads in batches. You don’t need the server running all the time, but you need a lot of them in a spiky workload,” said Hu. “So we have a dedicated cluster that YC companies can just use.”</p>

<p>As part of the partnership, Google will also offer YC startups $12,000 in Enhanced Support credits and a free year of Google Workspace Business Plus. YC startups can also connect with Google’s internal AI experts through monthly office hours.</p>


<p>Startup accelerators and venture capital firms are offering GPU clusters more and more these days. Andreessen Horowitz reportedly has <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-is-building-a-stash-of-more-than-20-000-gpus-to-win-ai-deals?rc=dp0mql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a stash of 20,000 GPUs</a> to attract AI startups. Google Cloud and Y Combinator would not reveal the exact number in this deal, but Hu says it’s sufficient for YC’s foundation model companies to train models on.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/what-really-does-and-doesnt-work-fair-use-dmca">well known</a> that the DMCA is used by corporate cyberbullies to take down content that they disagree with; but, is otherwise legal. The Counternotice system is also hillariously ineffective. The <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/512/">DMCA</a> requires service providers to “act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material;” yet, it gives those same “service providers” <em>14 days</em> to restore access in the event of a counternotice! The DMCA, like much American legislation, is heavily biased towards corporations, instead of the actual, living, breathing, citizens of the country.</p>
<p>It’s absolutely asinine and I would love absolutely nothing more than to have a lawsuit “win” against CrowdStrike. That would be absolutely <em>amazing</em> for marketing! Especially given the timing of such events…</p>
<p>Additionally, using the Digital Millenium <em>Copyright</em> Act to attempt to takedown a parody site for <em>Trademark Infringement</em> is absolutely hillarious.</p>
<p>There are several ways that <em>anyone</em> is allowed to use a trademark belonging to “others.” This is considered “Fair Use.” Fair Use is an important aspect of trademark and copyright law. It is a right to use trademarks and copyrighted works for parody, criticism, transformative works, news reporting / journalism, education, etc. Corporate cyberbullies don’t like that anyone else has rights. Again, I don’t care, because the only thing that matters is the law, and what a court thinks about it.</p>
<p><strong>Luckily…</strong> Parody is a well recognized “right” for “fair use”</p>

<p>Seeing as how this site is an <em>obvious</em> parody, that any “reasonable person” would be able to cleary identify <strong>AND</strong> there is no commercial use, no product being sold, no money being made in any way, shape, or form…</p>
<p>You can go straight to hell CrowdStrike. This is fair use. Fuck your feelings. Now… <a href="https://clownstrike.lol/">Return to Clownin’</a></p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Don’t your lawyers have more important shit to be doing right now anyway?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/koiuo/xdg-override">https://github.com/koiuo/xdg-override</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41133876">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">xdg-override</h2><a id="user-content-xdg-override" aria-label="Permalink: xdg-override" href="#xdg-override"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Override <code>xdg-open</code> behavior. Because the way it already works is not confusing enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://127001.me/post/change-browser-in-slack/" rel="nofollow">How do you change browser in Slack anyway?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is <code>xdg-open</code> and what <code>xdg-override</code> does?</h2><a id="user-content-what-is-xdg-open-and-what-xdg-override-does" aria-label="Permalink: What is xdg-open and what xdg-override does?" href="#what-is-xdg-open-and-what-xdg-override-does"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>xdg-open</code> is a GNU/Linux application that "opens" files and URLs in user's preferred application:</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, open <code>avatar.png</code> in the default image viewer</p>

<p dir="auto">Or open <code>https://freedesktop.org</code> URL in the default browser</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="~ ❯ xdg-open &quot;https://freedesktop.org&quot;"><pre><code>~ ❯ xdg-open "https://freedesktop.org"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Most application on GNU/Linux by convention delegate to <code>xdg-open</code> when they need to open a file or a URL. This ensures consistent behavior between applications and desktop environments: URLs are always opened in our preferred browser, images are always opened in the same preferred viewer.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, there are situations when this consistent behavior is not desired: for example, if we need to override default browser just for one application and only temporarily. This is where <code>xdg-override</code> helps: it replaces <code>xdg-open</code> with itself to alter the behavior without changing system settings.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, if our default browser is Firefox, and we want Chromium to be our default browser in Slack messanger, we can launch Slack like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="~ ❯ xdg-override --match &quot;^https?://&quot; chromium slack"><pre><code>~ ❯ xdg-override --match "^https?://" chromium slack
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does it work?</h2><a id="user-content-how-does-it-work" aria-label="Permalink: How does it work?" href="#how-does-it-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Two words: <code>PATH</code> manipulation.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can read the explanation of how <code>xdg-override</code> works and about my motivation in my blog post <a href="https://127001.me/post/change-browser-in-slack/" rel="nofollow">How do you change browser in Slack anyway?</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation and running</h2><a id="user-content-installation-and-running" aria-label="Permalink: Installation and running" href="#installation-and-running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you use Nix, you can install <code>xdg-override</code> from the flake, or you can try it without installation like this</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="~ ❯ nix run github:koiuo/xdg-override -- --match &quot;^https://&quot; chromium slack"><pre><code>~ ❯ nix run github:koiuo/xdg-override -- --match "^https://" chromium slack
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For everyone else, place the script anywhere you wish and execute it from there. It does not require any configs, and it only creates some temporary files under <code>/tmp</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="~ ❯ xdg-override --help

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Description</h2><a id="user-content-description" aria-label="Permalink: Description" href="#description"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Gitopper is GitOps for non-Kubernetes folks it watches a remote git repo, pulls changes and HUP the
server (service) process.</p>
<p dir="auto">A sparse (but with full history) git checkout will be done, so each service will only see the files
it will actually need. Several bind mounts are then setup to give the service access to the file(s)
in Git. If the target directories don't exist, they will be created, with the current user - if
specified.</p>
<p dir="auto">This tool does little more than just pull the repo, but the little it brings to the table allows for
a GitOps workflow without resorting to Kubernetes like environments.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Git repository that you are using to provision the services must have at least one
(sub)directory for each service.</p>
<p dir="auto">Gitopper will install packages if told to do so. It will not upgrade or downgrade them, assuming
there is a better way of doing those.</p>
<p dir="auto">The remote interface of gitopper uses SSH keys for authentication, this hopefully helps to fit in,
in a sysadmin organisation.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following features are implemented:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>Metrics</em>: are included see below, they export a Git hash, so a rollout can be tracked.</li>
<li><em>Diff detection</em>: possible using the metrics or gitopperctl.</li>
<li><em>Out of band rollbacks</em>: use gitopperctl to bypass the normal Git workflow.</li>
<li><em>No client side processing</em>: files are used as they are in the Git repo.</li>
<li><em>Canarying</em>: give a service a different branch to check out.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The options are:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-h, --hosts strings</strong>
:  hosts (comma separated) to impersonate, local hostname is always added</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-c, --config string</strong>
:  config file to read</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-s, --ssh string</strong>
:  ssh address to listen on (default ":2222")</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-m, --metric string</strong>
:  http metrics address to listen on (default ":9222")</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-d, --debug</strong>
:  enable debug logging</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-r, --restart</strong>
:   send SIGHUP to ourselves when config changes</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-o, --root</strong>
:  require root permission, setting to false can aid in debugging (default true)</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-t, --duration duration</strong>
:  default duration between pulls (default 5m0s)</p>
<p dir="auto">For bootstrapping gitopper itself the following options are available:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-U, --upstream string</strong>
:  use this git repo to clone and to bootstrap from</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-D, --directory string</strong>
:  directory to sparse checkout (default "gitopper")</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-B, --branch string</strong>
:   check out in this branch (default "main")</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-M, --mount string</strong>
:   check out into this directory, -c is relative to this directory</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-P, --pull</strong>
:   pull (update) the git repo to the newest version before starting</p>

<p dir="auto">And things should work then. I.e. in /etc/prometheus you should see the content of the
<em>miekg/gitopper-config</em> repository. Note that the prometheus package is installed, because <code>package</code>
is mentioned in the config file.</p>
<p dir="auto">The checked out git repo in /tmp/prometheus should <em>only</em> contain the prometheus directory thanks to
the sparse checkout. Changes made to any other subdirectory in that repo do not trigger a prometheus

<p dir="auto">A service can be in 5 states: OK, FREEZE, ROLLBACK (which is a FREEZE to a previous commit) and

<p dir="auto">These state are not carried over when gitopper crashes/stops (maybe we want this to be persistent,
would be nice to have this state in the git repo somehow?).</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>OK</code>: everything is running and we're tracking upstream.</li>
<li><code>FREEZE</code>: everything is running, but we're not tracking upstream.</li>
<li><code>ROLLBACK</code>: everything is running, but we're not tracking upstream <em>and</em> we're pinned to an older
commit. This state is quickly followed by FREEZE if we were successful rolling back, otherwise
BROKEN (systemd error)  of DIFF (git error)</li>
<li><code>BROKEN</code>: something with the service is broken, we're still tracking upstream. I.e. systemd error.</li>
<li><code>DIFF</code>: the git repository can't be reconciled with upstream. I.e. git error.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">ROLLBACK is a transient state and quickly moves to FREEZE, unless something goes wrong then it

<p dir="auto">Note that <code>machine</code> above should match either the machine name ($HOSTNAME) or any of the values you
give on the <code>-h</code> flag. This allows you to create services that run everywhere, by defining a service
that have name (say) "localhost" and then deploying gitopper with <code>-h localhost</code> on every machine.</p>
<p dir="auto">Options for each service:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>machine</code>: the machine where this service should be active. By default <code>gitopper</code> will know the
current hostname, but multiple aliases may be given to it via the <code>-h</code> flag.</li>
<li><code>service</code>: what systemd unit file is used to call <code>action</code> on. If service contains an <code>@</code> a
service template unit is assumed and gitopper will then run <code>systemctl enable &lt;service&gt;</code> to enable
the service template.</li>
<li><code>action</code>: action to use when calling <code>systemctl &lt;service&gt;</code>. If empty no systemd command will be
issued when the repo changes.</li>
<li><code>branch</code>: what branch to use in the checked out repo. Note different branches that use the <em>same</em>
repository on disk, will error on startup.</li>
<li><code>package</code>: what package to install for this service. If empty, no package will be installed.</li>
<li><code>user</code>: what user should the git repository belong to.</li>
<li><code>dirs</code>: describe the mapping between directories and files in the repository and on the local
disk. <code>local</code> is the <em>on disk</em> name, and <code>link</code> is the <em>relative</em> path of the directory or file in
the git repo. If a single file is used, <code>file</code> should be set to true.</li>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to Break It</h3><a id="user-content-how-to-break-it" aria-label="Permalink: How to Break It" href="#how-to-break-it"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Moving to a new user, will break git pull, with an error like 'dubious ownership of repository'. If
you want a different owner for a service, it's best to change the mount as well so you get a new
repo. Gitopper is currently not smart enough to detect this and fix things on the fly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Interface</h2><a id="user-content-interface" aria-label="Permalink: Interface" href="#interface"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Gitopper opens two ports: 9222 for metrics and 2222 for the rest-protocol-over-SSH. For any
interaction with gitopper over this port your key must be configured for it.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following services are implemented:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>List all defined machines.</li>
<li>List services run on the machine.</li>
<li>List a specific service.</li>
<li>Freeze a service to the current git commit.</li>
<li>Unfreeze a service, i.e. to let it pull again.</li>
<li>Rollback a service to a specific commit.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For each of these gitopperctl(8) will execute a "command" and will parse the returned JSON into a nice
table.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Metrics</h2><a id="user-content-metrics" aria-label="Permalink: Metrics" href="#metrics"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following metrics are exported:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>gitopper_service_state{"service"} &lt;state&gt;</li>
<li>gitopper_service_change_time_seconds{"service"} &lt;epoch&gt;</li>
<li>gitopper_machine_git_errors_total - total number of errors when running git.</li>
<li>gitopper_machine_git_ops_total - total number of git runs.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Metrics are available under the /metrics endpoint on port 9222.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exit Code</h2><a id="user-content-exit-code" aria-label="Permalink: Exit Code" href="#exit-code"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Gitopper has following exit codes:</p>
<p dir="auto">0 - normal exit
2 - SIGHUP seen (signal to systemd to restart us)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bootstrapping</h2><a id="user-content-bootstrapping" aria-label="Permalink: Bootstrapping" href="#bootstrapping"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are a couple of options that allow gitopper to bootstrap itself <em>and</em> make gitopper to be
managed by gitopper. Basically those options allow you to specify a service on the command line.
Gitopper will check out the repo and then proceed to read the config <em>in that repo</em> and setup
everything from there.</p>
<p dir="auto">I.e.:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="... -c config.toml -U https://github.com/miekg/gitopper-config -D gitopper -M /tmp/"><pre><code>... -c config.toml -U https://github.com/miekg/gitopper-config -D gitopper -M /tmp/
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Will sparse check out (only the <code>gitopper</code> (-D flag) directory) of the repo <em>gitopper-config</em> (-U
flag) in /tmp/gitopper (-M flag, internally '/gitopper' is added) and will then proceed to parse the
config file /tmp/gitopper/gitopper/config.toml and proceed with a normal startup.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note this setup implies that you <em>must</em> place config.toml <em>inside</em> a <code>gitopper</code> directory, just as
the other services must have their own subdirectories, gitopper needs one too.</p>
<p dir="auto">The gitopper service self is <em>also</em> added to the managed services which you can inspect with
gitopperctl(8).</p>
<p dir="auto">Any keys that have <em>relative</em> paths, will also be changed to key inside this Git managed directory
and pick up keys <em>from that repo</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-P</code> flag can be given to pull the repository even if it already exists, sometimes you need to
the newest version to properly bootstrap. For normal services the "git pull" routine will
automatically rectify it and restart the service.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel’s on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23385652/pat-gelsinger-intel-chips-act-ohio-manufacturing-chip-shortage">long, long road to recovery</a>, and over 15,000 workers will no longer be coming along for the ride. The chipmaker <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1704/intel-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results">just announced</a> it’s downsizing its workforce by over 15 percent as part of a new $10 billion cost savings plan for 2025, which will mean a headcount reduction of greater than 15,000 roles, Intel tells <em>The Verge</em>. The company currently employs over 125,000 workers, so layoffs could be as many as 19,000 people.</p><p>Intel will reduce its R&amp;D and marketing spend by billions each year through 2026; it will reduce capital expenditures by more than 20 percent this year; it will restructure to “stop non-essential work,” and it’ll review “all active projects and equipment” to make sure it’s not spending too much.</p><p>“This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to read,” reads part of <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/actions-accelerate-our-progress.html#gs.cgovp0">a memo</a> from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to staff, which you can also read in full at the bottom of this post.</p><div><p>“We will reduce layers, eliminate overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work...”</p></div><p>The company just reported a loss of $1.6 billion for Q2 2024, substantially more than the $437 million it lost last quarter. “Our Q2 financial performance was disappointing, even as we hit key product and process technology milestones,” admitted Gelsinger in the company’s press release. “Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI,” he writes in his employee memo. </p><p>Second quarter revenue was $12.8 billion, down just 1 percent year over year, and it’s not like all of Intel’s businesses are failing. While Intel has absolutely been losing money on its chipmaking Foundry business as it invests in new factories and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24119454/intels-chipmaking-business-7-billion-loss">to the tune of $7 billion in operating losses in 2023</a> and another $2.8 billion this quarter, the company’s products themselves aren’t unprofitable. </p><p>Almost all the losses this quarter and last quarter came from Foundry, while its sales continue to stay relatively stable and its PC and server businesses stay profitable. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195376/pc-industry-growth-wasnt-a-fluke">The PC sales slump ended</a> earlier this year.) The company is also set to receive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106596/intel-is-set-to-receive-up-to-8-5-billion-of-chips-act-funding">up to $8.5 billion in US government funding</a> from the CHIPS Act.</p><p>But investors didn’t seem happy that the company kept itself on a knife’s edge: over the past two years, before this quarterly loss, it had continued to swing between losses and profits overall, for just $1.1 billion in cumulative between Q2 2022 and Q1 2024. “Intel is now the worst-performing tech stock in the S&amp;P 500 this year,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/26/intel-dominated-us-chip-industry-now-struggling-to-stay-relevant.html">CNBC wrote in April</a>. </p><p>From a tech leadership perspective, Intel’s not yet a big player in AI server chips like Nvidia (maybe not even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209938/amd-q2-2024-earnings-datacenter-ai-revenue">a notable small one like AMD</a>), its relatively recent entry into graphics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23650611/intel-raja-koduri-gpus-amd-nvidia-apple-leave-ai-startup">has yet to impress</a>, and it had to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">overhaul its flagship laptop chips significantly</a> to address the existential threat of Arm chips from the likes of Qualcomm and Apple, which can offer more battery life than Intel. Like competitors, the company now partially relies on TSMC, not just its own foundries, to help produce some of its most advanced chips.</p><p>Microsoft recently followed Apple’s lead in ditching Intel chips for its latest slate of consumer hardware, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185462/microsoft-surface-laptop-7th-edition-review">the Surface Laptop</a> and Surface Pro, and launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24160486/microsoft-copilot-plus-ai-arm-chips-pc-surface-event">its Copilot Plus PC initiative</a> exclusively with Qualcomm, without waiting for Intel (or AMD)’s new flagship laptop chips to join them. Intel is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a">currently dealing with two generations of potentially defective desktop CPUs</a>, though the company currently believes it can mitigate the issue with a software update and doesn’t currently plan recalls.</p><p>On the company’s earnings call today, Intel CFO David Zinsner just suggested that the company’s next flagship AI laptop chip, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">Lunar Lake</a>, won’t be enough by itself to turn things around. </p><p>While he says “the AI PC is a big winner for the company,” and Intel plans to “ramp that product significantly next year to meet market demand,” he also described Lunar Lake as a “narrow targeted product” that relies on “external wafers” (read: manufactured by TSMC, not Intel). Intel also needs to buy the memory it’s including on each chip, as Lunar Lake laptops <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">don’t have separate memory sticks</a>. </p><p>Those are reasons why Lunar Lake will only modestly improve the company’s situation in 2025, he says. </p><p>“The good news is the follow-on product, Panther Lake, is internally sourced on [Intel’s own process] 18A and has a much-improved cost structure,” says Zinsner. Lunar Lake is coming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209778/intel-lunar-lake-launch-core-ultra-september-3rd">as soon as this September</a>. Panther Lake will start ramping in the second half of 2025, but the “huge volume benefits” of that chip won’t come until 2026, says Gelsinger. </p><p>On server chips, Gelsinger says Intel is “having to fight to win sockets” away from AI chipmakers but that Intel’s own Granite Rapids Xeon server processors are looking “very positive.  </p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Intel plans to reduce spend by billions each year.

But the company didn’t shrink all that much as a result. While headcount dipped roughly 5 percent in 2023 (from 131,900 employees to 124,800 employees), Intel hired its way back to 130,700 employees as of March 30th, 2024, its financial records show.</p><p>Intel says it’ll complete the majority of the layoffs it’s announcing today by the end of 2024, and spokesperson Penelope Bruce confirms that they are new layoffs — the 4 percent dip from 130,700 employees in March to 125,300 employees in June is not included in the total.</p><p>Gelsinger writes that Intel will offer a “companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees” and let employees broadly apply for voluntary layoffs starting next week — not every employee departure will come as a painful surprise.</p><p>Intel says it’s now restructuring, suspending its dividend, and spending less, period, but will “maintain its core investments to execute its strategy and build a resilient and sustainable semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. and around the world.”</p><p>Here’s the full memo from Gelsinger:</p><div><blockquote><p>Team,</p><p>We have moved our All Company Meeting to today, following our earnings call, as we are&nbsp;<a href="https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2024/corporate/2Q-24-earnings-release-89T32a86.pdf">announcing significant actions to reduce our costs</a>. We plan to deliver $10 billion in cost savings in 2025, and this includes reducing our head count by roughly 15,000 roles, or 15% of our workforce. The majority of these actions will be completed by the end of this year.</p><p>This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history. When we meet in a few hours, I’ll talk about why we’re doing this and what you can expect in the coming weeks. In advance of that, I wanted to preview some of what’s on my mind.</p><p>Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate. Our revenues have not grown as expected – and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both – particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.</p><p>These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I’ve done in my career. My pledge to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency and respect in the weeks and months to come.</p><p>Next week, we’ll announce a companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees and broadly offer an application program for voluntary departures. I believe that&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we implement these changes is just as important as the changes themselves, and we will adhere to Intel values throughout this process.</p><p><strong>Why Now?</strong></p><p>Since introducing our new operating model, we have taken a clean-sheet view of the business and assessed ourselves against benchmarks for high-performing foundries, fabless product companies and corporate functions. This work made it clear our cost structure is not competitive.</p><p>For example, our annual revenue in 2020 was about $24 billion higher than it was last year, yet our current workforce is actually 10% larger now than it was then. There are a lot of reasons for this, but it’s not a sustainable path forward.</p><p>Beyond our costs, we need to change the way we operate – something many of you shared as part of our Employee Experience Survey. There’s too much complexity, so we need to both automate and simplify processes. It takes too long for decisions to be made, so we need to eliminate bureaucracy. And there’s too much inefficiency in the system, so we need to expedite workflows.</p><p><strong>Key Priorities</strong></p><p>The actions we are taking will make Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company. Let me highlight our areas of focus:</p><p><strong>Reducing Operational Costs:</strong>&nbsp;We will drive companywide operational and cost efficiencies, including the cost savings and head count reductions mentioned above.</p><p><strong>Simplifying Our Portfolio:</strong>&nbsp;We will complete actions this month to simplify our businesses. Each business unit is conducting a portfolio review and identifying underperforming products. We are also integrating key software assets into our business units so we accelerate our shift to systems-based solutions. And we will narrow our incubation focus on fewer, more impactful projects.</p><p><strong>Eliminating Complexity:</strong>&nbsp;We will reduce layers, eliminate overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work, and foster a culture of greater ownership and accountability. For example, we will consolidate Customer Success into the Sales, Marketing and Communications Group to streamline our go-to-market motions.</p><p><strong>Reducing Capital and Other Costs:</strong>&nbsp;With the completion of our historic five-nodes-in-four-years roadmap clearly in sight, we will review all active projects and equipment so we begin to shift our focus toward capital efficiency and more normalized spending levels. This will reduce our 2024 capital expenditures by more than 20%, and we plan to reduce our non-variable cost of goods sold by roughly $1 billion in 2025.</p><p><strong>Suspending Our Dividend:</strong>&nbsp;We will suspend our stock dividend beginning next quarter to prioritize investments in the business and drive more sustained profitability.</p><p><strong>Maintaining Growth Investments:</strong>&nbsp;Our IDM2.0 strategy is unchanged. Having fought hard to reestablish our innovation engine, we will maintain the key investments in our process technology and core product leadership.</p><p><strong>The Future</strong></p><p>I have no illusions that the path in front of us will be easy. You shouldn’t either. This is a tough day for all of us and there will be more tough days ahead. But as difficult as all of this is, we are making the changes necessary to build on our progress and usher in a new era of growth.</p><p>When we began this journey, we set our sights high, knowing that Intel is a place where big ideas are born and the power of what’s possible triumphs over the status quo. After all, our mission is to create world-changing technologies that improve the lives of every person on the planet. And at our best, we have exemplified these ideals more than any company in the world.</p><p>To live up to this mission, we must continue to drive our IDM 2.0 strategy, which remains the same: re-establish process technology leadership; invest in at-scale, globally resilient supply chain by expanding manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and EU; become a world-class, leading-edge foundry for internal and external customers; rebuild product portfolio leadership; and deliver AI Everywhere.</p><p>Over the past few years, we have rebuilt a sustainable innovation engine that is largely in place and on track. It’s now time to focus on building the sustainable financial engine needed to drive our performance. We must improve our execution, adapt to new market realities and operate as a more agile company. That’s the spirit of the actions we are taking – knowing that the choices we make today, as difficult as they are, will strengthen our ability to serve our customers and grow our business for years to come.</p><p>As we take these next steps in our journey, let’s not forget that there has never been a greater need for what we do. The world will increasingly run on silicon – and the world needs a healthy and vibrant Intel. That’s why the work we are doing is so consequential. Not only are we remaking a great company, but we are also creating technology and manufacturing capabilities that will reshape the world for decades to come. And this is something we should never lose sight of as we push forward in pursuit of our goals.</p><p>We’ll talk more in a few hours. Please come with your questions so we can have an open and honest discussion about what comes next.</p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>Update, August 1st: </strong>Added more details from the earnings call about Intel’s expectations for its upcoming Lunar Lake and Panther Lake chips.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>    SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Intel Corporation today reported second-quarter 2024 financial results.

</p>
<p>
“Our Q2 financial performance was disappointing, even as we hit key product and process technology milestones. Second-half trends are more challenging than we previously expected, and we are leveraging our new operating model to take decisive actions that will improve operating and capital efficiencies while accelerating our IDM 2.0 transformation,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “These actions, combined with the launch of Intel 18A next year to regain process technology leadership, will strengthen our position in the market, improve our profitability and create shareholder value.”

</p>
<p>
“Second-quarter results were impacted by gross margin headwinds from the accelerated ramp of our AI PC product, higher than typical charges related to non-core businesses and the impact from unused capacity,” said David Zinsner, Intel CFO. “By implementing our spending reductions, we are taking proactive steps to improve our profits and strengthen our balance sheet. We expect these actions to meaningfully improve liquidity and reduce our debt balance while enabling us to make the right investments to drive long-term value for shareholders.”

</p>
<p>
<span>Cost-Reduction Plan</span>

</p>
<p>
As Intel nears the completion of rebuilding a sustainable engine of process technology leadership, it announced a series of initiatives to create a sustainable financial engine that accelerates profitable growth, enables further operational efficiency and agility, and creates capacity for ongoing strategic investment in technology and manufacturing leadership. These initiatives follow the establishment of separate financial reporting for Intel Products and Intel Foundry, which provides a "clean sheet" view of the business and has uncovered significant opportunities to drive meaningful operational and cost efficiencies. The actions include structural and operating realignment across the company, headcount reductions, and operating expense and capital expenditure reductions of more than $10 billion in 2025 compared to previous estimates. As a result of these actions, Intel aims to achieve clear line of sight toward a sustainable business model with the ongoing financial resources and liquidity needed to support the company’s long-term strategy.

</p>
<p>
The plan will enable the next phase of the company’s multiyear transformation strategy, and is focused on four key priorities:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Reducing Operating Expenses:</b> The company will streamline its operations and meaningfully cut spending and headcount, reducing non-GAAP R&amp;D and marketing, general and administrative (MG&amp;A) to approximately $20 billion in 2024 and approximately $17.5 billion in 2025, with further reductions expected in 2026. Intel expects to reduce headcount by greater than 15% with the majority completed by the end of 2024.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Reducing Capital Expenditures: </b>With the end of its historic five-nodes-in-four-years journey firmly in sight, Intel is now shifting its focus toward capital efficiency and investment levels aligned to market requirements. This will reduce gross capital expenditures* in 2024 by more than 20% from prior projections, bringing gross capital expenditures in 2024 to between $25 billion and $27 billion. Intel expects net capital spending* in 2024 of between $11 billion and $13 billion. In 2025, the company is targeting gross capital expenditures between $20 billion and $23 billion and net capital spending between $12 billion and $14 billion.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Reducing Cost of Sales:</b> The company expects to generate $1 billion in savings in non-variable cost of sales in 2025. Product mix will continue to be a headwind next year, contributing to modest YoY improvements to 2025's gross margin.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Maintaining Core Investments to Execute Strategy:</b> The company continues to advance its long-term innovation and path to leadership across process technology and products, and the increased efficiency from its actions is expected to further support its execution. In addition, Intel continues to sustain investments to build a resilient and sustainable semiconductor supply chain in the United States and around the world.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Intel is taking the added step of suspending the dividend starting in the fourth quarter, recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute its strategy. The company reiterates its long-term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improve to sustainably higher levels.

<span>Business Unit Summary</span>

</p>
<p>
Intel previously announced the implementation of an internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024 and created a foundry relationship between its Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI and NEX) and its Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry Manufacturing and Supply Chain, and Foundry Services (formerly IFS)). The foundry operating model is a key component of the company's strategy and is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. The company also previously announced its intent to operate Altera<sup>® </sup>as a standalone business beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Altera was previously included in DCAI's segment results. As a result of these changes, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the company internally receives information and manages and monitors its operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2024. There are no changes to Intel’s consolidated financial statements for any prior periods.

<b>Intel Products Highlights</b>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>CCG:</b> Intel continues to define and drive the AI PC category, shipping more than 15 million AI PCs since December 2023, far more than all of Intel's competitors combined, and on track to ship more than 40 million AI PCs by year-end. Lunar Lake, the company’s next-generation AI CPU, achieved production release in July 2024, ahead of schedule, with shipments starting in the third quarter. Lunar Lake will power over 80 new Copilot+ PCs across more than 20 OEMs.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>DCAI:</b> More than 130 million Intel<sup>®</sup> Xeon<sup>®</sup> processors power data centers around the world today, and at Computex Intel introduced its next-generation Intel<sup>®</sup> Xeon<sup>® </sup>6 processor with Efficient-cores (E-cores), code-named Sierra Forest, marking the company’s first Intel 3 server product architected for high-density, scale-out workloads. Intel expects Intel<sup>®</sup> Xeon<sup>®</sup> 6 processors with Performance-cores (P-cores), code-named Granite Rapids, to begin shipping in the third quarter of 2024. The Intel<sup>®</sup> Gaudi<sup>®</sup> 3 AI accelerator is also on track to launch in the third quarter and is expected to deliver roughly two-times the performance per dollar on both inference and training versus the leading competitor.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>NEX:</b> Intel announced an array of AI-optimized scale-out Ethernet solutions, including the Intel AI network interface card and foundry chiplets that will launch next year. New infrastructure processing unit (IPU) adaptors for the enterprise are now broadly available and supported by Dell Technologies, Red Hat and others. IPUs will play an increasingly important role in Intel’s accelerator portfolio, which the company expects will help drive AI data center growth and profitability in 2025 and beyond. Additionally, Intel and others announced the creation of the Ultra Accelerator Link, a new industry standard dedicated to advancing high-speed, low-latency communication for scale-up AI systems communication in data centers.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Intel Foundry Highlights</b>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Intel is nearing the completion of its promised five-nodes-in-four-years strategy, with Intel 18A on track to be manufacturing-ready by the end of this year and production wafer start volumes in the first half of 2025. In July 2024, Intel released to foundry customers the 1.0 PDK for Intel 18A. The company’s first two Intel 18A products, Panther Lake for client — the first microprocessor to use RibbonFet, PowerVia and advanced packaging — and Clearwater Forest for servers, are on track to launch in 2025.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Ansys, Cadence, Siemens, and Synopsys announced the availability of reference flows for Intel’s embedded multi-die interconnect bridge (EMIB) advanced packaging technology, which simplifies the design process and offers design flexibility. The companies also declared readiness for Intel 18A designs.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
During the quarter, Intel named industry veteran Kevin O'Buckley to lead Foundry Services. The company also recently appointed Dr. Naga Chandrasekaran to lead Intel Foundry Manufacturing and Supply Chain. Their leadership will support Intel’s continued development of the first systems foundry for the AI era.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Other Highlights</b>

</p>
<p>
Intel announced its second Semiconductor Co-Investment Program (SCIP) agreement, the formation of a joint venture with Apollo related to Intel’s Fab 34 in Ireland. SCIP is an element of Intel’s Smart Capital strategy, a funding approach designed to create financial flexibility to accelerate the company’s strategy, including investing in its global manufacturing operations, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

</p>
<p>
<span>Q3 2024 Dividend</span>

</p>
<p>
The company announced that its board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on the company’s common stock, which will be payable Sept. 1, 2024, to shareholders of record as of Aug. 7, 2024.

</p>
<p>
As noted earlier, Intel is suspending the dividend starting in the fourth quarter.

<br>Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures

</p>
<p>
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. Some of these non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.

</p>
<p>
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on at least an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance.

</p>
<p>
Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Acquisition-related adjustments

</p>

</td>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&amp;A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.

</p>



</td>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>
We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.

We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance.

</p>
<p>
Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the reconciliations from US GAAP to Non-GAAP actuals should be carefully evaluated. Please refer to "Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures" in this document for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to the comparable US GAAP measures, the ways management uses the non-GAAP measures, and the reasons why management believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors.

Intel Corporation
<br>Supplemental Reconciliations of GAAP Outlook to Non-GAAP Outlook

</p>
<p>
Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial outlook prepared in accordance with US GAAP and the reconciliations from this Business Outlook should be carefully evaluated. Please refer to "Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures" in this document for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to the comparable US GAAP measures, the ways management uses the non-GAAP measures, and the reasons why management believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors.

Intel Corporation
<br>Supplemental Reconciliations of Other GAAP to Non-GAAP Forward-Looking Estimates

</p>
<p>
Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the reconciliations should be carefully evaluated. Please refer to "Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures" in this document for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to the comparable US GAAP measures, the ways management uses the non-GAAP measures, and the reasons why management believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors.
