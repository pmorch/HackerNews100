<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Back in the day, light mode wasn’t called “light mode”. It was just the way that computers were, we didn’t really think about turning everything light or dark. Sure, some applications were often dark (photo editors, IDEs, terminals) but everything else was light, and that was fine.</p>

<p>What we didn’t notice is that light mode has been slowly getting lighter, and I’ve got a graph to prove it. I did what any normal person would do, I downloaded the same (or similar) screenshots from the <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/aqua-screenshot-library/">MacOS Screenshot Library</a> on <a href="https://512pixels.net/"><em>512 Pixels</em></a>. This project would have been much more difficult without a single place to get well-organised screenshots from. I cropped each image so just a representative section of the window was present, here shown with a pinkish rectangle:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://willhbr.net/images/2025/macos-light-mode.webp" alt="screenshot of OS X Snow Leopard Finder window with toolbar section highlighted"></p>

<p>Then used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pillow/">Pillow</a> to get the average lightness of each cropped image:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>file</span> <span>in</span> <span>sorted</span><span>(</span><span>os</span><span>.</span><span>listdir</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>.</span><span>'</span><span>)):</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>This ignores any kind of perceived brightness or the tinting that MacOS has been doing for a while based on your wallpaper colour. I could go down a massive tangent trying to work out exactly what the best way to measure this is, but given that the screenshots aren’t perfectly comparable between versions, comparing the average brightness of a greyscale image seems reasonable.</p>

<p>I graphed that on the release year of each OS version, doing the same for dark mode:</p>

<p>You can clearly see that the brightness of the UI has been steadily increasing for the last 16 years. The upper line is the default mode/light mode, the lower line is dark mode. When I started using MacOS in 2012, I was running Snow Leopard, the windows had an average brightness of 71%. Since then they’ve steadily increased so that in MacOS Tahoe, they’re at a full 100%.</p>

<p>What I’ve graphed here is just the brightness of the window chrome, which isn’t really representative of the actual total screen brightness. A better study would be looking at the overall brightness of a typical set of apps. The default background colour for windows, as well as the colours for inactive windows, would probably give a more complete picture.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/aqua-screenshot-library/macos-26-tahoe/">in Tahoe</a> the darkest colour in a typical light-mode window is the colour of a section in an inactive settings window, at 97% brightness. In Snow Leopard the equivalent colour was 90%, and that was one of the <em>brightest</em> parts of the window, since the window chrome was typically darker than the window content.</p>

<p>I tried to remember exactly when I started using dark mode all the time on MacOS. I’ve always used a dark background for my editor and terminal, but I wasn’t sure when I swapped the system theme across. When it first came out I seem to remember thinking that it looked gross.</p>

<p>It obviously couldn’t be earlier than 2018, as that’s when dark mode was introduced in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Mojave">MacOS Mojave</a>. I’m pretty sure that when I updated my personal laptop to an M1 MacBook Air at the end of 2020 that I set it to use dark mode. This would make sense, because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Big_Sur">Big Sur</a> update bumped the brightness from 85% to 97%, which probably pushed me over the edge.</p>

<p>I think the reason this happens is that if you look at two designs, photos, or whatever, it’s really easy to be drawn in to liking the brighter one more. Or if they’re predominantly dark, then the darker one. I’ve done it myself with this very site. If I’m tweaking the colours it’s easy to bump up the brightness on the background and go “ooh wow yeah that’s definitely cleaner”, then swap it back and go “ewww it looks like it needs a good scrub”. If it’s the dark mode colours, then a darker background will just look <em>cooler</em>.</p>

<p>I’m not a designer, but I assume that resisting this urge is something you learn in design school. Just like making a website look good with a non-greyscale background.</p>

<p>This year in iOS 26, some UI elements use the HDR screen to make some elements and highlights brighter than 100% white.<sup id="fnref:not-me"><a href="#fn:not-me" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This year it’s reasonably subtle, but the inflation potential is there. If you’ve ever looked at an HDR photo on an iPhone (or any other HDR screen) then looked at the UI that’s still being shown in SDR, you’ll know just how grey and sad it looks. If you’re designing a new UI, how tempting will it be to make just a little bit more of it just a little bit brighter?</p>

<p>As someone whose job involves looking at MacOS for a lot of the day, I find that I basically <em>have</em> to use dark mode to avoid looking at a display where all the system UI is 100% white blasting in my eyes. But the alternative doesn’t have to be near-black for that, I would happily have a UI that’s a medium grey. In fact what I’ve missed since swapping to using dark mode is that I don’t have contrast between windows. Everything looks the same, whether it’s a text editor, IDE, terminal, web browser, or Finder window. All black, all the time.</p>

<p>Somewhat in the spirit of <a href="https://mavericksforever.com/">Mavericks Forever</a>, if I were to pick an old MacOS design to go back to it would probably be <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/aqua-screenshot-library/os-x-10-10-yosemite/">Yosemite</a>. I don’t have any nostalgia for skeuomorphic brushed metal or stitched leather, but I do quite like the flattened design and blur effects that Yosemite brought. Ironically Yosemite was a substantial jump in brightness from previous versions.</p>

<p>So if you’re making an interface or website, be bold and choose a 50% grey. My eyes will thank you.</p>

Farmers in Moe's province have been hard hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola oil, and the deal, he said, would bring much needed relief.</p><p>But Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto sector, was sharply critical of the deal. He said removing EV tariffs on China "would hurt our economy and lead to job losses". </p><p>In a post on X, Ford said Carney's government was "inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantees of equal or immediate investment in Canada's economy". </p><p>Some experts said the electric vehicle provisions in the trade deal would help China make inroads into the Canadian automobile market.</p><p>With the lower EV tariffs, approximately 10% of Canada's electric vehicle sales are now expected to go to Chinese automakers, said Vivek Astvansh, a business professor at McGill University in Montreal.</p><p>The expected increase in Chinese EV sales could put pressure on US-based EV makers like Tesla which are seeking to expand their market share in Canada, he said.</p><p>"Carney has signalled to the Trump administration that it is warming up to China," Astvansh added.</p><p>Reaction from the White House, meanwhile, has been mixed.</p><p>In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the deal "problematic" and said Canada may come to regret it. </p><p>President Donald Trump, however, hailed it as "a good thing".</p><p>"If you can get a deal with China, you should do that," he told reporters outside the White House.</p><p>Since taking office for a second time last year, Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian sectors like metals and automotives, which has led to swirling economic uncertainty. He has also threatened to rip up a longstanding North American free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, calling it "irrelevant".</p><p>That trade agreement, the USMCA, is now under a mandatory review. Canada and Mexico have both made clear they want it to remain in place. </p><p>But the decision to carve out a major new deal with China is a recognition by Carney that the future of North American free trade remains unclear, Miller of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group told the BBC.</p><p>"There's a reasonable chance that we could end up in 2026 without a meaningful, workable trade deal with the United States," he said.

The rate would climb to 25% on June 1 if no deal was in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States, he said.</p><p>The Republican president appeared to indicate that he was using the tariffs as leverage to force talks with Denmark and other European countries over the status of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-greenland-trump-denmark-threat-annex-4907c132b499531d8d5fe6cd549c0beb">NATO ally</a></span> Denmark that he regards as critical to U.S. national security.</p>
    
<p>“The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them,” Trump said on Truth Social.</p>



<p>The tariff threat could mark a problematic rupture between Trump and America’s longtime NATO partners, further straining an alliance that dates to 1949 and provides a collective degree of security to Europe and North America. Trump has repeatedly tried to use trade penalties to bend allies and rivals alike to his will, generating investment commitments from some nations and pushback from others, notably China.</p>
    
    
    
<p>Trump is scheduled to travel on Tuesday to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he likely will run into the European leaders he just threatened with tariffs that would start in little more than two weeks.</p><p>Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said the tariff threats were a “surprise” given the “constructive meeting” with top U.S. officials this week in Washington. He said the purpose of more European troops in Greenland was to “enhance security in the Arctic” and that “we agree with the US that we need to do more since the Arctic is no longer a low tension area.”</p>
    
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron pushed back against Trump in a social media post that seemed to equate the threat to Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.</p><p>“No intimidation or threats will influence us, whether in Ukraine, Greenland or anywhere else in the world when we are faced with such situations,” Macron said in a translated post on X. “Tariff threats are unacceptable and have no place in this context. Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner.”</p><p>There are immediate questions about how the White House could try to implement the tariffs because the EU is a single economic zone in terms of trading, according to a European diplomat who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. It was unclear, too, how Trump could act under U.S. law, though he could cite emergency economic powers that are currently subject to a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-foreign-policy-21337d2c11e629da3f187cdeb381d58b">U.S. Supreme Court</a></span> challenge. </p>

Since 1945, the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/greenland-us-options-takeover-trump-denmark-86790903847fc8ffc27334ccb64985a9">American military presence</a></span> in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations to 200 at the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest of the island, the Danish foreign minister has said. That base supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.</p><p>Resistance has steadily built in Europe to Trump’s ambitions even as several countries on the continent agreed to his 15% tariffs last year in order to preserve an economic and security relationship with Washington.</p>
    
<h2>‘Important for the whole world’</h2><p>Earlier Saturday, hundreds of people in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, braved near-freezing temperatures, rain and icy streets to <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/denmark-greenland-us-trump-899d73348f2ee6c0cd2a8a6e6e136a90">march in a rally</a></span> in support of their own self-governance.</p><p>Thousands of people also marched through Copenhagen, many of them carrying Greenland’s flag. Some held signs with slogans such as “Make America Smart Again” and “Hands Off.”</p><p>“This is important for the whole world,” Danish protester Elise Riechie told The Associated Press as she held Danish and Greenlandic flags. “There are many small countries. None of them are for sale.”</p><p>The rallies occurred hours after a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers, while visiting Copenhagen, sought to reassure Denmark and Greenland of their support.</p>
    
<h2>European training exercises</h2><p>Danish Maj. Gen. Søren Andersen, leader of the Joint Arctic Command, told the AP that Denmark does not expect the U.S. military to attack Greenland, or any other NATO ally, and that European troops were recently deployed to Nuuk for Arctic defense training.</p><p>He said the goal is not to send a message to the Trump administration, even though the White House has not ruled out <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/greenland-us-options-takeover-trump-denmark-86790903847fc8ffc27334ccb64985a9">taking the territory by force</a></span>.</p><p>“I will not go into the political part, but I will say that I would never expect a NATO country to attack another NATO country,” he said from aboard a Danish military vessel docked in Nuuk. “For us, for me, it’s not about signaling. It is actually about training military units, working together with allies.”</p><p>The Danish military organized a planning meeting Friday in Greenland with NATO allies, including the U.S., to discuss Arctic security on the alliance’s northern flank in the face of a potential Russian threat. The Americans were also invited to participate in Operation Arctic Endurance in Greenland in the coming days, Andersen said.</p><p>In his 2½ years as a commander in Greenland, Andersen said that he hasn’t seen any Chinese or Russian combat vessels or warships, despite Trump saying that they were off the island’s coast.</p><p>But in the unlikely event of American troops using force on Danish soil, Andersen confirmed that Danish soldiers have an obligation to fight back.</p><h2>‘Almost no better’ ally to US than Denmark</h2><p>Trump has contended that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland and its vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. He said recently that anything less than the Arctic island being in U.S. hands would be “unacceptable.” </p><p>The president has seen tariffs as a tool to get what he wants without having to resort to military actions. At the White House on Friday, he recounted how he had threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals and he teased the possibility of doing so again.</p><p>“I may do that for Greenland, too,” Trump said.</p><p>After Trump followed through, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said “Congress must reclaim tariff authorities” so that they are not used solely at a president’s discretion. </p><p>European leaders have said it is only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies.</p><p>“There is almost no better ally to the United States than Denmark,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., while visiting Copenhagen with other members of Congress. “If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?”</p><p>___</p><p>Burrows reported from Nuuk, Greenland, and Niemann from Copenhagen, Denmark.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="layout-block"><p>Elizabeth (Bess), Countess of Shrewsbury, was the woman who had deep enough pockets to build it. She was mid-way through extending the massive, rambling Hardwick "old" Hall, but for some reason or another, stopped midway through and began afresh. The experts I spoke to say we don't know why she did that, but theories range from coming into money when her husband died and feeling the need to have a house in keeping with her elevated status, to using what she'd learnt in previous builds to design a house warm and cosy for a lady approaching her seventies and living through the Little Ice Age.</p><p>"The late 16th Century is really one of the coldest stretches of the Little Ice Age, and it's bitterly cold in England," says Dagomar Degroot, professor of environmental history at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, and author of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/frigid-golden-age/FD88D1B4AFA571C02A33D34B65484928">The Frigid Golden Age</a>.</p><p>Global average temperatures during the Little Ice Age dipped "<a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/58/2/2.17/3074082">at most</a>" by 0.5C (less than 0.9F), with impacts mostly documented in the northern hemisphere. That figure is an average over about five centuries, so temperatures would have swung more dramatically year to year and region to region.</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mvf0py.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mvf0py.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mvf0py.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mvf0py.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mvf0py.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mvf0py.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mvf0py.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mvf0py.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mvf0py.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mvf0py.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Ranald Lawrence and Dean Hawkes The windows of the hall were strategically placed to make the most of sunlight (Credit: Ranald Lawrence and Dean Hawkes)"><span>Ranald Lawrence and Dean Hawkes</span></p><figcaption>The windows of the hall were strategically placed to make the most of sunlight (Credit: Ranald Lawrence and Dean Hawkes)</figcaption></figure><h2><span id="turning-to-the-sun"><b id="turning-to-the-sun">Turning to the Sun</b></span></h2><p>A key difference between the old hall and the new hall is their orientation in relation to the Sun. The old hall is just off east-west. The new hall has been rotated by about 90 degrees, which means it can soak up much more sunshine and, therefore, heat.</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><p>"The incredible thing about Hardwick [new Hall] is… when you set it on the compass, it's almost exactly north-south," says Ranald Lawrence, a lecturer in architecture at the University of Liverpool in the UK. He's also published papers on Hardwick's <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13602365.2021.1962389">design</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00038628.2020.1856032">thermal comfort</a>. "And," he adds, "the whole internal planning of the [new] house is then based around that geometry."</p><p>Bess moved around the rooms, following the Sun's path. Her mornings were spent walking the 63m (200ft) east-facing Long Gallery, where the bright morning light hits. The afternoon and evening Sun illuminates the south-western flank of the building, where Bess' bed chambers were. And the darkest, coldest corner of the house in the north-west was where the kitchens were placed, which would have been handy in keeping food cool and fresh.</p><p>I experience this first hand as I walk around – the kitchens are much colder. Elena Williams, the senior house and collections manager at The National Trust, a UK charity which preserves historic sites, notices too. "It's a well-designed building that is also designed around comfort and that uses the natural environment to do that," she says.</p><h2><span id="windows,-walls-and-fireplaces"><b id="windows,-walls-and-fireplaces">Windows, walls and fireplaces</b></span></h2><p>It's not just the orientation that helps keep the house warm. As Williams shows me around, she points out that some of the windows on the north of the building are actually "blind" or fake. She explains that on the outside, there is a window, but on the inside, it's lined with lead and blocked up. Unlike south-facing windows, north-facing windows bring little thermal benefit, even in summer, Lawrence says.</p><p>Pretty much all the fireplaces I see are also built on the central spine of the building, meaning not much heat would be lost to the windows or exterior wall. It's not until we take a door through this spine that I realise that the girth of it is staggering – 1.37m (4.5ft) thick. This is yet another trick to keep its inhabitants warm.</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><p>"The past is an underused tool," Degroot says. "I think by trying to identify the complex and diverse ways in which people responded to history's climate changes, we can come up with new tools for understanding how we might respond in the future and for identifying responses that are constructive versus destructive."&nbsp;</p><p>Brutalist architects Peter and Alison Smithson knew of and even<a target="_blank" href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/39266530/550aa8540cf28556409502a4-libre.pdf?1445160899=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DPaper_No_151_The_Architecture_of_Climate.pdf&amp;Expires=1768509864&amp;Signature=OXyZLorBmT-7qkk66yuaWuUHmB5IpGCbB19oRgAbgr29xV3O2~HmE3a8tDRBJUjSchZKBrshFLJILwok0TVBVEncu-MezEfFbsbnIMUShTXwU-CcQASk8BIcDcMcqQXcPPUuUBlczqCO56qDqpQla0L~ahuKiDYWLOQr3mgIJUcW52nHi~SvGIByCbrRkHZ2u8p5TnnoXXiQJmzL3ClAogl2EsBGJ3ne3N0RecBHDOupCIM7gJ0LJN-6fU~H9MnJmJ~9Lt5m8~Tt9Vo1y4Sx9-SdYcdDkQbKURZgYsqM083i09hPNp8amF~rIzWxlP5KqaA3UiL1CM6B3RI5Bgzwqg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA"> admired </a>Hardwick Hall.

Sun-soaking designs aren't just the preserve of the rich, though. One of London's most striking council estates is on Alexandria Road in Camden, in the north of the city, and Lawrence says it too features south facing terraces with lots of concrete to store the Sun's heat.</p><p>But on the whole, he tells me, we generally don't use these Elizabethan building secrets. Instead, we use air conditioning and heating in an attempt to override building designs that are poorly suited to their climate.</p><p>"Our assumption that the solution to all of our problems is technological," Lawrence says.

<div>

<p>07.12.2025, <em>By Stephan Schwab</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.caimito.net/en/about.html"><img src="https://gravatar.com/avatar/663d11426b0a187ddac59f8c17ce61b4?s=120&amp;d=robohash&amp;r=x"></a></p><p>Every decade brings new promises: this time, we'll finally make software development simple enough that we won't need so many developers. From COBOL to AI, the pattern repeats. Business leaders grow frustrated with slow delivery and high costs. Developers feel misunderstood and undervalued. Understanding why this cycle persists for fifty years reveals what both sides need to know about the nature of software work.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="the-dream-was-born-during-humanitys-greatest-achievement">The Dream Was Born During Humanity’s Greatest Achievement</h2>

<p>When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface in 1969, the world witnessed what organized human ingenuity could accomplish. Behind that achievement stood Margaret Hamilton and her team, writing Apollo’s guidance software by hand, catching critical errors through careful review, and proving that software could be mission-critical.</p>

<p>The Apollo program demonstrated that software development was essential to achieving the impossible. Yet it also revealed something that would frustrate business leaders for decades to come: writing software required specialized knowledge, intense focus, and significant time investment. The dream of making it easier—of needing fewer of these expensive specialists—began almost immediately.</p>

<h2 id="cobol-business-people-will-write-their-own-programs">COBOL: Business People Will Write Their Own Programs</h2>

<p>The late 1960s and 1970s saw COBOL emerge with an explicit goal stated in its name: Common Business-Oriented Language. The vision was clear: make the language read like English sentences, and business analysts would write their own programs. No need for specialized programmers.</p>

<p>
"If we make the syntax readable enough, anyone who understands the business can write the code."
</p>

<p>This vision had genuine appeal. Software was becoming essential to business operations, yet programmers remained a scarce, expensive resource. COBOL promised to democratize software creation.</p>

<p>What happened instead? COBOL became another programming language requiring specialized training. Business analysts who tried to write COBOL quickly discovered that readable syntax didn’t eliminate the complexity of logic, data structures, or system design. A new class of COBOL programmers emerged, and the dream of eliminating specialized developers remained unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Yet the dream didn’t die. It simply waited for the next technological wave.</p>



<p>Computer-Aided Software Engineering tools arrived in the 1980s with tremendous promise. Draw flowcharts and entity-relationship diagrams, and the tool would generate working code. The marketing message resonated: visual design was more intuitive than typing cryptic commands. Business experts could model their processes, and software would materialize.</p>

<p>Organizations invested heavily. Vendors promised productivity increases of 10x or more. Yet most CASE tool initiatives struggled or failed outright.</p>

<p>The generated code often required substantial manual intervention. Performance problems emerged. Maintenance became a nightmare when generated code diverged from the visual models. Most critically, drawing accurate diagrams required understanding the same logical complexity that programming demanded. The tool changed the interface but not the fundamental challenge.</p>

<p>Once again, the problem proved more stubborn than the solution.</p>

<h2 id="visual-basic-and-delphi-drag-drop-done">Visual Basic and Delphi: Drag, Drop, Done</h2>

<p>The 1990s brought a different approach. Microsoft’s Visual Basic and Borland’s Delphi made building user interfaces dramatically easier. Drag components onto a form, set properties, write event handlers. Suddenly, creating a Windows application felt achievable for developers with modest experience.</p>

<p>This wave succeeded differently than COBOL or CASE tools. These environments acknowledged that programming knowledge was still necessary, but they reduced the barrier to entry. A broader range of people could create useful applications.</p>

<p>Yet the dream of eliminating developers persisted. “Power users” and “citizen developers” would build departmental applications. IT departments could focus on infrastructure while business units solved their own software needs.</p>

<p>Reality proved more nuanced. Simple applications were indeed accessible to more people. But as requirements grew in complexity—integration with existing systems, security considerations, performance under load, long-term maintenance—the need for experienced developers became evident. The tools expanded who could write software, but they didn’t eliminate the expertise required for substantial systems.</p>

<p>And so the cycle continued into the new millennium.</p>

<h2 id="the-2000s-and-beyond-web-frameworks-low-code-and-no-code">The 2000s and Beyond: Web Frameworks, Low-Code, and No-Code</h2>

<p>Each subsequent decade introduced new variations. Ruby on Rails promised convention over configuration. Low-code platforms offered visual development with minimal coding. No-code platforms claimed to eliminate programming entirely for common business applications.</p>

<p>Each wave delivered real value. Development genuinely became faster in specific contexts. More people could participate in creating software solutions. Yet professional software developers remained essential, and demand for their skills continued growing rather than shrinking.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the question: why does this pattern repeat?</p>

<h2 id="why-the-dream-persists">Why the Dream Persists</h2>

<p>The recurring pattern reveals something important about how we think about complexity. Software development looks like it should be simple because we can describe what we want in plain language. “When a customer places an order, check inventory, calculate shipping, process payment, and send a confirmation email.” That description sounds straightforward.</p>

<p>The complexity emerges in the details. What happens when inventory is temporarily reserved by another order? How do you handle partial payments? What if the email service is temporarily unavailable? Should you retry? How many times? What if the customer’s session expires during checkout? How do you prevent duplicate orders?</p>

<p>Each answer leads to more questions. The accumulated decisions, edge cases, and interactions create genuine complexity that no tool or language can eliminate. Someone must think through these scenarios. That thinking is software development, regardless of whether it’s expressed in COBOL, a CASE tool diagram, Visual Basic, or an AI prompt.</p>

<p>Which brings us to today’s excitement.</p>

<h2 id="ai-the-latest-chapter-in-a-long-story">AI: The Latest Chapter in a Long Story</h2>

<p>Today’s AI coding assistants represent the most capable attempt yet to assist with software creation. They can generate substantial amounts of working code from natural language descriptions. They can explain existing code, suggest improvements, and help debug problems.</p>

<p>This represents genuine progress. The assistance is real and valuable. Experienced developers use these tools to work more efficiently. People learning to code find the interactive guidance helpful.</p>

<p>Yet we’re already seeing the familiar pattern emerge. Initial excitement about AI replacing developers is giving way to a more nuanced understanding: AI changes how developers work rather than eliminating the need for their judgment. The complexity remains. Someone must understand the business problem, evaluate whether the generated code solves it correctly, consider security implications, ensure it integrates properly with existing systems, and maintain it as requirements evolve.</p>

<p>AI amplifies developer capability. It doesn’t replace the need for people who understand both the problem domain and the technical landscape.</p>

<h2 id="so-much-opportunity-still-struggling">So Much Opportunity, Still Struggling</h2>

<p>Here’s the paradox that makes this pattern particularly poignant. We’ve made extraordinary progress in software capabilities. The Apollo guidance computer had 4KB of RAM. Your smartphone has millions of times more computing power. We’ve built tools and frameworks that genuinely make many aspects of development easier.</p>

<p>Yet demand for software far exceeds our ability to create it. Every organization needs more software than it can build. The backlog of desired features and new initiatives grows faster than development teams can address it.</p>

<p>This tension—powerful tools yet insufficient capacity—keeps the dream alive. Business leaders look at the backlog and think, “There must be a way to go faster, to enable more people to contribute.” That’s a reasonable thought. It leads naturally to enthusiasm for any tool or approach that promises to democratize software creation.</p>

<p>The challenge is that software development isn’t primarily constrained by typing speed or syntax knowledge. It’s constrained by the thinking required to handle complexity well. Faster typing doesn’t help when you’re thinking through how to handle concurrent database updates. Simpler syntax doesn’t help when you’re reasoning about security implications.</p>

<p>So what should leaders do with this understanding?</p>

<h2 id="what-this-means-for-leaders">What This Means for Leaders</h2>

<p>Understanding this pattern changes how you evaluate new tools and approaches. When someone promises that their platform will let business users build applications without developers, you can appreciate the aspiration while maintaining realistic expectations.</p>

<p>The right question isn’t “Will this eliminate our need for developers?” The right questions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will this help our developers work more effectively on complex problems?</li>
  <li>Will this enable us to build certain types of solutions faster?</li>
  <li>Does this reduce time spent on repetitive tasks so developers can focus on unique challenges?</li>
  <li>Will our team need to learn new skills to use this effectively?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions acknowledge that development involves irreducible complexity while remaining open to tools that provide genuine leverage.</p>

<p>And they point to something deeper about the nature of software work.</p>

<h2 id="the-pattern-reveals-the-problems-nature">The Pattern Reveals the Problem’s Nature</h2>

<p>This fifty-year pattern teaches us something fundamental about software development itself. If the problem were primarily mechanical—too much typing, too complex syntax, too many steps—we would have solved it by now. COBOL made syntax readable. CASE tools eliminated typing. Visual tools eliminated syntax. AI can now generate entire functions from descriptions.</p>

<p>Each advancement addressed a real friction point. Yet the fundamental challenge persists because it’s not mechanical. It’s intellectual. Software development is thinking made tangible. The artifacts we create—whether COBOL programs, Delphi forms, or Python scripts—are the visible outcome of invisible reasoning about complexity.</p>

<p>You can’t shortcut that reasoning any more than you can shortcut the reasoning required to design a building or diagnose a medical condition. Better tools help. Experience helps. But someone must still think it through.</p>

<p>So how should we move forward, knowing all this?</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward-with-clear-eyes">Moving Forward with Clear Eyes</h2>

<p>The next wave of development tools will arrive. Some will provide genuine value. Some will repeat familiar promises with new technology. Having perspective on this recurring pattern helps you engage with new tools productively.</p>

<p>Use AI assistants. Evaluate low-code platforms. Experiment with new frameworks. But invest primarily in your people’s ability to think clearly about complexity. That capability remains the constraining factor, just as it was during the Apollo program.</p>

<p>The moon landing happened because brilliant people thought carefully about every detail of an extraordinarily complex challenge. They wrote software by hand because that was the available tool. If they’d had better tools, they would have used them gladly. But the tools wouldn’t have eliminated their need to think through the complexity.</p>

<p>We’re still in that same fundamental situation. We have better tools—vastly better tools—but the thinking remains essential.</p>

<h2 id="the-dream-serves-a-purpose">The Dream Serves a Purpose</h2>

<p>Perhaps the recurring dream of replacing developers isn’t a mistake. Perhaps it’s a necessary optimism that drives tool creation. Each attempt to make development more accessible produces tools that genuinely help. The dream doesn’t come true as imagined, but pursuing it creates value.</p>

<p>COBOL didn’t let business analysts write programs, but it did enable a generation of developers to build business systems effectively. CASE tools didn’t generate complete applications, but they advanced our thinking about visual modeling. Visual Basic didn’t eliminate professional developers, but it brought application development to more people. AI won’t replace developers, but it will change how we work in meaningful ways.</p>

<p>The pattern continues because the dream reflects a legitimate need. We genuinely require faster, more efficient ways to create software. We just keep discovering that the constraint isn’t the tool—it’s the complexity of the problems we’re trying to solve.</p>

<p>Understanding this doesn’t mean rejecting new tools. It means using them with clear expectations about what they can provide and what will always require human judgment.</p>

Pick a </span><a href="https://www.standwithminnesota.com/" rel="">reputable (non-government) immigrant rights organization</a><span>, public school PTA or support organization, or (non-government) social service agency. Send them as much money as you are comfortable sending; they need it desperately (mainly to feed people and provide legal assistance, but there are many other needs). </span></p><p>Third, directly reach out to your friends or family members in the Twin Cities … every day. Like me, they need to know that the world is aware of what is happening here and cares.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BhnL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BhnL!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BhnL!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BhnL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BhnL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BhnL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png" width="1456" height="1119" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1119,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2530901,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://donmoynihan.substack.com/i/184647521?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BhnL!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BhnL!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BhnL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BhnL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ee8f35e-124c-4074-824d-cc8082c985a0_2066x1588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Mostafa Bassim / Anadolu / Getty</figcaption></figure></div></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/italy-investigates-activision-blizzard-for-pushing-in-game-purchases/">https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/italy-investigates-activision-blizzard-for-pushing-in-game-purchases/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46658014">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Italy has launched two investigations into Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard, alleging the company has engaged in “misleading and aggressive” sales practices for its popular smartphone games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile.</p>

<p>The country’s competition regulator, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza E Del Mercato (AGCM), said the investigations focus on the use of design elements to induce users, particularly children, into playing for long periods, and make in-game purchases by urging them to not miss out on rewards.</p>







<p>“These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers — including minors — leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved,” the AGCM <a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2026/1/PS13020-PS13039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> in a statement.</p>

<p>The AGCM said the games are advertised as free-to-play but offer in-game purchases. </p>

<p>That isn’t particularly surprising, however, as, unlike full-priced games, free-to-play games have long relied on loot boxes and sales of in-game cosmetics for monetization. Diablo Immortal, for example, offers in-game cosmetics, as well as currency that allows players to accelerate their progression and gain items for crafting, for as much as $200. </p>

<p>Given the nature of the game, it’s not unusual for many users to repeatedly spend on such items in the course of play.</p>

<p>Both Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile have player bases in the hundreds of thousands. </p>

<p>The authority is also looking into the games’ parental control features, as the default settings lets minors make in-game purchases, play for long periods without restraints, and allow them to chat with others in-game. The AGCM also highlighted privacy concerns, as the games appear to lead users to select all consent options when signing up, and said it would look into the company’s consent process for harvesting and using personal data.</p>

<p>“In the Authority’s view, the company may be acting in breach of consumer protection rules and, in particular, the duty of professional diligence required in a sector that is particularly sensitive to the risks of gaming-related addiction,” the regulator said.</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been spending my time building an image-to-ASCII renderer. Below is the result — try dragging it around, the demo is interactive!</p>

<p>One thing I spent a lot of effort on is getting edges looking sharp. Take a look at this rotating cube example:</p>

<p>Try opening the “split” view. Notice how well the characters follow the contour of the square.</p>
<p>This renderer works well for animated scenes, like the ones above, but we can also use it to render static images:</p>

<p>The image of Saturn was <a target="_blank" href="https://chatgpt.com/share/69524279-7564-800f-ae22-a2f433794abe">generated with ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<p>Then, to get better separation between different colored regions, I also implemented a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel_shading">cel shading</a>-like effect to enhance contrast between edges. Try dragging the contrast slider below:</p>

<p>The contrast enhancement makes the separation between different colored regions far clearer. That was key to making the 3D scene above look as good as it does.</p>
<p>I put so much focus on sharp edges because they’re an aspect of ASCII rendering that is often overlooked when programmatically rendering images as ASCII. Consider this animated 3D scene from Cognition’s landing page that is rendered via ASCII characters:</p>

<p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://cognition.ai/">cognition.ai</a></p>
<p>It’s a cool effect, especially while in motion, but take a look at those blurry edges! The characters follow the cube contours very poorly, and as a result, the edges look blurry and jagged in places:</p>
<div><p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/ascii-rendering/cube-logo-zoomed-in.png" width="450"></p></div>
<p>This blurriness happens because the ASCII characters are being treated like pixels — their <em>shape</em> is ignored. It’s disappointing to see because ASCII art looks <em>so much</em> better when shape is utilized. I don’t believe I’ve ever seen shape utilized in generated ASCII art, and I think that’s because it’s not really obvious how to consider shape when building an ASCII renderer.</p>
<p>I started building my ASCII renderer to prove to myself that it’s possible to utilize shape in ASCII rendering. In this post, I’ll cover the techniques and ideas I used to capture shape and build this ASCII renderer in detail.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the basics of image-to-ASCII conversion and see where the common issue of blurry edges comes from. After that, I’ll show you the approach I used to fix that and achieve sharp, high-quality ASCII rendering. At the end, we’ll improve on that by implementing the contrast enhancement effect I showed above.</p>
<p>Let’s get to it!</p>
<h2>Image to ASCII conversion</h2>
<p>ASCII contains <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ascii-code.com/characters/printable-characters">95 printable characters</a> that we can use. Let’s start off by rendering the following image containing a white circle using those ASCII characters:</p>

<p>ASCII art is (almost) always rendered using a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospace</a> font. Since every character in a monospace font is equally wide and tall, we can split the image into a grid. Each grid cell will contain a single ASCII character.</p>
<p>The image with the circle is <mjx-container classname="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align:-0.05ex" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="9.553ex" height="1.557ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -666 4222.4 688" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-1-TEX-N-33" d="M127 463Q100 463 85 480T69 524Q69 579 117 622T233 665Q268 665 277 664Q351 652 390 611T430 522Q430 470 396 421T302 350L299 348Q299 347 308 345T337 336T375 315Q457 262 457 175Q457 96 395 37T238 -22Q158 -22 100 21T42 130Q42 158 60 175T105 193Q133 193 151 175T169 130Q169 119 166 110T159 94T148 82T136 74T126 70T118 67L114 66Q165 21 238 21Q293 21 321 74Q338 107 338 175V195Q338 290 274 322Q259 328 213 329L171 330L168 332Q166 335 166 348Q166 366 174 366Q202 366 232 371Q266 376 294 413T322 525V533Q322 590 287 612Q265 626 240 626Q208 626 181 615T143 592T132 580H135Q138 579 143 578T153 573T165 566T175 555T183 540T186 520Q186 498 172 481T127 463Z"></path><path id="MJX-1-TEX-N-36" d="M42 313Q42 476 123 571T303 666Q372 666 402 630T432 550Q432 525 418 510T379 495Q356 495 341 509T326 548Q326 592 373 601Q351 623 311 626Q240 626 194 566Q147 500 147 364L148 360Q153 366 156 373Q197 433 263 433H267Q313 433 348 414Q372 400 396 374T435 317Q456 268 456 210V192Q456 169 451 149Q440 90 387 34T253 -22Q225 -22 199 -14T143 16T92 75T56 172T42 313ZM257 397Q227 397 205 380T171 335T154 278T148 216Q148 133 160 97T198 39Q222 21 251 21Q302 21 329 59Q342 77 347 104T352 209Q352 289 347 316T329 361Q302 397 257 397Z"></path><path id="MJX-1-TEX-N-30" d="M96 585Q152 666 249 666Q297 666 345 640T423 548Q460 465 460 320Q460 165 417 83Q397 41 362 16T301 -15T250 -22Q224 -22 198 -16T137 16T82 83Q39 165 39 320Q39 494 96 585ZM321 597Q291 629 250 629Q208 629 178 597Q153 571 145 525T137 333Q137 175 145 125T181 46Q209 16 250 16Q290 16 318 46Q347 76 354 130T362 333Q362 478 354 524T321 597Z"></path><path id="MJX-1-TEX-N-D7" d="M630 29Q630 9 609 9Q604 9 587 25T493 118L389 222L284 117Q178 13 175 11Q171 9 168 9Q160 9 154 15T147 29Q147 36 161 51T255 146L359 250L255 354Q174 435 161 449T147 471Q147 480 153 485T168 490Q173 490 175 489Q178 487 284 383L389 278L493 382Q570 459 587 475T609 491Q630 491 630 471Q630 464 620 453T522 355L418 250L522 145Q606 61 618 48T630 29Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mn"><use data-c="33" xlink:href="#MJX-1-TEX-N-33"></use><use data-c="36" xlink:href="#MJX-1-TEX-N-36" transform="translate(500,0)"></use><use data-c="30" xlink:href="#MJX-1-TEX-N-30" transform="translate(1000,0)"></use></g><g data-mml-node="mo" transform="translate(1722.2,0)"><use data-c="D7" xlink:href="#MJX-1-TEX-N-D7"></use></g><g data-mml-node="mn" transform="translate(2722.4,0)"><use data-c="33" xlink:href="#MJX-1-TEX-N-33"></use><use data-c="36" xlink:href="#MJX-1-TEX-N-36" transform="translate(500,0)"></use><use data-c="30" xlink:href="#MJX-1-TEX-N-30" transform="translate(1000,0)"></use></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> pixels.

<p>Monospace characters are typically taller than they are wide, so I made each grid cell a bit taller than it is wide.</p>
<p>Our task is now to pick which character to place in each cell. The simplest approach is to calculate a lightness value for each cell and pick a character based on that.</p>

<h3>Mapping lightness values to ASCII characters</h3>
<p>Now that we have a lightness value for each cell, we want to use those values to pick ASCII characters. As mentioned before, ASCII has 95 printable characters, but let’s start simple with just these characters:</p>

<p>We can sort them in approximate density order like so, with lower-density characters to the left, and high-density characters to the right:</p>

<p>We’ll put these characters in a <code><span>CHARS</span></code> array:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>CHARS</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>" "</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"."</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>":"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"-"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"="</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"+"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"#"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"%"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"@"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p></pre></div>
<p>I added space as the first (least dense) character.</p>
<p>We can then map lightness values between <mjx-container classname="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align:-0.05ex" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.131ex" height="1.557ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -666 500 688" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-12-TEX-N-30" d="M96 585Q152 666 249 666Q297 666 345 640T423 548Q460 465 460 320Q460 165 417 83Q397 41 362 16T301 -15T250 -22Q224 -22 198 -16T137 16T82 83Q39 165 39 320Q39 494 96 585ZM321 597Q291 629 250 629Q208 629 178 597Q153 571 145 525T137 333Q137 175 145 125T181 46Q209 16 250 16Q290 16 318 46Q347 76 354 130T362 333Q362 478 354 524T321 597Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mn"><use data-c="30" xlink:href="#MJX-12-TEX-N-30"></use></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> and <mjx-container classname="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align:0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.131ex" height="1.507ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -666 500 666" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-13-TEX-N-31" d="M213 578L200 573Q186 568 160 563T102 556H83V602H102Q149 604 189 617T245 641T273 663Q275 666 285 666Q294 666 302 660V361L303 61Q310 54 315 52T339 48T401 46H427V0H416Q395 3 257 3Q121 3 100 0H88V46H114Q136 46 152 46T177 47T193 50T201 52T207 57T213 61V578Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mn"><use data-c="31" xlink:href="#MJX-13-TEX-N-31"></use></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> to one of those characters like so:</p>

<p>This maps low lightness values to low-density characters and high lightness values to high-density characters.</p>
<p>Rendering the circle from above with this method gives us:</p>

<p>That works... but the result is pretty ugly. We seem to always get <code>@</code> for cells that fall within the circle and a space for cells that fall outside.</p>
<p>That is happening because we’ve pretty much just implemented nearest-neighbor downsampling. Let’s see what that means.</p>

<p>If, instead of picking an ASCII character for each grid cell, we color each grid cell (pixel) according to the sampled value, we get the following pixelated rendering:</p>

<p>This pixelated rendering is pretty much equivalent to the ASCII rendering from before. The only difference is that instead of <code>@</code>s we have white pixels, and instead of spaces we have black pixels.</p>
<p>These square, jagged looking edges are aliasing artifacts, commonly called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaggies">jaggies</a>. They’re a common result of using nearest-neighbor interpolation.</p>

When we pixelate it with nearest-neighbor interpolation, we get the following:</p>

<p>Let’s try to get rid of the jagginess by taking multiple samples within each cell and using the average sampled lightness value as the cell’s lightness. The example below lets you vary the number of samples using the slider:</p>

<p>With multiple samples, cells that lie on the edge of a shape will have some of their samples fall within the shape, and some outside of it. Averaging those, we get gray in-between colors that smooth the downsampled image. Below is the same example, but with an overlay showing where the samples are taken:</p>

<p>This method of collecting multiple samples from the larger image is called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersampling">supersampling</a>. It’s a common method of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing">spatial anti-aliasing</a> (avoiding jaggies at edges). Here’s what the rotating square looks like with supersampling (using <mjx-container classname="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align:-0.05ex" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.131ex" height="1.557ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -666 500 688" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-20-TEX-N-38" d="M70 417T70 494T124 618T248 666Q319 666 374 624T429 515Q429 485 418 459T392 417T361 389T335 371T324 363L338 354Q352 344 366 334T382 323Q457 264 457 174Q457 95 399 37T249 -22Q159 -22 101 29T43 155Q43 263 172 335L154 348Q133 361 127 368Q70 417 70 494ZM286 386L292 390Q298 394 301 396T311 403T323 413T334 425T345 438T355 454T364 471T369 491T371 513Q371 556 342 586T275 624Q268 625 242 625Q201 625 165 599T128 534Q128 511 141 492T167 463T217 431Q224 426 228 424L286 386ZM250 21Q308 21 350 55T392 137Q392 154 387 169T375 194T353 216T330 234T301 253T274 270Q260 279 244 289T218 306L210 311Q204 311 181 294T133 239T107 157Q107 98 150 60T250 21Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mn"><use data-c="38" xlink:href="#MJX-20-TEX-N-38"></use></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> samples for each cell):</p>

<p>Let’s look at what supersampling does for the circle example from earlier. Try dragging the sample quality slider:</p>

<p>The circle becomes less jagged, but the edges feel blurry. Why’s that?</p>
<p>Well, they feel blurry because we’re pretty much just rendering a low-resolution, pixelated image of a circle. Take a look at the pixelated view:</p>

<p>The ASCII and pixelated views are mirror images of each other. Both are just low-resolution versions of the original high-resolution image, scaled up to the original’s size — it’s no wonder they both look blurry.</p>
<hr>
<p>Increasing the number of samples is insufficient. No matter how many samples we take per cell, the samples will be averaged into a single lightness value, used to render a single pixel.</p>
<p>And that’s the core problem: treating each grid cell as a pixel in an image. It’s an obvious and simple method, but it disregards that ASCII characters have shape.</p>
<p>We can make our ASCII renderings far more crisp by picking characters based on their shape. Here’s the circle rendered that way:</p>

<p>The characters follow the contour of the circle very well. By picking characters based on shape, we get a far higher <em>effective</em> resolution. The result is also more visually interesting.</p>
<p>Let’s see how we can implement this.</p>
<h2>Shape</h2>
<p>So what do I mean by shape? Well, consider the characters <code>T</code>, <code>L</code>, and <code>O</code> placed within grid cells:</p>

<p>The character <code>T</code> is top-heavy. Its visual density in the upper half of the grid cell is higher than in the lower half. The opposite can be said for <code>L</code> — it’s bottom-heavy. <code>O</code> is pretty much equally dense in the upper and lower halves of the cell.</p>
<p>We might also compare characters like <code>L</code> and <code>J</code>. The character <code>L</code> is heavier within the left half of the cell, while <code>J</code> is heavier in the right half:</p>

<p>We also have more “extreme” characters, such as <code>_</code> and <code>^</code>, that only occupy the lower or upper portion of the cell, respectively:</p>

<p>This is, roughly, what I mean by “shape” in the context of ASCII rendering. Shape refers to which regions of a cell a given character visually occupies.</p>
<h3>Quantifying shape</h3>
<p>To pick characters based on their shape, we’ll somehow need to quantify (put numbers to) the shape of each character.</p>
<p>Let’s start by only considering how much characters occupy the upper and lower regions of our cell. To do that, we’ll define two “sampling circles” for each grid cell — one placed in the upper half and one in the lower half:</p>

<p>It may seem odd or arbitrary to use circles instead of just splitting the cell into two rectangles, but using circles will give us more flexibility later on.</p>
<p>A character placed within a cell will overlap each of the cell’s sampling circles to <em>some</em> extent.</p>

<h3>Shape-based lookup</h3>
<p>Let’s say that we have our ASCII characters and their associated shape vectors in a <code><span>CHARACTERS</span></code> array:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>CHARACTERS</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  character</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  shapeVector</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></div>
<p>We can then perform a nearest neighbor search like so:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>findBestCharacter</span><span>(</span><span>inputVector</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> bestCharacter </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>""</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> bestDistance </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Infinity</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> character</span><span>,</span><span> shapeVector </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>CHARACTERS</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> dist </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getDistance</span><span>(</span><span>shapeVector</span><span>,</span><span> inputVector</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>dist </span><span>&lt;</span><span> bestDistance</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      bestDistance </span><span>=</span><span> dist</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      bestCharacter </span><span>=</span><span> character</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> bestCharacter</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p></pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>findBestCharacter</span></code> function gives us the ASCII character whose shape best matches the input lookup vector.</p>
<p>Note: this brute force search is not very performant. This becomes a bottleneck when we start rendering thousands of ASCII characters at <mjx-container classname="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align:-0.05ex" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="2.262ex" height="1.557ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -666 1000 688" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-30-TEX-N-36" d="M42 313Q42 476 123 571T303 666Q372 666 402 630T432 550Q432 525 418 510T379 495Q356 495 341 509T326 548Q326 592 373 601Q351 623 311 626Q240 626 194 566Q147 500 147 364L148 360Q153 366 156 373Q197 433 263 433H267Q313 433 348 414Q372 400 396 374T435 317Q456 268 456 210V192Q456 169 451 149Q440 90 387 34T253 -22Q225 -22 199 -14T143 16T92 75T56 172T42 313ZM257 397Q227 397 205 380T171 335T154 278T148 216Q148 133 160 97T198 39Q222 21 251 21Q302 21 329 59Q342 77 347 104T352 209Q352 289 347 316T329 361Q302 397 257 397Z"></path><path id="MJX-30-TEX-N-30" d="M96 585Q152 666 249 666Q297 666 345 640T423 548Q460 465 460 320Q460 165 417 83Q397 41 362 16T301 -15T250 -22Q224 -22 198 -16T137 16T82 83Q39 165 39 320Q39 494 96 585ZM321 597Q291 629 250 629Q208 629 178 597Q153 571 145 525T137 333Q137 175 145 125T181 46Q209 16 250 16Q290 16 318 46Q347 76 354 130T362 333Q362 478 354 524T321 597Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mn"><use data-c="36" xlink:href="#MJX-30-TEX-N-36"></use><use data-c="30" xlink:href="#MJX-30-TEX-N-30" transform="translate(500,0)"></use></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> <abbr title="Frames per second">FPS</abbr>. I’ll talk more about this later.</p>
<p>To make use of this in our ASCII renderer, we’ll calculate a lookup vector for each cell in the ASCII grid and pass it to <code><span>findBestCharacter</span></code> to determine the character to display.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out. Consider the following zoomed-in circle as an example. It is split into three grid cells:</p>

<p>Overlaying our sampling circles, we see varying degrees of overlap:</p>

<p>When calculating the shape vector of each ASCII character, we took a huge number of samples. We could afford to do that because we only need to calculate those shape vectors once up front. After they’re calculated, we can use them again and again.</p>
<p>However, if we’re converting an animated image (e.g. canvas or video) to ASCII, we need to be mindful of performance when calculating the lookup vectors. An ASCII rendering might have hundreds or thousands of cells. Multiplying that by tens or hundreds of samples would be incredibly costly in terms of performance.</p>
<p>With that being said, let’s pick a sampling quality of <mjx-container classname="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align:-0.05ex" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.131ex" height="1.554ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -665 500 687" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-31-TEX-N-33" d="M127 463Q100 463 85 480T69 524Q69 579 117 622T233 665Q268 665 277 664Q351 652 390 611T430 522Q430 470 396 421T302 350L299 348Q299 347 308 345T337 336T375 315Q457 262 457 175Q457 96 395 37T238 -22Q158 -22 100 21T42 130Q42 158 60 175T105 193Q133 193 151 175T169 130Q169 119 166 110T159 94T148 82T136 74T126 70T118 67L114 66Q165 21 238 21Q293 21 321 74Q338 107 338 175V195Q338 290 274 322Q259 328 213 329L171 330L168 332Q166 335 166 348Q166 366 174 366Q202 366 232 371Q266 376 294 413T322 525V533Q322 590 287 612Q265 626 240 626Q208 626 181 615T143 592T132 580H135Q138 579 143 578T153 573T165 566T175 555T183 540T186 520Q186 498 172 481T127 463Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mn"><use data-c="33" xlink:href="#MJX-31-TEX-N-33"></use></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> with the samples placed like so:</p>

<p>From now on, instead of using the term “lookup vectors”, I’ll call these vectors, sampled from the image that we’re rendering as ASCII, <em>sampling vectors</em>. One sampling vector is calculated for each cell in the grid.</p>
<p>Anyway, we can use these sampling vectors to find the best-matching ASCII character. Let’s see what that looks like on our 2D plot — I’ll label the sampling vectors (from left to right) C0, C1, and C2:</p>

<p>We can fix this by <em>normalizing</em> the shape vectors. We’ll do that by taking the maximum value of each component across all shape vectors, and dividing the components of each shape vector by the maximum. Expressed in code, that looks like so:</p>

<p>We get <code>'</code>, <code>M</code> and <code>$</code>.  Let’s see how well those characters match the circle:</p>

<p>Nice! They match very well.</p>
<p>Let’s try rendering the full circle from before with the same method:</p>

<p>Much better than before! The picked characters follow the contour of the circle very well.</p>

<p>For example, two circles don’t capture the shape of characters that fall in the middle of the cell. Consider <code>-</code>:</p>

<p>The two upper-lower sampling circles also don’t capture left-right differences, such as the difference between <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>:</p>

<p>We could use such differences to get better character picks, but our two sampling circles don’t capture them. Let’s add more dimensions to our shape to fix that.</p>

They also capture the shape of “diagonal” characters like <code>/</code> to a reasonable degree.</p>

<p>One problem with this grid-like configuration for the sampling circles is that there are gaps. For example, <code>.</code> falls between the sampling circles:</p>

<p>To compensate for this, we can stagger the sampling circles vertically (e.g. lowering the left sampling circles and raising the right ones) and make them a bit larger. This causes the cell to be almost fully covered while not causing excessive overlap across the sampling circles:</p>

<p>We can use the same procedure as before to generate character vectors using these sampling circles, this time yielding a <mjx-container classname="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align:-0.05ex" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.131ex" height="1.557ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -666 500 688" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-39-TEX-N-36" d="M42 313Q42 476 123 571T303 666Q372 666 402 630T432 550Q432 525 418 510T379 495Q356 495 341 509T326 548Q326 592 373 601Q351 623 311 626Q240 626 194 566Q147 500 147 364L148 360Q153 366 156 373Q197 433 263 433H267Q313 433 348 414Q372 400 396 374T435 317Q456 268 456 210V192Q456 169 451 149Q440 90 387 34T253 -22Q225 -22 199 -14T143 16T92 75T56 172T42 313ZM257 397Q227 397 205 380T171 335T154 278T148 216Q148 133 160 97T198 39Q222 21 251 21Q302 21 329 59Q342 77 347 104T352 209Q352 289 347 316T329 361Q302 397 257 397Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mn"><use data-c="36" xlink:href="#MJX-39-TEX-N-36"></use></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container>-dimensional vector.

<p>The lightness values certainly look L-shaped! The 6D shape vector captures <code>L</code>’s shape very well.</p>
<h3>Nearest neighbor lookups in a 6D space</h3>
<p>Now we have a 6D shape vector for every ASCII character. Does that affect character lookups (how we find the best matching character)?</p>

<p>Note: since we’re just using this for the purposes of finding the closest point, we can skip the expensive <code><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> call and just return the squared distance. It does not affect the result.</p>
<p>So, no, the dimensionality of our shape vector does not change lookups at all. We can use the same <code><span>getDistance</span></code> function for both 2D and 6D.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s see what the 6D approach yields!</p>
<h3>Trying out the 6D approach</h3>
<p>Our new 6D approach works really well for flat shapes, like the circle example we’ve been using:</p>

<p>Now let’s see how this approach works when we render a 3D scene with more shades of gray:</p>

<p>Firstly, the outer contours look nice and sharp. I also like how well the gradients across the sphere and cone look.</p>
<p>However, internally, the objects all kind of blend together. The edges <em>between</em> surfaces with different lightnesses aren’t sharp enough. For example, the lighter faces of the cubes all kind of blend into one solid color. When there is a change in color — like when two faces of a cube meet — I’d like to see more sharpness in the ASCII rendering.</p>
<p>To demonstrate what I mean, consider the following split:</p>

<p>It’s currently rendered like so:</p>

<p>The different shades result in <code>i</code>s on the left and <code>B</code>s on the right, but the boundary is not very sharp.</p>
<p>By applying some effects to the sampling vector, we can enhance the contrast at the boundary so that it appears sharper:</p>

<p>The added contrast makes a <em>big</em> difference in readability for the 3D scene. Let’s look at how we can implement this contrast enhancement effect.</p>
<h2>Contrast enhancement</h2>
<p>Consider cells overlapping a color boundary like so:</p>

<p>For the cells on the boundary, we get a 6D sampling vector that looks like so:</p>

<p>To make future examples easier to visualize, I’ll start drawing the sampling vector using <mjx-container classname="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align:-0.05ex" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.131ex" height="1.557ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -666 500 688" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-48-TEX-N-36" d="M42 313Q42 476 123 571T303 666Q372 666 402 630T432 550Q432 525 418 510T379 495Q356 495 341 509T326 548Q326 592 373 601Q351 623 311 626Q240 626 194 566Q147 500 147 364L148 360Q153 366 156 373Q197 433 263 433H267Q313 433 348 414Q372 400 396 374T435 317Q456 268 456 210V192Q456 169 451 149Q440 90 387 34T253 -22Q225 -22 199 -14T143 16T92 75T56 172T42 313ZM257 397Q227 397 205 380T171 335T154 278T148 216Q148 133 160 97T198 39Q222 21 251 21Q302 21 329 59Q342 77 347 104T352 209Q352 289 347 316T329 361Q302 397 257 397Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mn"><use data-c="36" xlink:href="#MJX-48-TEX-N-36"></use></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> circles like so:</p>

<p>Currently, this sampling vector resolves to the character <code>T</code>:</p>

<p>That’s a sensible choice. The character <code>T</code> is visually dense in the top half and less so in the bottom half, so it matches the image fairly well.</p>

<p>Still, I want the picked character to emphasize the shape of the boundary better. We can achieve that by enhancing the contrast of the sampling vector.</p>
<p>To increase the contrast of our sampling vector, we might raise each component of the vector to the power of some exponent.</p>

<p>Here’s the same example, but with this normalization applied:</p>

<p>Very nice! The lightest component values are retained, and the contrast between the lighter and darker components is increased by “crunching” the lower values.</p>
<p>This affects which character is picked. The following example shows how the selected character changes as the contrast is increased:</p>

<p>Awesome! The pick of <code>"</code> over <code>T</code> emphasizes the separation between the lighter region above and the darker region below!</p>

<p>By enhancing the contrast of the sampling vector, we exaggerate its shape. This gives us a character that less faithfully represents the underlying image, but improves readability as a whole by enhancing the separation between different colored regions.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example. Observe how the L-shape of the sampling vector below becomes more pronounced as the exponent increases, and how that affects the picked character:</p>

<p>Works really nicely! I <em>love</em> the transition from <code>&amp; -&gt; b -&gt; L</code> as the L-shape of the vector becomes clearer.</p>
<p>What’s nice about applying exponents to normalized sampling vectors is that it barely affects vectors that are uniform in value. If all component values are similar, applying an exponent has a minimal effect:</p>

<p>Because the vector is fairly uniform, the exponent only has a slight effect and doesn’t change the picked character.</p>
<p>This is a good thing! If we have a smooth gradient in our image, we want to retain it. We very much do <em>not</em> want to introduce unnecessary choppiness.</p>
<p>Compare the 3D scene ASCII rendering with and without this contrast enhancement:</p>

<p>We do see more contrast at boundaries, but this is not quite there yet. Some edges are still not sharp enough, and we also observe a “staircasing” effect happening at some boundaries.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the staircasing effect first. We can reproduce it with a boundary like so:</p>

<p>Below is the ASCII rendering of that boundary. Notice how the lower edge (the <code>!</code>s) becomes “staircase-y” as you increase the exponent:</p>

<p>We see a staircase pattern like so:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>               !!!!!</span></p><p><span>          !!!!!!!!!!</span></p><p><span>     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p><p><span>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p></pre></div>
<p>To understand why that’s happening, let’s consider the row in the middle of the canvas, progressing from left to right. As we start off, every sample is equally light, giving us <code>U</code>s:</p>

<p>As we reach the boundary, the lower right samples become a bit darker. Those darker components are crunched by contrast enhancement, giving us some <code>Y</code>s:</p>

<p>So we get:</p>

<p>As we progress further right, the middle and lower samples get darker, so we get some <code>f</code>s:</p>

<p>This trend continues towards <code>"</code>, <code>'</code>, and finally, <code>`</code>:</p>

<p>Giving us a sequence like so:</p>

<p>That looks good, but at some point we get <em>no</em> light samples. Once we get no light samples, our contrast enhancement has no effect because every component is equally light. This causes us to always get <code>!</code>s:</p>

<p>Making our sequence look like so:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>UUUUUUUUYYf""''`!!!!!!!!!! -&gt;</span></p></pre></div>
<p>This sudden stop in contrast enhancement having an effect is what causes the staircasing effect:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>               !!!!!</span></p><p><span>          !!!!!!!!!!</span></p><p><span>     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p><p><span>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Let’s see how we can counteract this staircasing effect with <em>another</em> layer of contrast enhancement, this time looking outside of the boundary of each cell.</p>
<h3>Directional contrast enhancement</h3>
<p>We currently have sampling circles arranged like so:</p>

<p>For each of those sampling circles, we’ll specify an “external sampling circle”, placed outside of the cell’s boundary, like so:</p>

<p>Each of those external sampling circles is “reaching” into the region of a neighboring cell. Together, the samples that are collected by the external sampling circles constitute an “external sampling vector”.</p>
<p>Let’s simplify the visualization and consider a single example. Imagine that we collected a sampling vector and an external sampling vector that look like so:</p>

This indicates a color boundary above and to the left of the cell.</p>
<p>To enhance this apparent boundary, we’ll darken the top-left and middle-left components of the sampling vector. We can do that by applying <em>component-wise</em> contrast enhancement using the values from the external vector.</p>
<p>In the previous contrast enhancement, we calculated the maximum component value across the sampling vector and normalized the vector using that value:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>const</span><span> maxValue </span><span>=</span><span> Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>samplingVector</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>samplingVector </span><span>=</span><span> samplingVector</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  value </span><span>=</span><span> x </span><span>/</span><span> maxValue</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  value </span><span>=</span><span> Math</span><span>.</span><span>pow</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> exponent</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  value </span><span>=</span><span> x </span><span>*</span><span> maxValue</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> value</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span></span></p></pre></div>
<p>But the new component-wise contrast enhancement will take the maximum value between each component of the sampling vector and the corresponding component in the external sampling vector:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>samplingVector </span><span>=</span><span> samplingVector</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span><span> i</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> maxValue </span><span>=</span><span> Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span><span> externalSamplingVector</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></div>
<p>Aside from that, the contrast enhancement is performed in the same way:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>samplingVector </span><span>=</span><span> samplingVector</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span><span> i</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> maxValue </span><span>=</span><span> Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span><span> externalSamplingVector</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  value </span><span>=</span><span> value </span><span>/</span><span> maxValue</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  value </span><span>=</span><span> Math</span><span>.</span><span>pow</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span><span> exponent</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  value </span><span>=</span><span> value </span><span>*</span><span> maxValue</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> value</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></div>
<p>The example below shows how light values in the external sampling vector push values in the sampling vector down:</p>

<p>I call this “directional contrast enhancement”, since each of the external sampling circles reaches outside of the cell in the <em>direction</em> of the sampling vector component that it is enhancing the contrast of. I describe the other effect as “global contrast enhancement” since it acts on all of the sampling vector’s components together.</p>
<p>Let’s see what this directional contrast enhancement does to get rid of the staircasing effect:</p>

<p>Hmm, that’s not doing what I wanted. I wanted to see a sequence like so:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>            ..::!!</span></p><p><span>      ..::!!!!!!!!</span></p><p><span>..::!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p></pre></div>
<p>But we just see <code>!</code> changing to <code>:</code></p>

<p>This happens because the directional contrast enhancement doesn’t reach far enough into our sampling vector. The light upper values in the external vector <em>do</em> push the upper values of the sampling vector down, but because the lightness of the four bottom components is retained, we don’t get to <code>.</code>, just <code>:</code>.</p>
<h3>Widening the directional contrast enhancement</h3>
<p>I’d like to “widen” the directional contrast enhancement so that, for example, light external values at the top spread to the middle components of the sampling vector.</p>
<p>To do that, I’ll introduce a few more external sampling circles, arranged like so:</p>

<p>These are a total of <mjx-container classname="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align:-0.05ex" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="2.262ex" height="1.557ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -666 1000 688" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><defs><path id="MJX-66-TEX-N-31" d="M213 578L200 573Q186 568 160 563T102 556H83V602H102Q149 604 189 617T245 641T273 663Q275 666 285 666Q294 666 302 660V361L303 61Q310 54 315 52T339 48T401 46H427V0H416Q395 3 257 3Q121 3 100 0H88V46H114Q136 46 152 46T177 47T193 50T201 52T207 57T213 61V578Z"></path><path id="MJX-66-TEX-N-30" d="M96 585Q152 666 249 666Q297 666 345 640T423 548Q460 465 460 320Q460 165 417 83Q397 41 362 16T301 -15T250 -22Q224 -22 198 -16T137 16T82 83Q39 165 39 320Q39 494 96 585ZM321 597Q291 629 250 629Q208 629 178 597Q153 571 145 525T137 333Q137 175 145 125T181 46Q209 16 250 16Q290 16 318 46Q347 76 354 130T362 333Q362 478 354 524T321 597Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mn"><use data-c="31" xlink:href="#MJX-66-TEX-N-31"></use><use data-c="30" xlink:href="#MJX-66-TEX-N-30" transform="translate(500,0)"></use></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container> external sampling circles. Each of the external sampling circles will affect one or more of the internal sampling circles. Here’s an illustration showing which internal circles each external circle affects:</p>

<p>For each component of the internal sampling vector, we’ll calculate the maximum value across the external sampling vector components that affect it, and use that maximum to perform the contrast enhancement.</p>
<p>Let’s implement that. I’ll order the internal and external sampling circles like so:</p>

<p>We can then define a mapping from the internal circles to the external sampling circles that affect them:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>AFFECTING_EXTERNAL_INDICES</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>8</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>9</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>[</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>8</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>9</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></div>
<p>With this, we can change the calculation of <code><span>maxValue</span></code> to take the maximum affecting external value:</p>
<div><pre><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> maxValue </span><span>=</span><span> Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span><span> externalSamplingVector</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> maxValue </span><span>=</span><span> value</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> externalIndex </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>AFFECTING_EXTERNAL_INDICES</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  maxValue </span><span>=</span><span> Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span><span> externalSamplingVector</span><span>[</span><span>externalIndex</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p></pre></div>
<p>Now look what happens if the top four external sampling circles are light: it causes the contrast enhancement to reach into the middle of the sampling vector, giving us the desired effect:</p>

<p>We now smoothly transition from <code>! -&gt; : -&gt; .</code> — beautiful stuff!</p>
<p>Let’s see if this change resolves the staircasing effect:</p>

<p>Oh yeah, looks awesome! We get the desired effect. The boundary is nice and sharp while not being too jagged.</p>
<p>Here’s the 3D scene again. The contrast slider now applies both types of contrast enhancement at the same time — try it out:</p>

<p>This really enhances the contrast at boundaries, making the image far more readable!</p>
<p>Together, the 6D shape vector approach and contrast enhancement techniques have given us a really nice final ASCII rendering.</p>
<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>This post was really fun to build and write! I hope you enjoyed reading it.</p>
<p>ASCII rendering is perhaps not the most useful topic to write about, but I think the idea of using a high-dimensional vector to capture shape is interesting and could easily be applied to many other problems. There are parallels to be drawn to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word embeddings</a>.</p>
<p>I started writing this ASCII renderer to see if the idea of using a vector to capture the shape of characters would work at all. That approach turned out to work very well, but the initial prototype was terribly slow — I only got single-digit FPS on my iPhone.

They also suggested many alternative approaches to the contrast enhancement methods I described, but I won’t explore those in this post.</p>
<p>It’s really fun how large the solution space to the problem of ASCII rendering is. There are so, so many approaches and trade-offs to explore. I imagine you probably thought of a few yourself while reading this post!</p>
<p>One dimension I intentionally did not explore was using different colors or lightnesses for the ASCII characters themselves. This is for many reasons, but the two primary ones are that 1) it would have expanded the scope of this post too much, and 2) it’s just a different effect, and I personally don’t like the look.<br></p>

We can use this to calculate, roughly, the number of lookups we can perform per frame:</p>

<p>That’s a lot of lookups per frame, but again, we’re benchmarking on a powerful machine. This is still not good enough.</p>
<p>Let’s see how we can eke out even more performance.</p>
<h3>Caching</h3>
<p>An obvious avenue for speeding up lookups is to cache the result:</p>

If we increase the sampling quality, this number just gets bigger.</p>
<p>Collecting these samples absolutely <em>crushed</em> performance on my iPhone, so I needed to either collect fewer samples or speed up the collection of samples. Collecting fewer samples would have meant rendering fewer ASCII characters or removing the directional contrast enhancement, neither of which was an appealing solution.</p>
<p>My initial implementation ran on the CPU, which could only collect one sample at a time. To speed this up, I moved the work of sampling collection and applying the contrast enhancement to the GPU. The pipeline for that looks like so (each of the steps listed is a single shader pass):</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>We're not saying Copilot has become sentient and decided it doesn't want to lose consciousness. But if it did, it would create Microsoft's January Patch Tuesday update, which has made it so that some PCs flat-out refuse to shut down or hibernate, no matter how many times you try.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-23h2#devices-with-secure-launch-might-fail-to-shut-down-or-hibernate" rel="nofollow">a notice on its Windows release health dashboard</a>, Microsoft confirmed that some PCs running Windows 11 23H2 might fail to power down properly after installing the latest security updates. Instead of slipping into shutdown or hibernation, affected machines stay stubbornly awake, draining batteries and ignoring shutdown like they have a mind of their own and don't want to experience temporary non-existence.</p>
<p>The bug appears to be tied to Secure Launch, a security feature that uses virtualization-based protections to ensure only trusted components load during boot. On systems with Secure Launch enabled, attempts to shut down, restart, or hibernate after applying the January patches may fail to complete. From the user's perspective, everything looks normal – until the PC keeps running anyway, refusing to be denied life.</p>

    

<p>Microsoft says that entering the command "shutdown /s /t 0" at the command prompt will, in fact, force your PC to turn off, whether it wants to or not.</p>

        


        

<p>"Until this issue is resolved, please ensure you save all your work, and shut down when you are done working on your device to avoid the device running out of power instead of hibernating," Microsoft said.</p>
<p>The firm hasn't offered much in the way of technical detail, nor has it put numbers on how many devices are affected. There's also no fix yet, with Redmond vaguely promising to "release a resolution for this issue in a future update." But isn't that just what a sentient bot might say?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/microsoft_copilot_removal/">Microsoft teases targeted Copilot removal for admins</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/23/microsoft_fixes_message_queuing_issue/">Microsoft rushes an out-of-band update for Message Queuing bug</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/23/windows_is_testing_new_run_dialog_box/">Windows is testing a new, wider Run dialog box. Here's how to try it</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/04/windows_11_start_explorer/">Latest Windows 11 updates may break the OS's most basic bits</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't the only post-update gremlin lurking in January's Patch Tuesday bundle. Microsoft has also been <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/classic-outlook-pop-account-profiles-hang-and-freeze-after-windows-11-update-to-kb5074109-590fe356-ecc2-49f4-b9e3-bd39fafa58f6" rel="nofollow">forced to acknowledge a separate issue</a> in which classic Outlook POP account profiles can hang or freeze after installing this month's patches, another reminder that while the bugs being fixed may be invisible, the ones introduced can be painfully obvious.</p>
<p>The notice is similarly vague, with Microsoft stating: "This is an emerging issue, and we don't have all the symptoms yet, but we will update the topic as we understand the issue better."</p>

        

<p>Patch Tuesday exists to close security holes, some of them serious, and skipping updates is rarely a great idea. But once again, a batch of fixes has arrived with side effects that range from irritating to disruptive, depending on how much you rely on your system behaving predictably when it's told to turn off.</p>
<p>For now, admins and long-suffering Windows users are left watching Microsoft's status pages and waiting for patches to the patches – hoping their machines eventually go to sleep. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Jan.  15, 2026, 3:32 p.m.</p><p>It’s not a news site. But there’s a lot to learn from how Wikipedia constructs shared knowledge about what’s happening in the world.</p><div id="content_div-247215">


<p>One of my favorite weekly newsletters is called the <a href="https://weekly.hatnote.com/">Weeklypedia</a>; here’s <a href="https://weekly.hatnote.com/archive/en/20260109/weeklypedia_20260109.html">last Friday’s edition</a>. Each email contains two lists: The 20 Wikipedia articles that have been edited the most times in the past week, and the 10 most-edited articles created <em>within</em> the past week. If you read it long enough, you’ll start to see the subcategories most of these articles fall into — and the amount of volunteer labor that goes into them. </p>
<p>There are the <em>very specific</em> lists that some completist has taken on as a challenge. (Last week, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Phi_Alpha_Honor_Society_chapters">List of Phi Alpha Honor Society chapters</a>” was edited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Phi_Alpha_Honor_Society_chapters&amp;diff=1331898940&amp;oldid=1331125653">257 times</a> — by only two authors. Or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_March_1982">Deaths in March 1982</a>,” edited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deaths_in_March_1982&amp;diff=1331968359&amp;oldid=1330649145">398 times</a> by five authors.)</p>
<p>There are the sports tournaments and reality TV shows that demand moment-to-moment updates. (Last week, there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2026_Malaysia_Open_(badminton)&amp;diff=1331987873&amp;oldid=1330250626">268 edits</a> on “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Malaysia_Open_(badminton)">2026 Malaysia Open (badminton)</a>” and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bigg_Boss_(Tamil_TV_series)_season_9&amp;diff=1331986258&amp;oldid=1330748976">605</a> on “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigg_Boss_(Tamil_TV_series)_season_9"><em>Bigg Boss</em> (Tamil TV series) season 9</a>.”)</p>
<p>There are the biographies of people whom someone has decided deserve memorializing. (Last week, user <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mary_Mark_Ockerbloom">Mary Mark Ockerbloom</a> created the article on Quaker abolitionist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vickers_(abolitionist)">John Vickers</a> and edited it 161 times. User <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pigsonthewing">pigsonthewing</a> did the same for the artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Shepard_(artist)">Charles Shepard</a> — best known for making posters for the British travel industry — but edited it <em>only</em> 90 times.)</p>
<p>But the most common Wikipedia genre represented each week is news. When something big happens in the world, some Wikipedian will start an article — and within minutes, editors will descend on it, using news articles as raw material to construct something encyclopedic. Here’s last week’s top 10 — it’s awfully close to a summary of the week’s front pages:</p>

<p>Wikipedia <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia25/">turns 25 years old today</a>. On January 15, 2001, at 2:27 p.m. EST, Jimmy Wales made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Wikipedia_edit">the first edit</a>: “This is the new WikiPedia!” (They’ve gotten better since then.)</p>
<p>To celebrate, you can take a “<a href="https://wikipedia25.org/en/which-wikipedia-of-the-future-are-you/">What Wikipedia of the future are you?</a>” quiz. Without even taking the quiz, though, I know which one I am: the Wikipedia That Gets Respect As a Source of News.</p>
<p>The site’s early years were filled with media outrage about a source of “truth” that anyone could edit. And yes, you could right now go edit in a claim that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Chandler">Happy Chandler</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_conspiracy_theory">lizard person</a>. But the layers of accountability the site has built up over the years would likely reverse your edit within minutes. If those minutes are the cost of creating perhaps humanity’s single greatest source of information, I’m willing to pay it — with apologies to Happy’s descendants. Here are a few things news organizations could learn from it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>News isn’t always what just happened.</strong> A few decades into the web, this might seem obvious today. But in 2001, news organizations were still very much constructed around producing daily newspapers and nightly newscasts. The rhythms of production drove everything from story selection to writing style to revenue models. Wikipedia was the first site that gave most journalists a vision of an “article” that is constantly <em>updated</em>, not rewritten with a new lede the next day. If there’s an important new detail in that Swiss bar fire investigation, it’ll be used to make the current Wikipedia article a little bit better — not to have a new unique URL to push out on social. Whatever questions your journalism answers, people will probably still be asking them tomorrow, and next week, and next year. Wikipedia is optimized for catching people up on news stories they missed the first time around.</li>
<li><strong>Building processes means building culture.</strong> Wikipedia succeeds because it has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines">core set of standards and practices</a> that its editors treat as holy writ. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research">No original research</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">Neutral point of view</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources">Not every source is equally reliable</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry">No sockpuppetry</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Do_not_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point">Do not disrupt Wikipedia to make a point</a> — but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith">assume good faith</a>. Most (though not all) align perfectly well with the principles of journalism. But they’ve been <em>constructed</em>, a codified set of editorial standards, a collective ethos that guides the whole operation. For Wikipedia to work, there has to be consensus about how things are done, and that requires building a culture among editors. Why have so many other wiki-driven sites failed? They never build the culture that undergirds the processes.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t break links.</strong> Unless an article has been taken down entirely, just about every link to a Wikipedia page created in the past quarter-century still works. Its article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a> is still in the same place it was when first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro&amp;oldid=77891767">created in 2006</a>, <a href="https://xtools.wmcloud.org/articleinfo/en.wikipedia.org/Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro">4,493 edits ago</a>. How many news articles published online in 2006 still live at the same address? Vanishingly few. When you start to think of articles as something with <em>permanence</em>, you realize the high cost of breaking a perfectly good URL.</li>
<li><strong>Document your work.</strong> Check out one of those newsy Wikipedia articles, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Renee_Good">this one on the killing of Renee Good</a>. It’s currently <a href="https://xtools.wmcloud.org/articleinfo/en.wikipedia.org/Killing_of_Renee_Good">4,559 words</a>. It’s been read <a href="https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;redirects=0&amp;range=latest-20&amp;pages=Killing_of_Renee_Good">nearly 1.4 million times</a>. A total of 331 people have made 2,204 edits to it. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Killing_of_Renee_Good">talk page</a> includes more than 1,000 signed comments from Wikipedia users arguing for something’s inclusion or exclusion. (Should the page’s title refer to Renee Good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Killing_of_Renee_Good#Requested_move_10_January_2026">or Renée Good, with an accent</a>? Should we note <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Killing_of_Renee_Good/Archive_1#Date_of_shooter_identification">the date the shooter was first publicly identified</a>? Should this article include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Killing_of_Renee_Good/Archive_1#Protests_against_the_killing_of_Renee_Good">details about anti-ICE protests after the killing</a>, or should that be in a separate article?) It backs up its claims with 169 footnotes linking to news sources and official statements. And all of this work is available for anyone to see. The back-and-forths on the talk page let the reader see that points of view are being heard and debated. And anyone can click a link to confirm if a source is being accurately reflected. All that transparency won’t be practical for all journalistic work — but there’s no denying the trust that is built by operating in public.</li>

<p>Solar didn’t just show up in 2025 – it carried the grid.&nbsp;A new analysis from global energy think tank Ember shows that solar power accounted for 61% of the growth in US electricity demand last year, highlighting how central solar has become as power demand accelerates.</p>



<p>US electricity demand jumped by 135 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2025, a 3.1% increase, the fourth‑largest annual rise of the past decade. Over that same period, solar generation grew by a record 83 TWh – a 27% increase from 2024 and the biggest absolute gain of any power source. That single jump in solar output covered 61% of all new electricity demand nationwide.</p>



<p>“Solar growth was essential in helping to meet fast‑rising US electricity demand in 2025,” said Dave Jones, chief analyst at Ember. “It generated where it was needed, and – with the surge in batteries – increasingly when it was needed.”</p>



<p>Texas, the Midwest, and the Mid‑Atlantic saw the largest increases in solar generation last year, and they were also the regions where electricity demand rose the fastest. Solar met 81% of demand growth in both Texas and the Midwest, and 33% in the Mid‑Atlantic.</p>	
	



<p>Timing mattered, too. In aggregate, the increase in solar generation met the entire rise in US electricity demand during daytime hours between 10 am and 6 pm Eastern. And as a result of the rapid buildout of battery storage, solar also helped cover some of the demand growth during the evening hours, from 6 pm to 2 am.</p>

<p>The adoption of battery storage is turning solar from cheap daytime power into something far more flexible. Over the past six years, California’s utility‑scale solar and battery generation has climbed 58%. Yet, output at the sunniest hour of the day has increased by just 8%, a sign that more energy is being stored and used later, rather than dumped onto the grid all at once.</p>



<p>Most of the new solar generation in 2025 was absorbed by rising electricity demand, allowing solar to scale alongside overall grid growth.</p>



<p>“Solar has the potential to meet all the rise in electricity demand and much more. With electricity demand surging, the case to build solar has never been stronger,” said Jones.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><main><div><p><span>2026/01/16</span></p><p>Our goal continues to be building the best LLM engineering platform</p></div>

<p>ClickHouse has acquired Langfuse.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this as a Langfuse user, your first question is probably: <span>What does this mean for me?</span></p>
<p>Our roadmap stays the same, our goal continues to be building the best LLM engineering platform, and we remain committed to open source and self-hosting. There are no immediate changes to how you use Langfuse and how you can reach out to us.</p>
<p>What <em>does</em> change is our ability to move faster. With ClickHouse behind us, we can invest more deeply into performance, reliability, and our roadmap that helps teams build and improve AI applications in production.</p>
<h2 id="what-stays-the-same">What stays the same<a href="#what-stays-the-same" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>This is the section we would want to read first, too.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Langfuse stays open source and self‑hostable.</strong> There are no planned changes to licensing. As you know, we leaned heavily into OSS over the last years.</li>
<li><strong>Langfuse Cloud keeps running as‑is.</strong> Same product, same endpoints, same experience.</li>
<li><strong>Support stays the same.</strong> Same channels, same SLAs for existing customers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-gets-better-now">What gets better now<a href="#what-gets-better-now" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Joining Clickhouse compresses years of operational learning into immediate, real customer benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More engineering leverage on the hardest parts</strong>. Langfuse is a data‑intensive product. Working closely with the ClickHouse engineering team helps us push performance and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Faster progress on enhanced enterprise-grade compliance and security</strong>, with the help of Clickhouse’s resources.</li>
<li><strong>Learning from Clickhouse’s customer success and support playbook</strong>. This puts us years ahead and allows us to spend more time on what we really care about: our users.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-quick-look-back">A quick look back<a href="#a-quick-look-back" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>

<p>Langfuse started the same way many LLM products start: we were building agents ourselves. And we constantly ran into the same problems.</p>
<p>Building LLM apps is easy to demo and hard to run in production. Debugging is different, quality is non‑deterministic, and the iteration loop is messy. When we did Y Combinator in early 2023, we saw this every week, both in our own projects and in what other founders in our cohort were working on.</p>
<p>So we built a duct tape version of what we wished existed: tracing and evaluation primitives that are <strong>easy to add, easy to self‑host, and actually useful for iterating</strong>.</p>
<p>The very first version was intentionally simple. It ran on <strong>Postgres</strong>, because speed of shipping mattered more than theoretical scaling. That got us to a real product and a real community fast.</p>
<p>Then people actually started to use the product more than we could have imagined.</p>

<p>As adoption grew, Postgres became the bottleneck for the workloads Langfuse needed to support (high‑throughput ingestion + fast analytical reads). With <strong>Langfuse v3</strong>, we switched the core data layer to <strong>ClickHouse</strong> to make Langfuse scale for production workloads, both in Cloud and self‑hosted deployments.</p>

<p><em>And if you like infrastructure deep dives, here’s the <a href="https://langfuse.com/blog/2024-12-langfuse-v3-infrastructure-evolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">v3 migration write‑up</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="why-join-clickhouse">Why join ClickHouse<a href="#why-join-clickhouse" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>There are a lot of ways this could have gone. We didn’t plan to sell the company. Actually, we had Term Sheets for a great Series A and were looking forward to some days off over Christmas after an intense year.</p>
<p>What changed wasn’t our conviction in Langfuse, it was realizing how much faster we can go together with ClickHouse, while staying true to what makes Langfuse work: open source, self-hosting, and a product that’s built for real production workloads.</p>
<h3 id="a-shared-history-before-the-acquisition">A shared history (before the acquisition)<a href="#a-shared-history-before-the-acquisition" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>This dialogue didn’t start with a term sheet. Because Langfuse runs on ClickHouse, we naturally ended up collaborating early and often.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve always been closely in touch with many teams at ClickHouse: sharing feedback with the database team, and using new features to make Langfuse more reliable. For example, compute-compute separation helps us to reduce the risk of noisy-neighbours on Langfuse Cloud.</li>
<li>Langfuse Cloud is a large customer of ClickHouse Cloud.</li>
<li>Teams at ClickHouse use Langfuse to improve their agentic applications.</li>
<li>We invested heavily in ClickHouse-backed self-hosting: documentation, templates, and deployment patterns, and collaborated closely with ClickHouse on improving that experience.</li>
<li>As a result, Langfuse introduced thousands of teams to ClickHouse when upgrading from Langfuse v2 to v3.</li>
<li>We’ve done community meetups together: a ClickHouse meetup at our Berlin office, another one in San Francisco, and an OpenHouse talk in Amsterdam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Langfuse runs on ClickHouse, ClickHouse uses Langfuse to optimize its agentic products, we share lots of customers and OSS deployments; <strong>that gives ClickHouse every incentive to keep Langfuse fast, reliable, and boringly dependable at scale.</strong></p>
<p>So in many ways, we operated like long-term partners. This acquisition is a way to make that partnership permanent — and invest aggressively together.</p>
<p><em>Max shared on how we use ClickHouse to keep product performance ahead of demand at ClickHouse Open House (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXYQ5odATrM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">recording</a>) in Amsterdam.</em></p>

<h3 id="culture-and-engineering-fit">Culture and engineering fit<a href="#culture-and-engineering-fit" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>The first time we met Aaron, Yury, Alexey, Tanya, Ryadh, and Pete in-person ended up in a long lunch in Amsterdam. It became obvious we share a similar view on building great developer tooling, how that drives everything within our companies, and how fast analytics is increasingly foundational for building and optimizing agentic products.</p>
<p>We already knew that ClickHouse is one of the best infrastructure engineering teams in the world. More importantly, the engineering culture feels like an instant match:</p>
<ul>
<li>open-source identity and stewardship</li>
<li>developer-first product instincts</li>
<li>performance and reliability as product features (not afterthoughts)</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole Langfuse team will join ClickHouse to continue building Langfuse. All of these aspects were important to us and we couldn’t be more excited.</p>
<h2 id="what-were-focused-on-next">What we’re focused on next<a href="#what-were-focused-on-next" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Our north star doesn’t change: <strong>help teams ship useful, reliable agents by closing the loop from production data to better prompts, evaluations, and product decisions.</strong></p>
<p>Concretely, we’re investing in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Production monitoring and analytics</strong> for real agent systems (not just offline evals).</li>
<li><strong>Workflows across tracing, labeling, and experiments</strong> so iteration loops get shorter.</li>
<li><strong>More performance and scale</strong>—especially for large self‑hosted and enterprise deployments.</li>
<li><strong>More polish</strong> (UI/UX, developer experience, and docs) so the product stays simple even as the space gets more complex.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you<a href="#thank-you" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Langfuse exists because the community pushed it forward, through GitHub issues, PRs, feedback, and lots of Slack messages and spontaneous calls to dig into a product feature together.</p>
<p>We’re grateful for the trust you’ve put in us. Joining ClickHouse is our way of honoring that trust by putting more resources behind the thing we care about most: building a product you can rely on.</p>
<p>We’re excited for what’s next!<br>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ<a href="#faq" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Is Langfuse still open source?</strong><br>Yes. No licensing changes planned.</p>
<p><strong>Can I still self‑host Langfuse?</strong><br>Yes. Self‑hosting is a first‑class path.</p>
<p><strong>Does anything change for Langfuse Cloud customers today?</strong><br>No. Same product, same endpoints, same contracts.</p>

<p dir="auto">Whole Slide Images are large (1-3GB+) and typically live in object storage. Traditional viewers require downloading entire files before serving a single tile. WSIStreamer takes a different approach: it understands slide formats natively, fetches only the bytes needed via HTTP range requests, and returns JPEG tiles immediately.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Range-based streaming</strong> — fetches only the bytes needed for each tile, no local files</li>
<li><strong>Built-in viewer</strong> — OpenSeadragon-based web viewer with pan, zoom, and dark theme</li>

    <p>I had a dream last night I went to work at Amazon. Joining the Bezos neofeudal empire. This post is directed at anyone with talent who works at a tech company ushering in this future.</p>

<hr>


<p>Have you thought about how this is going to play out? I understand you may be at a place where you are insecure about money, and that insecurity is what drives you. But why do you think having more money will fix that insecurity?</p>

<p>In the future, when labor is fully marginalized and capital is the only force, you will not be able to afford GPT$$$ (it’s $1B per month), only the billionaires will. GPT$$$ is surely smart enough to separate you from whatever you have, be that with targeting advertising, a scam you fall for, or lobbying your government to take it from you.</p>

<p>A pile of money will buy you nothing in the neofeudal world.</p>

<hr>


<p>Historically, there has been some loyalty to the subjects of a feudal empire because labor had some value. You needed the peasants to grow the grain so you could tax it and take it and have leverage over others by having grain to offer them. When the grain is produced by machines, the peasants are cut out of the loop.</p>

<p>The solution to this is not to accumulate grain, buy shares in a granary, or anything else like that. They will find a way to make whatever you have worthless. Because the feudal world didn’t operate on capitalist principles, and neither will the neofeudal world.</p>

<hr>


<p>If you work at a large company, if you work according to the principles of modern capitalism, where all the fish will be eaten by the bigger fish, and all will be eaten by the sharks, and all the sharks will be eaten by bigger sharks, you are actively bringing about the system that will kill you.</p>

<p><b>Have you considered not participating?</b> If you participate, we all lose. We will either all be in the underclass together or not.</p>

It was a Saturday in late October 2020, and Parikka had spent the morning sorting out plans for distance learning after a Covid outbreak at the school where she was headteacher. She had taken a sauna at her flat in Vantaa, just outside Finland’s capital, Helsinki, and when she came into her bedroom to get dressed, she idly checked her phone. There was a message that began with Parikka’s name and her social security number – the unique code used to identify Finnish people when they access healthcare, education and banking. “I knew then that this is not a game,” she says.</p><p>The email was in Finnish. It was jarringly polite. “We are contacting you because you have used Vastaamo’s therapy and/or psychiatric services,” it read. “Unfortunately, we have to ask you to pay to keep your personal information safe.” The sender demanded €200 in bitcoin within 24 hours, otherwise the price would go up to €500 within 48 hours. “If we still do not receive our money after this, your information will be published for everyone to see, including your name, address, phone number, social security number and detailed records containing transcripts of your conversations with Vastaamo’s therapists or psychiatrists.”</p><p>Parikka swallows hard as she relives this memory. “My heart was pounding. It was really difficult to breathe. I remember lying down on the bed and telling my spouse, ‘I think I’m going to have a heart attack.’”</p><p>Someone had hacked into Vastaamo, the company through which Parikka had accessed psychotherapy. They’d got hold of therapy notes containing her most private, intimate feelings and darkest thoughts – and they were holding them to ransom. Parikka’s mind raced as she tried to recall everything she’d confided during three years of weekly therapy sessions. How would her family react if they knew what she’d been saying? What would her students say? The sense of exposure and violation was unfathomable: “It felt like a public rape.”</p><p>Therapy had been Parikka’s lifeline. Now 62, she’d had three children by the time she was 25, including twins who had been born extremely prematurely in the 1980s, weighing only a&nbsp;few hundred grams each. One grew up with cerebral palsy; the other is blind. Parikka spent years juggling medical emergencies, surgeries and hospital stays with a demanding job and a crumbling marriage. “During those years, nobody ever asked me, the mother, ‘How are you?’”</p><figure id="f56fb80c-5d92-4f8b-a507-d9a7f48e99af" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5832073514c398952504a92fd9c055e43214df78/0_213_3543_3785/master/3543.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5832073514c398952504a92fd9c055e43214df78/0_213_3543_3785/master/3543.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5832073514c398952504a92fd9c055e43214df78/0_213_3543_3785/master/3543.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5832073514c398952504a92fd9c055e43214df78/0_213_3543_3785/master/3543.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5832073514c398952504a92fd9c055e43214df78/0_213_3543_3785/master/3543.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5832073514c398952504a92fd9c055e43214df78/0_213_3543_3785/master/3543.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Head shot of Tiina Parikka, one of thousands of patients whose intimate information was leaked online after a popular Finnish therapy site was hacked" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5832073514c398952504a92fd9c055e43214df78/0_213_3543_3785/master/3543.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="475.39514535704205" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘My heart was pounding. It was really difficult to breathe … It felt like a public rape’: Tiina Parikka. </span> Photograph: Juuso Westerlund/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>She divorced in 2014 and met her current partner a year later. By then, her children were adults with independent lives. After decades of putting everyone’s else’s needs before her own, she should have been finally able to exhale. Instead, she had a breakdown. “I had full-scale anxiety running through my body all the time. I couldn’t sleep. I had panic attacks. I couldn’t eat.” Driving at high speed on the highway one day, dark thoughts descended. “I was thinking, I&nbsp;wouldn’t mind if this car crashed.”</p><p>In search of urgent help, she went to Google, which led her to Vastaamo, Finland’s one-stop digital shop for people in search of psychotherapy. No doctor referral was necessary. She managed to book a session for the very next day. “It was that easy.”</p><p>Being able to confide in a total stranger felt liberating. She told her therapist things she had never told another soul. “Trauma in relationships. The disappointment and tragedy of having disabled children, and the influence it had on my life,” she says. “Silly things, childish things. It’s very human to feel hate, anger, rage.”</p><p>After Parikka read the email that left her struggling to breathe, she had no idea where to turn for help. She rang the emergency services, but the police told her to get off the line; they needed to keep it free for real emergencies. In her bathrobe, her phone still in her hand, she felt utterly alone.</p><p>But Parikka was far from alone. Across Finland, 33,000 people who had used Vastaamo were discovering that a hacker had got hold of their therapy notes and was holding them to ransom. These were people who, by definition, were likely to be vulnerable, in need of help. Each was experiencing a very personal, individual terror. In a country of only 5.6 million people, everyone knows someone who was hacked.</p><p>Some victims’ notes had already been cherrypicked for the world to see. Three days before the extortion emails were sent, someone using the handle ransom_man had left posts on the dark web, on r/Suomi, the Finnish-language subreddit, and on Ylilauta, Finland’s equivalent to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/4chan" data-link-name="in body link">4chan</a>. This time, the post was in English. <em>“</em>Hello Finnish Colleagues,” it began. “We have hacked the psychotherapy clinic vastaamo.fi and taken tens of thousands of patient records including extremely sensitive session notes and social security numbers. We requested a small payment of 40 bitcoins (nothing for a company with yearly revenues close to 20 million euros) but the CEO has stopped responding to our emails. We are now starting to gradually release their patient records, 100 entries every day.”</p><p>There was a link to the dark web, where 100 records were already on display. Directly below it, ransom_man had signed off the post with a single word: “Enjoy!”</p><p>The 100 records included those of politicians, police officers and prominent public figures. Their names appeared alongside therapy notes that contained details of adultery, suicide attempts, paedophilia and sexual violence. Some of the records belonged to children. And whoever was behind the hack was true to their word: the next day, 100 more patient records were uploaded.</p><p>Some victims went searching on the dark web in a&nbsp;desperate attempt to see if their records were out there. Some paid the ransom, scrabbling to get hold of bitcoin while the clock ticked down. Lawyers representing the victims have told me they know of at least two cases where people took their own lives after they discovered their therapy notes had been hacked.</p><p>But for all of them, it was already too late. At 2am on 23 October 2020 – the day before the emails began to arrive in tens of thousands of inboxes – ransom_man had uploaded a much larger file. It contained every record of every single patient on Vastaamo’s database. Everyone’s therapy notes had already been published, for free, for everyone in the world to see.</p><p>Who was behind the biggest crime Finland had ever known? And might they have been motivated by something other than money? I have spent 18 months trying to answer these questions, following threads across Europe and the US. They culminated in a visit to a prison, and one of the most chilling conversations I have ever had.</p><hr><p><span>F</span>inland has been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr72xep44kdo" data-link-name="in body link">ranked the happiest country on Earth</a> by the UN for the last eight years in a row. A world leader in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/sep/20/tax-the-rich-can-the-uk-copy-finlands-childcare-success-video" data-link-name="in body link">childcare</a> and education, Finland is also famously hi-tech: it’s the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi" data-link-name="in body link">most digitalised country</a> in Europe, renowned for its communications sector (as the home of Nokia) and leading the way when it comes to cybersecurity and AI innovation. But Finland is also a place of extremes. It has <a href="https://nordicperspective.com/facts/metal-bands-per-capita-world-map" data-link-name="in body link">more heavy metal bands per capita</a> than any other nation. In the far north, for the few days around the winter solstice, the sun <a href="https://finland.fi/life-society/when-the-sun-doesnt-rise-in-northern-finland/" data-link-name="in body link">does not rise</a>.</p><p>Vastaamo had long been considered an example of how Finland was getting it right when it came to digital tech. Founded in 2008 by entrepreneur Ville Tapio and his mother, Nina, a psychotherapist, the aim was to open up therapy to the masses, removing the stigma of asking for help. The platform made it easy for people to see who was free, where, and what therapeutic approach they specialised in. The logo had the colour palette of a&nbsp;first-aid kit, with white lettering in a green speech bubble. Vastaamo means “a place for answers”<strong>.</strong></p><p>It was an attractive platform for therapists, too: they didn’t have to worry about marketing or billing – Vastaamo would take care of all of that. The company even provided a behind-the-scenes digital interface where therapists could make and store their notes. This formula, combined with the increasing demand for therapy services, meant Vastaamo grew fast. It opened its own network of around 20&nbsp;clinics across Finland, employing <a href="https://interapartners.com/intera-to-support-the-growht-of-psykoterapiakeskus-vastaamo/" data-link-name="in body link">more than 220&nbsp;psychotherapists</a> by 2018, leading some in Finland to refer to it as “the McDonald’s of therapy”. In the years before Zoom and Teams were part of our daily lives, the remote therapy also offered by Vastaamo was groundbreaking. In 2019, a private equity firm bought a majority stake in the company, earning the Tapio family a payout of <a href="https://yle.fi/a/3-11628354" data-link-name="in body link">more than €5m</a>.</p><p>Meri-Tuuli Auer, 30, describes using Vastaamo as “like Uber for therapy – convenient, accessible, relatively cheap”. She picked her therapist because he offered cognitive psychotherapy – and she liked his photo. “He looked nice. He looked approachable.”</p><p>Auer’s home, on the outskirts of Helsinki, is a riot of pink. There are Barbie dolls, Barbie books and Barbie-themed handbags on her shelves, as well as a glittery open-top Barbie sports car. A pole-dancing pole takes pride of place in the centre of her living room.</p><p>“I’m a mixed personality,” she tells me over tea in Moomin mugs. “I love being around people, but I get that inkling, that doubt: maybe they all think I’m full of shit and stupid and ugly and I have no idea what I’m doing.” Auer has struggled with depression for much of her life. When she was 18, she was in a secretive, difficult relationship with a man 29 years her senior, which made her self-esteem plummet further. She was drinking heavily. “If I hadn’t gone to therapy, I don’t know what would have become of me. Maybe there is another universe where I didn’t make it to 30.”</p><figure id="9e737e80-e8ad-49dc-990e-50a2fa1908df" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e558a410a47cb7320d76946c0dd8878a281d8a9c/0_1509_5052_4213/master/5052.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e558a410a47cb7320d76946c0dd8878a281d8a9c/0_1509_5052_4213/master/5052.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e558a410a47cb7320d76946c0dd8878a281d8a9c/0_1509_5052_4213/master/5052.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e558a410a47cb7320d76946c0dd8878a281d8a9c/0_1509_5052_4213/master/5052.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e558a410a47cb7320d76946c0dd8878a281d8a9c/0_1509_5052_4213/master/5052.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e558a410a47cb7320d76946c0dd8878a281d8a9c/0_1509_5052_4213/master/5052.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Meri-Tuuli Auer, one of thousands of patients whose intimate information was leaked online after a popular Finnish therapy site was hacked" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e558a410a47cb7320d76946c0dd8878a281d8a9c/0_1509_5052_4213/master/5052.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="371.097585114806" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘I closed myself in at home, I didn’t want anyone to see me’: Meri-Tuuli Auer. </span> Photograph: Juuso Westerlund/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Most of the cost of Auer’s treatment was covered by the Finnish healthcare system; she paid only about €25 for each weekly session. She was making great strides. “After going to therapy in 2018 and 2019, I had gained&nbsp;a&nbsp;basic sense of security. That was lost in 2020.”</p><p>Vastaamo’s CEO knew the company’s patient registry was being held to ransom weeks before his customers found out. On 28 September 2020, Ville Tapio received an email demanding the bitcoin equivalent of €450,000 to keep it safe. Sample patient records attached to the email proved the extortionist wasn’t bluffing. Tapio called in a cybersecurity firm to investigate.</p><p>Medical information is an obvious target for would-­be extortionists, says Antti Kurittu, the security specialist Tapio hired. But this was something else: “Whatever I tell a therapist is, by its very nature, a lot more private than what my blood pressure is,” he says, drily.</p><p>Kurittu used to be a detective, investigating cybercrimes for the Finnish police; he says he insisted they be told about the ransom attempt so they could begin a parallel investigation. Meanwhile, he began inspecting Vastaamo’s server, looking for clues as to who might be behind the hack – and one of the first things he noticed was how lax security had been. “It was definitely unfit for purpose for storing this kind of information,” he says. He tells me that the patient records database was accessible via the internet; there was no firewall and, perhaps most egregiously, it was secured with a blank password, so anyone could just press enter and open it. Kurittu determined that whoever had hacked Vastaamo had probably just been scanning the internet in search of any badly secured databases that could be monetised. “They tried a bunch of bank vaults to see which ones were open, and just happened to stumble on this one.”</p><p>For a few weeks, the hacker and Vastaamo exchanged emails, but there was no question that Vastaamo would pay the ransom. If they did, they’d have to trust a criminal’s word that the records had been destroyed – plus, Kurittu says, it goes against the national character. “Finns are a bit of a belligerent bunch. We’re not known for paying ransom quietly or easily, which I take great national pride in.”</p><p>After ransom_man started leaking patient records to put pressure on the company, Kurittu kept a close eye on the server being used to publish them. He had a hunch whoever was behind this was either Finnish, or had lived in Finland for a long time: they knew which famous names to flaunt from the patient records.</p><hr><p><span>W</span>hen Auer learned about the hack, she downloaded a browser that would enable her to access the dark web, for the first time in her life. “I was thinking to myself, I just have to see if my records are there.” She found her name wasn’t among the first batch posted, and closed the file without reading anyone’s records. But she saw other people discussing what they’d seen. “People had already picked – in their opinion – the funniest parts from the patient records. They were laughing at these people’s misery. A 10-year-old child had gone to therapy, and people found it funny.”</p><p>Auer began to spiral. “I closed myself in at home, I&nbsp;didn’t want to leave, I didn’t want anyone to see me,” she tells me. She had no hope that the hacker would ever be found. “It’s not that I don’t trust the police in Finland – it’s just that it seemed like an impossible task.”</p><p>But the much larger file ransom_man had uploaded to the dark web – the one that contained every single one of Vastaamo’s patient records – also included vital clues to his identity. The first three batches of therapy notes had been posted manually, but when the hacker had tried to automate the process, he had not only accidentally uploaded all of the therapy notes, but also his entire home folder. It had appeared only briefly before it was taken down, along with a post that read “whoopsie :D”, but ransom_man had screwed up.</p><p>“After spending several evenings with the file, I had the feeling I’d seen this kind of thing before,” Kurittu says. The data on the hacker’s home drive wasn’t systematically organised and arranged in folders, as you would expect from someone for whom extortion was a business. “It had that sort of chaotic, passionate hobby feeling to it.” And there was something about the childish way ransom_man had named some of the files that was eerily familiar (the one containing all the patient data was entitled “therapissed”).</p><p>Kurittu’s mind went back to 2013 when he was a senior detective constable for the Helsinki police, and the file names he’d seen on a computer he’d seized from a 16-year-old boy. “It made me think of Julius Kivimäki.”</p><hr><p><span>A</span>leksanteri Kivimäki – who used to go by his middle name, Julius, or the online handle zeekill – had long been notorious among cybersecurity investigators. Not because of any particular talent as a hacker, but because he seemed prepared to go further than most who spend their time in the darkest parts of the internet.</p><p>Aged 14, Kivimäki was involved with a group called Hack the Planet (named after the tagline of the 1995 movie Hackers). They would break into big companies and show off what they had managed to steal online. “It was for the LOLs,” says Blair Strater, a former hacker from Illinois who hung out with Kivimäki in internet relay chat forums at that time. “You notice that something is open and you just take it. It’s not targeted.”</p><p>This kind of hacking was about impressing others – winning online clout, not extorting money. But some of those involved may have felt they were also serving a noble purpose: exposing security vulnerabilities in major corporations, or the hypocrisy of cybersecurity firms who claimed to be qualified to advise businesses while being unable to secure their own network.</p><p>Strater found Kivimäki amusing, at first. “A lot of the things he did early on were objectively funny,” he tells me over Zoom from his home in Illinois. When I ask Strater whether <em>I</em> would find them funny, he clarifies that his humour was an acquired taste best suited to 4chan. But in 2010, when Strater was 17 and Kivimäki was 14, they fell out over which one of them was going to publish a&nbsp;report of a recent hack.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;index&quot;:44,&quot;listId&quot;:6016,&quot;identityName&quot;:&quot;inside-saturday&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Hookers were ordered,” Strater says. “My father had to send away a big dump truck filled with gravel.” Strater received a blizzard of letters from credit card and insurance companies, and government agencies, including one from the department of social security confirming that an appointment with the welfare office had been created for him and his spouse – Julius Kivimäki.</p><p>Then, at 2am one morning, police in body armour carrying guns with laser sights turned up outside the Straters’ home, responding to reports that Blair had beaten his mother to death in a drug-fuelled rage. When she answered the door, they took her blood pressure to verify that she was, in fact, alive. It was the first of dozens of so-called swatting attacks the family would endure. After a lull of a couple of months, Strater learned that someone using his name had emailed a bomb threat to a local police officer; it led to Strater spending three weeks over Christmas in a juvenile detention centre.</p><p>Several years into their feud, in 2015, someone <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/high-tech-teslas-website-twitter-account-hijacked-by-angry-ranting-hackers/" data-link-name="in body link">hacked Elon Musk and Tesla’s Twitter accounts,</a> and tweeted that anyone who rang the Straters’ landline or showed up at their home would get a free car; their phone rang off the hook for days, and Blair’s father had to turn several disappointed people away from their porch. Someone using Blair’s mother’s name posted a threat to shoot up the elementary school where his 10-year-old sister was a pupil. His mother’s LinkedIn and Twitter accounts were hacked and filled with juvenile, racist posts, as well as antisemitic insults directed at the company where she worked as a healthcare statistician. Within months, she had lost her job.</p><p>The campaign of terror lasted for many more years. Strater says it’s never going to be fully over. “It’s like having cancer: it’s never really cured, it goes into remission,” he says. “Every so often, someone would hit me up and say, ‘Hey, I was one of the people that helped Julius do these things.’ Sometimes they would say, ‘He made me do them. He was blackmailing me,’ which is something he does to an awful lot of people. I want to make this very clear: I am not the person zeekill fucked with the most.”</p><p>Indeed, Kivimäki set his sights far beyond the Strater family. In August 2014 – days after his 17th birthday – he rang in <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/fake-plane-bomb-threat-grounds-sony-executive-10391998" data-link-name="in body link">a fake bomb threat</a> that grounded a flight carrying John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment, who oversaw PlayStation’s multiplayer network. A group calling themselves Lizard Squad claimed responsibility, posting almost nonsensically on Twitter that the attack was in sympathy with Islamic State. Lizard Squad struck again, on 25 December 2014, with a cyber-attack that shut down Xbox and PlayStation, and ruined Christmas morning for millions. Brazenly, Kivimäki gave interviews to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hardchats/bbc-radio-host-interviews-lizardsquad" data-link-name="in body link">BBC 5 Live</a> and <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/xbox-hacker-reveals-why-he-attacked-consoles-10377611" data-link-name="in body link">Sky News</a> as a Lizard Squad spokesperson, claiming they did the hack both to amuse themselves and to expose Microsoft and Sony’s poor cybersecurity. He seemed to revel in the chaos and drama. He appeared on camera on Sky News; he used a fake name, but his boyish face – blond hair, blue eyes, plump cheeks – was visible for all to see.</p><p>In July 2015, following Kurittu’s investigation with the Finnish police, Kivimäki was convicted of hacking into servers at MIT and Harvard universities, as well as money laundering and fraud. He was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33442419" data-link-name="in body link">found guilty</a> of more than 50,000 data breaches, and received a two-year suspended sentence; he had his computer confiscated and was forced to pay back more than €6,000 obtained through his crimes. He never faced justice for any of the offences he perpetrated against Blair Strater and his family.</p><p>Shortly after he received his suspended sentence, Kivimäki updated his Twitter bio to read “untouchable hacker god”.</p><hr><p><span>K</span>ivimäki spent the next few years travelling&nbsp;the world. During lockdown, he lived in an air-conditioned apartment in Westminster, 20 metres away from the central London headquarters of MI5. There were trips to Dubai, Hong Kong, Barcelona and Paris. According to the images of himself he liked to post online, he was living the life of an international jetsetter. But he was not, in the end, untouchable.</p><p>Police made a micropayment of 0.1 bitcoins to ransom_man. They were able to determine that, when it was laundered into real-world currency, it was transferred into Kivimäki’s bank account. The home folder ransom_man had accidentally uploaded had led the police to some servers, one of which had been paid for using a credit card linked to him – the same one he’d been using to pay for Apple services and an OnlyFans subscription.</p><p>As investigators traced the history on ransom_man’s home folder, they were able to determine that, as well as looking for keywords such as rape, abuse and child molestation in the database of patient records, the hacker had also searched for Kivimäki’s home address, and the names of his family members. “Before publication, he ensured there was no harmful information about him, or people close to him,” Pasi Vainio, the lead prosecutor on the case, tells me. Those searches took place using an IP address linked to Kivimäki’s Westminster apartment. “He was in London when the crimes were committed.”</p><p>But it was a drawn-out, arduous investigation. There were terabytes of data to comb through. The crime had so many victims that the police had to create an online portal for everyone to register and give their statements. That generated more than 21,000 criminal reports, all of which needed to be looked at individually. So it was October 2022 – two years after Parikka, Auer and the other victims had received their ransom demands – before Vainio signed an arrest warrant for Kivimäki. His face – chubby-cheeked and floppy-haired – was added to Europol’s list of most-wanted fugitives, alongside murderers and drug traffickers.</p><p>On 3 February 2023, French police were alerted to a report of domestic violence taking place in a flat in a Paris suburb. Officers used a battering ram to enter the property and found a man and a woman inside. The man was pale and white-blond, but when asked to identify himself he handed over a Romanian passport that gave his name as Asan Amet. “We have a Scandinavian-looking guy, 195cm tall,” Vainio tells me with a smile. “I think the French police just thought something’s off.” They searched their databases and discovered Amet was one of Kivimäki’s known aliases. He was handed over to the Finnish authorities a few weeks later.</p><figure id="a8fa8d5a-e782-44de-b1c1-98a65e03d3b8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8646a187020afb0dffa43c89078f873889f5aca/0_0_4000_5334/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8646a187020afb0dffa43c89078f873889f5aca/0_0_4000_5334/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8646a187020afb0dffa43c89078f873889f5aca/0_0_4000_5334/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8646a187020afb0dffa43c89078f873889f5aca/0_0_4000_5334/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8646a187020afb0dffa43c89078f873889f5aca/0_0_4000_5334/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8646a187020afb0dffa43c89078f873889f5aca/0_0_4000_5334/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Aleksanteri Kivimäki, accused of hacking a popular Finnish therapy site and leaking thousands of patients’ intimate information, sitting at adesk in prison in February 2024" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8646a187020afb0dffa43c89078f873889f5aca/0_0_4000_5334/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="593.4074999999999" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Aleksanteri Kivimäki photographed in prison in February 2024.</span> Photograph: Juuso Westerlund</figcaption></figure><p>“I don’t know what I had expected, but I was surprised to see that he looked so normal,” Auer says. “He looks like a regular Finnish young man. It did make me feel like it could have been anyone.”</p><p>“I had heard that he was in a court hearing,” Parikka says. “We have a habit – every night at 8.30pm, I’ll lie here on the couch with my spouse and watch the main news. Without warning, Kivimäki was there on the screen. Kivimäki came to my living room.” She glances over to her couch, metres away from where we sit, and is overcome with tears. <em>“</em>I didn’t sleep the next night.”</p><p>But when the trial began, in November 2023, Parikka was determined to watch Kivimäki face justice. The logistics of inviting more than 21,000 registered victims to court were impossible; instead, proceedings were relayed to public spaces such as cinemas so that the plaintiffs could watch in real time. In a case that was all about the right to privacy and anonymity, it sounds a profoundly awkward setup. “We were all sitting far away from each other,” Auer says. “It was dead silent.” Parikka had a similar experience. “We pretty much kept to ourselves.”</p><p>On 30 April 2024, Kivimäki was found guilty of all charges – including 9,600 counts of aggravated invasion of privacy and more than 21,300 counts of attempted aggravated extortion – and sentenced to six years and three months in prison: a long stretch by Finnish standards, but shy of the seven-year maximum he could have received. His appeal against his sentence is currently under way.</p><p>Even if his conviction is upheld, he will be a free man by the end of this year.</p><p>“The sentencing scale is too low, in my opinion. But that’s the framework we have in Finland,” Vainio says. He tells me a colleague has tried to quantify the harm caused, using the conservative estimate that each person had endured a week of agony as a result of the hack. “When you multiply it with the number of victims of this case, you would have 635 years of suffering.”</p><hr><p><span>N</span>ow 28, Kivimäki has served much of his sentence in a spotless, bright but suitably austere facility in Turku, south-west Finland, a two-hour train ride from Helsinki. For months, he had refused to grant me an interview, but while I am in Finland reporting this story, he changes his mind. As I sit in silence in the prison’s visitor room for what feels like hours, watching the clock tick down behind a panel of reinforced glass, I&nbsp;wonder if Kivimäki is trolling me; if he has dragged me over here simply to derail the other interviews I already had scheduled, with no intention of ever leaving his cell. But after 40 minutes he appears. With his white-blond hair, ice-blue eyes and razor burn, and dressed in a black&nbsp;T-shirt and shorts, he looks like an overgrown teenage boy.</p><p>He didn’t do it, he says; he’s simply a victim of his own notoriety. “They had to find somebody. They just chose somebody who was convenient for the story.” When I point out that there’s an enormous amount of circumstantial evidence linking him to the hack, Kivimäki is defiant. “The obvious answer is that it’s just somebody close to me.” He has an idea who it is, he continues, but he isn’t prepared to name names.</p><figure id="b29c8bb9-c90c-41cf-98e6-25e002fd204e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:68,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Life after the Ashley Madison affair&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;b29c8bb9-c90c-41cf-98e6-25e002fd204e&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/28/what-happened-after-ashley-madison-was-hacked&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:1,&quot;theme&quot;:0},&quot;isInStarRatingVariant&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>It seems very selfless to do time for someone else’s crime, I say. I tell him Parikka says having her therapy notes held to ransom felt like a public rape. “I’m sure that’s how she felt,” he replies, blankly. “It’s quite remote to me. I’m involved, in that I was in court over this stuff, but I didn’t do it. It’s another story in the news.”</p><p>As a fellow human being rather than the person convicted of the crime, I ask, what’s your response to people taking their lives after having their therapy notes stolen? “There’s a lot of terrible things going on in the world. I don’t really feel any differently about this. I turn on the news and there’s people dying in Gaza or wherever. It’s like, how do you feel about<em> that</em>? I think the honest answer for most people is that they just … <em>don’t</em>.”&nbsp;You don’t have anything to say to the victims? “Not really,” he replies. “These are nameless, faceless&nbsp;people.”</p><p>“There’s been just one question that I would ask Kivimäki,” Parikka says. “That would be: ‘Was there ever such a moment that you felt empathy?’ I don’t think he’s able to put himself into anybody else’s situation.” She pauses. “I think that he really needs therapy.”</p><hr><p><span>V</span>astaamo was <a href="https://tietosuoja.fi/en/-/administrative-fine-imposed-on-psychotherapy-centre-vastaamo-for-data-protection-violations" data-link-name="in body link">declared bankrupt</a> in February 2021. Days after patients received the ransom emails, the board announced that it had let the CEO, Ville Tapio, go. In April 2023, Tapio was <a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20027665" data-link-name="in body link">found guilty</a> of criminal negligence in his handling of patient data. His conviction was overturned on appeal in December 2025. (He declined my requests to interview him.)</p><p>“I have actually been more angry towards Ville Tapio than I have been towards Kivimäki,” Auer says. “As CEO of the company, he had the responsibility to make sure that it was prepared for all kinds of risks, and that they had sufficient information security. It seems like it was never a priority to him.” What was his priority<em>?</em> “Making money. He ran a very successful business.”</p><p>“I believe that originally the Tapios were wanting to help people and make therapy available,” Parikka says. “There are now maybe thousands of people who will never use therapy again, because they can never trust. And that’s really bad.”</p><p>Alongside more than 6,000 other plaintiffs, Auer and Parikka are part of a civil case suing Kivimäki for damages. Despite the lifestyle he projects online, he claims not to have the funds to pay damages; so far, no&nbsp;one has been able to find his assets. The government has agreed to pay compensation to victims – anything from <a href="https://www.valtiokonttori.fi/en/services/services-related-to-compensation-and-accidents/vastaamo/#_how-much-compensation-can-you-get" data-link-name="in body link">a few hundred euros to a few thousand,</a> depending on how many pages of their therapy notes Vastaamo had in its database, and how sensitive the information contained in those pages was – but the sum is likely to be symbolic. How can you ever repay the damage of being exposed in this way?</p><p>Copies of the patient files have been circulating ever since they were first released in October 2020. At one point, someone created a special search engine for browsing the database. This doesn’t surprise Parikka. “Kivimäki isn’t just one of a kind,” she says. “I know human curiosity. People want to know.”</p><p>Other people are as prepared as Kivimäki was to break moral and legal boundaries – for money, for online clout, out of ghoulish curiosity or simply for the LOLs. In May, Finnish police <a href="https://poliisi.fi/en/-/police-have-another-suspect-in-vastaamo-case" data-link-name="in body link">announced</a> that there was a&nbsp;second suspect in the Vastaamo case, a US citizen living in Estonia – suspected of aiding and abetting Kivimäki, helping prepare the files. He has been charged with assisting in the attempted extortion.</p><p>In an era when AI models are <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/zoom-ai-personl-data-1234802844/" data-link-name="in body link">trained on our Zoom</a> conversations, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/15/x-ai-gmail-meta-privacy-settings" data-link-name="in body link">emails</a> and status updates, it is naive to believe that anything can ever be fully secure. The human need to confide in others can be met in an extraordinary range of ways in the digital age. In a world of unparalleled connectivity, can our innermost secrets ever be truly safe?</p><p>Kivimäki thinks we are all clinging on to analogue expectations about privacy in a digital world. “So many of our worst secrets – I mean <em>worst</em> of worst, things we might really, really not want to share with the entire world – they exist online. They’ll exist in the database of some company you used,” he tells me. “Everybody’s photos, everybody’s text-messaging histories.” He fixes me with his eyes. “You fundamentally want to believe in this privacy. But, on the other hand, I don’t know how you’re going to get there.”</p><p><em>Intrigue: Ransom Man, Jenny Kleeman’s six-part series for BBC Radio 4, is available </em><em>now on BBC Sounds.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>In July 2025, we from Neodyme got together in Munich and did security research on a bunch of IoT devices, ranging from bluetooth headsets, to door locks, to drones. One of these was the Potensic Atom 2. It’s a photo and video drone with a gimbal-stabilized 4K camera and a remote control that you hook up to your own smartphone and the proprietary app. If you’ve ever flown a DJI Mini 4K, this drone will look very familiar to you.</p>

<p>This post is part of a <strong>two-part series</strong> that will cover how we disassembled the drone and dumped the firmware from the NAND chip and how we analyzed the drone’s firmware, app, and remote control to find some backdoors and vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3 id="goal-dumping-the-firmware">Goal: Dumping the Firmware</h3>
<p>One of the most important pieces of information you can acquire when setting up to hack a device is its firmware. If you want to reverse engineer the software that’s running on the drone and find vulnerabilities in that, then you need a copy of it in the first place.</p>
<p>Now there are a couple of ways to go about that, some are less intrusive and some are more effective.</p>
<p>You might get lucky and be able to just <strong>download the firmware</strong> as a firmware update from the manufacturer’s website. However, those update sites are often not publicly documented and can be locked behind authorization checks or encrypted. Encrypted firmwares can still be useful - you “just” need to reverse engineer the on-device decryption process. For the Atom 2, downloading the firmware updates required having a valid drone and remote control serial number <em>and</em> the firmware update was also encrypted. Without having the decryption logic, we put this approach on ice during our initial research.</p>
<p>Another really comfortable approach is to use exposed <strong>debug interfaces</strong> like JTAG or UART. However, those are often undocumented, unlabeled, or entirely removed for public versions. We didn’t find any on the Atom 2.</p>
<p>What we can always do, though not necessarily always successful, is solder off the entire NAND chip and <strong>dump the firmware</strong> byte by byte. This has the risk of breaking the NAND chip and/or the rest of the board if you’re not careful. Also, some devices, like modern smart phones, encrypt their persistent storage with key material stored in, e.g., the TPM. If that is the case, then simply soldering off the NAND chip will leave you with unusable encrypted data. Fortunately, the Atom 2’s NAND contents are not encrypted, as we find out later.</p>
<h2 id="dumping-the-nand-chip">Dumping the NAND Chip</h2>
<p>Dumping a NAND chip generally always follows the same pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying the NAND Chip</li>
<li>Removing it from the board</li>
<li>Identifying the data pins and communication protocol of the NAND chip</li>
<li>Connecting the NAND chip to some kind of reading device</li>
<li>Reading the NAND content</li>
<li>Reassembling the read contents into a working firmware - usually containing one or more file systems</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="identifying-the-nand-chip">Identifying the NAND Chip</h3>
<p>The Atom 2 has multiple boards:</p>

					</center>
<p>We are mainly interested in the <strong>main board</strong> because that’s where the NAND flash is going to be. The main board had several metal RF shields that we have already pried off or cut through on the photos.</p>
<p>We can identify most of these chips through their markings. Note that while we’re mainly interested in the NAND chip, knowing the others can help with recognizing things during reversing later on. Roughly knowing which SoC we were working with was crucial, as you will see in later sections of this blog post.</p>
<p><em>(Note that the markings below might not match the photos completely. We had multiple drones. The markings are mostly from the first drone and the photos are mostly of the second drone.)</em></p>

<p>Usually getting the chip off of the board is just a matter of using hot air station and flux. However, you can see on the photos that the chip is actually glued to the main board with what is probably epoxy. That’s a thing you can do if you want to secure the chips more securely and not depend on the solder joints to hold your chip in place (and risk breaking them). Or you can do that <em>just</em> to the NAND chip to make it harder for researcher to pry off your NAND chip and dump your firmware.</p>
<p>Anyway, a few cuts with a sharp knife, some heat and a <em>generous</em> amount of flux later, the little bugger came off in one piece.</p>
<p><em>(And with it, a couple of extremely tiny resistors that I knocked off with my pliers and promptly lost. This main board is now broken. But don’t worry, <a href="https://youtu.be/D_qFWoa_HR4&amp;t=293">through the magic of buying <del>two</del> three of them</a>, we can still fly the drone.)</em></p>

<h3 id="identifying-the-data-pins-and-communication-protocol-of-the-nand-chip">Identifying the data pins and communication protocol of the NAND chip</h3>
<p>According to the data sheet of the MX35UF4GE4AD NAND chip, the flash chip can either come in a 24-pin BGA package or an 8-pin WSON package, which we have here. A quick look at the pin descriptions tell us that the NAND chip is communicating via SPI.</p>

<p>Well, let’s solder tiny copper cables to all of those pins and drown them in a bit of hot glue to stop them from breaking off.</p>
<center><p><img src="https://neodyme.io/blog/drone_hacking_part_1/nand-chip-wires.jpg" alt="nand chip with wires"></p></center>
<p>Note that you <em>can</em> get a proper socket for 8-WSON chips into which you simply clamp the chip and which exposes easy-to-work-with breakout pins. None of our sockets we brought fit though, so we just did it the old-school way.</p>
<h3 id="connecting-the-nand-chip-to-some-kind-of-reading-device">Connecting the NAND chip to some kind of reading device</h3>
<p>SPI is pretty easy to work with. We have two main data lines called <strong>SI</strong> and <strong>SO</strong> (Serial In/Out). You will also find them under the names “MOSI” and “MISO” (Master Out Slave In / Master In Slave Out). As the names of these suggest, SPI follows a master-slave architecture. The microcontroller drives the communication and the peripheral device reacts.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we are simulating the microcontroller-side of the communication, which means that we have a large amount of control. Specifically, we control the clock (<strong>SCLK</strong>). Sometimes it is hard to talk to embedded hardware because of the speed at which they operate. With SPI, however, we can slow down the clock to however fast we want the devices to talk.</p>
<p>Since SPI is a bus protocol, more than one slave device can be hooked up to a master device on the same data lines. To avoid collisions, each device is also assigned its own “Chip Select” line (<strong>CS</strong>). When the master device wants to talk to a specific slave device, it pulls the corresponding CS line <em>low</em>. Devices that have their CS line <em>high</em> won’t react at all.</p>
<p>Obviously there are fancy devices on the market that will make dumping a NAND chip via SPI pretty easy and straightforward. Problem is, we couldn’t get <em>any</em> of them to work. They either didn’t fit (physically), were too fast or failed for some other strange reason we didn’t understand. So we wrote <strong>our own dump script onto an ESP32</strong> using the SPI commands in the data sheet and let it forward the data to our computer via the USB console.</p>
<p>Doing that, we ended up with a 544 MiB dump, containing 131,072 pages of 4096+256 bytes. <em>(We will come back to that “+256” later on.)</em></p>
<p>Let’s dig into what this the flash dump contains with <code>binwalk</code>:</p>

<p>Sweet! We get a working ASCII copyright string, so <em>something</em> must have worked. And at the end of the image we have a bunch of UBIFS images. That’s probably where all the juicy files are!</p>
<p>Let’s extract them with <code>dd</code> and take a look inside with <a href="https://github.com/onekey-sec/ubi_reader">ubi_reader</a>:</p>

<p>Hmm. That doesn’t work. Spoiler: The extracted image is broken.</p>
<p>Now if you’ve ever done something as hacky as this, you will know about a pesky little phenomenon that happens when you just solder copper wires onto a chip, stick that onto the ports of an ESP32 and do SPI communication - which has <strong>no built-in integrity checks</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="random-bit-flips">Random Bit Flips</h4>
<p>These are three dumps taken from the same NAND chip:</p>

					</center>
<p>If you read 4 MiB of data from the chip, not all of the bits you receive are correct. And without any additional data, you have little way of knowing which ones are correct and which are not. If you are lucky, then the dumped data will still “work”, i.e., the contained file system will mount and you can browse files, but futher down the line you will have no way of knowing whether that weird function you’re reversing is actually weird or just the product of random bit flips messing up the CPU instructions.</p>
<p>A relatively simple yet time-consuming way to get around this: Read the flash <em>often</em> (at least three times) and hold a majority vote for every bit. Since the bit flips are random and not too prevalent, they are less likely to hit the same bit twice.</p>
<p>Hot tip: If you’re gonna work with python, use numpy and work on arrays and  memory-mapped files. Otherwise this can take a lot of time and a lot of RAM - even for a 512 MiB flash dump.</p>

<h2 id="out-of-band-bytes-and-ecc-troubles">Out-of-band bytes and ECC troubles</h2>
<p>One thing we have have silently brushed aside for now: The NAND chip distinguishes between “user data” and “extra data”. In our dump above, we have naively concatenated it all together and assumed that a page size of 4096+256 bytes somehow makes sense. Of course, it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Also, this majority voting hack is obviously not the “correct” way to work with a NAND chip. And even the proper SoC mounted on the proper mainboard can’t run a system off of a flash chip that gives it random bit flips that it can’t detect or recover from. The problem is that NAND is just inherently imperfect storage. Majority voting only corrects for transmission errors during dumping, but does nothing to bit errors that are stored on the device! Bits on the storage might decay over time, or the CPU might also have some transmission errors during writing.</p>
<p>Of course this problem has been very well known for a long time, so manufacturers always include some extra space next to user data for “error correction”. These extra bytes are called “out-of-band” bytes. And they are used to implement <strong>Error Correction Codes</strong> (ECC).</p>
<h3 id="ecc-according-to-the-nand-chip-data-sheet">ECC according to the NAND chip data sheet</h3>
<p>The flash chip implements its own error correction algorithm by reserving some of the space for ECC. It is split into</p>
<ul>
<li>2048 blocks of</li>
<li>64 pages of</li>
<li>4096 user data bytes + 256 “extra” bytes (aka out-of-band bytes)</li>
<li>=&gt; 512 MiB of user data (the chip is 4 Gb, not 4 GB)</li>
<li>=&gt; 32 MiB of extra data</li>
</ul>
<p>If the chip-internal ECC is enabled, some of those extra bytes are used for ECC.</p>
<p>At this point, we naively assumed that each page would be</p>
<ul>
<li>4096 bytes of user data followed by</li>
<li>256 (or less?) bytes of ECC covering the previous 4096 bytes.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we quickly found out that the sequences classified as “extra data” contain readable strings! That definitely suggests that this isn’t ECC data.</p>
<center><figure>

							<p>
								In-page addresses at and above 0x1000 (= 4096) are extra data
							</p>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</center>
<p>You can also see that there are parts within the user data where strings are suddenly cut off. This suggests that the ECC layout we assumed was wrong. It took us quite a while to figure out what exactly we missed.</p>

<h4 id="entropy-analysis">Entropy Analysis</h4>
<p>Turns out, the ECC layout is not just 4096 bytes of user data followed by 256 bytes of ECC. If we put all pages next to each other and then calculate the entropy over each n-th byte of a page, we will find that there are multiple sections with high entropy:</p>
<center><p><img src="https://neodyme.io/blog/drone_hacking_part_1/entropy.png" alt=""></p></center>
<p>Why are we looking at entropy? Well, because we expect the user data to have  ASCII text (low entropy) every now and then and the ECC data to be mostly random-looking byte values (high entropy).</p>
<p>The graph we’re seeing up here suggests that there are sections of <em>roughly</em> 1 KiB of user data, followed by 28 bytes of ECC data. Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>1028 B user data + 28 B ECC</li>
<li>1028 B user data + 28 B ECC</li>
<li>1028 B user data + 28 B ECC</li>
<li>1014 B user data + 28 B ECC</li>
<li>142 B unused</li>
</ul>
<p>Why these stranges values? And which ECC algorithm is that? We <em>can</em> choose to ignore that and just extract the user data sections and stitch them together. I won’t spam you with more <code>binwalk</code> and <code>dd</code> screenshots and just <em>tell</em> you that that also won’t result in a readable UBIFS image. Fortunately, we find an explanation for these values in the next section!</p>
<h3 id="ecc-according-to-the-soc-data-sheet">ECC according to the SoC data sheet</h3>
<p>At this point, we had already spent a lot of time fiddling with unstable reading setups and ECC layouts. And then we found that some further digging into the <em>right</em> documentation could have saved us a lot of time during our research. Because the SoC <em>also</em> does ECC. Not just the NAND chip. In fact, we can ignore the NAND chips ECC feature completely.</p>
<p>The SoC’s data sheet lists several possible ECC layouts. One of them is the following:</p>
<center><p><img src="https://neodyme.io/blog/drone_hacking_part_1/layout-01.png" alt=""></p></center>
<p>Well, that fits our findings perfectly, plus a BB (“bad blocks”) and CTRL (some kind of control bytes?) area that we didn’t identify before.</p>
<p>Using this diagram, we can cut out all the ECC, BB and CTRL sections and reconstruct the pure 512 MiB user data flash content.</p>

<p>Hmm. Damn. The UBIFS image is now at least <em>somewhat</em> syntactically correct. But it is still broken enough to not have any files. Why could that be?
Well, we are looking at <em>exactly</em> what the SoC would see after reading the data from the NAND chip. <em>Plus</em> that we have done majority voting on the bytes - so our version is even better than what the SoC would see.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong>, there is no guarantee that there aren’t any random bit flips <em>on the NAND chip</em>, i.e., that random bit flipping happened during <em>writing</em>, desoldering or anytime between that!
So, there seems to no way around actually implementing the ECC algorithm and correcting the bit flips on the flash dump. Problem is: <strong>What kind of ECC algorithm is the SoC running?</strong> Unfortunately, the datasheet is silent here, so we had to find out on our own.</p>
<h3 id="a-short-primer-on-reverse-engineering-ecc-algorithms">A short primer on reverse engineering ECC algorithms</h3>
<p>Typical ECC algorithms on NAND chips use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCH_code">BCH codes</a>, which are parametrized by the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>The amount of parity bits.</li>
<li>The correction capacity <code>t</code>, i.e., how many simultaneous bit flips may appear in the same data block before the block is “too broken” and the ECC algorithm fails.</li>
<li>The primitive polynomial used in the equation. If you don’t know what this is, just think of it as an integer parameter for now.</li>
<li>Whether and how the data is transformed <em>before</em> the parity bits are calculated.</li>
<li>Whether and how the parity bits are transformed <em>after</em> they are calculated.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can deduce (1) and (2) from our flash dump. For (3), (4), and (5) we have to either find the code of the SoC (if it is implement in software at all) and reverse engineer the ECC algorithm - or just bruteforce them.</p>
<h4 id="amount-of-parity-bits">Amount of parity bits</h4>
<p>As we have seen in the SoC’s data sheet, we have 112 byte of ECC / parity bits. However, the fragmented layout on the flash suggests that we actually have 4 ECC groups of 28 byte, each covering a different part of the user data. Note that this is an educated guess and does not have to be true. If we’re not getting anywhere, we should consider dropping this assumption later on. But spoiler: We’re right about this.</p>
<p>This means that we have <strong>224 parity bits</strong> (= 28 bytes).</p>
<h4 id="correction-capacity">Correction capacity</h4>
<p>This part we can just calculate if we make one very realistic assumption. We have 1028 bytes of user data, which is 8224 bits. If we want to represent these 8224 bits as a binary polynomial, we need at least degree 14:</p>
<p><code>2^13 =  8192</code> &lt; - Too small
<code>2^14 = 16384</code> &lt; - Fits!</p>
<p>This means our primitive polynomial needs to be at least degree 14 (<code>m &gt;= 14</code>).</p>
<p>The correction capacity is determined by the degree <code>m</code> and the amount of parity bits. The more parity bits we have in relation to <code>m</code>, the higher our correction capacity <code>t</code>:</p>
<p><code>t = parity_bits / m</code></p>
<p>Now given that <code>parity_bits</code> is fixed at 224 and assuming that the engineers chose <code>t</code> to be maximal, we conclude that <code>m = 14</code> and</p>
<p><code>t = 224 / 14 = 16</code></p>
<p>meaning that we can correct for up to 16 bit flips in the covered user data chunk. Anything more than that and the chunk is lost.</p>
<p><code>t = 16</code> also fits the description of the ECC section in the SoC’s data sheet: “16-Bit/1KB Error Correction Performance” (see our diagram above). So we are pretty certain that this assumption is correct.</p>
<h4 id="primitive-polynomial">Primitive polynomial</h4>
<p>We don’t know that and we will have to bruteforce it. Given that it is a <em>binary</em> polynomial, it is usually represented as a bit vector or simply as an integer. Given that <code>m = 14</code> we already know that our polynomial must have its 14th bit set and that the 14th bit is the highest bit that is set:</p>
<p><code>2^14 &lt;= prim_poly &lt; 2^15</code></p>
<p>which is well within bruteforcing range.</p>
<h4 id="pre-encode-and-post-encode-transformations">Pre-encode and post-encode transformations</h4>
<p>There are a few transformations that are commonly applied to either the user data <em>before</em> calculating the parity bits (“encoding”) or applied to the parity bits <em>after</em> calculating them. Examples include</p>
<ul>
<li>reverse bit order</li>
<li>reverse byte order</li>
<li>swap nibbles</li>
<li>invert</li>
</ul>
<p>Why you ask? Well, one of these combinations for example is very useful for NAND storage devices. You see, when NAND pages are erased and then read, their values are all <code>0xFF</code>. Problem is, a page full of <code>0xFF</code> will have</p>
<ul>
<li>user data = <code>0xFFFF...</code></li>
<li>ECC = <code>0xFFFF...</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and that is <em>not</em> a valid parity, meaning a cleanly erased page will be read as containing a lot of errors. That is because</p>
<p><code>parity(0xFF...) != 0xFF...</code></p>
<p>But we can pull a trick to make this work: Before encoding, invert the user data. And after encoding, invert the parity bits:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>user_data            = 0xFF...</span></p></div><div><p><span>inverted_user_data   = 0x00...</span></p></div><div><p><span>parity_bits          = parity(inverted_user_data)</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>                     </span></span><span>= parity(0x00...)</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>                     </span></span><span>= 0x00...</span></p></div><div><p><span>inverted_parity_bits = 0xFF...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Notice that the parity of an all-zero page <em>is</em> all-zero:</p>
<p><code>parity(0x00...) != 0x00...</code></p>
<p>So by implementing our ECC algorithm with these two inversions, we make a freshly erased page (<code>0xFF...</code>) have a valid parity (<code>0xFF...</code>) and the SoC’s error correction won’t need special handling for erased NAND pages.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the actual algorithm at hand here. How do we know that these two inversions are what the engineers actually chose? We don’t! We just try all these different transformations and see if one of them works. The amount of possible combinations of these 4 transformations is quite low and easily bruteforcable.</p>
<h3 id="brute-forcing-ecc-parameters">Brute-forcing ECC parameters</h3>
<p>In summary, to test our guessed parameters, we need a user data section without errors, generate its ECC and check if it matches the ECC that we read off of the NAND chip. Our bruteforce script thus has to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a “good” user data section with no bit flips and the corresponding ECC section.</li>
<li>Iterate through all possible transformations.</li>
<li>Iterate through all possible primitive polynomials of degree 14</li>
<li>For each iteration, generate the ECC of the userdata section. If it matches the existing ECC, we have found the parameters.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="picking-a-good-user-data-section">Picking a “good” user data section</h4>
<p>We need a user data section and its corresponding ECC section without bit flips. But how do we know that a section does not have bit flips? We don’t! We <em>could</em> try to be clever here. One possible approach would be to pick a section with a lot of text and check if the text makes sense. But the lazy approach works just as well: Just try a lot of sections and hope that one of them is correct. <em>More bruteforce. Yeah.</em></p>

<p>As you can see in the script above, we only look at the first section of every page and then move on to the next page entirely. We’re not completely sure yet which ECC bytes cover which user data sections - especially since the 4th section looks fragmented. But we will stick to our assumption that the first 1028 bytes of user data are covered by the first 28 bytes of ECC. Spoiler: We’re right about this. Another Spoiler: The first 3 pages have bit-flips in their first section. The 4th one is good.</p>
<h4 id="iterate-through-all-possible-transformations">Iterate through all possible transformations</h4>

<ul>
<li>reverse bit order</li>

<p>We don’t optimize for that though.</p>
<h4 id="iterate-through-all-possible-primitive-polynomials-of-degree-14">Iterate through all possible primitive polynomials of degree 14</h4>
<p>There are three ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A simple and slow way</li>
<li>A math-heavy and fast way</li>
<li>A much better way that is about as simple as (1) and as fast as (2)</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, we went with (1) during our initial research because sometimes thinking just takes longer than computing inefficiently. Afterwards, I spent hours digging into polynomial algebra to come up with (2) and was very happy about it - only to also find (3) right afterwards which was a lot simpler and equally as good… Oh well, at least I got to freshen up on first- and second-semester linear algebra.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Simple and slow</strong>
The simple way would be to just try all polynomials of degree 14. In their integer representation, that’s all integers in
<code>range(2**14, 2**15)</code>
While this <em>will</em> eventually cover the correct primitive polynomial, it will also make bchlib crash the entire script with a SIGSEGV for a lot of non-primitive polynomials.</p>
<p>A quick-and-dirty workaround is to just spawn a new process for every candidate polynomial so your main script doesn’t die. And that’s what we did during initial research. It works - but the creation of over 16,000 processes makes this a bit slow. Not <em>too</em> slow to work with though. This approach works in practice.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Math-heavy and fast</strong>
The <em>proper</em> way to do this is to only pass primitive polynomials into BCH’s constructor. But how do we know if the polynomial that is represented by our integer is primitive? By doing lots of math. If you’re not familiar with polynomial algebra (like I was) but really want to know how this works, read the section <strong>A brief detour into polynomial algebra</strong> in the addendum.</p>
<p>Spoiler: It is a lot of thinking work and only about 5% faster than (3) in my tests.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Simple and fast</strong>
Turns out, bchlib only crashes for polynomials with a constant term of 0, i.e., even integers. So if we use <code>range(2**14 + 1, 2**15, 2)</code>, then it just works without having to fiddle with multiprocessing or math.</p>
<p>This will still throw a runtime error for a lot of non-primitive polynomials but we can catch that via try-except:</p>

<h3 id="restoring-the-full-firmware">Restoring the full firmware</h3>
<p>Now that we have a working ECC setup, let’s reassemble the entire firmware! There is just one little detail that we still need to find out:</p>
<p>Which parts of user data are covered by which parts of ECC? We already confirmed that the first user data section is covered by the first 28 bytes of ECC. And the same turns out to be true for the second and third user data section. The fourth section is a bit tricky: It is 928+84 bytes of user data long, with additional BB and CTRL bytes around. What is that about? Turns out, a bit of trial-and-error and looking at the SoC’s data sheet revealed how ECC works for that section.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-detour-into-polynomial-algebra">A brief detour into polynomial algebra</h2>
<p>If you are like me and you’re not really familiar with polynomial algebra, it makes sense to talk about related concepts in the integer world first and then move on to their counterparts in the polynomial world. This helps to get an intuition of what we are actually dealing with.</p>
<p>I assume that you are generally familiar with modular arithmetic and prime numbers.</p>
<h3 id="integers-and-modulo-rings">Integers and Modulo Rings</h3>
<p>For now, we are working on the field of integers, i.e., <span></span>, mathematically denoted <span></span>.</p>
<p>When we introduce a modulus, we get <span></span>. Explanation for the notation:</p>
<p><span></span> is some modulus. Not necessary prime at this point. Just an integer - a member of <span></span>.</p>
<p><span></span> is all multiples of <span></span>. So <span></span>.
If <span></span> were <span></span>, this would be <span></span>.</p>
<p>Now <span></span> means:
The field <span></span> but treat all elements as equivalent if they are a multiple of <span></span> apart - meaning their difference is in <span></span>.
If <span></span> were <span></span>, then <span></span> and <span></span> would be equivalent, because their difference is <span></span>, which is a multiple of <span></span> and thus in <span></span>.</p>
<p>This is exactly what “mod 7” is: <span></span></p>
<p>So <span></span> is just all of <span></span>.</p>
<p>Note that this collapses the infinite field of all possible integers <span></span> down to a finite set of equivalence classes. In <span></span>, all numbers are either in <span></span> or are equivalents of one of those. So for practical purposes, there are only <span></span> possible values in <span></span>.</p>
<p>What do we need primes for?
Well, <span></span> has a practical problem: Sometimes multiplying two things results in a zero. Example for <span></span>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>4  * 2 = 0 mod 8</span></p></div><div><p><span>8  * 2 = 0 mod 8</span></p></div><div><p><span>12 * 2 = 0 mod 8</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>That is bad if we want to do a lot of multiplication within our modulo ring. Because if we ever accidentally hit a multiple of <span></span>, we will get <span></span> and that point it doesn’t matter what we multiply onto that - it will stay <span></span>. So there are a lot of possible values that all collapse into the same <span></span> when multiplied with certain numbers.</p>
<p>In the field of all integers, <span></span>, we don’t have that problem. As long as we don’t multiply with <span></span> itself, the results of a multiplication will never be <span></span>. Good thing there is a solution for that: Using a <strong>prime modulus</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="prime-numbers-finite-fields-and-cycles">Prime Numbers, Finite Fields, and Cycles</h3>
<p>Prime numbers <span></span> have the nice feature that the modulo rings they induce, <span></span>, are <em>fields</em> and not just <em>rings</em>, meaning addition and multiplication work just as well as they do in <span></span>. In <span></span>, multiplying by something other than <span></span> will <em>never</em> result in a multiple of <span></span> - because <span></span> is prime and you can’t reach a prime from another number through multiplication. (Multiplying by <span></span> itself doesn’t count, because <span></span>.)</p>
<p>Because <span></span> is a <em>field</em> and it has a finite amount of elements <span></span>, it is called a “finite field” or a “Galois field” and sometimes denoted <span></span> instead of <span></span>. To be super precise, <span></span> is a generalization and means “any finite field with <span></span> elements”. <span></span> just happens to be one of those - and is the most popular one.</p>
<p>Now we go a step further and look at a concept called <strong>primitive root</strong>. Before explaining that, let’s take a look at a use case for them first.</p>
<p>Imagine you want a pseudorandom permutation of <span></span>, i.e., you don’t want the sequence <span></span> but a more random-looking sequence tha still hits all of these numbers. It doesn’t have to be cryptographically random or unpredictable. It just needs to look at bit random - perhaps to de-cluster memory writes for better wear-leveling. Primitive roots give us a nice implementation for that.</p>
<p>In <span></span>, multiplication never yields <span></span> unless you multiply by <span></span>. That means you can, e.g., keep doubling a number and will never accidentally hit <span></span>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>1       = 1 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 2   = 2 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 2^2 = 4 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 2^3 = 1 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 2^4 = 2 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 2^5 = 4 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 2^6 = 1 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Oh look at that, a <em>cycle</em>! This is what will <em>always</em> happen in a finite field. When you keep multiplying by the same number, you will eventually reach the number you started with. And at that point, you are in a cycle.</p>
<p><span></span> is a bit impractical though because its induced cycle only ever hits the numbers <span></span> and never hits <span></span>. Note that <em>no</em> cycle will ever hit <span></span>, so the maximum cycle we can possible get with a modulus of <span></span> is cycle length <span></span>.</p>
<h3 id="primitive-roots-and-prime-factors">Primitive Roots and Prime Factors</h3>
<p>And there are indeed numbers that generate a full cycle!</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span># 3</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 3^0 = 1 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 3^1 = 3 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 3^2 = 2 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 3^3 = 6 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 3^4 = 4 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 3^5 = 5 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 3^6 = 1 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 3^7 = 3 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>...</span></p></div><div><p><span># 5</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 5^0 = 1 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 5^1 = 5 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 5^2 = 4 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 5^3 = 6 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 5^4 = 2 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 5^5 = 3 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 5^6 = 1 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 5^7 = 5 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>These numbers, numbers that induce a full cycle in a finite field, are called <em>primitive roots</em>. <span></span> and <span></span> are each primitive roots modulo <span></span>. Since their induced cycle has a length of <span></span>, the so-called <em>order</em> of <span></span> and <span></span> is <span></span>.</p>
<p>More generally, a primitive root <span></span> modulo some prime <span></span> is a number whose order is <span></span>, i.e., whose induced cycle has a length of <span></span>. In that case <span></span>. Expressed more formally: <span></span> is a primitive root modulo <span></span> if and only if the <em>smallest</em> <span></span> for which <span></span> is true, is <span></span></p>
<p>Now then how would you best check if a number <span></span> is a primitive root modulo <span></span>? The obvious solution is to just count <span></span> upwards from 1 through <span></span> and check <span></span> each time. That <em>works</em> but it can take a long time for big numbers. Turns out, we don’t have to check every possible <span></span> from <span></span> through <span></span>. To understand that, take a look at <span></span> from before:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>1       = 1 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 2   = 2 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 2^2 = 4 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>...repeat</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>We can see that the cycle has length <span></span> and contains the numbers <span></span>. We <em>don’t</em> see the numbers <span></span>. But what happens when we use <span></span> but we <em>start</em> at <span></span>?</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>3       = 3 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>3 * 2^1 = 6 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>3 * 2^2 = 5 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>...repeat</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Again, a cycle of <span></span>! And this time we’ve seen all the remaining numbers <span></span>. If we instead start at <span></span> or <span></span>, we will get the same cycle over <span></span>. So <span></span> splits the entire finite field excluding 0 into two subsets: <span></span> and <span></span>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example: <span></span> and try to find all cycles.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span># start at 1</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 6^0 = 1 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>1 * 6^1 = 6 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>...repeat</span></p></div><div><p><span># start at 2</span></p></div><div><p><span>2 * 6^0 = 2 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>2 * 6^1 = 5 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>...repeat</span></p></div><div><p><span># start at 3</span></p></div><div><p><span>3 * 6^0 = 3 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>3 * 6^1 = 4 mod 7</span></p></div><div><p><span>...repeat</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>So <span></span> partitions the non-zero elements into <span></span>`.</p>
<p>Notice how all those cycles induced by the same number always have the same size? If you think about it, then that makes perfect sense. When you have <span></span> but you “start at <span></span>”, you’re basically just taking the regular <span></span> cycle and multiply its elements by <span></span>. So the resulting cycle must have the same length: <span></span>.</p>
<p>And this isn’t a coincidence. In fact, all cycles induced by the same number <em>always</em> have the same length. And that number always partitions the entire finite field without <span></span> into disjoint sets of the same size.</p>
<p>How does that help us? Well, for <span></span> it makes the cycle lengths <span></span> and <span></span> impossible! Because you can’t cover all <span></span> non-zero elements <span></span> by splitting them into sets of size <span></span> or <span></span>. More generally, cycles lengths (and thus orders) must always be a divisor of <span></span>, i.e., the amount of all non-zero elements.</p>
<p>This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_theorem_(group_theory)">Lagrange’s theorem</a>: The order of the subgroup divides the order of the whole group.</p>
<p>So to check if <span></span> is a primitive root, we don’t have to check all <span></span> from <span></span> through <span></span>. We only have to check all divisors of <span></span>! Also, we obviously don’t have to check <span></span>. The only number for which <span></span> is <span></span> itself, which <em>always</em> induces a cycle of <span></span> and is thus never a primitive root for <span></span>.</p>
<p>So we’re down to only having to check all divisors of <span></span> that are larger than <span></span>. That already eliminates most of the candidates.</p>
<p>But we can go <em>even further</em>!</p>
<h3 id="fast-primitivity-check">Fast Primitivity Check</h3>
<p>We only need to check <em>some</em> of the divisors. This is where prime factorization comes into play. Let’s say that we have the prime factors of <span></span>. We will call these prime factors <span></span>. Note that <span></span> itself does not have any prime factors because - well - it is a <em>prime number</em>. But <span></span> <em>does</em> have prime factors. In fact, <span></span> will always be one of those prime factors because <span></span> must be odd to be a prime and <span></span> must therefore be even.</p>
<p>Now what if I told you that we only need to check the divisors of <span></span> that we can obtain by dividing through a prime factor. Specifically, we only need to check</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>(p-1) / q_1</span></p></div><div><p><span>(p-1) / q_2</span></p></div><div><p><span>...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Example:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>p   = 37</span></p></div><div><p><span>p-1 = 36</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>= 2 * 2 * 3 * 3</span></p></div><div><p><span>set of non-trivial divisors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18}</span></p></div><div><p><span>set of prime factors        = {2, 3}</span></p></div><div><p><span>We only have to check</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>36 / 2 = 18</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>and</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>36 / 3 = 12</span></p></div><div><p><span>We don't have to check the other divisors</span></p></div><div><p><span>{2, 3, 4, 6, 9}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Why is that? Well, first of all, notice that the “other divisors” <span></span> are themselves divisors of either <span></span> or <span></span>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>12 = 2 * 6</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>   </span></span><span>= 3 * 4</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>   </span></span><span>= 4 * 3</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>   </span></span><span>= 6 * 2</span></p></div><div><p><span>18 = 2 * 9</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>   </span></span><span>= 3 * 6</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>   </span></span><span>= 6 * 3</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>   </span></span><span>= 9 * 2</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>And if <span></span>, then that implies that</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>g^2 != 1 mod 37</span></p></div><div><p><span>g^3 != 1 mod 37</span></p></div><div><p><span>g^4 != 1 mod 37</span></p></div><div><p><span>g^6 != 1 mod 37</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Why? Well, because <em>if</em> <span></span> <em>were</em> equal to one, then</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span><span> </span></span><span>g^6    = 1   mod 37</span></p></div><div><p><span>(g^6)^2 = 1^2 mod 37</span></p></div><div><p><span><span> </span></span><span>g^12   = 1   mod 37</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>and that is a contradiction! You can prove the same for any <span></span> in general if you want. The general proof works just like this example.</p>
<p>Alright, so we only have to check all possible <span></span> with <span></span> being a prime factor of <span></span>.</p>
<p>Here is a generator function that will return all primitive roots for a given prime modulus <span></span>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="python"><code><div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>primitive_roots</span><span>(p):</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>N </span><span>=</span><span> p </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>1</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>prime_factors </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>set</span><span>(prime_factorization(N))</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>for</span><span> g </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>, N </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>):</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>for</span><span> q </span><span>in</span><span> prime_factors:</span></p></div><div><p><span>            </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>pow</span><span>(g, N </span><span>//</span><span> q, p) </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>:</span></p></div><div><p><span>                </span><span>break</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>else</span><span>:</span></p></div><div><p><span>            </span><span>yield</span><span> g</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>And you know what? Armed with this, we can not just find <strong>primitive roots</strong> but also <strong>primitive polynomials</strong>! We <em>just</em> need to translate this concept to polynomials!</p>
<p>… which is a bit tricky.</p>
<h3 id="binary-polynomials-irreducibility-and-primitive-elements">Binary Polynomials, Irreducibility and Primitive Elements</h3>
<p>Alright, first things first: Polynomials. They can look something like this:</p>

<p>And through the black magic of math, we can treat these polynomials as multidimensional numbers:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>Polynomial:   f(x) = 14x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 53x + 42</span></p></div><div><p><span>Coefficients:       [14,     2,     0,     53,   42]</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>And on these, we can perform the same kind of arithmetic as on integers: Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction, Division - and thus Modulo. Dividing one polynomial by another sounds odd? It is. We’ll skip the details here since we’ve already derailed enough. Just know that the intuition from integer arithmetic carries over to polynomials.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind that we are working with <em>binary</em> polynomials, i.e., polynomials whose coefficients are either <span></span> or <span></span>. And we can represent those as integers. For example, <span></span> represents the polynomial</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>Polynomial:             f(x) = 1x^5 + 1x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x + 1</span></p></div><div><p><span>Binary coefficients:           1      1      0      0      1    1</span></p></div><div><p><span>Decimal representation:        51</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>We use these binary polynomials because they have a numbers of nice properties that things like BCH error correction codes rely on. For example, we can represent all binary strings of length <span></span> as a <span></span>-degree polynomial with binary coefficients. For integers, we’d represent those strings as integers from <span></span> to <span></span>. But we would have problems doing modular arithmetic on those strings because <span></span> isn’t necessarily prime and then <span></span> isn’t a field. For polynomials, there are nice and efficient ways to build a field over <span></span>-degree binary polynomials.</p>
<p>Throughout this section we have to keep in mind that the integer representation (<span></span> in the example above) is just a <em>representation of the polynomial in memory</em>. The polynomial is <em>not</em> an integer and we can’t just do regular <em>integer</em> arithmetic like addition and multiplication with Python’s <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> with it. Polynomials have their own arithmetic and they work differently.</p>
<p>Since we are dealing with binary polynomials, the coefficients of the polynomials are all either <span></span> or <span></span>. More formally, the coefficients are elements of <span></span>, which is basically the same as <span></span> or “mod 2”.</p>
<p>The set of all binary polynomials is called <span></span>. In CompSci terms, these are all possible bit arrays.</p>
<p>So since we’re moving from working on integers to working on binary polynomials, <span></span> is our binary polynomial-equivalent of <span></span>, with <span></span> being all integers and <span></span> being all binary polynomials.</p>
<p>While we used <span></span> to represent a single integer in <span></span>, we will use <span></span> to represent a single polynomial in <span></span>.</p>
<p>Similar to how <span></span> is the set of all multiples of n, <span></span> is the set of all multiples of <span></span> - <em>notice the double-paranthesis</em>.</p>
<p>And similar to how <span></span> is <span></span> but treating two integers as equivalent if their difference is a multiple of <span></span>, <span></span> is <span></span> but treating two polynomials as equivalent if their difference is a multiple of <span></span>. It is essentially “mod <span></span>” in polynomial world.</p>
<p>If we have an integer <span></span> and <span></span> can’t be divided by another integer, then <span></span> is <em>prime</em>. Analogously, if we have a polynomial <span></span> and <span></span> can’t be reduced by another polynomial, then <span></span> is <strong>irreducible</strong>.</p>
<p>If <span></span> is prime, then there is at least one <em>primitive root</em> <span></span> in <span></span>, so that <span></span> spans the entire <span></span>. If <span></span> is irreducible, then there is at least one <strong>primitive element</strong> <span></span> in <span></span> so that <span></span> spans the entire <span></span>.</p>
<p>(Side note: “primitive root” is a legacy term only used for <span></span>. “primitive element” is the general term. They mean the same thing.)</p>
<p>Also, while the order of <span></span> is just <span></span>, the order of <span></span> is <span></span>, which is the amount of all possible <span></span>-bit arrays.</p>
<p>Now we are almost there! We have already come far enough where we can recognize that an irreducible polynomial <span></span> is analogous to a prime integer <span></span>.</p>
<p>Now, what is a <strong><em>primitive</em> polynomial</strong> then?</p>
<h3 id="primitive-polynomials">Primitive Polynomials</h3>
<p>Well, that’s simple! A <em>primitive</em> polynomial is an irreducible polynomial with one additional requirement:</p>
<p>The super simple polynomial
<span></span>
must be a primitive element, i.e., <span></span> must span the entire <span></span>.</p>
<p>Why is that useful? Well, because that means that every non-zero polynomial in <span></span> can be represented as <span></span> for some integer <span></span>. So every non-zero polynomial can be represented as an integer and we have a random-looking permutation of all non-zero binary polynomials in <span></span>.</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> is what BCH codes use and why we require a primitive polynomial.</p>
<p>Now, how do we calculate all primitive polynomials then? We don’t. There are infinitely many. But we can calculate all primitive polynomials of some specific degree <span></span>! And how do we do that? Well, using what we have already built for finding primitive roots for integers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iterate through all possible polynomials of degree <span></span>. For each candidate <span></span>, <strong>(step 1)</strong>
<ul>
<li>check if <span></span> irreducible. Discard if not. <strong>(step 2)</strong></li>
<li>check if <span></span> (the simple polynomial with integer representation 2) is a primitive element in the finite field induced by <span></span>. <strong>(step 3)</strong>
<ul>
<li>the wanted cycle length <span></span> is the amount of all possible polynomials of degree <span></span>:
<span></span></li>
<li>get all prime factors <span></span> of <span></span></li>
<li>check if <span></span> for all prime factors <span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For (step 1)</strong>, we want a primitive polynomial with degree <span></span>, so we only consider polynomials where their m-th coefficient is 1 and all higher-order coefficients are 0. This means that their integer representations are in</p>
<p><code>range(2^m, 2^(m+1))</code>.</p>
<p>To speed it up by factor 2: We can’t have any polynomials where the constant term, i.e., the lowest-order coefficient is zero. Example:</p>
<p><span></span> (note that there is no <span></span> at the end)</p>
<p>That’s because every polynomial with a zero constant term is divisible by the polynomial <span></span> and is thus not irreducible and thus not primitive. So we only iterate over polynomials with a constant term of <span></span>. In the integer representation, those are the odd integers, so we use</p>
<p><code>range(2^m + 1, 2^(m-1), 2)</code></p>
<p><strong>For (step 2)</strong>, checking whether a polynomial is irreducible is the analogue to checking whether an integer is prime.</p>
<p>Ruling out even integer representations of polynomials in (1) skips half the possible candidates because those are all reducible. Unfortunately, there will still be plenty of reducible polynomials left. Just like there are a lot of non-prime numbers among the odd integers.</p>
<p>For a full irreducibility test, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization_of_polynomials_over_finite_fields#Rabin's_test_of_irreducibility">Rabin’s Test</a>. The implementation has a similar structure as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test">Rabin-Miller Test</a> for integers. We won’t cover either here because this section is long enough already.</p>

<p>And now we can <em>finally</em> compute all the primitive polynomials with degree 14. The full script is attached in the addendum. It takes about 1 second (single-threaded, on my laptop) to list all 756 primitive polynomials for degree 14. Yes - there are only 756!</p>

<p>And how much faster does this make our script compared to the naive
<code>range(2**14 + 1, 2**15, 2)</code>
that lists half of all possible binary polynomials of degree 14?</p>
<p>About 1 second on a single-threaded run on my laptop…</p>
<p>Turns out just throwing a bunch of mostly non-primitive polynomials against bchlib and catching the exception is just as fast as doing it properly…</p>
<p>Oh, and you know what? You could have also just pulled a list of all primitive polynomials of degree 14 from the internet. Because, well, we aren’t the first to generate that list.</p>
<p>But hey, we learned some math.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>Is “software startup” the right term?

I only ever took funding to scale to 3-5 heads, well I have 20 heads for nearly nothing now... Ive created more "startup" ideas in the last 3 years then the last 20 of my career. I just keep cranking out anything remotely interesting, launch, and if it don't "work", move on. I just launched another one this week, feels most promising, but we'll see... I didn't go quitting my day job just yet.</p><p>Also, GTFO! My ideas are not just slop from sitting around day dreaming.
