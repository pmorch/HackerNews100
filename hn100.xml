</span>
A: Yes, but there are caveats: the spirit of this event is to help identify and notify vendors of vulnerabilities in EOL software or products, and all submissions should be in this spirit.
If an EOL item has components that are not EOL within it, that‚Äôs fine. However, non-EOL components should not be the focus of the vulnerability or chain - we are not looking for exploits in current systems. If you have questions, please reach out via the submission process and we will work with you to ensure the submission is appropriate for the event.</code></pre><pre><code>
<span data-text-attribute-id="a64773bc-7087-4f7b-8765-1464461c1fb0">2) What should my Junkyard pitch at DistrictCon look like? </span>

For the maximum audience enjoyment and clarity of your awesome work, we prefer you presenting a live demo against the EOL system. We know this won't always be practical, so we will work with you during submission review to find the right way. As part of your demonstrated chain, the judges are (among other things) looking for proof of control and execution. 

Given the broad swath of valid targets, we know this may differ in what that means, but two "traditional" examples are to pop a shell and confirm root privileges, or demonstrate arbitrary code execution.</code></pre><pre><code>
<span data-text-attribute-id="4f60b934-ec85-40cd-99e1-da056f2b6634">3) What is EOL for Open Source, specifically with an archived repository? </span>

If the software you‚Äôre attempting to exploit is an archived repository, first ask if (a) the software moved to a new home and (b) is the archived repo a fork and the substantially similar project is still active? 

If the maintainer confirms they are not maintaining the given version or product, you should be good to go. Otherwise feel free to reach out to the DistrictCon Junkyard Team via the submission process, or via outreach@districtcon.org with additional questions.</code></pre></blockquote><h4>I have More questions.</h4><blockquote><pre><code>Additional details such as the responsible disclosure timelines and any assistance from the conference will be published when available. Please contact outreach@districtcon.org for more details.</code></pre><pre><code>In the case of similar bugs, our team will work privately with the submitters to deduplicate appropriately. </code></pre></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Inside a bustling unit at St. Michael's Hospital in downtown Toronto, one of Shirley Bell's patients was suffering from a cat&nbsp;bite and a fever, but otherwise appeared fine ‚Äî until an alert from an AI-based early warning system showed he was sicker than he seemed.</p><p dir="ltr">While the nursing team usually checked blood work around noon, the technology flagged incoming results several hours beforehand. That warning showed&nbsp;the patient's white blood cell count was "really, really high,"&nbsp;recalled Bell, the clinical nurse educator for the hospital's general medicine program.</p><p dir="ltr">The cause turned out to be cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection. Without prompt treatment, it can lead to extensive tissue damage, amputations&nbsp;and even death. Bell said the patient was given antibiotics quickly to avoid those worst-case scenarios, in large part thanks to the team's in-house AI technology, dubbed Chartwatch.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's lots and lots of other scenarios where patients' conditions are flagged earlier, and the nurse is alerted earlier, and interventions are put in earlier," she said. "It's not replacing the nurse at the bedside; it's actually enhancing your nursing care."</p><p dir="ltr">A year-and-a-half-long study on Chartwatch, <a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.240132"><u>published Monday</u></a> in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, found that use of the AI system led to a striking 26 per cent drop in the number of unexpected deaths among hospitalized patients.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're glad to see that we're saving lives," said co-author Dr. Muhammad Mamdani, vice-president of data science and advanced analytics at Unity Health Toronto and director of the University of Toronto Temerty Faculty of Medicine Centre for AI Research and Education in Medicine.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">'A promising sign'</h2><p dir="ltr">The research team looked at more than 13,000 admissions to St. Michael's general internal medicine ward ‚Äî an 84-bed unit caring for some of the hospital's most complex patients ‚Äî to compare the impact of the tool among that patient population to thousands of admissions into other subspecialty units.&nbsp;</p><div dir="ltr"><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/waive-the-wait-paperwork-doctors-1.7176165" text="This northern Ontario company is using AI to reduce paperwork at doctors' offices" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>This northern Ontario company is using AI to reduce paperwork at doctors' offices</span></a></li></ul></div><p dir="ltr">"At the same time period in the other units in our hospital that were not using Chartwatch, we did not see a change in these unexpected deaths," said lead author Dr. Amol Verma, a clinician-scientist at St. Michael's, one of three Unity Health Toronto hospital network sites, and Temerty professor of AI research and education in medicine at University of Toronto.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">"That was a promising sign."</p><div dir="ltr"><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-artificial-intelligence-1.6994961" text="AI will be critical for the future of rural health care in Canada, experts say" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>AI will be critical for the future of rural health care in Canada, experts say</span></a></li></ul></div><p dir="ltr">The Unity Health AI team started developing Chartwatch back in 2017, based on suggestions from staff that predicting deaths or serious illness could be key areas where machine learning could make a positive difference.</p><p dir="ltr">The technology underwent several years of rigorous development and testing before it was deployed in October&nbsp;2020, Verma said.</p><div dir="ltr"><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Dr. Amol Verma, a clinician-scientist at St. Michael‚Äôs Hospital who helped lead the creation and testing of CHARTwatch, stands at a computer." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/dr-amol-verma.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/dr-amol-verma.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/dr-amol-verma.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-amol-verma.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dr-amol-verma.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7322732.1726245155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-amol-verma.jpg" data-cy="image-img"></p><figcaption>Verma simulates the tool's use inside the downtown Toronto health-care facility.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Evan Mitsui/CBC)</figcaption></figure></div><p dir="ltr">"Chartwatch measures about 100 inputs from [a patient's] medical record that are currently routinely gathered in the process of delivering care," he explained.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md">https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41578483">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true" aria-labelledby="file-name-id-wide file-name-id-mobile"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why wordfreq will not be updated</h2><a id="user-content-why-wordfreq-will-not-be-updated" aria-label="Permalink: Why wordfreq will not be updated" href="#why-wordfreq-will-not-be-updated"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The wordfreq data is a snapshot of language that could be found in various
online sources up through 2021. There are several reasons why it will not be
updated anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Generative AI has polluted the data</h2><a id="user-content-generative-ai-has-polluted-the-data" aria-label="Permalink: Generative AI has polluted the data" href="#generative-ai-has-polluted-the-data"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I don't think anyone has reliable information about post-2021 language usage by
humans.</p>
<p dir="auto">The open Web (via OSCAR) was one of wordfreq's data sources. Now the Web at
large is full of slop generated by large language models, written by no one to
communicate nothing. Including this slop in the data skews the word
frequencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sure, there was spam in the wordfreq data sources, but it was manageable and
often identifiable. Large language models generate text that masquerades as
real language with intention behind it, even though there is none, and their
output crops up everywhere.</p>
<p dir="auto">As one example, <a href="https://pshapira.net/2024/03/31/delving-into-delve/" rel="nofollow">Philip Shapira
reports</a> that ChatGPT
(OpenAI's popular brand of generative language model circa 2024) is obsessed
with the word "delve" in a way that people never have been, and caused its
overall frequency to increase by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Information that used to be free became expensive</h2><a id="user-content-information-that-used-to-be-free-became-expensive" aria-label="Permalink: Information that used to be free became expensive" href="#information-that-used-to-be-free-became-expensive"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq is not just concerned with formal printed words. It collected more
conversational language usage from two sources in particular: Twitter and
Reddit.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Twitter data was always built on sand. Even when Twitter allowed free
access to a portion of their "firehose", the terms of use did not allow me to
distribute that data outside of the company where I collected it (Luminoso).
wordfreq has the frequencies that were built with that data as input, but the
collected data didn't belong to me and I don't have it anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now Twitter is gone anyway, its public APIs have shut down, and the site has
been replaced with an oligarch's plaything, a spam-infested right-wing cesspool
called X. Even if X made its raw data feed available (which it doesn't), there
would be no valuable information to be found there.</p>
<p dir="auto">Reddit also stopped providing public data archives, and now they sell their
archives at a price that only OpenAI will pay.</p>
<p dir="auto">And given what's happening to the field, I don't blame them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">I don't want to be part of this scene anymore</h2><a id="user-content-i-dont-want-to-be-part-of-this-scene-anymore" aria-label="Permalink: I don't want to be part of this scene anymore" href="#i-dont-want-to-be-part-of-this-scene-anymore"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq used to be at the intersection of my interests. I was doing corpus
linguistics in a way that could also benefit natural language processing tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">The field I know as "natural language processing" is hard to find these days.
It's all being devoured by generative AI. Other techniques still exist but
generative AI sucks up all the air in the room and gets all the money. It's
rare to see NLP research that doesn't have a dependency on closed data
controlled by OpenAI and Google, two companies that I already despise.</p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq was built by collecting a whole lot of text in a lot of languages.
That used to be a pretty reasonable thing to do, and not the kind of thing
someone would be likely to object to. Now, the text-slurping tools are mostly
used for training generative AI, and people are quite rightly on the defensive.
If someone is collecting all the text from your books, articles, Web site, or
public posts, it's very likely because they are creating a plagiarism machine
that will claim your words as its own.</p>
<p dir="auto">So I don't want to work on anything that could be confused with generative AI,
or that could benefit generative AI.</p>
<p dir="auto">OpenAI and Google can collect their own damn data. I hope they have to pay a
very high price for it, and I hope they're constantly cursing the mess that
they made themselves.</p>

</p>


    <p>There was a time when software (and games! Games are just software for fun!) were distributed on DVD. A physical disk that you would insert into your system to load up software and install. This was the 2000's, when computers prided themselves on being personal computation devices. A <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chromebook</a> was a curiosity at the time, promising to run most of your software in "someone else's computer"; all you needed was the internet and the interface. The Chromebook was a reckoning. Through the 2010's we slowly moved into the clouds of various giants; it was the easy way to compute. The giants were renting out services - subscriptions started gaining foothold as the second best way to make money online after advertisements - and we were happy to give away the control in exchange for convenience. A minor consequence of this is that an entire generation of computer scientists hasn't had the opportunity to start off as computer enthusiasts - the primordial hacker mindset is slowly waning in prominence.</p>
<p>It is 2024, and I say it is time we revisited some of the fundamental joys of setting up our own systems.</p>
<p>Why? Good question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophically, it is a form of rebellion, carving out a niche in a world dominated by monopolies, resisting the forces that be from having complete control over our digital selves. Showing the world a <em>different</em> way of living. One of the last bastions of online freedom, self-hosters stand alongside open-source-ers, data-hoard-ers, privacy-ers, matrix/activity-pub/decentralized-tech-ers, piracy-ers, de-google-ers and hack-ers.</li>
<li>Practically, it is foolishness, for what you save in money you lose in time and sanity. Seriously, else-hosting is the practical option, let someone else worry about the reliability, concurrency, redundancy and availability of your systems.</li>
<li>Intellectually, it is the digital garage of constant tweaking of systems, a source of zen and arcane knowledge. Where you retire after a day's work to work on your favourite toys.</li>
</ul>
<p>So most importantly, it is supposed to be fun. A hobby.</p>
<p>And like every hobby there are a lot of gatekeepers. People who believe having a personal server that you can <em>touch</em> is a necessity to call yourself a self-hoster. Eh. Don't listen to them. Self-hosting is as much about the software as it is about the hardware. I say we get the enthusiasts by any means necessary; they will eventually grow into full-fledged self-hosting. Or not. It doesn't matter! This is supposed to be fun, why are you stopping people from having fun?</p>
<p>And so, here is a gentle introduction to self-hosting that is not "true self-hosting", but whatever. Sue me. We will operate at the software level only, and laugh at the feeble protestations of the rigidly-defined self-hoster loyalists. We will dispense with the heavy prose after this point.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/uberspace.png" alt="uberspace"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shared web hosting service is a web hosting service where many services reside on one web server connected to the Internet. The overall cost of server maintenance is spread over many customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need a space to host. I recommend <a href="https://uberspace.de/en/">Uberspace</a>. They are the most heart-warmingly nice people about hosting; they operate on the idea of "here's a screwdriver, try not to burn down the building, but have fun". Excellent.</p>
<p>So, make an account on Uberspace - did I also mention that you pay after the month ends, so technically everyone gets a free month of trial? I mean, can they get more awesome? (pst, they do).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Secure Shell Protocol is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the cool part: you now have SSH access to a computer in the cloud with 10GB of storage and 1.5GB of RAM. Go ahead, do it now. Run <code>ls</code> to be greeted by your brand spanking new empty user directory.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-software">The Software</h3><p>What to do, what to install‚Ä¶. I will give you two resources to peruse.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lab.uberspace.de/">Uberspace Labs</a> - An Uberspace specific installation guide to various software that you can play around with on Uberspace. Highly recommend searching for anything you want here first.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">Awesome-Selfhosted</a> - A broader listing of self-hostable software. If it is on here, it means there is a decent amount of community behind that software; it should cover 90% of the broadly self-hostable programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot use Docker in Uberspace. The memory constraints are too low to run a full virtualization suite. Which is a bummer for the larger software and docker-only installations <strong>but</strong> there are workarounds for it. You can install software from source or pull the final run-time from the dockerisation process and use it as a build image (I leave this as an exercise for the intrepid reader :)).</p>
<p><em>But what exactly do I install first??</em>  Alright, alright. Author suggests the following two trackers - one for finance, and one for videos and website updates.</p>
<h3 id="actual-budget">Actual Budget</h3><p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/actual.png" alt="actual"></p>
<p>Have you always wanted a way to track your finances - expenditures, net worth, spend patterns, etc.? Have also been wary of putting all this sensitive information in the hands of others? What if there was a way to be in control of your data, yet have it accessible across the world via a browser?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://actualbudget.com/"><em>Actual Budget</em></a> is a super fast and privacy-focused app for managing your finances. At its heart is the well proven and much loved Envelope Budgeting methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use this and I have written a guide on how to install this <a href="https://lab.uberspace.de/guide_actual/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure to peek into the reports section - you should be able to slice and dice your finances and gain tons of insight out of it. For instance, turns out what I considered to be minor purchases actually add up over the month, and I spend an inordinate amount of money on commute!</p>
<h3 id="miniflux">Miniflux</h3><p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/miniflux.png" alt="miniflux"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://miniflux.app/"><em>Miniflux</em></a> is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a way to keep track of your favourite news outlets and magazines, be posted on the latest blog posts of your favourite writers. You could also build a dedicated ad-free feed timeline of your YouTube subscriptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>RSS</em> (<em>Really Simple Syndication</em>) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitor sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bonus</em>: YouTube has an RSS feed and the embedded YouTube player is ad-free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install <em>Miniflux</em> on Uberspace. Add feeds of your favourite YouTube channels. Hop into settings and enable Fever API.</p>
<p>Now any RSS client which is capable of reading from the Fever API should be able to access your RSS aggregator in the cloud. If you are in the Apple ecosystem I highly recommend <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/">Unread</a> by Golden Hill Software.</p>
<p>With this I have a dedicated recent first timeline of all the videos as they are released.</p>
<p>I also have separate categories of feed for news and comics - there is a ton of webcomics out there beyond <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>, <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/">smbc</a> and <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/">oatmeal</a> - a great way to catch up is via RSS.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="bonus-your-domain">Bonus: Your Domain</h3><p>The coolest part about self-hosting is showing off your stuff. What better way to show off your things than to have a personal domain - a place you can call your own. Head over to a domain name registrar and grab a site on the net-estate. I suggest <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a>.</p>
<p>Now you have a bunch of extraordinary things you can do. With something like <code>awesauce.com</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can point the various services you host on Uberspace to subdomains of your main site. Show off your <code>actual.awesauce.com</code> and <code>miniflux.awesauce.com</code>!</li>
<li>Check with your email provider if they allow you to set up custom domain. You may have to pay for the privilege. Once done you have achieved another freedom - now you can shift the underlying email service provider while keeping the address the same. All mails, for forever, can come to <code>contact@awesauce.com</code>. Woohoo!</li>
<li>Point a subdomain or a URL path to your GitHub repository and host publicly accessible files like your resume: <code>awesauce.com/files/resume.pdf</code></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This has not been a detailed step by step walkthrough on how to do things, by design. You are meant to go and explore; this is simply a way pointer to invigorate your curiosities.</p>
<p>Here is a final reader's exercise: Figure out a way to send yourself a mobile notification when a particular item comes back in stock or website changes :D</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/knhash/changedetection.png" alt="changedetection"></p>
<hr>
<p>This made it to the HackerNews front page, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41577156">head over there</a> for some good discussion around the topic.</p>

<p>Bear with me till the end.</p>

<p>I work in the same office as Anna, EY Pune and in the same cluster. </p>

<p>The death of Anna was informed via a centralised mail in which they attached her linkedin picture with some standard short message like RIP. News was put in the grapevine that she was already suffering from a health condition which got worse. </p>

<p>Though I haven't worked directly with her, I've worked with her manager, who is worse than how it's portrayed in the letter. He actually prioritises his convenience (like cricket) and he doesn't really care for anyone's time or effort. He proudly bought IPL final tickets in deadline at exorbitant prices and showed off on insta. He takes all the credit himself, and blames the team for any shortfalls (classic manager behaviour). Boasts all day everyday. When he reviews your work, his focus is not on the correctness of work, he points out as many mistakes as he could, depicting how smart he is, and in other words how dumb you are.</p>

<p>Her assistant manager, she's atrocious. Basically what the asst manager does is distribute work to the team and follow up from each one. Ensure no one is stress free, no one is taking time off. Basically they highlight their potential by getting work done from lesser people (like work of 5/6 resources from 2 resources) in order to get promoted. It is said in common language that you can trust and deal with a drunken man out of his mind, but not an AM. Every AM is the embodiment of this statement.</p>

<p>I have been working in EY for quite some time now, and I have seen people come and go. People who come here (generally) are very hardworking people who have thirst for learning and they are ready to work day and night. Australian timings, European timings, US timings, you name it. Seasoned people exploit these newcomers like anything. And these senior people have power. Good deal of power. They can make your life a living hell if you don't co-operate with them. Try reporting to HR, then you'll get to know he's part of this structure too. They have the audacity to use profane language in reviews. Newly qualified CAs and articles come all the way from their states like Kashmir, Punjab, TN, sacrificing everything just to learn and get good exposure. But it's a bloodbath.  All these people are school toppers of their time. It seems apparent that years of mind numbing toil wasn't enough.They're humiliated to an extent where they lose their respect in their own eyes. Humiliation in the team calls is quite normal here. And these newcomers are from small families who teach them to respect elders and not react to any unreasonable behaviour, not to say NO to any work, give your heart and soul to the work you do. Everyone of us went through this thinking maybe something is wrong with me, if everyone is able to handle this pressure I should handle it too. Female employees may get some leniency but for our male colleagues it's absolutely brutal. Everyone is tortured to hell. No social life, no personal time, no time to attend even phone calls. Most of the newcomers including articles quit, some endure the trouble for some years and then quit, remaining become managers and become trouble for others.</p>

<p>We average 16 hours a day in the busy season, and 12 hours a day in non busy seasons. No weekends or public holidays are off. Annually EY voluntarily announces a day off to rejuvenate their employees. And yes you guessed it right! Even that is not off. We work on that day as well - from Office! Overwork is the only way to get promoted, do and make others do it. </p>

<p>Top level people (Partners) don't care about sh<em>t. You don't even get to interact with partners until you're at least an asst manager. They don't give a f</em>*k about any employee, they just care about getting work done. Even if you go through boiling hell and get the work done, you won't get any acknowledgement from anyone forget about appreciation. One of my colleagues was hospitalized suffering from Dengue, and these people made him make workpapers from his hospital bed. Good for him he quit then and there. When I say these people are inhuman, they literally are.</p>

<p>People leaving EY are usually very happy, and their colleagues congratulate them like they are being released from prison. </p>

<p>It's my request to all my colleagues reading this message - please reevaluate your priorities, see what you're really doing to yourself. And to CAs and articles who dream to work in such an organisation - be very careful of what you wish for.</p>

<p>Anna's death has impacted us all. And such letter from Augustine is a conclusive evidence that "already suffering from health issues" was an deliberately created rumour. Hope the effort behind this letter doesn't go in vain. </p>

<p>Support from all suffering employees of EY.</p>

<p>More power to you Augustine.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				
				
				
				
<p>Almost every major website you visit today pops up a banner to warn you that it uses ‚Äúcookies.‚Äù   This is not legally required in the U.S. or in most places, and where it is, the vast majority of sites do not comply with legal requirements.  From a policy perspective: cookie pops are just dumb ‚Äì (virtually) no one reads them.  There are vastly better ways to deal with the issue they present ‚Äì legally and from a site usability perspective. </p>



<p>First, no current U.S. law requires cookie pop-ups.   <em>Some</em> sites that are available in the European Union are required to post cookie pop ups ‚Äì sites that use so called ‚Äútracking cookies.‚Äù  I discuss below a recent EU case that makes this issue even worse than one would have originally thought. </p>



<p>Second, an anecdotal review of websites shows the vast, <em>vast</em> majority of them ‚Äì all of them in my experience that are ‚ÄúU.S.‚Äù sites ‚Äì utterly fail to comply with the so called EU ‚Äúcookie law.‚Äù  Why?  Because they store the cookie before consent (which is not permitted under the cookie law) and they simply state, ‚ÄúThis site uses cookies‚Äù and present an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button (and/or an X to close the pop up) with a link to the privacy policy.  See for example <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/">www.abajournal.com</a> which, as of the date of this post, simply provides an OK button ‚Äì no option to do anything like reject or manage the cookies, and a link to the privacy policy.   Just a useless and legally insufficient user interface distraction.  </p>



<p>Finally, except in very, very limited cases, these cookie pops do not in any way increase user privacy protection.   Why?  If a site does comply with the notice and consent requirements, <em>it is not legally required to provide the service if a user declines tracking cookies.</em>  The site can simply not provide functionality.  So in many cases, its not really a choice ‚Äì the choice is either not to use the site, or consent to tracking.  This is made worse because many governments and third parties use these sites for information dissemination.  A truly privacy focused law would at least require that the site function if a person elected no tracking.  </p>



<p>The whole cookie problem was started by our friends in Europe when they promulgated the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32002L0058">ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC</a>.  However, no U.S. company really started focusing on compliance with the ‚Äúcookie issue‚Äù presented in the ePrivacy Directive until the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union, <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3e485e15-11bd-11e6-ba9a-01aa75ed71a1/language-en">Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 came into effect.  The GDPR applies in Europe, not the US, however so many U.S. companies either do business in, or ostensibly could be regulated by, EU members ‚Äì so they attempt to comply with both U.S.and EU law.  </p>



<p>Many ‚Äúcookies‚Äù ‚Äì  the ones necessary to actually operate a website, are ‚Äúexempt‚Äù and need not be identified nor are they subject to consent.   However, sites that use tracking cookies and other tracking technology ‚Äì even anonymized data ‚Äì are required under EU law to obtain prior consent before even storing the cookie or other technology that allows such tracking.  </p>



<p>In my opinion, this system has been an utter failure in policy and actual impact.   It has not stopped companies from incessant user tracking.  The companies that rely on user tracking have the power to force the choice of ‚Äúallow tracking‚Äù or do not use the service.   The privacy policies remain mostly unintelligible, or at the very least, its is all but impossible to tell what exact tracking a company does, primarily because they either disclose only the types of tracking, or disclose so excessively that the cookie disclosure is indecipherable.  </p>



<p>But the EU is doubling down on the concept . . . </p>



<p>In a recent decision (File number: DOS-2019-0137) of the Dispute Chamber of the Data Protection Authority of Belgium issued 2/2/2022, that regulator held that the European arm of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)‚Äôs ‚Äúpop up‚Äù framework used by most of its members ‚Äì intentionally designed to comply with the GDPR, <strong>in fact did not</strong>.   The decision is lengthy (my machine translated version into English is 139 pages long), and undoubtedly will be appealed.   As an overview, IAB created a real time bidding system (RTB) ‚Äì an automated system of bidding for advertising.  This is their framework in the U.S. and many other countries, but in Europe, they created the ‚ÄúTransparency and Consent Framework‚Äù (TCF).   At issue in this case was a subset of the TCF, which the Board described as follows: ‚ÄúSpecifically for the TCF, there are also the companies that use so-called ‚ÄúConsent Management Platforms‚Äù (CMPs) to offer. Specifically, a CMP takes the form of a pop-up that appears on the first connection to a website appears to request permission from the internet user to collect cookies and other identification data‚Äù Para. 40 (Note, all English translations here are machine created by Google‚Äôs translation service).  The original decision in Dutch is here (and I can post the English translated version if someone requests it): <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/publications/beslissing-ten-gronde-nr.-21-2022.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/publications/beslissing-ten-gronde-nr.-21-2022.pdf</a>.  </p>



<p>The basic idea is that IAB manages a ‚Äúconsensu‚Äù cookie ‚Äì that indicates if the web user has already consented (or rejected) cookies.  So, a participating site would somehow take information from a user‚Äôs initial browser session, send it off to IAB, and IAB would send back a text string indicating if that user had already consented to accept cookies or not.  If not, a ‚Äúcookie pop up‚Äù would be presented to the user.   The Board found that the IAB maintains a database of users and preferences, which can be used ‚Äúin order to create an advertising profile of data subjects and to show them personalized advertising‚Äù  Para. 50.  It therefore concluded the IAB was a data controller (a point the IAB disputed).  From this point forward the Board essentially found nearly every conceivable violation of the GDPR that could be found.  Among them, that ‚ÄúIAB Europe [] failed to observe the principles of due regard for transparency and fairness with regard to data subjects‚Äù in part because some of the information that can be sucked up into the preference model includes ‚Äúspecial categories of personal data ‚Ä¶ For example, participating organizations could become acquainted with the websites previously visited by a data subject, including the political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, health data or also trade union memberships of the data subjects be inferred or disclosed.‚Äù  Para 51.  It also found the IAB‚Äôs privacy policy insufficient because among other reasons it was only available in English, and used unclear vague terms like ‚Äúservices‚Äù and ‚Äúother means.‚Äù  Para. 54.  It also did not like that the terms ‚Äúpartners‚Äù and ‚Äúthird parties‚Äù were not explained sufficiently. </p>



<p>To me this is just evidence that no one really understands the law ‚Äì or that the regulators think it says one thing and the industry thinks it says another.  Not good either way.  But after that decision, it seems like it would be all but impossible to have a centralized ‚Äúcookie consent‚Äù service ‚Äì or to comply, the service would be so intrusive as to make the web experience intolerable.</p>



<p>The solution?  In my view, just stop with the cookie pop ups.  They are stupid and ineffective.  Enact a law that requires a service to respect the do not track signal from a browser (currently entirely voluntary), and not store any tracking cookies, clear gifs or other trackers ‚Äì and require that a site not ‚Äúdiscriminate‚Äù against users who elect no tracking ‚Äì basically ‚Äì provide all functions to users whether they consent or do not consent.  I would also prevent any government organization to use a site that tracks users as a service for information dissemination. </p>

<p>We don‚Äôt typically think of dental cavities as a chronic disease‚Äîin part because of the separation between medicine and dentistry‚Äîbut it is. And it doesn‚Äôt just affect children: most adults in industrialized countries, where sugary food is commonly available, have to deal with this disease process.</p>

<p>I write the word ‚Äúcavity,‚Äù but the phrase ‚Äúdental caries‚Äù is actually more encompassing. First documented in&nbsp;<u><a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merriam-webster.com%2Fdictionary%2Fcaries&amp;data=05%7C02%7Chaleh.cohn%40mail.mcgill.ca%7Cf03015f21ece403afee108dc75da1eef%7Ccd31967152e74a68afa9fcf8f89f09ea%7C0%7C0%7C638514826885498770%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=fV6hWm531mY5HNCQA%2BOggVL5LPnX%2Bz3lcHYc0E7KwWY%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="//www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/caries.

<p>Few people enjoy going to the dentist and being told to reduce their sugar consumption. So, what if there was a pain-free way of avoiding dental caries forever? There is a product you can buy right now that essentially‚Äîthrough interviews and social media endorsements‚Äîpromises to do just that. It‚Äôs a bacterium that you paint onto your teeth. It superinfects your mouth, taking over for the bacteria responsible for caries. A single application lasts a lifetime.</p>

<p>There is, however, a big problem with this product, called Lumina, and it has to do with what happens when we become so focused on a potential solution, dedicating our life to making it work, that we miss important changes in our understanding of the problem itself.</p>

It looked like some sort of mutated version of a streptococcus, so he named it&nbsp;<i>Streptococcus mutans</i>, or&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>for short.</p>

<p>A few decades later,&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>had established itself in the minds of the scientific community as the great culprit behind dental caries, what experts call its etiology, meaning its cause. The bacterium was able to stick to the surface of our teeth and, in processing the sugars in our mouth, it would produce large amounts of acid, specifically lactic acid. Normally, our saliva is able to neutralize a lot of this acid, but&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>secretes complex sugars that create a sort of film over our teeth called plaque, trapping its acid underneath. Over time, the tooth, eroded by the acid, would cavitate and develop a hole.</p>

<p>In the late 1970s, however, a chance event would promise to change the game.

Could we colonize the human mouth with this naturally mutated&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>and thus bid goodbye to cavities?</p>

<p>A good replacement strain, it turns out, needs to meet a number of criteria, not unlike the robots of Isaac Asimov‚Äôs fictional universe which had to abide by the Laws of Robotics. The chosen bacterium must not cause disease, obviously. It should not predispose us to other diseases by disrupting the bacterial ecosystem that exists in our mouth. It has to stay in the mouth for a long time and ensure that the bacterium it is replacing doesn‚Äôt grow back. And because mutations do arise naturally, it has to be genetically stable: it should not be able to regain the ability to produce massive amounts of acid by picking up the gene from a neighbouring bacterium (which does happen in the wild!). Figuring out that the mutated&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>did not fulfill all of these criteria and finding a strain that did led Hillman and colleagues down a very long path.</p>

<p>Caries occur because of a catastrophic shift in the balance of our mouth‚Äôs bacterial and fungal ecosystem. It is not due to any one bacterium, and any bacterium capable of releasing acid after ingesting sugars can contribute to this. Even if you could reliably stop&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>from producing acid, you could not guarantee the absence of future dental caries. The reason why&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>became the Big Bad of the 1970s dentistry world is because researchers were stuck studying the mouth bacteria they could grow in the laboratory, and&nbsp;<i>S. mutans</i>grows well in the conditions scientists were selecting back then.

<p>We are thus left with a product, Lumina, that cannot guarantee the prevention of future caries and whose safety can be summarized by a giant question mark. Is the Mutacin-1140 it releases into the mouth safe in the long term? Can the bacterium be transmitted to a partner via kissing? Is it safe in people with a compromised immune system? Will it upset the oral microbiome in ways that have not been tested for? I wish I had answers.</p>

But in terms of what works to reduce the chances of a dentist announcing you have a cavity, it‚Äôs fairly straightforward: reduce your sugar consumption and use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Our teeth are constantly in the midst of getting demineralized and remineralizing themselves. The acid produced by bacteria in the mouth interferes with remineralization, but the presence of fluoride helps those precious minerals diffuse into the tooth to form new crystals and thus protect the tooth from cavities. That‚Äôs why fluoride is so good for our teeth.</p>

<p>Or you could paint your teeth with an experimental bacterium and see what happens.</p>

<p><strong>Take-home message:</strong><br>
	- Lumina is a genetically engineered version of the Streptococcus mutans bacterium that lives in the mouth, and it is supposed to prevent you from developing dental caries because it does not produce acid<br>
	- It has been poorly studied for safety and effectiveness<br>
	- Streptococcus mutans is actually neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of dental caries; the disease actually comes about because of a shift in the equilibrium of bacteria in the mouth which encourages the demineralization of our teeth</p>

                <p>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Sept.  17, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The independent directors of the Board of 23andMe Holding Co. (Nasdaq: ME), today sent the following letter to Anne Wojcicki, Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder, and Chair of the Board of Directors of 23andMe, in which the independent directors have provided their resignation from the Board, effective immediately:<br></p>  <p>Dear Anne,</p>  <p>We, the independent directors of the 23andMe Board, hereby tender our resignations, effective immediately.</p>  <p>After months of work, we have yet to receive from you a fully financed, fully diligenced, actionable proposal that is in the best interests of the non-affiliated shareholders. We believe the Special Committee and the Board have provided ample time for you to submit such a proposal. That we have not seen any notable progress over the last 5 months leads us to believe no such proposal is forthcoming. The Special Committee is therefore unwilling to consider further extensions, and the Board agrees with the Special Committee‚Äôs determination.</p>  <p>While we continue to wholeheartedly support the Company‚Äôs mission and believe deeply in the value of the personalized health and wellness offering that you have articulated, it is also clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward. Because of that difference and because of your concentrated voting power, we believe that it is in the best interests of the Company‚Äôs shareholders that we resign from the Board rather than have a protracted and distracting difference of view with you as to the direction of the Company.</p>  <p>We are proud of what 23andMe has achieved in pioneering direct access to genetic information, and we have been honored to have had the opportunity to be part of those efforts.</p>  <p>Sincerely,</p>  <p>/s/</p>  <p>Roelof Botha, Patrick Chung, Sandra Hern√°ndez, M.D., Neal Mohan, Valerie Montgomery Rice M.D., Richard Scheller, Ph.D., Peter J.

<p>None of the bread and butter of programming as we know it is here: conditionals and loops are nowhere to be seen, there is no way to create functions‚Ä¶ heck, variables don‚Äôt even have names!</p>

<p>Where does one even start?</p>

<p>This little introduction is meant to introduce you, somebody with programming experience, to the world of assembly. We‚Äôll discuss the basics of the language and map them to high-level programming constructs.</p>

<p>By the end of this guide, you will be able to navigate assembly code, know where to look for information, and even write some simple programs all by yourself.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs get started!</p>

<h2 id="hello-world">Hello world</h2>

<p>Unsurprisingly, our first program will be a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù.</p>

<p>Before jumping into the code though, we need to briefly introduce the language we‚Äôll be using. At the end of this section, we will be able to write and run our first assembly program.</p>

<h3 id="x86-64-assembly">x86-64 assembly</h3>

<p>First things first, assembly is not a language.</p>

<p>Assembly refers to a <em>family of programming languages</em> featuring instructions that closely map to the machine code that the CPU will execute. In fact, one of the raisons d‚Äôetre of assembly languages is to provide a human-readable version of machine code in situations like reverse engineering, hardware programming, or developing games for consoles.</p>

<p>In this guide, we will use <em>x86-64 assembly</em> which can be assembled and executed on most personal computers. This choice should ease running and tinkering with the snippets along the way.</p>

<p>For historical reasons, there are two ‚Äúflavors‚Äù of the x64-64 assembly syntax: one called <em>Intel</em> and the other is called <em>AT&amp;T</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In this guide we will stick to the <em>Intel</em> dialect because it‚Äôs used by the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel Software Developer Manuals (SDM)</a>, the source of truth on what the CPU <em>really</em> does when fed an instruction.</p>

<p>Assembly is all about working close to the hardware. Optimizimg for portability of the code examples across operative systems and architactures would obfuscate the content of this introduction.</p>

<p>The snippets we will be written for Linux, and they should run fine on Window‚Äôs WSL as well. The general concepts and practices are nonetheless valid regardless of your OS of choice.</p>

<h3 id="anatomy-of-an-instruction">Anatomy of an instruction</h3>

<p>Instructions are the way we tell the CPU what to do. They look something like this:</p>



<p>They represent the smallest unit of assembly language and are mostly composed of two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>mnemonic</strong>: a shortened word or sentence that specifies the operation to be performed</li>
  <li><strong>operands</strong>: a list of 0-3 items representing what‚Äôs affected by the operation</li>
</ul>

<p>In our example, the mnemonic is <code>mov</code>, which stands for <em>move</em>, and the operands are <code>rax</code> and <code>rbx</code>. This instruction in plain English would read: move the content of <code>rbx</code> in <code>rax</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p><code>rax</code> and <code>rbx</code> are registers and we will introduce them in the next paragraph. In the meantime, you can imagine them as variables holding a value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some instructions will have more then mnemonic and operands. Additional parts such as <em>prefixes</em> and <em>size directives</em> will only be needed later, and we‚Äôll talk through them at the right moment.</p>

<p>Fear not, there is no need to memorize all the possible instructions now. Whenever we‚Äôll come across new operations, we will discuss them, and with repetition you will remember in no time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel Software Developer Manuals (SDM)</a> will be our instruction reference in the next chapters. Keep it handy!</p>

<h3 id="storing-data-registers">Storing data: Registers</h3>

<p>You can think of registers as storage space baked right into the CPU itself. They are small and incredibly fast to access.</p>

<p>The most common registers are the so-called <em>general purpose</em> registers. In x86-64 they are sixteen in total, and they are 64 bits wide.</p>

<p>One can access the whole register or a subset by using different names. For example, using <code>rax</code> (as in the code above) would address all the 64 bits in the <code>rax</code> register. With <code>al</code>, you can access the lower byte of the same register.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Register</th>
      <th>Higher byte</th>
      <th>Lower byte</th>
      <th>Lower 2 bytes¬π</th>
      <th>Lower 4 bytes¬≤</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

    <tr>

<p>General purpose means that they can store anything in principle. In practice, we‚Äôll see that some registers have special meanings, some instructions only use certain registers, and some conventions dictate who is expected to write where.</p>

<p>The only non-general-purpose register we will be concerned with is <code>rip</code> the <em>instruction pointer</em> register. It holds the address of the next instruction to execute, and therefore, modifying <code>rip</code> allows programs to jump to arbitrary instructions in the code.</p>

<h3 id="our-first-assembly-file">Our first assembly file</h3>

<p>Assembly files typically have an <code>.s</code> or <code>.asm</code> extension and they are split in three sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>data</strong>: where we define constants and initialized variables;</li>
  <li><strong>bss</strong>: where we define non-initialized variables;</li>
  <li><strong>text</strong>: where we will type our code, this is the only mandatory section of the file.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code><span>section</span> <span>.data</span>
  <span>; constants here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.bss</span>
  <span>; variables here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.text</span>
  <span>; code here</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>The semicolon <code>;</code> is the comment character: whatever comes after it will not be executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assembly programs run as you would expect. They start with the first instruction and sequentially execute one instruction after the other, from top to bottom. To create control flow, such as conditionals and loops, we make our programs ‚Äòjump‚Äô to specific instructions. We will look at jumps in detail in the next sections.</p>

<p>Just as you‚Äôd use a <code>main</code> function in many high-level languages, assembly requires us to specify an entry point for our program. We do this using the <code>global</code> declaration, which points to a <em>label</em>.</p>

<p>Labels are the assembly‚Äôs way of giving human-readable names to specific instructions. They serve two purposes: making our code more understandable and allowing us to reference these instructions elsewhere in our program. You can declare a label by writing it followed by a colon, like this: <code>label:</code>. When you want to reference a label (for example, in a jump instruction), use it without the colon: <code>label</code>.</p>

<p>Typically, <code>global</code> references a <code>_start</code> label declared immediately after it. That is where our program will start executing.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>section</span> <span>.data</span>
  <span>; constants here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.bss</span>
  <span>; variables here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.text</span>
  <span>global</span> <span>_start</span>
<span>_start:</span>
  <span>; instructions here</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="at-last-hello-world">At last, ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù</h3>

<p>Finally, we have all the tools to build software in assembly. Very Nice!</p>

<p>Our program will use two system calls: <code>sys_write</code> to print characters in a terminal and <code>exit</code> to terminate the process with a given status code.</p>

<p>Using syscalls goes like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>select the syscall to invoke by moving its identifier in <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>pass arguments to the syscall by populating appropriate registers</li>
  <li>use the <code>syscall</code> instruction to fire the call</li>
</ul>

<p>The only other instruction we will use is <code>mov</code> which we have seen in the instruction paragraph. It works pretty much like an assignment (the <code>=</code> operator) in many high-level languages: it moves the content of the second operand into the first operand.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at the code to see how this plays together.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Coding along</strong></p>

  <p>Throughout this series, we‚Äôll use an embedded editor to tinker with the code and run the examples as we go. The same content can be found in the sibling repository <a href="https://github.com/shikaan/x86-64-asm-intro">shikaan/x86-64-asm-intro</a> if you want to run locally.</p>

<p>In this first article, we learned some basic assembly concepts, we cut our teeth on its syntax, and we even wrote some working software.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-19065">

<p>I wrote a decade ago about the <a href="https://conversableeconomist.com/2014/07/16/double-irish-dutch-sandwich/" title="">Double Irish Dutch Sandwich</a>, a strategy for corporations to evade taxes that was widespread and large-scale enough to come to the attention of the International Monetary Fund. But due to various changes in national and international tax agreements, the strategy seems to have faded substantially. Ana Maria Santacreu and&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Samuel Moore  of the St. Louis Fed provide some background in ‚Äú<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/aug/unpacking-discrepancies-american-irish-royalty-reporting" title="">Unpacking Discrepancies in American and Irish Royalty Reporting</a>‚Äù (August 08, 2024). </p>



<p>For those who don‚Äôt keep up to speed on the details of international tax evasion schemes, Santacreu and Moore describe the Double Irish Dutch Sandwich works like this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich tax scheme, as illustrated in the third figure, involved a complex arrangement between a U.S. parent company (USP) and three foreign subsidiaries. The first Irish subsidiary (I1) was incorporated in Ireland but managed from Bermuda, allowing it to avoid both Irish and U.S. taxes. The second Irish subsidiary (I2) was incorporated and managed in Ireland. The purpose of I2 is to control foreign distribution and collect income. A Dutch subsidiary (N) acted as an intermediary between I2 and I1 to avoid Irish taxes.</p>



<p>The scheme worked by exploiting specific provisions in Irish and U.S. tax laws. A USP would transfer intellectual property ownership to I1. Then, I2 would sublicense the intellectual property from I1 and pay royalties. These royalties would flow from I2 to N, and then from N to I1, taking advantage of European Union tax regulations. This structure allowed profits to be shifted to tax havens like Bermuda, effectively minimizing tax liabilities for the entire corporate structure.</p>

<p>However, a combination of Irish tax reforms in 2015 and changes in the <a href="https://conversableeconomist.com/2024/08/12/us-tax-policy-the-coming-storm-in-2025/" title="">US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 </a>made this strategy ineffective: ‚ÄúConsequently, Irish companies began paying royalties directly to American parent companies instead of routing them through tax havens.‚Äù</p>



<p>The shifts in royalty payments tell the story. This figure shows royalty payments by Irish companies to the US, which doubled from since 2019 to 2021. </p>

<p>Conversely, tax payments from Ireland and from Netherlands to Bermuda, well-known for it‚Äôs near-zero corporate taxes, went way down‚Äìshowing a decilne in corporate profits being routed through Bermuda. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm sure the international tax lawyers around the world are strategizing new tax evasion strategies even as I write these words. But it‚Äôs worth remembering that there are two large costs at play here. The obvious loss is to government revenue, but the more subtle and still very real loss is the diversion of high-powered talent from what could have been gains in efficiency and productivity to focus instead on corporate reorganizations and tax evasion games. </p>

<p>When you enter a hostname in your web browser (e.g., apple.com), that name must first be translated into an IP address so your computer can connect to the server. This lookup is usually performed unencrypted, meaning your Internet provider and other parties monitoring your connection can see which sites you visit. To protect these lookups from prying eyes, Little Snitch 6 offers a new feature: DNS encryption. With DNS encryption enabled, all name lookups are routed through Little Snitch and performed in encrypted form.</p>
<p>For this purpose, Little Snitch registers a DNS proxy. macOS then sends <strong>all</strong> DNS requests to that proxy, which in turn performs the lookup in encrypted form. The key point here is that <strong>all</strong> requests must be routed through the proxy.</p>
<h2>But‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>While investigating a DNS-related issue on macOS 15 Sequoia, we discovered that some DNS requests‚Äîparticularly those made via certain low-level legacy APIs‚Äîwere not being received by our proxy!</p>
<p>There appears to be a bug in macOS Sequoia causing <strong>some</strong> requests to bypass the installed DNS proxy and be sent unencrypted to the system‚Äôs default name server instead.</p>
<p>Note that this bug likely affects any kind of DNS proxy, not just Little Snitch.</p>
<p>So, if you rely on the new DNS encryption feature of Little Snitch 6, or if you are using another third-party DNS proxy, be aware that some DNS lookups may bypass the proxy until Apple provides a fix in a future macOS update.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> DNS lookups performed via higher-level APIs do not appear to be affected by this bug. For example, your web-browsing in Safari or Chrome still fully benefits from encrypted lookups. Firefox, on the other hand, does seem to be affected.</p>
<h2>How to Reproduce</h2>
<ol>
<li>Enable DNS encryption in Little Snitch &gt; Settings.</li>
<li>Start <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> with a capture filter for <code>port 53</code>.</li>
<li>Run the following code in an Xcode playground:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>import Foundation

let domain = "dnsproxytest.com"
var result: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;addrinfo&gt;?
let status = getaddrinfo(domain, nil, nil, &amp; result)</code></pre>
<p>You will notice that the lookup for <code>dnsproxytest.com</code> can be seen in Wireshark in unencrypted form on UDP port 53 (the default for unencrypted lookups).</p>
<p>Additionally, you will see that Little Snitch Network Monitor does not display any traffic for the lookup because the lookup completely bypasses the network filter!</p>
<p>We have reported this bug to Apple and hope for a fix soon. Please stay tuned, we will keep you updated here.</p>
<h2>Update 2024-09-17, 7:10 p.m.</h2>
<p>After further investigation, we found that this bug has already existed at least since macOS 14.5 Sonoma (maybe even earlier, but we currently don‚Äôt have access to an older 14.x system for testing).</p></section>

  <p>We‚Äôre delighted to announce the general availability of Swift 6. This is a major new release that expands Swift to more platforms and domains.</p>

<p>Many people know of Swift as a language for app development, with a million apps on the App Store. But Swift is great for more than just apps. Swift‚Äôs safety, speed, and approachability make it a great choice for many other use cases including libraries, internet-scale services, and the most performance-critical and secure code.</p>

<p>Swift 6 scales even further through new low-level programming features, an embedded Swift language subset, expanded Linux and Windows support, new cross-platform APIs including the new Swift Testing library, and more.</p>

<p>Read on for a deep dive into changes to the language, standard libraries, debugging, platform support, and next steps for getting started with Swift 6.</p>

<h2 id="language-and-standard-library">Language and Standard Library <a title="Permalink for Language and Standard Library section" href="#language-and-standard-library">
            <!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?--> 
          </a></h2>



<p>Swift has long offered memory safety, ensuring that variables are initialized before they‚Äôre used, memory isn‚Äôt accessed after it‚Äôs been deallocated, and array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.  Swift 6 now includes a new, opt-in language mode that extends Swift‚Äôs safety guarantees to prevent data races in concurrent code by diagnosing potential data races in your code as compiler errors.</p>

<p>Data-race safety checks were previously available as warnings in Swift 5.10 through the <code>-strict-concurrency=complete</code> compiler flag. Thanks to improved <code>Sendable</code> inference and new compiler analysis for transferring mutable state from one actor to another, Swift 6 warnings about data-race safety have fewer false positives. You can find more information about the Swift 6 language mode and how to migrate at <a href="http://swift.org/migration">Swift.org/migration</a>.</p>

<p>Swift 6 marks the start of the journey to make data-race safety dramatically easier. The usability of data-race safety remains an area of active development, and your feedback will help shape future improvements.</p>

<p>Swift 6 also comes with a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/synchronization">Synchronization library</a> for low-level concurrency APIs, including atomic operations and a new mutex API.</p>



<p>Swift 6 enables functions to specify the type of error that they throw as part of their signature. This feature is useful in generic code that forwards along errors thrown in client code, or in resource-constrained environments that cannot allocate memory, such as in embedded Swift code.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>parseRecord</span><span>(</span><span>from</span> <span>string</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span><span>(</span><span>ParseError</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Record</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>// ... </span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A call to <code>parseRecord(from:)</code> will either return a <code>Record</code> instance or throw an error of type <code>ParseError</code>. A <code>do..catch</code> block will infer <code>ParseError</code> as the type of the <code>error</code> variable:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>do</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>record</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>parseRecord</span><span>(</span><span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>myString</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// 'error' has type 'ParseError'</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Typed throws generalizes over throwing and non-throwing functions. A function that is specified as <code>throws</code> (without a specific error type) is equivalent to one that specifies <code>throws(any Error)</code>, whereas a non-throwing function is equivalent to one that specifies <code>throws(Never)</code>. Calls to functions that are <code>throws(Never)</code> are non-throwing and don‚Äôt require error handling at the call site.</p>

<p>Typed throws can also be used in generic functions to propagate error types from parameters, in a manner that is more precise than <code>rethrows</code>. For example, the <code>Sequence.map</code> method can propagate the thrown error type from its closure parameter, indicating that it only throws the same type of errors as the closure:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>extension</span> <span>Sequence</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>func</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>Element</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span><span>(</span><span>E</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span><span>(</span><span>E</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>T</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span> 
    <span>// ... </span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When given a closure that throws <code>ParseError</code>, <code>map</code> will throw <code>ParseError</code>. When given a non-throwing closure, <code>E</code> is inferred to <code>Never</code> and <code>map</code> will not throw.</p>



<p>Swift 5.9 introduced non-copyable types with the <code>~Copyable</code> syntax for modeling resources with unique ownership, and writing performance-conscious code by eliminating the runtime overhead associated with copying. Swift 6 now supports these types with the generics system, making it possible to write generic code that works with both copyable and non-copyable types.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>protocol</span> <span>Drinkable</span><span>:</span> <span>~Copyable</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>consuming</span> <span>func</span> <span>use</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Coffee</span><span>:</span> <span>Drinkable</span><span>,</span> <span>~Copyable</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* ... */</span> <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Water</span><span>:</span> <span>Drinkable</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* ... */</span> <span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>drink</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>consuming</span> <span>some</span> <span>Drinkable</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>~Copyable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>drink</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>Coffee</span><span>())</span>
<span>drink</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>Water</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>Drinkable</code> protocol has no requirement that its conforming types are <code>Copyable</code>. This means both the non-copyable type <code>Coffee</code> and copyable type <code>Water</code> can be passed into the generic <code>drink</code> function.</p>

<p>Switch statements can now be written to avoid copying within enum pattern-matching operations. This means that switch statements can be used with non-copyable payloads and can also provide performance benefits for copyable payloads, especially those based on copy-on-write containers like <code>Array</code> and <code>Dictionary</code>.</p>

<p>Non-copyable types are already used throughout the standard libraries. For instance, the new <code>Atomic</code> type in the Synchronization library is based on <code>~Copyable</code>, <code>Optional</code> and <code>Result</code> can now wrap non-copyable types, and the unsafe buffer pointer types can now point to non-copyable elements. C++ interoperability also uses non-copyable types to expose C++ move-only types to Swift.</p>



<p>Swift 5.9 introduced bidirectional interoperability with C++ to seamlessly bring Swift to more existing projects. Swift 6 expands interoperability support to C++ move-only types, virtual methods, default arguments, and more standard library types including <code>std::map</code> and <code>std::optional</code>.</p>

<p>C++ types that do not have a copy constructor can now be accessed from Swift 6 as non-copyable types with <code>~Copyable</code>. And for those times when it‚Äôs useful to expose a C++ type with a copy constructor as <code>~Copyable</code> in Swift for better performance, a new <code>SWIFT_NONCOPYABLE</code> annotation can be applied to the C++ type.</p>

<p>Swift now also supports calls of C++ virtual methods on types annotated as <code>SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE</code> or <code>SWIFT_IMMORTAL_REFERENCE</code>.</p>

<p>When calling C++ functions or methods that have default argument values for some of their parameters, Swift now respects these default values, rather than requiring you to explicitly pass an argument.</p>



<p>Swift 6 includes a preview of <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/embedded-swift.md">Embedded Swift</a>, a language subset and compilation mode suitable for embedded software development, such as programming microcontrollers. The toolchain supports ARM and RISC-V bare-metal targets.</p>

<p>Embedded Swift produces small and standalone binaries by relying on generic specialization. Since it doesn‚Äôt rely on a runtime or type metadata, Embedded Swift is suitable for platforms with tight memory constraints as well as use in low-level environments with limited runtime dependencies.</p>

<p>Embedded Swift remains an experimental feature, with ongoing development before stable support in a future Swift release.</p>



<p>Swift 6 rounds out the set of low-level integer primitives with the addition of signed and unsigned <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0425-int128.md">128-bit integer types</a>. These are available on all Swift platforms, and provide the same API as other fixed-width integer types in the standard library.</p>



<p>Swift 6 introduces a number of productivity enhancements, including <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence/count(where:)"><code>count(where:)</code></a> to streamline counting the number of elements in a sequence that satisfy a predicate, <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/pack-iteration/">pack iteration</a> for writing natural <code>for</code>-loops over the elements in a value parameter pack, access control for imports to keep implementation details from leaking into your public APIs, <code>@attached(body)</code> macros for synthesizing and augmenting function implementations, expression macros as default arguments, and more.</p>

<p>You can find a complete list of language proposals that were accepted through the <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution">Swift Evolution</a> process and implemented in Swift 6 on the <a href="https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution/#?version=6.0">Swift Evolution dashboard</a>.</p>





<p>Swift 6 provides a new debugging macro to easily customize how an object is displayed in LLDB when using the <code>p</code> command, and in the variables view in Xcode and VSCode, by using a formatting scheme that does not run arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Types that conform to <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code> provide a <code>debugDescription</code> property that returns a string describing the object. In LLDB, the <code>po</code> command calls this computed property on an object. In contrast, the <code>p</code> command uses LLDB‚Äôs type summary formatters to directly format the object using its stored property values.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugdescription()"><code>@DebugDescription</code></a> is a new macro in the standard library which lets you specify LLDB type summaries for your own types directly in code. The macro processes the <code>debugDescription</code> property, translating simple string interpolations involving stored properties into LLDB type summaries. This allows LLDB to use your custom formatting even when using <code>p</code>, and also in Xcode or VSCode‚Äôs variable display windows. The macro can use an existing conformance to <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code>, or you can provide a separate string interpolation only for use in LLDB‚Äôs <code>p</code> command. Providing a separate LLDB description string is useful if your <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code> implementation doesn‚Äôt meet the requirements of the <code>@DebugDescription</code> macro, or if you‚Äôre familiar with the <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/use/variable.html#summary-strings">LLDB Summary String syntax</a> and you want to use it directly.</p>

<p>For example, the following code customizes how <code>po</code> in LLDB displays the <code>Organization</code> type with a conformance to <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code>, and the <code>@DebugDescription</code> macro exposes this custom formatting to the <code>p</code> command and the variables view:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@DebugDescription</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Organization</span><span>:</span> <span>CustomDebugStringConvertible</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>manager</span><span>:</span> <span>Person</span>
  <span>// ... and more</span>

  <span>var</span> <span>debugDescription</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"#</span><span>\(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>\(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span> [</span><span>\(</span><span>manager</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>]"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>(lldb) p myOrg
(Organization) myOrg = "`#100 Worldwide Travel [Jonathan Swift]`" 
</code></pre></div>



<p>Swift 6 dramatically improves startup performance in the debugger when you use explicit module builds. When debugging locally-built code, LLDB can now import explicitly-built Swift and Clang modules directly from the project build artifacts. This avoids the need to recompile implicit Clang module dependencies from source, which can take a long time, and it‚Äôs very sensitive to issues with header search paths. If the first <code>p</code> or <code>po</code> command in LLDB takes a long time due to Clang module compilation, or if your debugging is frequently blocked by Clang header import problems, consider adopting explicit modules in your project!</p>





<p>Swift 6 unifies the implementation of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/">Foundation</a> across all platforms. The modern, portable Swift implementation provides consistency across platforms, it‚Äôs more robust, and it‚Äôs open source. macOS and iOS started using the Swift implementation of Foundation alongside Swift 5.9, and Swift 6 brings these improvements to Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>Core types like <code>JSONDecoder</code>, <code>URL</code>, <code>Calendar</code>, <code>FileManager</code>, <code>ProcessInfo</code>, and more have been completely reimplemented in Swift. These types share their implementation with macOS 15 and iOS 18, providing a new level of cross-platform consistency, reliability, and performance. Recently released APIs like <code>FormatStyle</code>, <code>ParseStrategy</code>, <code>Predicate</code>, and <code>JSON5</code>, from past macOS and iOS releases are now available on all Swift platforms. New Foundation APIs like <code>Expression</code>, calendar enumeration improvements, calendar recurrence rules, format style enhancements, and more are available simultaneously on macOS, iOS, Linux, and Windows - and they were built with community involvement.</p>

<p>If your Linux or Windows app imports the <code>Foundation</code> library from the Swift toolchain today, you get all of these improvements for free. And if your app is particularly sensitive to binary size, you can now import the <code>FoundationEssentials</code> library, which provides a more targeted subset of Foundation‚Äôs features that omits internationalization and localization data.</p>



<p>Swift 6 introduces Swift Testing, a new testing library designed from the ground up for Swift. It includes expressive APIs that make it easy to write and organize tests. It provides detailed output when a test fails using macros like <code>#expect</code>. And it scales to large codebases with features like parameterization to easily repeat a test with different arguments.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@Test</span><span>(</span><span>"Continents mentioned in videos"</span><span>,</span> <span>arguments</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"A Beach"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"By the Lake"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"Camping in the Woods"</span>
<span>])</span>
<span>func</span> <span>mentionedContinents</span><span>(</span><span>videoName</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>throws</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>videoLibrary</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>VideoLibrary</span><span>()</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>video</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>#require</span><span>(</span><span>await</span> <span>videoLibrary</span><span>.</span><span>video</span><span>(</span><span>named</span><span>:</span> <span>videoName</span><span>))</span>
  <span>#expect(video.mentionedContinents.count &lt;= 3)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Swift Testing takes full advantage of macros. Its <code>@Test</code> and <code>@Suite</code> attached macros declare test functions and suite types respectively, and they accept arguments (known as traits) to customize various behaviors. The <code>#expect</code> and <code>#require</code> expression macros validate expected behaviors, and capture rich representation of expressions and their sub-values to produce detailed failure messages.</p>

<p>Since Swift Testing is included directly in Swift 6 toolchains, you can <code>import Testing</code> without needing to declare a package dependency. This means your tests do not need to build Swift Testing or its dependencies (including swift-syntax), and its macro implementation comes prebuilt. The package manager in Swift 6 automatically builds and runs Swift Testing tests in addition to XCTests (if present), and shows results from both libraries in log output. Swift Testing supports all platforms that Swift officially supports, including all Apple platforms, Linux, and Windows.</p>

                <p><strong>Leaked internal documents from a Kremlin-controlled propaganda center reveal how a well-coordinated Russian campaign supported far-right parties in the European Parliament elections ‚Äî and planted disinformation across social media platforms to undermine Ukraine.</strong></p>

		
<p>In a video resembling a movie trailer, the head of Russia‚Äôs secret propaganda project, Ilya Gambashidze, removes his sunglasses and sits behind a computer, wearing a camouflage-patterned hoodie with the words ‚ÄúRussian Ideological Troops‚Äù spelled out on his sleeve. Text flashes on the screen: ‚ÄúNarrative production, content creation, 300 media outlets, 20 think tanks‚Ä¶‚Äù The video, part of a leak from Russia‚Äôs IT organization Social Design Agency (SDA), appears to be aimed at partners interested in their information operations services.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGambashidze is responsible for numerous projects in various countries,‚Äù a source connected to EU intelligence told us. The organization and Gambashidze are already sanctioned both in the EU and the U.S.</p>
<p>Amid the ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine, the Russian presidential administration has emerged as a key client of SDA.<span>&nbsp; </span>Recently, the U.S Department of Justice and FBI revealed that Russian officials, including Sergei Kiriyenko, the Russian presidential administration‚Äôs chief of staff and often referred to as Vladimir Putin‚Äôs right-hand man, have attended several project meetings with Gambashidze. (We exposed his role in supervising influence operations in our previous <a href="https://vsquare.org/tag/kremlin-leaks/"><span>investigative series, #KremlinLeaks</span></a>). Sofia Zakharova, another staffer in Putin‚Äôs administration, is also a frequent participant in these meetings.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBetween April 2022 and April 2023, Gambashidze took notes related to at least 20 Russian Presidential Administration meetings,‚Äù the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-09/doppelganger_affidavit_9.4.24.pdf"><span>U.S. affidavit</span></a> claims, citing several documents that are now also available to VSquare.</p>
<p>The leaked documents, comprising thousands of files from SDA servers, were obtained by Delfi Estonia, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, NDR and WDR, who shared the data with international partners: De Standaard, NRC, Schemes, Shomrim, DR, Profil, Dossier Center, FRONTSTORY.PL and VSquare. The latest FBI files on Russian influence operations correspond with the data from the leak, and refers to the SDA as ‚Äú<span>a public relations company, specializing in election campaigns, with deep ties to the Russian government.‚Äù</span></p>
<p>The leak reveals how the SDA operates as a center for psychological warfare. Its ‚Äúarmy‚Äù consists not of soldiers, but of meme creators and internet trolls. According to internal records, the agency employs ‚Äúideologists‚Äù, eight ‚Äúcommentators,‚Äù and a ‚Äúbot farm operator.‚Äù</p>
<p>The scale of disinformation production is astonishing. A leaked report claims that in the first four months of 2024, the SDA‚Äôs bot army, dubbed the ‚ÄúRussian Digital Army,‚Äù generated 33.9 million comments. They also claim to have produced 39,899 ‚Äúcontent units‚Äù on social media, including 4,641 videos and 2,516 memes and graphics.</p>
<p>Clear quotas are set. For example, in one project targeting Germany and France, the quotas were as follows: ‚ÄúCartoons ‚Äì 60 units. Memes ‚Äì 180 units. Article comments ‚Äì 400.‚Äù</p>
<p>There are hundreds of examples of memes in the leaked documents, some of which were created by cartoonists employed by the SDA.</p>
<p>In internal discussions, those involved do not shy away from admitting that they are producing fake news and disinformation. Elections in Europe and the U.S. are the primary targets.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe European Parliament elections are in the summer of 2024. Critical milestones are approaching in 2024, including the Bundestag elections and the U.S. presidential election. The outcome of these campaigns will largely determine the West‚Äôs future sanctions policy towards Russia and support for Ukraine,‚Äù reads one document outlining the focus of these information operations.</p>
<p>The Russians remain optimistic about shifting Western public opinion on Ukraine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPublic opinion in the project‚Äôs target countries is gradually moving towards reducing or completely stopping support for Ukraine,‚Äù a document reads.</p>
<p>The leaked files include detailed reports on the thousands of fake comments made in various countries, along with instructions on how to craft such comments.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWrite a comment from a 38-year-old German woman, who believes Germany is losing its main source of income: industry and a strong economy ‚Äì we must stop wasting money on Ukraine and return to cheap Russian energy!.‚Äù one document offered as instruction.</p>
<p>Similar instructions were written for ‚Äúcommenters‚Äù aiming at a U.S audience: ‚ÄúWrite a 400-character comment from a 38-year-old American woman, who believes military aid to Ukraine and Israel should be cut. Zelensky is wasting taxpayers‚Äô money!‚Äù</p>
<p>A similar narrative was crafted to target Poland‚Äôs online space: ‚ÄúWrite a 400-character comment from a 38-year-old Polish woman, who believes the government is to blame for the country‚Äôs rise in food prices. Poland is flirting with Ukraine, it has allowed a million Ukrainian migrants to settle in Poland taking jobs and receiving benefits, it can‚Äôt even solve the Ukrainian grain issue to protect its farmers! As a result, ordinary citizens who love this country and pay taxes suffer. This is not good for anything!‚Äù</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúUkrainian grain issue‚Äù mentioned in the comment was heavily <a href="https://dfrlab.org/2024/06/03/tailored-russian-disinformation-targets-polish-farmer-protests/"><span>amplified by the Russian</span></a> propaganda machine before the EU elections, presumably to sow division between Poland and Ukraine and undermine solidarity with Ukraine.</p>
<h2><b>Undermining the European Parliament</b></h2>
<p>One goal of Russia‚Äôs influence operations, according to the leaked records, is to bolster far-right parties in Western Europe, in the hope that these parties will oppose aid to Ukraine and sanctions on Russia.</p>
<p>According to the documents, Russian operatives thought that the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) parliamentary group‚Äôs success in the European Parliament would benefit Russia. (ID was dissolved after the European elections.)</p>
<p>‚ÄúProposal: conduct a comprehensive counter-campaign against liberal globalists, their platform and prominent representatives before the elections to the EP in the countries with the largest representation in this electoral body ‚Äì Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Poland,‚Äù states a project document preparing for elections. It also notes that over half of European Parliament seats belong to these countries, making them key targets.</p>
<p>The document outlines four key narratives to promote. For example: ‚ÄúLiberals and globalists spread fear and want us to panic. We must fear war, climate disasters, viruses, a Russian attack. Through fear, they seek our submission. Additionally, they aim to exploit contradictions around family values, LGBT rights, and the economic uncertainty caused by the war in energy and agriculture.‚Äù</p>
<p>The toolkit to achieve these goals includes: [working] in comment sections; memes, videos, cartoons; threads on social media; fakes, street art.</p>
<p>Several documents confirm that the SDA was particularly active in Germany, supporting the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur opinion leader became the deputy leader of the AfD faction!‚Äù reads one Russian meeting memo, though it doesn‚Äôt specify who is being referenced.</p>
<p>The Russians also note that AfD‚Äôs 2024 election program can be seen as a key Russian strategic narrative: ‚ÄúIt is worth noting that AfD‚Äôs program for the 2024 elections states that the cause of the Ukraine conflict is ‚Äòthe dominance of non-European powers.‚Äô These powers are blamed for ‚Äòdragging European countries into conflict,‚Äô‚Äù describes a project document.</p>
<p>Another document reveals that the project‚Äôs success is gauged by the popularity of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. According to a document listing ‚Äúkey performance indicators,‚Äù the project could be considered a success if the AfD were to poll at 20 percent. Other public polls are also used to measure successes in target countries. ‚ÄúGrowth of the number of Germans unwilling to sacrifice their well-being for the sake of victory ‚Äì 55 percent,‚Äù says one document.</p>
<p>Talking points are proposed to achieve those aims. For example: ‚ÄúThe U.S is waging an economic and hybrid war against Russia at the expense of Germany. Anti-Russian decisions by NATO and the EU harm Germans first and foremost.‚Äù</p>
<p><span>Metrics for success are similar in France: T</span>he National Rally (previously known as National Front) should be polling at 20 percent and ‚Äúthe number of French people who do not want to sacrifice their well-being for the sake of victory over Russia/for the sake of Ukraine should exceed 44 percent.‚Äù</p>
<p>After the European elections, the SDA <span>evaluated</span> its success. In this post-election analysis, it took notice of the increase in right-wing representatives in the European Parliament.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus, we can state a serious success of the campaign in social networks,‚Äù they concluded.</p>
<p>However, the same document warns that the success of the far-right in the European Parliament does not necessarily translate into success for Russia. As a cautionary example, it cites Giorgia Meloni‚Äôs ‚Äúhawkish‚Äù stance (she has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine)<span> and notes that Marine Le Pen‚Äôs support is also not without complications as Le Pen publicly applauded Zelensky during his visit to Paris, which did not go unnoticed by the Russians.</span></p>
<p>‚ÄúOverall, though, the general success of the far-right in the European Parliament elections is perceived globally as a success for Russian foreign policy and, moreover, for Russian propaganda,‚Äù the document states.</p>
<h2><b>Planting fakes for useful idiots</b></h2>
<p>The SDA isn‚Äôt only generating comments for non-existent 38-year-old women in Germany and America. Its employees also fabricate Ukrainian documents and official quotes to be disseminated through the media. For instance, SDA created forged documents and quotes related to the crash of an Il-76 plane in Belgorod in January 2024. Russian propaganda claimed at the time that this plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war and blamed Ukraine for shooting it down. These ‚Äúfakes,‚Äù as the SDA itself calls them, were created to persuade the public that Ukraine was hiding that fact. A document titled ‚ÄúRegister of Fakes and Doppelgangers‚Äù details 73 instances where the SDA created disinformation for distribution.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur new team fabricated a story about child abductions. The Americans seriously published it. That‚Äôs a success!‚Äù boasted Sofia Zakharova, who is associated with the Russian presidential administration. This comes from an SDA meeting protocol from September 2023.</p>
<p>A few weeks before this meeting, information began circulating on Telegram channels about Ukrainian children whose organs were being sold on the dark web. Some of the reports weaving their way through social media blamed the ‚ÄúKiev regime‚Äù orchestrating child evacuations. This claim was meant to mirror the allegations made by the International Criminal Court against Russian President Vladimir Putin and the head of the Russian child deportation program in Ukraine, <a href="https://vsquare.org/kremlin-leaks-putin-elections-russia-propaganda-ukraine/"><span>Maria Lvova-Belova</span></a>.</p>
<p>Soon, this disinformation narrative was even spread by some U.S. politicians, such as Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from the state of Georgia.</p>
<p>The SDA team also highlights Greene in a U.S.-focused document, explaining how their information operations are picked up by influential figures in the U.S. The document includes a link to an article from Breitbart, a far-right U.S. news outlet, in which Greene indicates that weapons supplied by the United States to Ukraine have reached Hamas.</p>
<p>The same document indicates that reducing U.S. support for Ukraine can be achieved by contrasting it with the American economic situation.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe question ‚Äòwhere is our money going?‚Äô should be the most frequent in the comments section,‚Äù the document says.</p>
<h2><b>‚ÄúThe Other Ukraine‚Äù</b></h2>
<p>One notable project has a code-name ‚ÄúThe Other Ukraine‚Äù and is aimed at Ukrainians in the Western Europe, Russia and Ukraine itself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnother Ukraine‚Äù has been associated with exiled Ukrainian oligarch and close friend of Putin, Viktor Medvedchuk, in media reports before. Leaked documentation now suggests that the project is aided and orchestrated also by SDA.</p>
<p>Medvedchuk‚Äôs association can also be seen in the documents, according to which the project aims to ‚Äúposition Viktor Medvedchuk as a consistent fighter for a peaceful future for Ukraine.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is an alternative to war. Medvedchuk talks about peaceful dialogue as an alternative to a possible nuclear war,‚Äù the document says.</p>
<p>The project proposes to use Ukrainian language for propaganda purposes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA full-fledged information agency aimed at Ukrainians and operating within the framework of the ideology of the ‚ÄòOther Ukraine‚Äô must appear in the information space,‚Äù a project document indicates. ‚ÄúThis source should ensure the loyalty of the ‚Äònew Russian Ukrainians‚Äô to the President of Russia and active support for his policies.‚Äù</p>
<p>A comprehensive table with a detailed media plan follows: it says what<span>&nbsp; </span>texts, videos, infographics and photos should be produced and released and how often. For example, the instructions call for ‚Äúcomments in support and defense of and the quota is set to 300 comments per day.</p>
<p><span>According to Ukrainian prosecutors, as well as European security agencies, Medvedchuk is also associated with the <a href="https://vsquare.org/eu-parliament-russia-interference-investigative-journalism-pellegrini/"><span>Voice Of Europe scandal</span></a></span>: MEPs were paid to disseminate Russian propaganda; several participated in activities organized by pro-Russian media outlet Voice of Europe, which was used to funnel the money. <span>After the network‚Äôs associates in the Czech Republic and Poland (where authorities seized ‚Ç¨48,500 and $36,000) were arrested, the outlet and connected businessmen were sanctioned by the EU.</span> Later, Belgian police raided the EU Parliament office and private home of an assistant to an MEP who worked for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and received Russian money <span>through</span> the Voice of Europe network.</p>
<p>An EU intelligence source claims both projects were actually prepared in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Other Ukraine and Voice of Europe were developed in early 2023, in Russia‚Äôs Presidential Administration, in the office of Sergey Kiriyenko,‚Äù the source says.</p>
<h2><b>Info ops center in Kaliningrad</b></h2>
<p>In a document titled ‚ÄúInformation operations project office Baltics,‚Äù the SDA considers the creation of a center in Kaliningrad, which would focus on the Baltic states, Poland and Germany.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThanks to its geographical location and historical cultural ties with Europe, Kaliningrad Oblast is the most convenient springboard for organizing and conducting information operations in EU countries,‚Äù the document states.</p>
<p>The project names the following objectives: spreading Russian narratives; influencing political and economic decisions; influencing electoral processes; forming groups and networks of supporters; promoting the interests of Russian business; and creating a system for the promotion of the Russian agenda in the media and social networks.</p>
<p><span>The documents outline the new institution‚Äôs structure, including units such as an</span> analytical monitoring center and content center; IT and IS division; legal expertise center; and translation bureau.</p>
<p>Several documents mention Poland, one of the main targets for the SDA‚Äôs manipulative efforts. Among them is a note on the likely results of the MEP elections. The memo proposes a ‚Äúcounter-campaign‚Äù against the ‚Äúliberal globalists.‚Äù</p>
<p>The SDA also monitors the Polish media space and searches for divisive statements. One such report quotes Krzysztof Bosak, deputy speaker of the Sejm and leader of the far-right Confederation, whose statements on Israel triggered a public clash with theIsraeli ambassador to Poland.</p>
<h2><b>Rest of the world in sight</b></h2>
<p>The examples above are still only a fraction of the SDA‚Äôs operations. There are numerous campaigns with different aims in different countries. The DOJ affidavit mentions four different projects aimed at the U.S alone.</p>
<p>A campaign separate from ‚ÄúThe Other Ukraine‚Äù suggests dividing Ukraine into 20 regions and preparing information operations for each region. ‚Äú50,000 comments in 20 regions of Ukraine per month,‚Äù the document says.</p>
<p>Israel is another target.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCurrently, the situation in the State of Israel seems very favorable for starting a serious project to influence public opinion. The goal of such influence should be to tear Israel out of the general Western anti-Russian agenda,‚Äù a project document titled ‚ÄúNormal Israel‚Äù says. Again, quotas for comments, texts and memes are provided.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSDA records also revealed its planning of campaigns targeting foreign countries, including Mexico and Israel, with the intent that those efforts would influence associated ethnic or religious groups residing in the United States,‚Äù the DOJ affidavit says.</p>
<p>Separate objectives are set for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>The need to ‚Äúneutralize external pressure on the political leadership of these countries by mobilizing the public to support initiatives that run counter to the interests of the United States and its allies‚Äù is mentioned in a document in regard to Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. ‚ÄúSuch mobilization must be carried out through information impact on national audiences,‚Äù the document reads.</p>
