<p>Infinite canvas tools are a way to view and organize information spatially, like a digital whiteboard. Infinite canvases encourage freedom and exploration, and have become a popular interface pattern across many apps.</p>

<p>The JSON Canvas format was created to provide longevity, readability, interoperability, and extensibility to data created with infinite canvas apps. The format is designed to be easy to parse and give users <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">ownership over their data</a>. JSON Canvas files use the <code>.canvas</code> extension.</p>

<p>JSON Canvas was originally created for <a href="https://obsidian.md/blog/json-canvas/">Obsidian</a>. JSON Canvas can be implemented freely as an import, export, and storage format for any app or tool. This site, and all the resources associated with JSON Canvas are <a href="https://github.com/obsidianmd/jsoncanvas">open source</a> under the MIT license.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Airbnb will no longer allow hosts to use indoor security cameras, regardless of where they’re placed or what they’re used for. In <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/an-update-on-our-policy-on-security-cameras/">an update on Monday</a>, Airbnb says the change to “prioritize the privacy” of renters goes into effect on April 30th.</p><p>The vacation rental app <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231223165134/https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3061">previously let</a> hosts install security cameras in “common areas” of listings, including hallways, living rooms, and front doors. Airbnb required hosts to disclose the presence of security cameras in their listings and make them clearly visible, and it prohibited hosts from using cameras in bedrooms and bathrooms.</p><p>But now, hosts can’t use indoor security cameras at all. The change comes after <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/airbnb-camera-hidden-couple-reddit-lawsuit-1743269">numerous reports</a> of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/couple-finds-hidden-camera-disguised-as-smoke-detector-in-florida-airbnb">guests</a> finding <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/people-keep-finding-hidden-cameras-in-their-airbnb">hidden cameras</a> within their rental, leading some vacation-goers to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23550845/smartphone-hidden-camera-android-ios-how-to">scan their rooms</a> for cameras.</p><p><a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fhelp%2Farticle%2F3061%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dhere%2520to%2520help-%2CWhat%2520we%2520do%2520allow%2Cof%2520a%2520reservation%2520are%2520permitted.">Airbnb’s new policy</a> also introduces new rules for outdoor security cameras, and will now require hosts to disclose their use and locations before guests book a listing. Hosts can’t use outdoor cams to keep tabs on indoor spaces, either, nor can they use them in “certain outdoor areas where there’s a great expectation of privacy,” such as an outdoor shower or sauna. </p><p>Additionally, listings will have to disclose noise decibel monitors, which hosts might use to measure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/29/18037604/noiseaware-gen-3-indoor-outdoor-security-microphone">whether there’s a party going on</a> in their rental — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/17/23309433/airbnb-anti-party-technology-north-america-usa-canada-party-ban">something that Airbnb banned</a> in 2022. “These changes were made in consultation with our guests, hosts, and privacy experts, and we’ll continue to seek feedback to help ensure our policies work for our global community,” Juniper Downs, Airbnb’s head of community policy and partnership, says in a statement. </p><p>Airbnb hosts will have until the end of April to remove the security cameras from inside their listings. If a guest reports the presence of an indoor camera after that, Airbnb says it will investigate and that it could remove the host’s listing or account as a result. The new policy still can’t control the presence of hidden cameras, but it will at least offer some peace of mind knowing that rule-abiding hosts can no longer put cameras anywhere in their rentals.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>In our <a href="https://stability.ai/news/using-the-new-ai-supercomputer"><span>last installment</span></a>, we spoke about how we plan to utilize our state-of-the-art AI Supercomputer.</p><p>In this installment, we delve deeper into performance benchmarks and benefits of various compute solutions.</p><p>Our commitment to developing cutting-edge open models in multiple modalities necessitates a compute solution capable of handling diverse tasks with efficiency. To this end, we conducted a performance analysis, training two of our models, including the highly anticipated <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3"><span>Stable Diffusion 3</span></a>.</p><p>In our analysis, we compared the training speed of Intel Gaudi 2 accelerators versus Nvidia's A100 and H100, two of the most common choices for startups and developers training LLMs.</p><p><strong>Model 1:</strong></p><p><a href="https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3"><span><strong>Stable Diffusion 3</strong></span></a> is our most capable text-to-image model, soon to be in <a href="https://stability.ai/stablediffusion3"><span>early preview</span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon public release of Stable Diffusion 3, it will be available in sizes ranging from 800M to 8B parameters. Our analysis utilized the 2B parameter version and showed pleasantly surprising results.&nbsp;</p><p>We measured the training throughput for the 2B <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3-research-paper"><span>Multimodal Diffusion Transformer</span></a> (MMDiT) architecture model with d=24, BFloat16mixed precision, optimized attention (xFormers for A100 and the FusedSDPA for Intel Gaudi). We call this model version MMDiT-ps2-d24.</p><p>First, let’s examine our training benchmark results across 2 nodes, a total of 16 accelerators (Gaudi/GPU). Here’s an excerpt of the raw data:</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1709158639151_25063">
  <p>In this configuration, the Gaudi 2 cluster processed over 3x more images per second, compared to A100-80GB GPUs. This is particularly impressive considering that the A100s have a very optimized software stack.&nbsp;</p><p>On inference tests with the Stable Diffusion 3 8B parameter model the Gaudi 2 chips offer inference speed similar to Nvidia A100 chips using base PyTorch. However, with TensorRT optimization, the A100 chips produce images 40% faster than Gaudi 2. We anticipate that with further optimization, Gaudi 2 will soon outperform A100s on this model. In earlier tests on our SDXL model with base PyTorch, Gaudi 2 generates a 1024x1024 image in 30 steps in 3.2 seconds, versus 3.6 seconds for PyTorch on A100s and 2.7 seconds for a generation with TensorRT on an A100.&nbsp;</p><p>The higher memory and fast interconnect of Gaudi 2, plus other design considerations, make it competitive to run the Diffusion Transformer architecture that underpins this next generation of media models.</p><p><br><strong>Model 2:</strong></p><p><a href="https://stability.ai/news/stable-beluga-large-instruction-fine-tuned-models"><span><strong>Stable Beluga 2.5 70B</strong></span></a><strong> </strong>is our fine-tuned version of LLaMA 2 70B, building on the <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stable-beluga-large-instruction-fine-tuned-models"><span>Stable Beluga 2</span></a> model which was the first open model to best ChatGPT 3.5 in select benchmarks. We ran this training benchmark on 256 Gaudi 2 accelerators. Running our PyTorch code out of the box, with no extra optimizations, we measured an impressive total average throughput of 116,777 tokens/second. More specifically, this involves using a FP16 datatype, a global batch size of 1024, gradient accumulation steps of 2, and micro batch size of 2.</p><p>On inference tests with our 70B language model on Gaudi 2, it generates 673 tokens/second per accelerator, using an input token size of 128 and output token size of 2048. In comparison to <a href="https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/performance.html"><span>TensorRT-LLM</span></a>, Gaudi 2 appears to be 28% faster than the 525 tokens/second for the A100. We also anticipate further speed improvements with FP8.</p><p>Companies like ours face an increasing demand for more powerful and efficient computing solutions. Our findings underscore the need for alternatives like the Gaudi 2, which not only offers superior performance to other 7nm chips, but also addresses critical market needs such as affordability, reduced lead times, and superior price-to-performance ratios. Ultimately, the opportunity for choice in computing options broadens participation and innovation, thereby making advanced AI technologies more accessible to all.</p><p>Stay tuned for more insights in our next installment of "Behind the Compute."&nbsp;</p><p>To stay updated on our progress follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/stabilityai"><span>Twitter</span></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stability.ai/"><span>Instagram</span></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stability-ai"><span>LinkedIn</span></a>, and join our <a href="https://discord.gg/stablediffusion"><span>Discord Community</span></a>.</p>

It certainly blows commercial alternatives like Prince XML out of the water.<p>That forms a solid foundation that I find it hard to imagine paying for. The things where you might still command a premium are basically safety mechanisms/CI checks/library components that ensure the PDF renders correctly in the presence of variable-length content, etc. as well as maybe PDF-specific features like metadata and fillable forms. Naive ways to format headers, footers, tables/grids/flexboxes etc. often fail in PDFs because of unexpected layout complications. So having a methodology, process, and validation system for ensuring that a mission critical piece of information appears on a PDF in the presence of these constraints could be attractive.

I'm pretty sure paged.js will pass it through without messing with it, so you're good if the browser that Playwright/puppeteer is driving supports the correct color profile when emitting the PDF. I honestly don't know if browsers have sufficient support for that when emitting a PDF, though.<p>Overall you're right that color correction is another area where you could probably command a premium.

We can extract most of the tags from the HTML semantics by themselves which makes it much easier.</p><p>- We target the PDF 1.7 spec. Color profiles can be changed and you can use a custom .icc profile, with the corresponding embedding restrictions based on the document format. MediaBox is supported through the @page size property. Bleed, trim and marks can be added using vendor specific css properties. We don't support ArtBox yet but this is something we can look into!

My career has also revolved around PDF generation (once for federal compliance at large companies, second for scrubbing data from PDFs for HIPAA compliance and then generating a new pdf based on the scrubbed data). I think I've seen your tool around, I ended up creating a workflow that generated LateX scripts then converted them to pdfs, and the second a python library. The most difficult aspect for our tools was formatting - the pdfs were generally 60-100 pages and tables could show up anywhere and break the page/formatting. Quite curious to see how your company will grow, good luck!</span></p></div></td></tr>

Microsoft basically forcing people to use XPS in windows (&gt;70% market share of computing) still wasn't able to achieve meaningful usage or change.</p><p>I expect that PDFs will not go away for 20 years at least, but who knows

<p dir="auto">No-code tools have significantly speed up how we get things done, allowing non-tech users to build amazing apps and changing the way many work and live. People like using spreadsheet-like UI to handle their data because it's easy, flexible, and great for team collaboration. They also prefer designing their app screens without being stuck with clunky templates.</p>
<p dir="auto">Giving non-techy people the ability to create their software sounds exciting. But that's just the start:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>As businesses expand, their data needs intensify. No one wishes to hear that once their orders reach 100k, they'll outgrow their current interface. Yet, many no-code platforms falter at such scales.</li>
<li>Most no-code platforms are cloud-based. This means your important data sits with the provider, and switching to another platform can be a headache.</li>
<li>Sometimes, no-code tools can't do what you want because of their limitations, leaving users stuck.</li>
<li>If a tool becomes essential, you'll eventually need some tech expertise. But developers often find these platforms tricky.</li>
<li>Maintaining systems with complex setups can be hard for developers, especially if these aren't built using common software standards.</li>
<li>Systems that don't use these standards might need revamping or replacing, costing more in the long run. It might even mean ditching the no-code route and going back to traditional coding.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What we think the future of no-code products look like</h4><a id="user-content-what-we-think-the-future-of-no-code-products-look-like" aria-label="Permalink: What we think the future of no-code products look like" href="#what-we-think-the-future-of-no-code-products-look-like"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>An interface that anyone can use to build applications easily.</li>
<li>Easy access to data, letting users grab, move, and reuse their information as they wish.</li>
<li>Data privacy and choice, whether that's in the cloud, on-premise, or even just on your local.</li>
<li>It needs to work for developers too, not just non-tech users.</li>
<li>It should handle lots of data, so it can grow with your business.</li>
<li>Flexibility to integrate with other software, combining strengths to get the job done.</li>
<li>Last, native AI integration to takes usability to the next level.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In essence, Teable isn't just another no-code solution, it's a comprehensive answer to the evolving demands of modern software development, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their technical proficiency, has a platform tailored to their needs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Sponsors ❤️</h2><a id="user-content-sponsors-heart" aria-label="Permalink: Sponsors :heart:" href="#sponsors-heart"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you are enjoying some this project in your company, I'd really appreciate a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/teableio">sponsorship</a>, a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/teable" rel="nofollow">coffee</a> or a dropped star.
That gives me some more time to improve it to the next level.</p>

    <div><p><b>Following its investigation, the EDPS has found that the European Commission (Commission) has infringed several key data protection rules when using Microsoft 365. In its decision, the EDPS imposes corrective measures on the Commission</b>.</p>
<p>The EDPS has found that the Commission <b>has infringed several provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</b>, the EU’s data protection law for EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies (EUIs), including those <b>on transfers of personal data outside the EU/European Economic Area (EEA)</b>. In particular, the Commission has failed to provide appropriate safeguards to ensure that personal data transferred outside the EU/EEA are afforded an essentially equivalent level of protection as guaranteed in the EU/EEA. Furthermore, in its contract with Microsoft, <b>the Commission did not sufficiently specify what types of personal data are to be collected and for which explicit and specified purposes when using Microsoft 365</b>. The <b>Commission’s infringements as data controller also relate to data processing</b>, including transfers of personal data, carried out <b>on its behalf</b>.</p>
<p><b>Wojciech Wiewiórowski, EDPS, said: </b><i>“It is the responsibility of the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies (EUIs) to ensure that any processing of personal data outside and inside the EU/EEA, including in the context of cloud-based services, is accompanied by robust data protection safeguards and measures. This is imperative to ensure that individuals’ information is protected, as required by</i><i> Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, whenever their data is processed by, or on behalf of, an EUI.” </i></p>
<p>The EDPS has therefore decided to order the Commission, effective on <b>9 December 2024</b>, to <b>suspend all data flows </b>resulting from its use of Microsoft 365<b> to Microsoft </b>and to its affiliates and sub-processors<b> located in countries outside the EU/EEA not covered by an adequacy decision</b>. The EDPS has also decided to order the Commission to <b>bring the processing operations</b> resulting from its use of Microsoft 365 <b>into compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</b>. <b>The Commission must demonstrate compliance with both orders by 9 December 2024</b>.</p>
<p>The EDPS considers that <b>the corrective measures it imposes (<a href="https://www.edps.europa.eu/system/files/2024-03/EDPS-2024-05-European-Commission_s-use-of-M365-infringes-data-protection-rules-for-EU-institutions-and-bodies_EN.pdf">see annex for a detailed excerpt</a>) are appropriate, necessary </b>and<b> proportionate in light of the seriousness and duration of the infringements found. </b></p>
<p>Many of the infringements found concern all processing operations carried out by the Commission, or on its behalf, when using Microsoft 365, and impact a large number of individuals.</p>
<p>The EDPS also takes into account the need <b>not to compromise the Commission’s ability to carry out its tasks in the public interest or to exercise official authority vested in the Commission, and the need to allow appropriate time for the Commission to implement the foreseen suspension of relevant data flows, and to bring the processing of data into compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</b></p>
<p>The measures imposed by the EDPS in its decision of 8 March 2024 are without prejudice to any other or further action that the EDPS may undertake.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


This page has two purposes: to describe how to implement computer
language interpreters in general, and in particular to build an interpreter
for most of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)"><i>Scheme</i></a>
dialect of Lisp using <a href="http://python.org/">Python 3</a> as the implementation language. 
I call my language and interpreter <i>Lispy</i> (<a href="https://www.norvig.com/lis.py"><b>lis.py</b></a>). Years ago, I showed how to write a semi-practical Scheme interpreter  <a (in="" href="https://www.norvig.com/jscheme.html">Java</a> and in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=QzGuHnDhvZIC&amp;lpg=PA756&amp;vq=scheme%20interpreter&amp;dq=Paradigms%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Programming&amp;pg=PA753#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">in Common
Lisp</a>).  This time around the goal is to demonstrate, as concisely
and simply as possible, what
<a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523">Alan Kay called</a> "<a href="http://www.righto.com/2008/07/maxwells-equations-of-software-examined.html"><i>Maxwell's Equations of Software</i></a>."

<p>Why does this  matter? As <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html">Steve
  Yegge said</a>, <i>"If you don't know how compilers work, then you
  don't know how computers work."</i> Yegge describes 8 problems that
  can be solved with compilers (or equally well with interpreters, or
   with Yegge's
  typical heavy dosage of cynicism).


</p><h2>Syntax and Semantics of Scheme Programs</h2>

The <i>syntax</i> of a language is the arrangement of characters to form correct statements or expressions; the
<i>semantics</i> is the meaning of those statements or expressions.  For example, in the language of
mathematical expressions (and in many programming languages), the syntax for adding one plus two is "1 +
2" and the semantics is the application of the addition operation to the two numbers, yielding the value 3. We say we
are <i>evaluating</i> an expression when we determine its
value; we would say that "1 + 2" evaluates to 3, and write
that as "1 + 2" ⇒ 3.

<p>Scheme syntax is different from most other programming languages. Consider:


</p><blockquote>
<table><tbody><tr><th>Java</th><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Scheme
    </th></tr><tr><td>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<tt><b>if</b> (x.val() &gt; 0) {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>return</b> fn(A[i] + 3 * i, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>new</b> String[] {"one", "two"});
<br>}
  </tt></td><td>&nbsp;
  </td><td><tt>(<b>if</b> (&gt; (val x) 0)
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(fn (+ (aref A i) (* 3 i)) 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<b>quote</b> (one two)))
   </tt></td></tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote>

Java has a wide variety
of syntactic conventions (keywords, infix operators, three kinds of brackets,
operator precedence, dot notation, quotes, commas,
semicolons), but Scheme syntax is much simpler: 
<ul>
<li> Scheme programs consist solely of <i>expressions</i>.  There is no statement/expression distinction.
</li><li> Numbers (e.g. <tt>1</tt>) and symbols (e.g. <tt>A</tt>) are called <i>atomic expressions</i>;
they cannot be broken into pieces.  These are similar to their Java counterparts, except that in
Scheme, operators such as <tt>+</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt> are symbols too, and are treated the same
way as <tt>A</tt> and <tt>fn</tt>.
</li><li> Everything else is a <i>list expression</i>: a "(", followed by zero or more expressions,
followed by a ")".  The first element of the list determines what it means:
<ul>
<li>A list starting with a keyword, e.g. <tt>(if ...)</tt>, is a <i>special form</i>;
the meaning depends on the keyword.
</li><li>A list starting with a non-keyword, e.g. <tt>(fn ...)</tt>, is a function call.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
The beauty of Scheme is that the full language only needs 5 keywords and 8 syntactic
forms.  In comparison, Python has 33 keywords and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html">110</a>
syntactic forms, 
and Java has 50 keywords and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-18.html">133</a> syntactic forms.
All those parentheses
may seem intimidating, but Scheme syntax has the virtues of
simplicity and consistency. (Some have joked that "Lisp" stands for
"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Lots+of+Irritating+Silly+Parentheses"><i><b>L</b>ots
of <b>I</b>rritating <b>S</b>illy <b>P</b>arentheses</i></a>"; I think it stand for
"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;as_q=&amp;as_epq=Lisp+Is+Syntactically+Pure"><i><b>L</b>isp
<b>I</b>s <b>S</b>yntactically <b>P</b>ure</i></a>".)  


<p>In this page we will cover all the important points of the Scheme language and its interpretation
(omitting some minor details), but we will take two steps to get there,
defining a simplified language first, before defining the near-full Scheme language. 

</p><h2>Language 1: Lispy Calculator</h2>

<i>Lispy Calculator</i> is a subset of Scheme using only five syntactic forms (two atomic, two special forms, and the procedure call).
Lispy Calculator lets you do any computation you could do on a typical calculator—as long as you are comfortable with prefix notation. 
And you can do two things that are not offered in typical calculator languages: "if" expressions, and the definition of new variables.  
Here's an example program, that computes the area of a circle of radius 10, using the formula π <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>:

<pre>(define r 10)
(* pi (* r r))
</pre>

Here is a table of all the allowable expressions:

<p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Expression</th><th>Syntax</th><th>Semantics and Example

  </th></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.1">variable reference</a></td><td><i>symbol</i></td><td>A symbol is interpreted as a variable name;
  its value is the variable's
  value. <br>Example: <tt>r</tt> ⇒ <tt>10</tt> (assuming <tt>r</tt> was previously defined to be 10)

    </td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.2">constant
  literal</a></td><td><i>number</i></td><td>A number 
  evaluates to itself. <br>Examples: <tt>12 ⇒ 12</tt> <i>or</i>
  <tt>-3.45e+6 ⇒ -3.45e+6</tt>


      </td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.5">conditional</a></td><td><tt>(if</tt> <i>test conseq
  alt</i><tt>) </tt></td><td>Evaluate <i>test</i>; if true,
  evaluate and return <i>conseq</i>; otherwise  
  <i>alt</i>. <br>Example: <tt>(if (&gt; 10 20) (+ 1 1) (+ 3 3)) ⇒ 6</tt>
    

    </td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-8.html#%_sec_5.2">definition</a>

</td><td>Define a new variable and give it
  the value of evaluating the expression <i>exp</i>. 
      <br>Examples: <tt>(define r 10)</tt> 
      
</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.3">procedure
   call</a></td><td><tt>(</tt><i>proc arg...</i><tt>)</tt>	</td><td>If <i>proc</i> is
   anything other than one of the symbols <tt>if,  define,
   </tt> or <tt>quote</tt> then it is treated as a procedure.  Evaluate <i>proc</i>
   and all the <i>args</i>, and then the procedure is applied to the list of <i>arg</i> values. <br>Example: <tt>(sqrt (* 2 8)) ⇒ 4.0</tt>
  
   </td></tr></tbody></table>

   

  </p><p>In the Syntax column of this table, <i>symbol</i> must be a
   symbol,
   <i>number</i> must be an integer or floating point number,
   and the other italicized words can be any
   expression. The notation <i>arg...</i> means zero or more repetitions
   of <i>arg</i>. 
   




</p><h2>What A Language Interpreter Does</h2>

A language interpreter has two parts:
<ol>

  <li> <b>Parsing:</b> The parsing component takes an input program in
the form of a sequence of characters, verifies it according to the
<i>syntactic rules</i> of the language, and translates the program
into an internal representation.  In a simple interpreter the internal
representation is a tree structure (often called an <i>abstract syntax tree</i>) 
that closely mirrors the nested
structure of statements or expressions in the program. In a language
translator called a <i>compiler</i> there is often a series of internal representations,
starting with an abstract syntax tree, and progressing to a
sequence of instructions that can be directly executed by the
computer. The Lispy parser is implemented with the function <tt>parse</tt>.</li><li> <b>Execution:</b> The internal representation is then
  processed according to the <i>semantic rules</i> of the
  language, thereby carrying out the computation. Lispy's execution function is called <tt>eval</tt> (note this shadows
  Python's built-in function of the same name).
  
</li></ol>

Here is a picture of the interpretation process:

<blockquote>program  ➡ <span><tt>parse</tt></span>
➡ abstract-syntax-tree 
➡ <span><tt>eval</tt></span>
➡ result 
</blockquote>

<p>And here is a short example of what we want <tt>parse</tt> and <tt>eval</tt> to be able to do (<tt>begin</tt> evaluates each expression in order and returns the final one):

</p><pre>&gt;&gt; program = "(begin (define r 10) (* pi (* r r)))"

&gt;&gt;&gt; parse(program)
['begin', ['define', 'r', 10], ['*', 'pi', ['*', 'r', 'r']]]

&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(parse(program))
314.1592653589793
</pre>

<h2>Type Definitions</h2>

Let's be explicit about our representations for Scheme objects:

<pre>Symbol = str              # A Scheme Symbol is implemented as a Python str
Number = (int, float)     # A Scheme Number is implemented as a Python int or float
Atom   = (Symbol, Number) # A Scheme Atom is a Symbol or Number
List   = list             # A Scheme List is implemented as a Python list
Exp    = (Atom, List)     # A Scheme expression is an Atom or List
Env    = dict             # A Scheme environment (defined below) 
                          # is a mapping of {variable: value}

</pre>

<h2>Parsing: <tt>parse</tt>, <tt>tokenize</tt> and <tt>read_from_tokens</tt></h2>


Parsing is traditionally separated into two parts: <i>lexical
analysis</i>, in which the input character string is broken up into a
sequence of <i>tokens</i>, and <i>syntactic analysis</i>, in which the
tokens are assembled into an abstract syntax tree.  
The Lispy tokens are parentheses, symbols, and numbers.
There are
many tools for lexical analysis (such as Mike Lesk and Eric Schmidt's
<a href="http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/#lex">lex</a>), but for now we'll
use a very simple tool: Python's <tt>str.split</tt>. The function <tt>tokenize</tt> takes
as input a string of characters; it
adds spaces around each paren, and then calls <tt>str.split</tt> to get a
list of tokens:

<pre>def tokenize(chars: str) -&gt; list:
    "Convert a string of characters into a list of tokens."
    return chars.replace('(', ' ( ').replace(')', ' ) ').split()
</pre>

Here we apply tokenize to our sample program:

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; program = "(begin (define r 10) (* pi (* r r)))"
&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenize(program)
['(', 'begin', '(', 'define', 'r', '10', ')', '(', '*', 'pi', '(', '*', 'r', 'r', ')', ')', ')']
</pre>


<p>Our function <tt>parse</tt> will take a string representation of a program as input, call <tt>tokenize</tt>
to get a list of tokens, and then call <tt>read_from_tokens</tt> to assemble an abstract syntax tree.
<tt>read_from_tokens</tt> looks at the first token; if
it is a <tt>')'</tt> that's a syntax error. If it is a <tt>'('</tt>, then we start
building up a list of sub-expressions until we hit a matching <tt>')'</tt>.
Any non-parenthesis token must be a symbol or number. 
We'll let Python make the distinction between them: for each non-paren token,
first try to interpret it as an int, then as a float, and if it is neither
of those, it must be a
symbol. Here is the parser:

</p><pre>def parse(program: str) -&gt; Exp:
    "Read a Scheme expression from a string."
    return read_from_tokens(tokenize(program))

def read_from_tokens(tokens: list) -&gt; Exp:
    "Read an expression from a sequence of tokens."
    if len(tokens) == 0:
        raise SyntaxError('unexpected EOF')
    token = tokens.pop(0)
    if token == '(':
        L = []
        while tokens[0] != ')':
            L.append(read_from_tokens(tokens))
        tokens.pop(0) # pop off ')'
        return L
    elif token == ')':
        raise SyntaxError('unexpected )')
    else:
        return atom(token)

def atom(token: str) -&gt; Atom:
    "Numbers become numbers; every other token is a symbol."
    try: return int(token)
    except ValueError:
        try: return float(token)
        except ValueError:
            return Symbol(token)
</pre>




<tt>parse</tt> works like this:

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; program = "(begin (define r 10) (* pi (* r r)))"

&gt;&gt;&gt; parse(program)
['begin', ['define', 'r', 10], ['*', 'pi', ['*', 'r', 'r']]]
</pre>


 
We're almost ready to define <tt>eval</tt>. But we need one more concept first.

<h2>Environments</h2>

An environment is a mapping from variable names to their values.
By default, <tt>eval</tt> will use a global environment that includes the names for a bunch of standard functions (like <tt>sqrt</tt> and <tt>max</tt>,
and also operators like <tt>*</tt>).  This environment can be augmented with user-defined variables,
using the expression <tt>(define <i>symbol value</i>)</tt>.  

<pre>import math
import operator as op

def standard_env() -&gt; Env:
    "An environment with some Scheme standard procedures."
    env = Env()
    env.update(vars(math)) # sin, cos, sqrt, pi, ...
    env.update({
        '+':op.add, '-':op.sub, '*':op.mul, '/':op.truediv, 
        '&gt;':op.gt, '&lt;':op.lt, '&gt;=':op.ge, '&lt;=':op.le, '=':op.eq, 
        'abs':     abs,
        'append':  op.add,  
        'apply':   lambda proc, args: proc(*args),
        'begin':   lambda *x: x[-1],
        'car':     lambda x: x[0],
        'cdr':     lambda x: x[1:], 
        'cons':    lambda x,y: [x] + y,
        'eq?':     op.is_, 
        'expt':    pow,
        'equal?':  op.eq, 
        'length':  len, 
        'list':    lambda *x: List(x), 
        'list?':   lambda x: isinstance(x, List), 
        'map':     map,
        'max':     max,
        'min':     min,
        'not':     op.not_,
        'null?':   lambda x: x == [], 
        'number?': lambda x: isinstance(x, Number),  
		'print':   print,
        'procedure?': callable,
        'round':   round,
        'symbol?': lambda x: isinstance(x, Symbol),
    })
    return env

global_env = standard_env()
</pre>


<h2>Evaluation: <tt>eval</tt></h2>

<h2>Interaction: A REPL</h2>

It is tedious to have to enter <tt>eval(parse("..."))</tt> all the time.
One of Lisp's great legacies is the notion of an interactive read-eval-print loop:
a way for a programmer to enter an expression, and see it immediately read, evaluated, and printed, without having to go through a lengthy build/compile/run cycle.  So let's define the function <tt>repl</tt> (which stands for read-eval-print-loop), and the function <tt>schemestr</tt> which returns a string representing a Scheme object.

<pre>def repl(prompt='lis.py&gt; '):
    "A prompt-read-eval-print loop."
    while True:
        val = eval(parse(raw_input(prompt)))
        if val is not None: 
            print(schemestr(val))

def schemestr(exp):
    "Convert a Python object back into a Scheme-readable string."
    if isinstance(exp, List):
        return '(' + ' '.join(map(schemestr, exp)) + ')' 
    else:
        return str(exp)
</pre>

Here is <tt>repl</tt> in action:

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; repl()
lis.py&gt; (define r 10)
lis.py&gt; (* pi (* r r))
314.159265359
lis.py&gt; (if (&gt; (* 11 11) 120) (* 7 6) oops)
42
lis.py&gt; (list (+ 1 1) (+ 2 2) (* 2 3) (expt 2 3))
lis.py&gt; 
</pre>

<h2>Language 2: Full Lispy</h2>

We will now extend our language with three new special forms, giving us a much more nearly-complete Scheme subset:

<p><table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Expression</th><th>Syntax</th><th>Semantics and Example

          </th></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.2">quotation</a></td><td><tt>(quote </tt><i>exp</i><tt>)</tt></td><td>
Return the <i>exp</i> literally; do not evaluate it. <br>Example:
	<tt>(quote (+ 1 2)) ⇒ (+ 1 2)</tt> 
    
  </td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.6">assignment</a></td><td><tt>(set!</tt> <i>symbol
  exp</i><tt>)</tt></td><td>Evaluate <i>exp</i> and assign that value to
  <i>symbol</i>, which must have been previously defined (with a
  <tt>define</tt> or as a parameter to an enclosing procedure).
    <br>Example: <tt>(set! r2 (* r r))</tt>


      
</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.4">procedure</a></td><td><tt>(lambda (</tt><i>symbol...</i><tt>)</tt>
  <i>exp</i><tt>)</tt></td><td>Create a procedure
  with parameter(s) named <i>symbol...</i> and <i>exp</i> as the body. <br>Example: <tt>(lambda (r)
  (* pi (* r r)))</tt>

</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>The <tt>lambda</tt> special form (an obscure nomenclature choice that refers to Alonzo Church's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>) creates a procedure.  
We want procedures to work like this:

</p><pre>lis.py&gt; (define circle-area (lambda (r) (* pi (* r r)))
lis.py&gt; (circle-area (+ 5 5))
314.159265359
</pre>

There are two steps here. In the first step,  the <tt>lambda</tt> expression is evaluated to 
create a procedure, one which refers to the global variables <tt>pi</tt> and <tt>*</tt>, takes a single parameter, which it calls <tt>r</tt>.
This procedure is used as the value of the new variable <tt>circle-area</tt>. In the second step,  
the procedure we just defined is the value of <tt>circle-area</tt>, so it is called, with the value 10 as the argument.
We want <tt>r</tt> to take on the value 10,
but it wouldn't do to just set <tt>r</tt> to 10 in the global environment.  
What if we were using <tt>r</tt> for some other purpose? We wouldn't want a call to <tt>circle-area</tt> to alter that value.  Instead, we want to arrange for there to be a <i>local</i> variable named <tt>r</tt> that we can set to 10 without worrying about interfering with any global variable that happens to have the same name.
The process for calling a procedure introduces these new local variable(s), binding each symbol in the parameter list of. the function 
to the corresponding value in the argument list of the function call.

<h2>Redefining <tt>Env</tt> as a Class</h2>

To handle local variables, we will redefine <tt>Env</tt> to be a subclass of <tt>dict</tt>.
When we evaluate <tt>(circle-area (+ 5 5))</tt>, we will fetch the procedure body, <tt>(* pi (* r r))</tt>,
and evaluate it in an environment that has <tt>r</tt> as the sole local variable (with value 10), but also has the global environment as the "outer" 
environment; it is there that we will find the values of <tt>*</tt> and <tt>pi</tt>.  
In other words, we want an environment that looks like this, with the local (blue) environment nested inside the outer (red) global environment:

<p><div>
<tt>pi: 3.141592653589793
<br>*: &lt;built-in function mul&gt;
<br>...
<br>

</tt></div>

</p><p>When we look up a variable in such a nested environment, we look first at the innermost level, but if
we don't find the variable name there, we move to the next outer level.
Procedures and environments are intertwined, so let's define them together:

</p><pre>class Env(dict):
    "An environment: a dict of {'var': val} pairs, with an outer Env."
    def __init__(self, parms=(), args=(), outer=None):
        self.update(zip(parms, args))
        self.outer = outer
    def find(self, var):
        "Find the innermost Env where var appears."
        return self if (var in self) else self.outer.find(var)

class Procedure(object):
    "A user-defined Scheme procedure."
    def __init__(self, parms, body, env):
        self.parms, self.body, self.env = parms, body, env
    def __call__(self, *args): 
        return eval(self.body, Env(self.parms, args, self.env))

global_env = standard_env()
</pre>

We see that every procedure has three components: a list of parameter names,  a body expression, and an environment
that tells us what other variables are accessible from the body. For a procedure defined at the top level this will be
the global environment, but it is also possible for a procedure to refer to the local variables of the environment
in which it was <i>defined</i> (and not the environment in which it is <i>called</i>). 

<p>An environment is a subclass of <tt>dict</tt>, so it has
all the methods that <tt>dict</tt> has. In addition there are two methods: the constructor
<tt>__init__</tt> builds a new environment by taking a list of parameter names
and a corresponding list of argument values, and creating a new environment that has those
{variable: value} pairs as the inner part, and also refers to the given <tt>outer</tt> environment.
The method <tt>find</tt> is used to find the right environment for
a variable: either the inner one or an outer one. 

</p><p>To see how these all go together, here is the new definition of <tt>eval</tt>. Note that
the clause for variable reference has changed: we now have to call <tt>env.find(x)</tt> to find at what level
the variable <tt>x</tt> exists; then we can fetch the value of <tt>x</tt> from that level. (The clause for
<tt>define</tt> has not changed, because a <tt>define</tt> always adds a new variable
to the innermost environment.)  There are two new clauses: for <tt>set!</tt>, we find the environment level
where the variable exists and set it to a new value.  With <tt>lambda</tt>, we create a new procedure object with the given
parameter list, body, and environment.

</p><pre>def eval(x, env=global_env):
    "Evaluate an expression in an environment."
    if isinstance(x, Symbol):    # variable reference
        return env.find(x)[x]
    elif not isinstance(x, List):# constant 
        return x   
    op, *args = x       
    if op == 'quote':            # quotation
        return args[0]
    elif op == 'if':             # conditional
        (test, conseq, alt) = args
        exp = (conseq if eval(test, env) else alt)
        return eval(exp, env)
    elif op == 'define':         # definition
        (symbol, exp) = args
        env[symbol] = eval(exp, env)
    elif op == 'set!':           # assignment
        (symbol, exp) = args
        env.find(symbol)[symbol] = eval(exp, env)
    elif op == 'lambda':         # procedure
        (parms, body) = args
        return Procedure(parms, body, env)
    else:                        # procedure call
        proc = eval(op, env)
        vals = [eval(arg, env) for arg in args]
        return proc(*vals)
</pre>

<p>To appreciate how procedures and environments work together, consider this program and the environment that gets formed when we evaluate <tt>(account1 -20.00)</tt>:

</p><p><table><tbody><tr><td>
<p>
<div><tt>(define <b>make-account</b>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;(lambda (<b>balance</b>)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(lambda (<b>amt</b>)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(begin <b>(set! balance (+ balance amt))</b> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;balance))))
  </p></div>
<br><tt>(define <b>account1</b> (make-account 100.00))
  <br>(account1 -20.00)
</tt></tt></div>

</p></td><td> &nbsp; </td><td>

<div><b><tt>+</tt></b>: &lt;built-in operator add&gt;
<br><tt><b>make-account</b>: &lt;a Procedure&gt;

<br><tt><tt><b>account1</b>: &lt;a Procedure&gt;
</tt></tt></tt></div>

</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>Each rectangular box represents an environment, and the color of
the box matches the color of the variables that are newly defined in
the environment.  In the last two lines of the program we define <tt>account1</tt> and call
<tt>(account1 -20.00)</tt>; this represents the creation of a bank account
with a 100 dollar opening balance, followed by a 20 dollar withdrawal.
In the process of evaluating <tt>(account1 -20.00)</tt>, we will eval the
expression highlighted in yellow.  There are three variables in that
expression.  <tt>amt</tt> can be found immediately in the innermost
(green) environment. But <tt>balance</tt> is not defined there: we
have to look at the green environment's outer <tt>env</tt>, the blue
one. And finally, the variable <tt>+</tt> is not found in either of
those; we need to do one more outer step, to the global (red) environment.
This process of looking first in inner environments and then in
outer ones is called <i>lexical scoping</i>.  
<tt>Env.find(var)</tt> finds the right environment according to
lexical scoping rules.



</p><p>Let's see what we can do now:

</pre>

We now have a language with procedures, variables, conditionals (<tt>if</tt>), and sequential execution (the <tt>begin</tt> procedure).  If you are familiar with other languages, you might think that a <tt>while</tt> or <tt>for</tt> loop would be needed, but
Scheme manages to do without these just fine. The Scheme report says "Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language." In Scheme
you iterate by defining recursive functions.

<h2>How Small/Fast/Complete/Good is Lispy?</h2>

In which we judge Lispy on several criteria:

<ul>
<li><b><i>Small:</i></b> Lispy is <i>very</i> small: 117 non-comment
  non-blank lines; 4K of source code. (An earlier version was just 90 lines, but had fewer standard procedures
and was perhaps a bit too terse.)   The smallest version of
  my Scheme in Java, <a href="http://norvig.com/jscheme.html">Jscheme</a>, was 1664 lines and 57K of source. Jscheme was
  originally called SILK (Scheme in Fifty Kilobytes), but I only kept
  under that limit by counting bytecode rather than source code. Lispy does much
  better; I think it meets Alan Kay's 1972 <a href="http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html">claim</a>
  that <i>you could define the
  "most powerful language in the world" in "a page of code."</i> (However,
  I think Alan would disagree, because he would count the Python compiler as part of the code, putting me <i>well</i> over a page.)

<pre>bash$ grep "^\s*[^#\s]" lis.py | wc
     117     497    4276
</pre></li><li><b><i>Fast:</i></b> Lispy computes <tt>(fact 100)</tt> exactly in 0.003
seconds.  That's fast enough for me (although far slower than most
other ways of computing it). </li><li><b><i>Complete:</i></b> Lispy is not very complete compared to the
Scheme standard.  Some major shortcomings:
<ul>
  <li> <b><i>Syntax</i></b>: Missing comments, quote and quasiquote notation, # literals, the derived
  expression types (such as <tt>cond</tt>, derived from <tt>if</tt>,
  or <tt>let</tt>, derived from <tt>lambda</tt>), and dotted list notation.
</li><li> <b><i>Semantics</i></b>: Missing call/cc and tail recursion.  
</li><li> <b><i>Data Types</i></b>: Missing strings, characters, booleans, ports,
  vectors, exact/inexact numbers.
  Python lists are actually closer to Scheme
  vectors than to the Scheme pairs and lists that we implement with them.
</li><li> <b><i>Procedures</i></b>: Missing over 100 primitive procedures.
  
 </li><li> <b><i>Error recovery</i></b>: Lispy does not attempt to detect,
  reasonably report, or recover from errors.  Lispy expects the
  programmer to be perfect.
</li></ul></li><li><b><i>Good:</i></b> That's up to the readers to decide.  I found it
was good for my purpose of explaining Lisp interpreters.
</li></ul>

<h2>True Story</h2>

To back up the idea that it can be very helpful to know how
interpreters work, here's a story.  Way back in 1984 I was writing a
Ph.D. thesis.  This was before LaTeX, before Microsoft Word for Windows—we used
troff. Unfortunately, troff had no facility for forward references
to symbolic labels: I wanted to be able to write "As we will see on
page @theorem-x" and then write something like "@(set theorem-x \n%)" in
the appropriate place (the troff register \n% holds the page number). My
fellow grad student Tony DeRose felt the same need, and together we
sketched out a simple Lisp program that would handle this as a preprocessor.  However,
it turned out that the Lisp we had at the time was good at reading
Lisp expressions, but so slow at reading character-at-a-time non-Lisp
expressions that our program was annoying to use.  
<p>
From there Tony and I split paths.  He reasoned that the hard part was
the interpreter for expressions; he needed Lisp for that, but he knew
how to write a tiny C routine
for reading and echoing the non-Lisp characters and link it in to the Lisp
program.  I didn't know how to do that linking, but I reasoned that writing an
interpreter for this trivial language (all it had was set variable,
fetch variable, and string concatenate) was easy, so I wrote an
interpreter in C. So, ironically, Tony wrote a Lisp program (with one small routine in C) because he was a
C programmer, and I wrote a C program because I was a Lisp programmer.
</p><p>
In the end, we both got our theses done (<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1985/6081.html">Tony</a>, <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1987/5995.html">Peter</a>).

<p dir="auto">In this repository you'll find the fully reversed source code for GTA III (<a href="https://github.com/halpz/re3/tree/master/">master</a> branch) and GTA VC (<a href="https://github.com/halpz/re3/tree/miami/">miami</a> branch).</p>
<p dir="auto">It has been tested and works on Windows, Linux, MacOS and FreeBSD, on x86, amd64, arm and arm64.<br>
Rendering is handled either by original RenderWare (D3D8)
or the reimplementation <a href="https://github.com/aap/librw">librw</a> (D3D9, OpenGL 2.1 or above, OpenGL ES 2.0 or above).<br>
Audio is done with MSS (using dlls from original GTA) or OpenAL.</p>
<p dir="auto">The project has also been ported to the <a href="https://github.com/AGraber/re3-nx/">Nintendo Switch</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/re3">Playstation Vita</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/re3-wiiu/">Nintendo Wii U</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Improvements</h2><a id="user-content-improvements" aria-label="Permalink: Improvements" href="#improvements"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We have implemented a number of changes and improvements to the original game.
They can be configured in <code>core/config.h</code>.
Some of them can be toggled at runtime, some cannot.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fixed a lot of smaller and bigger bugs</li>
<li>User files (saves and settings) stored in GTA root directory</li>
<li>Settings stored in re3.ini file instead of gta3.set</li>
<li>Debug menu to do and change various things (Ctrl-M to open)</li>
<li>Debug camera (Ctrl-B to toggle)</li>
<li>Rotatable camera</li>
<li>XInput controller support (Windows)</li>
<li>No loading screens between islands ("map memory usage" in menu)</li>
<li>Skinned ped support (models from Xbox or Mobile)</li>
<li>Rendering
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Widescreen support (properly scaled HUD, Menu and FOV)</li>
<li>PS2 MatFX (vehicle reflections)</li>
<li>PS2 alpha test (better rendering of transparency)</li>
<li>PS2 particles</li>
<li>Xbox vehicle rendering</li>
<li>Xbox world lightmap rendering (needs Xbox map)</li>
<li>Xbox ped rim light</li>
<li>Xbox screen rain droplets</li>
<li>More customizable colourfilter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Menu
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Map</li>
<li>More options</li>
<li>Controller configuration menu</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can load DFFs and TXDs from other platforms, possibly with a performance penalty</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">To-Do</h2><a id="user-content-to-do" aria-label="Permalink: To-Do" href="#to-do"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following things would be nice to have/do:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fix physics for high FPS</li>
<li>Improve performance on lower end devices, especially the OpenGL layer on the Raspberry Pi (if you have experience with this, please get in touch)</li>
<li>Compare code with PS2 code (tedious, no good decompiler)</li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210217192931/https://github.com/GTAmodding/re3/wiki/PS2-port" rel="nofollow">PS2 port</a></li>
<li>Xbox port (not quite as important)</li>
<li>reverse remaining unused/debug functions</li>
<li>compare CodeWarrior build with original binary for more accurate code (very tedious)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Modding</h2><a id="user-content-modding" aria-label="Permalink: Modding" href="#modding"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Asset modifications (models, texture, handling, script, ...) should work the same way as with original GTA for the most part.</p>
<p dir="auto">CLEO scripts work with <a href="https://github.com/cleolibrary/CLEO-Redux">CLEO Redux</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mods that make changes to the code (dll/asi, limit adjusters) will <em>not</em> work.
Some things these mods do are already implemented in re3 (much of SkyGFX, GInput, SilentPatch, Widescreen fix),
others can easily be achieved (increasing limis, see <code>config.h</code>),
others will simply have to be rewritten and integrated into the code directly.
Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If you feel the need, you can also use CodeWarrior 7 to compile re3 using the supplied codewarrior/re3.mcp project - this requires the original RW33 libraries, and the DX8 SDK. The build is unstable compared to the MSVC builds though, and is mostly meant to serve as a reference.</p>

<p dir="auto">re3 was started sometime in the spring of 2018,
initially as a way to test reversed collision and physics code
inside the game.
This was done by replacing single functions of the game
with their reversed counterparts using a dll.</p>
<p dir="auto">After a bit of work the project lay dormant for about a year
and was picked up again and pushed to github in May 2019.
At the time I (aap) had reversed around 10k lines of code and estimated
the final game to have around 200-250k.
Others quickly joined the effort (Fire_Head, shfil, erorcun and Nick007J
in time order, and Serge a bit later) and we made very quick progress
throughout the summer of 2019
after which the pace slowed down a bit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Due to everyone staying home during the start of the Corona pandemic
everybody had a lot of time to work on re3 again and
we finally got a standalone exe in April 2020 (around 180k lines by then).</p>
<p dir="auto">After the initial excitement and fixing and polishing the code further,
reVC was started in early May 2020 by starting from re3 code,
not by starting from scratch replacing functions with a dll.
After a few months of mostly steady progress we considered reVC
finished in December.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since then we have started reLCS, which is currently work in progress.</p>

<p>Devices in the Spartan UltraScale+ family offer a high I/O to logic cell ratio for FPGAs built in 28nm and lower process technology (the highest in the industry, according to AMD), consume up to 30% less power than compared to the previous generation, and feature robust security features that outclass the rest of the Cost-Optimized portfolio.</p>
<p>This FPGA family is built on the same UltraScale+ architecture as <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/2022/11/15/amd-unveils-low-cost-artix-ultrascale-au7p-fpga-and-zynq-ultrascale-zu3t-mpsoc/">previous Artix and Zynq products</a>. They are the first AMD UltraScale+ FPGAs to feature a hardened DDR memory controller and PCIe Gen4 x8 support, “providing both power efficiency and future-ready capabilities for customers.”</p>

<p>eBPF is a crazy technology – like putting JavaScript into the Linux kernel –  and getting it accepted had so far been an untold story of strategy and ingenuity. The eBPF documentary, published late last year, tells this story by interviewing key players from 2014 including myself, and touches on new developments including Windows. (If you are new to eBPF, it is the name of a kernel execution engine that runs a variety of new programs in a performant and safe sandbox in the kernel, like how JavaScript can run programs safely in a browser sandbox; it is also no longer an acronym.) The documentary was played at KubeCon, and is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb_vD3XZYOA">youtube</a>:</p>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wb_vD3XZYOA?si=-i0HID5ek4hPcEOD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>Watching this brings me right back to 2014, to see the faces and hear their voices discussing the problems we were trying to fix. Thanks to Speakeasy Productions for doing such a great job with this <a href="https://ebpfdocumentary.com/">documentary</a>, and letting you experience what it was like in those early days. This is also a great example of all the work that goes on behind the scenes to get code merged in a large codebase like Linux.</p>

<p>When Alexei Starovoitov visited Netflix in 2014 to discuss eBPF with myself and Amer Ather, we were so entranced that we lost track of time and were eventually kicked out of the meeting room as another meeting was starting. It was then I realized that we had missed lunch! Alexei sounded so confident that I was convinced that eBPF was the future, but a couple of times he added "if the patches get merged." <em>If</em> they get merged?? They <em>have</em> to get merged, this idea is too good to waste.</p>

<p>While only several of us worked on eBPF in 2014, more joined in 2015 and later, and there are now hundreds contributing to make it what it is. A longer documentary could also interview Brendan Blanco (bcc), Yonghong Song (bcc), Sasha Goldshtein (bcc), Alastair Robertson (bpftrace), Tobais Waldekranz (ply), Andrii Nakryiko, Joe Stringer, Jakub Kicinski, Martin KaFai Lau, John Fastabend, Quentin Monnet, Jesper Dangaard Brouer, Andrey Ignatov, Stanislav Fomichev, Teng Qin, Paul Chaignon, Vicent Marti, Dan Xu, Bas Smit, Viktor Malik, Mary Marchini, and many more. Thanks to everyone for all the work.</p>

<p>Ten years later it still feels like it's early days for eBPF, and a great time to get involved: It's likely already available in your production kernels, and there are tools, libraries, and documentation to help you get started.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the documentary. PS. Congrats to Isovalent, the role-model eBPF startup, as Cisco recently announced they would acquire them!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Exposure to leaded gasoline lowered the IQ of about half the population of the United States, a new study estimates.</p><p>The peer-reviewed study, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focuses on people born before 1996 — the year the U.S. banned gas containing lead.</p><p>Overall, the researchers from Florida State University and Duke University found, childhood lead exposure cost America an estimated 824 million points, or 2.6 points per person on average.&nbsp;</p><p>Certain cohorts were more affected than others. For people born in the 1960s and the 1970s, when leaded gas consumption was skyrocketing, the IQ loss was estimated to be up to 6 points and for some, more than 7 points. Exposure to it came primarily from inhaling auto exhaust.&nbsp;</p><p>The team behind the study used gas consumption data, population estimates and other data to calculate that as of 2015, more than 170 million Americans had had blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter in their early childhood years.&nbsp;</p><p>Lead is a neurotoxin, and no amount of it is safe. Currently, 3.5 micrograms per deciliter is the reference value for blood lead levels to be considered <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/prevention/blood-lead-levels.htm">high</a>; the acceptable amount was once higher.&nbsp;</p><p>Principal study author Michael McFarland, an associate professor of sociology at Florida State University and a faculty member of the university’s Center for Demography and Population Health, called the number of people affected by lead exposure “staggering.”</p><p>“This is important because we often think about lead as an issue for children, and of course it is,” he said. “But what we really wanted to know is what happens to those children who were exposed?”</p><p>In many cases, McFarland said, a 2 to 3 point IQ difference is nominal, unless an individual is on the lower side of IQ distribution.</p><p>“If you’re more toward cognitive impairment, a couple points can mean a lot,” he said.</p><p>But on a population basis, shifting the average IQ down even a small amount could have large consequences, said Sung Kyun Park, an associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. The entire bell curve shifts, he explained, with more of the population at what was once the extreme low end of IQ scores.</p><p>Lead used to be added to gasoline to help engines run more smoothly until other, safer additives replaced it. In addition to being linked to lower IQs, it has also been associated with heart and <a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/lead-exposure-and-kidney-function#:~:text=Most%20lead%2Drelated%20kidney%20disease,is%20stored%20in%20the%20bones.">kidney disease</a>.</p><p>Lead can be inhaled or ingested, with children particularly susceptible to its poisonous effects. Children’s blood lead levels have been dramatically lowered in the U.S. in recent decades, but lead exposure still happens, and Black children are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33394180/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Although%20lead%20exposure%20in,gap%20was%20lesser%20but%20persisted.">exposed</a> more often than white children. Monday’s study, too, estimated that most Black adults under age 45 experienced “considerably higher” levels of blood lead levels in early life than their white counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>The racial disparities are generally due to environmental contamination and infrastructure issues that affect drinking water in low-income and minority neighborhoods, with the water crisis in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-michigan-gov-rick-snyder-charged-flint-water-crisis-n1253966">Flint, Michigan</a>, one of the most egregious examples in recent years.</p><p>And while children are the most vulnerable to getting very ill from lead, the toxin’s damage can show up years later, Park said.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="435"><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-best-essay-1.gif" width="121" height="18" alt="The Best Essay"><span size="2" face="verdana">March 2024<p>Despite its title this isn't meant to be the best essay. My goal
here is to figure out what the best essay would be like.</p><p>It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic.
What made it special would be what it was about.</p><p>Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probably
wouldn't be about this year's lipstick colors. But it wouldn't be
vaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be
surprising. It has to tell people something they don't already know.</p><p>The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell
people something surprising about.</p><p>That may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences.
One is that science enters the picture like an elephant stepping
into a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea of
natural selection in an essay written in 1844.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><span color="#dddddd">1</span></a>]</span>
Talk about an
important topic you could tell people something surprising about.
If that's the test of a great essay, this was surely the best one
written in 1844. And indeed, the best possible essay at any given
time would usually be one describing the most important scientific
or technological discovery it was possible to make.
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><span color="#dddddd">2</span></a>]</span><p>Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing
this that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the best
essay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best
one you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true.
It might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this
sense. But it wouldn't be impressive to write an essay introducing
natural selection now. The best essay <i>now</i> would be one describing
a great discovery we didn't yet know about.</p><p>If the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces to
the question of how to make great discoveries, then I started with
the wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that we
shouldn't waste our time writing essays but instead focus on making
discoveries in some specific domain. But I'm interested in essays
and what can be done with them, so I want to see if there's some
other question I could have asked.</p><p>There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the
one I started with. Instead of asking <i>what would the best essay
be?</i> I should have asked <i>how do you write essays well?</i> Though
these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer
to the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay
writing. The second question forces it to be.</p><p>Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do
you do that well? How do you discover by writing?</p><p>An essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a
question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't
have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like
one in the sense that it spurs some response.</p><p>How do you get this initial question? It probably won't work to
choose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it.
Professional traders won't even trade unless they have what they
call an <i>edge</i> — a convincing story about why in some class of
trades they'll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn't
attack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about
it or way of approaching it.</p><p>You don't need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind
of gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about
something other people take for granted can be edge enough.</p><p>If you come across a question that's sufficiently puzzling, it could
be worth exploring even if it doesn't seem very momentous. Many an
important discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed
insignificant at first. How can they <i>all</i> be finches? 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><span color="#dddddd">3</span></a>]</span><p>Once you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud
about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific
string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This
initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts
your ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because
once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.</p><p>Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting
with something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn't be, because
this is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some
specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's
wrong, you'll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay
writing is rereading what you've written and asking <i>is this correct
and complete?</i> You have to be very strict when rereading, not just
because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between
your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be
discovered.</p><p>The prize for being strict with what you've written is not just
refinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make
it exactly right, sometimes you find that you can't, and that the
reason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when
you discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><span color="#dddddd">4</span></a>]</span><p>Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first step
in a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional
questions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process
continues recursively, as response spurs response. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><span color="#dddddd">5</span></a>]</span><p>Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which
means you're traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped,
which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point.
How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the
greatest combination of generality and novelty. I don't consciously
rank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting;
but generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><span color="#dddddd">6</span></a>]</span><p>If you're willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don't have to guess
right. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if it
isn't good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time.
In this essay I've already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in addition
to countless shorter ones. Maybe I'll reattach it at the end, or
boil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we'll
see. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><span color="#dddddd">7</span></a>]</span><p>In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous
temptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep
something that isn't right just because it contains a few good bits
or cost you a lot of effort.</p><p>The most surprising new question being thrown off at this point is
<i>does it really matter what the initial question is?</i> If the space
of ideas is highly connected, it shouldn't, because you should be
able to get from any question to the most valuable ones in a few
hops. And we see evidence that it's highly connected in the way,
for example, that people who are obsessed with some topic can turn
any conversation toward it. But that only works if you know where
you want to go, and you don't in an essay. That's the whole point.
You don't want to be the obsessive conversationalist, or all your
essays will be about the same thing. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><span color="#dddddd">8</span></a>]</span><p>The other reason the initial question matters is that you usually
feel somewhat obliged to stick to it. I don't think about this when
I decide which branch to follow. I just follow novelty and generality.
Sticking to the question is enforced later, when I notice I've
wandered too far and have to backtrack. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><span color="#dddddd">9</span></a>]</span>
But I think this is
the optimal solution. You don't want the hunt for novelty and
generality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see what
you get.<p>Since the initial question does constrain you, in the best case it
sets an upper bound on the quality of essay you'll write. If you
do as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow
from the initial question, the initial question itself is the only
place where there's room for variation.</p><p>It would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though,
because you can't predict where a question will lead. Not if you're
doing things right, because doing things right means making
discoveries, and by definition you can't predict those. So the way
to respond to this situation is not to be cautious about which
initial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essays
are for taking risks.</p><p>Almost any question can get you a good essay. Indeed, it took some
effort to think of a sufficiently unpromising topic in the third
paragraph, because any essayist's first impulse on hearing that the
best essay couldn't be about x would be to try to write it. But if
most questions yield good essays, only some yield great ones.</p><p>Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? Considering
how long I've been writing essays, it's alarming how novel that
question feels.</p><p>One thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I love
questions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seeming
counterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three.
This essay is an example. Writing about the best essay implies there
is such a thing, which pseudo-intellectuals will dismiss as reductive,
though it follows necessarily from the possibility of one essay
being better than another. And thinking about how to do something
so ambitious is close enough to doing it that it holds your attention.</p><p>I like to start an essay with a gleam in my eye. This could be just
a taste of mine, but there's one aspect of it that probably isn't:
to write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interested
in it. A good writer can write well about anything, but to stretch
for the novel insights that are the raison d'etre of the essay, you
have to care.</p><p>If caring about it is one of the criteria for a good initial question,
then the optimal question varies from person to person. It also
means you're more likely to write great essays if you care about a
lot of different things. The more curious you are, the greater the
probable overlap between the set of things you're curious about and
the set of topics that yield great essays.</p><p>What other qualities would a great initial question have? It's
probably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas.
And I find it's a good sign if it's one that people think has already
been thoroughly explored. But the truth is that I've barely thought
about how to choose initial questions, because I rarely do it. I
rarely <i>choose</i> what to write about; I just start thinking about
something, and sometimes it turns into an essay.</p><p>Am I going to stop writing essays about whatever I happen to be
thinking about and instead start working my way through some
systematically generated list of topics? That doesn't sound like
much fun. And yet I want to write good essays, and if the initial
question matters, I should care about it.</p><p>Perhaps the answer is to go one step earlier: to write about whatever
pops into your head, but try to ensure that what pops into your
head is good. Indeed, now that I think about it, this has to be the
answer, because a mere list of topics wouldn't be any use if you
didn't have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you
need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't
generate those systematically. If only. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><span color="#dddddd">10</span></a>]</span><p>You can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. The
quality of the ideas that come out of your head depend on what goes
in, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.</p><p>You can't learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning
about topics that are very different from one another. When I tell
people about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buy
books about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because the
topics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhaps
that's actually optimal in this business.</p><p>You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building
things, and by going places and seeing things. I don't think it's
important to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who
make you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for an
afternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smart
people. I know because that's what a block of office hours at Y
Combinator consists of.</p><p>While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes
from doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have
to solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing,
I suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have
done, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other
fields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your
time working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was
hard.</p><p>I'm not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement to
those already doing it. If you've spent all your life so far working
on other things, you're already halfway there. Though of course to
be good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writing
you'd probably have spent at least some time doing it.</p><p>Everything I've said about initial questions applies also to the
questions you encounter in writing the essay. They're the same
thing; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, just
as every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So any
technique that gets you good initial questions also gets you good
whole essays.</p><p>At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels
like a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn't every
answer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you
start to feel sated. Once you've covered enough interesting ground,
you start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just
as well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it's
not lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be
asking the initial question of a new essay.</p><p>That's the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas:
the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough
starting from question A, you'll never make it to question B. Though
if you keep writing essays you'll gradually fix this problem by
burning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of
essays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.</p><p>When a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. You
can either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtrees
end to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usually
it requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuously
at this point, but not this time. This time I actually need an
example of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier that
the best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in the way the
best painting would. This seems surprising enough to be
worth investigating further.</p><p>There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about
a matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect
on readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that
looked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us.
But with essays the two senses diverge, because essays
teach, and you can't teach people something they already know.
Natural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance,
but an essay explaining it couldn't have the same effect on us that
it would have had on Darwin's contemporaries, precisely because his
ideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><span color="#dddddd">11</span></a>]</span><p>I imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essay
would be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it would
contain some deep, timeless wisdom that would appeal equally to
Aristotle and Feynman. That doesn't seem to be true. But if the
best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in this stricter
sense, what would it take to write essays that were?</p><p>The answer to that turns out to be very strange: to be the evergreen
kind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense that
its discoveries aren't assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwise
there will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers.
If you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future as
well, you have to write essays that won't stick — essays that,
no matter how good they are, won't become part of what people in
the future learn before they read them. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><span color="#dddddd">12</span></a>]</span><p>I can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write about
things people never learn. For example, it's a long-established
pattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes,
and only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of them
weren't worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, you
can be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprised
by it.</p><p>Ditto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdo
things — of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions,
for example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learn
to avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timeless
topic.</p><p>Sometimes when we're slow to grasp things it's not just because
we're obtuse or in denial but because we've been deliberately lied
to. There are a lot of things adults </p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/lies.html"><u>lie</u></a> 
to kids about, and when
you reach adulthood, they don't take you aside and hand you a list
of them. They don't remember which lies they told you, and most
were implicit anyway. So contradicting such lies will be a source
of surprises for as long as adults keep telling them.<p>Sometimes it's systems that lie to you. For example, the educational
systems in most countries train you to win by 
</p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/lesson.html"><u>hacking the test</u></a>. But
that's not how you win at the most important real-world tests, and
after decades of training, this is hard for new arrivals in the real
world to grasp. Helping them overcome such institutional lies will
work as long as the institutions remain broken. 
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f13n"><span color="#dddddd">13</span></a>]</span><p>Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers
already know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted
culturally. "Everyone knows," for example, that it can be rewarding
to have </p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/kids.html"><u>kids</u></a>. But till you have them you don't know precisely what
forms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never
have put into words.<p>I've written about all these kinds of topics. But I didn't do it
in a deliberate attempt to write essays that were timeless in the
stricter sense. And indeed, the fact that this depends on one's ideas
not sticking suggests that it's not worth making a deliberate attempt
to. You should write about topics of timeless importance, yes, but
if you do such a good job that your conclusions stick and future
generations find your essay obvious instead of novel, so much the
better. You've crossed into Darwin territory.</p><p>Writing about topics of timeless importance is an instance of
something even more general, though: breadth of applicability. And
there are more kinds of breadth than chronological — applying to
lots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimate
aim.</p><p>I already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I'm
always chasing. But I'm glad I understand where timelessness fits.</p><p>I understand better where a lot of things fit now. This essay has
been a kind of tour of essay writing. I started out hoping to get
advice about topics; if you assume good writing, the only thing
left to differentiate the best essay is its topic. And I did get
advice about topics: discover natural selection. Yeah, that would
be nice. But when you step back and ask what's the best you can do
short of making some great discovery like that, the answer turns
out to be about procedure. Ultimately the quality of an essay is a
function of the ideas discovered in it, and the way you get them
is by casting a wide net for questions and then being very exacting
with the answers.</p><p>The most striking feature of this map of essay writing are the
alternating stripes of inspiration and effort required. The questions
depend on inspiration, but the answers can be got by sheer persistence.
You don't have to get an answer right the first time, but there's
no excuse for not getting it right eventually, because you can keep
rewriting till you do. And this is not just a theoretical possibility.
It's a pretty accurate description of the way I work. I'm rewriting
as we speak.</p><p>But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly
on effort, in the limit case it's inspiration that makes the
difference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing
to get. That pool has no bottom.</p><p>How to get more questions? That is the most important question of
all.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>[</p><a name="f1n"><span color="#000000">1</span></a>]
Darwin wouldn't have chosen to publish his ideas this way.
His 1844 essay, like the 1839 version that preceded it, was written more to work out
his ideas than to communicate them. But Lyell and Hooker's hands were 
forced by Alfred Wallace's independent
discovery of natural selection before Darwin had published anything.<p>[</p><a name="f2n"><span color="#000000">2</span></a>]
There might be some resistance to this conclusion on the
grounds that some of these discoveries could only be understood by
a small number of readers. But you get into all sorts of difficulties
if you want to disqualify essays on this account. How do you decide
where the cutoff should be? If a virus kills off everyone except a 
handful of people sequestered at Los Alamos,
could an essay that had been disqualified now be eligible? Etc.<p>[</p><a name="f3n"><span color="#000000">3</span></a>]
When you find yourself very curious about an apparently minor
question, that's an exciting sign. Evolution has designed you to
pay attention to things that matter. So when you're very curious
about something random, that could mean you've unconsciously noticed
it's less random than it seems.<p>[</p><a name="f4n"><span color="#000000">4</span></a>]
Corollary: If you're not intellectually honest, your writing
won't just be biased, but also boring, because you'll miss all the
ideas you'd have discovered if you pushed for the truth.<p>[</p><a name="f5n"><span color="#000000">5</span></a>]
Sometimes this process begins before you start writing.
Sometimes you've already figured out the first few things you want
to say. Schoolchildren are often taught they should decide <i>everything</i>
they want to say, and write this down as an outline before they
start writing the essay itself. Maybe that's a good way to get them
started — or not, I don't know — but it's antithetical to the
spirit of essay writing. The more detailed your outline, the less
your ideas can benefit from the sort of discovery that essays are for.<p>[</p><a name="f6n"><span color="#000000">6</span></a>]
The problem with this type of "greedy" algorithm is that you
can end up on a local maximum. If the most valuable question is
preceded by a boring one, you'll overlook it. But I can't imagine
a better strategy. There's no lookahead except by writing. So use
a greedy algorithm and a lot of time.<p>[</p><a name="f7n"><span color="#000000">7</span></a>]
I ended up reattaching the first 5 of the 17 paragraphs, and
discarding the rest.<p>[</p><a name="f8n"><span color="#000000">8</span></a>]
Stephen Fry confessed to making use of this phenomenon when
taking exams at Oxford. He had in his head a standard essay about
some general literary topic, and he would find a way to turn the
exam question toward it and then just reproduce it again.<p>Strictly speaking it's the graph of ideas that would be highly
connected, not the space, but that usage would confuse people who
don't know graph theory, whereas people who do know it will get
what I mean if I say "space".</p><p>[</p><a name="f9n"><span color="#000000">9</span></a>]
Too far doesn't depend just on the distance from the original
topic. It's more like that distance divided by the value of whatever
I've discovered in the subtree.<p>[</p><a name="f10n"><span color="#000000">10</span></a>]
Or can you? I should try writing about this. Even if the
chance of succeeding is small, the expected value is huge.<p>[</p><a name="f11n"><span color="#000000">11</span></a>]
There was a vogue in the 20th century for saying that the
purpose of art was also to teach. Some artists tried to justify
their work by explaining that their goal was not to produce something
good, but to challenge our preconceptions about art. And to be fair,
art can teach somewhat. The ancient Greeks' naturalistic sculptures
represented a new idea, and must have been extra exciting to
contemporaries on that account. But they still look good to us.<p>[</p><a name="f12n"><span color="#000000">12</span></a>]
Bertrand Russell caused huge controversy in the early 20th
century with his ideas about "trial marriage." But they make boring
reading now, because they prevailed. "Trial marriage" is what we
call "dating."<p>[</p><a name="f13n"><span color="#000000">13</span></a>]
If you'd asked me 10 years ago, I'd have predicted that schools
would continue to teach hacking the test for centuries. But now it
seems plausible that students will soon be taught individually by
AIs, and that exams will be replaced by ongoing, invisible
micro-assessments.<span color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell,

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://codedeepdives.com/blog/guide-to-software-engineer-contracting-in-uk">https://codedeepdives.com/blog/guide-to-software-engineer-contracting-in-uk</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39662506">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is my guide to contracting in the UK. Its based on my experiences, and to be honest yours might be different. But maybe this guide will help someone who is thinking of going contracting, and it might help you understand the pros/cons and what to know about it before you begin.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-contracting-and-what-is-involved">What is contracting, and what is involved?</h3>
<p>Contracting is where you work for a company, without being a permanent employee.</p>
<p>This means you get no benefits (like holiday pay), should expect no training, are expected to 'hit the ground running' and should know your tech stack pretty well. And the main benefit for this: much higher pay.</p>
<p>Someone earning £70-80k could easily get a contract paying £400-500 a day. Even on the low end of £400, £400 * 22 days worked a month = £8k/mo = £96k a year. Plus, you end up paying less tax due to the different structure.</p>
<p>Most contractors will work for a company for something like 6 weeks to 6 months. Then you set LinkedIn to 'looking for work', speak to agency recruiters, and you tell them your date rate. They'll match you up with potential roles.</p>
<p>The interview process for contract roles is really straightforward. They'll do some basic checks, but if it takes more than an hour or two you can sometimes even just refuse, and they'll accommodate that.</p>
<p>If you turn up and are rubbish, your contract will be terminated really quick. And if there are layoffs, contractors would (sometimes) already be well gone already.</p>
<p>During first COVID waves (and first lockdowns) the UK software engineer contract market completely dried up. There were almost no contracts going around (definitely not many published publicly or on LinkedIn).</p>
<p><strong>Note: none of this is legal or tax advice. This is just based on my experience, and is entirely my own opinion on how the UK contract market works. Before thinking of going contracting, please do further research. Speak to other contractors, speak to recruiters and get a feel for the contract market near you</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most of this guide also assumes you are set up as a limited company, and contracting within that</strong> but the guide is also relevant if you are contracting via an umbrella company or sole trader.</p>
<h3 id="proscons-of-contracting-in-uk">Pros/cons of contracting in UK</h3>
<h4 id="pros-of-contracting-in-uk">Pros of contracting in UK</h4>
<ul>
<li>You are your own boss (but you have clients who you have to keep happy),</li>
<li>you can select your own work hours. The contract might say something like you have to do 40hrs work a week or 8hrs a day, you can choose when they are.</li>
<li>You will not be on-call</li>
<li>You will not have to attend company off-sites (in fact you probably legally won't be able to)</li>
<li>You can have as much holiday as you want (but you only get paid for days you work)</li>
<li>For some contracts, you can work weekends (<em>at your choice</em>) which is great if you need to earn more money</li>
<li>It is easy to get a contract and start work within a day or two. I've never found it hard to find a new contract immediately. You normally know when you will be moving to a new role, so you normally have at least a few weeks.</li>
<li>You are always seeing new companies, new tech, new tech stacks, and the job never gets boring</li>
<li>More exposure to different ways of working and different frameworks</li>
<li>No performance reviews, no feedback cycles</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-of-contracting-in-uk">Cons of contracting in UK</h4>
<ul>
<li>A lot of people say job security, however I do not believe this. It is so easy to find new contracts, and even perm employees are layed off.</li>
<li>the paperwork, legal and tax side is not fun. Tip: pay an accountant to do everything</li>
<li>no sick pay. You don't work, you don't get paid.</li>
<li>No benefits. No insurance, no gym, etc. But you earn a lot more so its not a huge deal, except for the pension contribution.</li>
<li>more complex to get mortgages</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="job-security-as-a-contractor">Job security as a contractor</h3>
<p>A lot of permanent employees think their jobs are much more secure than contractors. I very much disagree. Contractors can get a new role almost immediately (the only time this hasn't been true was during COVID first lockdown)</p>
<p>I think there is a bit more stress when interviewing all the time, but after a while it becomes quite easy. Landing the next role can be as easy as calling up a few recruiters and seeing what roles they have right now.</p>
<h3 id="taxetc">Tax/etc</h3>
<p><strong>I am not an accountant. Please consult with an accountant to understand the tax implications. This is just a very high level overview of tax in UK when contracting</strong></p>
<h4 id="ir35-and-other-tax-issues">IR35 and other tax issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you have your own ltd company, IR35 is a very important tax law that all contractors should be aware of. I don't want to give bad advice here, and I would recommend that every contractor fully understands the IR35 laws, so please Google it and read up. This cannot be skipped, and if you do not know about IR35 recruiters and hiring managers will not take you seriously.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="is-it-worth-getting-an-accountant-when-contracting">Is it worth getting an accountant when contracting?</h4>
<ul>
<li>100% yes!</li>
<li>Get an accountant/bookkeeper to deal with all your tax things. Don't go with one of the cheap online ones, go to a proper accountant and pay them to handle everything.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="expenses-and-tax-deductible-things">Expenses and tax deductible things</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most business expenses are tax deductible.</li>
<li>Food is not! despite what many contractors will like to tell you.</li>
<li>Laptops, monitors, travel (in most cases when contracting) are all expenses</li>
<li>If you register for VAT, you may be able to set up for flat rate VAT. This means you can't really claim back any VAT (as a contractor you probably won't have many purchases) unless its over £2k. But you can charge VAT (at 20%) but you send HMRC a smaller %. The details of this, in my opinion, are best left for an accountant to explain to you. But basically you can make another couple of % (especially in the first year, where you get an extra 1%).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="getting-a-mortgage-as-a-contractor">Getting a mortgage as a contractor</h4>
<ul>
<li>Getting a mortgage is only slightly harder as a contractor. There are specialist  mortgage advisors who can find providers that give a mortage to contractors and self employed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="limited-companies-umbrella-companies-sole-trader">Limited companies, umbrella companies, sole trader</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited companies</strong> are what most contractors are. Some companies will only work with contractors who have a ltd company.  If you have this then the contracts are between the business you're contracting at, and your ltd company. If you are earning a decent day rate and are busy most months, then it is probably better in terms of tax to be set up as a limited company. It also means you can substitute yourself with someone else (just like if you hired a plumbing company, they can send who they want as long as they are qualified)</li>
<li><strong>Umbrella companies</strong> will be set up by agencies. They charge for this, and you make less due to worse tax structure. I cannot see why people do it, except it is easier</li>
<li>You can also do <strong>contracting as a sole trader</strong>, although you will be more limited with what companies will work with you. I did it as a sole trader for quite a while, until my accountant told me how I would be much better off with a ltd company.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="business-bank-accounts">Business bank accounts</h4>
<p>Getting a business bank account is easy.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly used ones that I've seen other contractors set up is with tide (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.tide.co/">www.tide.co</a>). Do your research and see what is the best available one for you.</p>
<p>Most business bank accounts have a cost (you can probably get them for £10/mo). I think the reason tide are popular is because they charge no monthly fee (and very minimal fees for doing things like certain withdrawals).</p>
<p>You will need your business bank set up before you can accept payments from companies. Do not accept bank transfers to your personal current bank account.</p>
<p>If you are setting up a ltd company: You will be unable to set up a business bank account until you have your company set up, and have the documentation to prove it.</p>

<p><strong>Get insurance when contracting</strong>.</p>
<p>As well as it covering you in case something goes wrong (or you get sued), some companies won't work with you if you don't have insurance. It is quite quick to get insurance, and you can use price comparision sites for business insurance.</p>
<p>There are a few types, including <em>public liability insurance</em>, <em>professional indemnity insurance</em>, <em>employers' liability insurance</em> (important if you employ others in your business)</p>
<h3 id="day-rates-as-a-contractor">Day rates as a contractor</h3>
<p>In the UK everything contractors do are based on day rates. Contractors are often quite happy to share what sort of day rates they're getting with other contractors.</p>
<p>In my experience there is only a slight correlation between how good someone is at software engineering and the day rate they are getting.</p>
<h4 id="uk-london-software-engineer-contract-day-rates">UK London software engineer contract day rates</h4>
<ul>
<li>London software engineering day rates are around £400-500 (outside IR35)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="uk-non-london-software-engineer-contract-day-rates">UK (non London) software engineer contract day rates</h4>
<ul>
<li>Outside of UK they can be lower, £300-400</li>
<li>Sometimes they can be the same as London rates.</li>
<li>Many are remote, so the location doesn't matter as much as it did a few years ago</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-calculate-contractor-day-rate-from-a-perm-salary">How to calculate contractor day rate, from a perm salary</h4>
<p>This is a funny subject, as there is no easy comparison. A perm employee is going to have benefits, sick pay, holiday. But I think from experience £70k = £400, £80 = £500, £90+ = £600+. Maybe this isn't too accurate, and might be on the low end of perm employee salary ranges.</p>
<h3 id="skills-and-attributes-as-a-contractor">Skills and attributes as a contractor</h3>
<p>Contractors are not always very skilled! I've worked with highly paid contractors who knew only the basics of how to code. But generally great engineers can command a higher price and after working with a recruiter, the recruiters will hear only positive feedback and will be keen to place you again in another role.</p>
<p>I've always specalised in certain languages and frameworks. Knowing them really well has always meant I could just present myself as an expert in whatever tech the role was for. (I'd only apply for those roles).</p>
<p>For SaaS and other typical tech startups, as well as knowing your programming language &amp; frameworks, I'd suggest you know these really well:</p>
<ul>
<li>git</li>
<li>experience with something like jira</li>
<li>(if for a FE role) experience with something like Figma or Sketch</li>
</ul>
<p>No one will be around to show you how to use git if you are a contractor and turn up without knowing how to use it.</p>
<h4 id="how-skilled-do-you-have-to-be-to-be-a-contractor">How skilled do you have to be to be a contractor?</h4>
<p>It helps to be very skilled, but really I think anyone with more than a few years of working in a perm role could land contract jobs. Most contract jobs are quite simple. They want you to quickly turn out a new feature or build something. Often its from scratch, which is nice. Sometimes its not from scratch, but you can pick and choose what contracts you work with.</p>
<h4 id="what-sorts-of-teams-will-you-be-working-with-as-a-contractor">What sorts of teams will you be working with as a contractor?</h4>
<p>A wide mix! It could be almost just you by yourself, or working with a typical cross functional squad. You won't have a manager (you might have someone to report to - but they won't be your manager)</p>
<p>You may be expected to turn up and get set up almost immediately. Unlike a perm job, there will probably be very mimimal onboarding, and if you do have to do onboarding you will not do the same as normal permanent new starters.</p>
<h3 id="getting-contractor-roles">Getting contractor roles</h3>
<p>In the UK the best way I've found to get contract roles is to simply speak to recruiters. The best place to find them is on LinkedIn. Set yourself to 'open to work', add some experiences, and contact recruiters who are posting contracts. The best way to find them is to search for things like "London JS per day" or "London JS contract" or "London JS outside ir35", and you'll find a bunch of recruiters posting their roles.</p>
<p>I read online before I started contracting like this that it is super competitive, you have to phone them the second you see them put an ad up. I never experienced this. There is enough work and there are enough roles posted that you can ignore all that. I have a feeling that recruiters might spread these lies in order to get you to only work with them.</p>
<h4 id="what-companies-are-looking-for-when-hiring-contractors">What companies are looking for when hiring contractors</h4>
<p>I've worked mostly with startups, but orgs of all sizes hire contractors (including FAANG).</p>
<h4 id="interviewing-for-contract-roles">Interviewing for contract roles</h4>
<p>Interviews are generally quite simple. There might be some simple tech test (if it takes long, you can sometimes refuse and just say you don't have time - some companies will still continue the interview process with you.)</p>
<p>There will probably not be a full behaviour type interviews, or them seeing how well you will fit in culturally.</p>
<p>If there are behaviour/culture interviews, then they will not see you as a contractor - they see you as someone they can try and turn into a perm employee. This is good - but they'll expect you to take part in everything normal employees take part in.</p>
<h4 id="speaking-to-recruiters">Speaking to recruiters</h4>
<ul>
<li>Know your date rate. If you don't know, do some research and pick a number. Don't go low.</li>
<li>Get a ltd company set up, it makes it easier and you can start working ASAP</li>
<li>Get insurance. Its not too expensive, some companeis will require it</li>
<li>Tell recruiters what rate you're looking for, what your expertise or specality is (maybe this is just what languages you have been using)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="negotiations">Negotiations</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you go via a recruiter, they will tell you a rate (e.g. £500) but they charge the company much more (e.g. £600+). If the company <em>really</em> wants to work with you, and you have other roles you're considering you can negociate. The agency will get a smaller cut, but they are competing against other agencies and would prefer a smaller cut than no cut at all.</li>
<li>Know market rate. If you don't know market rate, just say your rate is market rate.</li>
<li>Negociations will be with the agency.</li>
<li>If you go direct: they save quite a bit by not paying recruitment agency fees. You may be able to demand a higher day rate.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-find-work">How to find work</h4>
<ul>
<li>LinkedIn! I know other contractors find work in other ways, but linkedin has really good success rate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="writing-a-cv-as-a-contractor">Writing a CV as a contractor</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 or 2 pages max</li>
<li>You can just put short summaries, and write what tech you used.</li>
<li>recruiters don't care about your personal bio. They care about what tech you know.</li>
<li>create a version of your cv for each role you apply to. Highlight/make bold the tech stack that you know &amp; is used for that role</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="going-from-perm-to-contract">Going from perm to contract</h4>
<ul>
<li>Legally it is questionable if you go from perm at a company to contracting at the company - especially if you do it under your own ltd company. I would not advise it. Go contract at another company.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="going-from-contractor-to-perm">Going from contractor to perm</h4>
<ul>
<li>Its common to be offered a perm role. Companies sometimes see contractors as a part of recruiting long term perm employees.</li>
<li>The salary will be rubbish compared to your day rate, but they'll try to convince you that the benefits are worth it</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="does-educationuniversity-matter-for-getting-contractor-roles-in-uk">Does education/university matter for getting contractor roles in UK?</h4>
<p>I have never been asked about qualifications or university. I don't think it matters for software engineering contractors.</p>
<p>When hiring contractors it is a <em>little</em> like hiring a plumber. They just assume you know how to do the job and your experience are your credentials.</p>
<h4 id="going-direct-vs-finding-work-via-an-agency">Going direct vs finding work via an agency</h4>
<p>Going direct can be harder, as you have to approach CTOs (small startups) or hiring managers. But it can pay off, as a lot of companies are always hiring software engineers and often need contractors to fill up capacity.</p>
<h3 id="general-tips">General tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid having to find new contracts in late December or January - get it sorted and planning in advance. In my experience the contract market dies down a little in these months.</li>
<li>Before starting contracting, have at least some amount of savings that you can rely on if you had to have some time off between contracts (or if you get ill)</li>
<li>Always charge for day rates. Don't bother doing hourly charging.</li>
<li>Keep up to date with the ever changing IR35 laws.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p><span>03 Mar 2024</span></p><p>Geoanalytics is crucial in military affairs, as a significant portion of
military data contains geoattributes. In this article, I will discuss
how to use PostgreSQL to process geospatial data and address common
geoanalytical tasks. The information will cover methods for finding the
nearest objects, distance calculations, and using geospatial indexes to
enhance these processes. We will also explore techniques for determining
a point within a polygon and geospatial aggregation. The goal of this
article is to provide practical examples and tips to enhance working
with geospatial data and contribute to the development of new solutions.</p>

<p><em>The materials and data used in the article are open-source and have
been approved by the military representatives.</em></p>

<h2 id="first-data-source-how-to-import-russian-military-polygon-data-into-postgresql">First data source: how to import russian military polygon data into PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>I will need certain datasets to initiate the analysis and showcase
PostgreSQL's capabilities in geoanalytics. I decided to start with data
on russian military facilities available on
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM). The first step is
to load this data into PostgreSQL, after which we can use tools to
optimize queries and enhance their efficiency.</p>

<p>To import data on russian military objects from OSM, we will use the
<a href="https://osm2pgsql.org/">osm2pgsql</a> tool. This open-source tool
efficiently transfers data from OSM to PostgreSQL. We will load the
<a href="http://download.geofabrik.de/russia-latest.osm.pbf">russia-latest.osm.pbf</a>
file (3.4 GB) containing information about points, lines, roads, and
polygons from OSM. After loading, the file will be used to populate the
corresponding tables in PostgreSQL, where we can begin the analysis and
processing of data.</p>

<p>The script we are using includes commands for loading OSM data, creating
a new PostgreSQL database, and importing data using osm2pgsql:</p>



<p>After executing the script, five main tables will appear in our
database:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>osm2pgsql_properties</strong>—stores settings and properties used
during the data import.</li>
  <li><strong>planet_osm_line</strong>—contains linear elements, such as roads and
rivers.</li>
  <li><strong>planet_osm_point</strong>—includes point objects, such as buildings
(not all buildings are marked as geographic polygons, so we will
have to come up with something to be devised to work with these
points).</li>
  <li><strong>planet_osm_polygon</strong>—stores polygons representing areas, such as
military bases.</li>
  <li><strong>planet_osm_roads</strong>—stores transportation routes.</li>
</ul>

<p>To simplify the analysis of military objects, we will create a table
called <strong>military_geometries</strong>. The SQL script will select data from the
<strong>planet_osm_line</strong>, <strong>planet_osm_point</strong>, <strong>planet_osm_polygon</strong>, and
<strong>planet_osm_roads</strong> tables, filtering out military objects. A 100-meter
buffer will be applied to lines, points, and roads using
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html">ST_Buffer</a>. This will also
allow us to create polygons based on points and lines, providing the
ability to analyze, for example, whether a point is within the specified
polygons.</p>



<p>Executing the provided SQL script will allow us to create a
<strong>military_geometries</strong> table that will contain polygons for 9,252
military objects identified on OSM:</p>

<p><img src="https://klioba.com/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image1.png" alt="">
<em>Visualization of 9,252 military sites across russia and the temporarily
occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea using QGIS</em></p>

<p>In OSM, as in other open sources, information is subject to change. For
example, from the beginning of 2022, 2,995 military objects in russia
were deleted.</p>

<p>They say, "Screenshots don't burn", but such deletions often lead to
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a>,
where attempts to hide information only attract more attention. If you
want to delve into the historical data of OSM and help identify such
anomalies, you can use resources like
<a href="https://download.geofabrik.de/russia.html">GeoFabrik.de</a>. Although this
doesn't directly relate to our analysis, I want to show how these
deleted objects look on a map, illustrating russian attempts to conceal
essential data.</p>

<p><img src="https://klioba.com/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image2.jpeg" alt="">

<h2 id="second-data-source-fire-data-from-nasa-satellites">Second data source: fire data from NASA satellites</h2>

<p>As the next data source, we will utilize information from the <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/firms/vj114imgtdlnrt">Fire
Information for Resource Management
System</a>
(FIRMS) developed at the University of Maryland with support from NASA
and the UN in 2007. FIRMS allows real-time monitoring of active fires
worldwide, utilizing data from Aqua and Terra satellites equipped with
MODIS spectroradiometers and VIIRS on S-NPP and NOAA 20 satellites. The
information is updated every three hours and even more frequently for
the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>We will be using FIRMS data to identify fires within the territory of
russian military facilities since 2022.</p>

<p>To download fire data from the FIRMS system, we will employ the
following script, extracting all records of fires in russia from January
1, 2022, to the current date. These data will then be imported into a
new table, <strong>viirs_fire_events</strong>, in the PostgreSQL database.</p>



<p>Therefore, we will populate the <strong>viirs_fire_events</strong> table, which will
contain 1,711,475 records of fires in russia. These fires appear as
follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://klioba.com/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image3.jpeg" alt="">
<em>Visualization of fires in russia since January 1, 2022 (1,711,475 fires)</em></p>

<p>The <strong>viirs_fire_events</strong> table in the PostgreSQL database will be used
to store detailed fire data, with fields for coordinates, satellite
parameters, date and time of acquisition, and other critical metadata. A
new column with a data type of <strong>GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326)</strong> will be
automatically populated based on the data from the <strong>longitude</strong> and
<strong>latitude</strong> columns.</p>



<p>Suppose you are interested in working with this data on military objects
and fires, but the described process of extracting datasets seems
time-consuming. In that case, there are exported CSV tables for you. You
can download them via the following links:
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/files.sql.ua/csv/military_geometries.csv">military_geometries</a>,
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/files.sql.ua/csv/viirs_fire_events.csv">viirs_fire_events</a>.</p>

<h2 id="searching-for-military-facilities-where-fires-occurred-points-within-the-polygon">Searching for military facilities where fires occurred: points within the polygon</h2>

<p>As for now, we have two tables: <strong>military_geometries</strong> and
<strong>viirs_fire_events</strong>. Let's try to find those military facilities that
have had fires (since the beginning of 2022) or those that have not yet
🙂.</p>

<p><img src="https://klioba.com/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Let's use an SQL query with the
<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Contains.html"><strong>ST_Contains</strong></a> function to
identify military objects where fires have been detected from NASA
satellites.</p>



<p>As you've probably noticed, we've identified 129 military sites that
have experienced fires since the start of 2022. What's intriguing is
that, in some cases, these fires seem to have occurred more than once.</p>

<p><img src="https://klioba.com/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image5.png" alt="">
<em>Military facilities where fires have occurred since the beginning of
2022 (the transparency of the facilities indicates the frequency of the
fire incidents)</em></p>

<p>The second aspect you may have noticed is that the specified query took
54 minutes and 15 seconds to execute, which is quite long for such a
straightforward operation. It's helpful to use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html">EXPLAIN
ANALYZE</a>
command to understand the reasons for this duration. This command allows
you to analyze the query execution process, identify potential
bottlenecks, and further optimize the query to improve performance.</p>



<p>In this case, when using the <strong>Nested Loop Semi Join</strong> operator, we
encountered a complexity of O(n*m), where n is 9,252 rows in the
<strong>military_geometries</strong> table, and m is 1,711,475 rows in
<strong>viirs_fire_events</strong>. This implies that each row from the first table
is compared with every row from the second table, resulting in a huge
number of operations.</p>

<p>Hence, let's discuss how we can speed up the execution of such a query
by utilizing indexes.</p>

<h2 id="productivity-boost-utilizing-indexing-in-geoanalytics">Productivity boost: utilizing indexing in geoanalytics</h2>

<p>PostgreSQL is renowned for its scalability features, offering numerous
methods for accessing geospatial data within this database. To find all
methods suitable for working with points in a two-dimensional space, we
can execute the following query:</p>



<p>As a result, we will observe at least five access methods, including
btree, hash, gist, brin, and spgist. I suggest investigating by creating
indexes for each of these methods and operator classes. After creating
the indexes, we will assess the query performance regarding fires at
military facilities in russia to determine which methods are most
effective for our task.</p>

<p><em>Note: The operator classes mentioned do not utilize geometry data types for searching; they work with &lt;@(point, polygon) and &lt;@(point, box). As a result, the row counts may not match the output (for example, a complex geographic polygon may have been simplified to a rectangle).</em></p>

<p>The results table shows that the most effective indexes for our task are
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gist.html">GiST</a> and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/spgist.html">SP-GiST</a>. Let's
delve into how they operate.</p>

<h2 id="how-gist-works">How GiST works</h2>

<p>Generalized Search Tree (GiST) indexes in PostgreSQL enable efficient
sorting and searching across diverse data types using the concept of
balanced trees. They provide the ability to develop custom operators for
indexing, making GiST quite versatile and adaptive to specific
requirements.</p>

<p><img src="https://klioba.com/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image6.png" alt="">
<em>The hierarchical structure of the GiST index in PostgreSQL [1]</em></p>

<p>In the example of a GiST tree depicted: at the top level, there are
<strong>R1</strong> and <strong>R2</strong>, serving as bounding boxes for other elements. <strong>R1</strong>
contains <strong>R3</strong>, <strong>R4</strong>, and <strong>R5</strong>, while <strong>R3</strong>, in turn, encompasses
<strong>R8</strong>, <strong>R9</strong>, and <strong>R10</strong>. The GiST index has a hierarchical
structure, allowing for significantly faster search. Unlike B-trees,
GiST supports overlap operations and spatial relationship determination.
This is why GiST is well-suited for indexing geometric data.</p>

<h2 id="how-sp-gist-works">How SP-GiST works</h2>

<p>Space Partitioning Generalized Search Tree (SP-GiST) indexes in
PostgreSQL are designed for data structures that partition space into
non-overlapping regions, such as quadrant trees or prefix trees. They
enable the recursive division of data into subsets, forming unbalanced
trees. This makes SP-GiST indexes particularly effective for in-memory
usage, where they can quickly process queries due to fewer levels and
small data groups in each node.</p>

<p>However, SP-GiST indexes have disadvantages when stored on disk due to
the high number of disk operations required for their functioning,
especially in large databases.</p>

<p>Considering this, GiST indexes often become a better choice, especially
when working with polygons and complex spatial structures.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-nearest-neighbors-10-fires-near-the-shahed-production-plant">Finding the nearest neighbors: 10 fires near the Shahed production plant</h2>

<p>Now, let's attempt to solve the task of finding nearest neighbors using
PostgreSQL. Using our datasets, we will try to identify ten fires that
occurred near the factory in russia, where Iranian Shahed drones are
manufactured. For more detailed information about the plant, you can
refer to the <a href="https://molfar.com/blog/alabuga-deanon">research</a>
conducted by the Molfar team. The factory is located in the special
economic zone
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabuga_Special_Economic_Zone">Alabuga</a>
in Tatarstan, where previously cat food and automotive glass were
produced, and mushrooms were grown. However, after sanctions against
Russia, its priorities shifted, and now it plays a key role in russia's
plans for drone production.</p>

<p>One of the methods to solve this task is to create a buffer in the form
of a circle around the selected target. This buffer is recursively
expanded until the required number of results is obtained. In
PostgreSQL, this can be implemented with the following SQL query, which
forms the buffer and identifies fires that occurred within the specified
radius from the selected object:</p>



<p>This approach involves gradually expanding the buffer and analyzing the
results, which can be time-consuming.</p>

<p><img src="https://klioba.com/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image7.png" alt="">
<em>A plant in Tatarstan that produces Shaheds with fire visualization
within radii of 1.5 and 10 km</em></p>

<p>Various operators supported by GiST indexes can be utilized to optimize
geospatial queries. To retrieve a list of available operators to use
with a GiST index, you can execute an SQL query that scans the
PostgreSQL system tables and provides information about operators
associated with the <strong>gist_geometry_ops_2d</strong> operator class. This will
help identify the most efficient operators for performing specific
geospatial operations in the database.</p>



<p>Our GiST index provides extensive capabilities for working with geodata,
allowing you to determine the spatial location of objects and measure
distances. The <strong>&lt;-&gt;</strong> operator enables sorting objects by proximity
to a specified point. In this example, we use this operator to identify
the ten closest fires to the specified location.</p>



<p>The query turned out to be significantly faster—15 times swifter,
compared to the previous methodology, and this is without repeated
executions with a changed radius. We can analyze the query plan to
confirm that the speed increased due to the use of an index and an
operator. This way, we'll ensure that the index was indeed involved,
which is the key to improving productivity.</p>



<p>As we can see, indexes, similar to GiST, extend analytical capabilities
beyond simple comparisons, enabling the resolution of more complex
tasks. As demonstrated in this article, open data can be effectively
utilized for quickly assessing and defining goals on a global scale,
including evaluating the success of target impact.</p>

<h2 id="ubers-h3-a-perspective-on-geospatial-analytics-and-data-aggregation">Uber's H3: a perspective on geospatial analytics and data aggregation</h2>

<p>The H3, developed by Uber, is a hexagonal grid system designed to
facilitate flexible and efficient distribution of geospatial data. It
seems that H3 has the potential to become a common standard for working
with geodata in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Let's explore how this

<p>This is a hierarchical system consisting of 15 levels dividing the
Earth's surface into hexagons. The zero level is divided into 122
sections, 12 of which are pentagons for accurately representing the
Earth's spherical shape. We have approximately 569 trillion hexagons at
the finest level, each representing a distinct geospatial object. The
video below demonstrates how this works in practice.

<p>PostgreSQL can integrate H3 functionality through an additional
extension. To install this extension, use the <strong>CREATE EXTENSION h3;</strong>
command, and it is available on cloud computing services, including AWS
RDS (my acknowledgments to AWS for their support of Ukraine). Once
you've installed this extension, new functions become accessible.
Let's explore those functions that might be useful for beginners:</p>

<p>To address the first task effectively, we can transform all our polygons
into arrays of H3 indexes (hexagons) of a specified level. Similarly, we
can process the centroids of fires by converting them into H3 indexes.
By obtaining BIGINT data types for these H3 indexes, we can apply a
standard B-tree index, which is particularly efficient in performing
equality comparison operations. This will significantly improve query
execution speed in complex geoanalysis tasks, ensuring fast and accurate
results.</p>

<p>Let's examine a few simple H3 functions that will help better
understand how this works in practice:</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>h3_polygon_to_cells(geom, 8)</strong><br>This function converts the geometry of a military polygon into a set of H3 indexes at the eighth level of resolution, effectively dividing the polygon into hexagons, each covering an area of 0.737327598 square kilometers, enabling detailed spatial analysis.</td>
      <td><strong>h3_grid_disk(h3_polygon_to_cells(geom, 8), 1)</strong><br>If certain areas of the polygon remain uncovered after applying h3_polygon_to_cells, you can use h3_grid_disk to create an additional ring of H3 indexes. It will expand coverage by adding hexagons around existing indexes, ensuring complete coverage of the defined geographic polygon.</td>
      <td><strong>h3_polygon_to_cells(geom, 9)</strong><br>Using the <strong>h3_polygon_to_cells</strong> function with a level 9 increases the grid’s resolution to a finer scale, where each hexagon represents an area of 0.105332513 square kilometers. This allows for greater accuracy in reproducing the geometry of the geographic polygon for detailed spatial analysis. However, it also results in more hexagons, which may negatively impact query execution speed.</td>

<p>During my presentation at PGConf.2023, the largest conference in Europe
dedicated to PostgreSQL, I had the opportunity to showcase a series of
more complex challenges that can be addressed by aggregating geospatial
data using H3. One example involved the search for other drones located
in the exact location and time, as well as the analysis of routes taken
by drones traveling together, identified in different places over a
specific period (Companion Analysis). You will have the opportunity to
learn more about this topic in the continuation of this article. In the
meantime, you can check out the materials of my
<a href="https://klioba.com/public/presentations/PostGIS_Warfare_Export.pdf">presentation</a>.</p>

<p>Within our datasets, we can analyze military objects and, through
aggregation with H3, calculate the density of these objects in russia.
The visualization of this analysis looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://klioba.com/imgs/geoanalytics-postgresql/image12.png" alt="">
<em>Visualization of the density of military objects in russia and the
temporarily occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea using H3 hexagons</em></p>

<p>Using H3 for aggregating geospatial data significantly enhances
analytical capabilities, allowing for a more profound interpretation and
visualization of complex spatial relationships.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><h2 id="on-the-cult-of-performance-in-databases">On the cult of performance in databases</h2><p>It takes about 4.5 hours for me to go door to door from my house in Seattle to our office in San Francisco. Let’s say you built a hypersonic plane with a top speed that was 10 times faster than the usual Boeing 737-MAX (with or without the extra windy window seat). After you factor in an Uber to the airport, waiting in security lines, boarding, taxiing on the tarmac, takeoff and landing, waiting for a gate, waiting for baggage, and my Uber to the office, you’d have accomplished some amazing feats of engineering but probably only shaved off 20% of the overall travel time. That’s good, but I’m still not going to make a 10 am meeting.</p><p>The database industry has been focused on the equivalent of making faster planes. Meanwhile, security lines get longer and luggage gets lost. An ideal query optimizer won’t help you if your data is in a slightly wonky CSV file or if the question you want to ask is difficult to formulate in SQL.</p><p>Performance is the most common metric that database nerds like me use to measure our importance, and like sports fans, we tend to pick teams that we root for against everyone else. If your favorite database wins the benchmark wars, you have bragging rights at the watercooler. You can brandish your stats, <a href="https://www.fivetran.com/blog/warehouse-benchmark">backed</a> <a href="https://duckdb.org/2023/11/03/db-benchmark-update.html">up</a> <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-vs-snowflake-for-real-time-analytics-benchmarks-cost-analysis">by</a> <a href="https://www.singlestore.com/blog/tpc-benchmarking-results/">blog</a> <a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/11/15/snowflake-claims-similar-price-performance-to-databricks-but-not-so-fast.html">posts</a>, to prove to anyone who will listen that your favorite DB is the champ.</p><p>Performance in general, and general-purpose benchmarking in particular, is a poor way to choose a database. You’re better off making decisions based on ease of use, ecosystem, velocity of updates, or how well it integrates with your workflow. At best, performance is a point-in-time view of the time it will take to complete certain tasks; at worst, however, it leads you to optimize for the wrong things.</p></section>

How could we be that much slower than Azure? However, the results didn’t match the impression we had from users. Every time a customer did a head-to-head evaluation of us vs Azure, they ended up choosing BigQuery. The market outcomes at that time were almost the reverse of the benchmarks: Snowflake and BigQuery ended up selling a lot better than Redshift, which sold much better than Azure.</p><p>If the benchmark didn’t match the customer experience, then either the benchmark was done wrong, the benchmark was testing the wrong thing, or performance turned out to not be that important after all. We did a lot of poking around, and it wasn’t the first one; the GigaOm folks are pretty good at running benchmarks and the methodology was sound. The benchmarks they ran, TPC-H and TPC-DS, are the industry standards and had a broad range of queries. They were the benchmarks we ourselves ran internally in order to judge performance, and while one can quibble with the data size or their relevance to real-world workloads, they were the best available.</p><p>So if the benchmark was a good representation of performance, and customers, by a large margin, ended up buying the systems that did poorly on the benchmark, then it leads you to believe that perhaps there are more important things than performance.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-fast">What does it mean to be fast?</h2><p>In the 15 years that I’ve spent working on cloud databases, I’ve noticed an anti-pattern across the industry: People who build databases tend to be laser focused on the time between when someone clicks the “run” button and the time that results are ready. It is easy to see why database people would focus on just the database server time; after all that is the thing that they have the most control over. But what is actually impactful to users is the time it takes to complete a task, which is not the same thing.</p><p>In BigQuery, we outsourced building the JDBC drivers to a company that specializes in building database connectors. If you’re not familiar with JDBC, these provide a universal interface that programmers and Business Intelligence tools use to connect to a database. It made sense at the time to have a well-known expert build the interfaces.</p><p>A few years later, after numerous customer complaints, we realized that bugs in our JDBC driver were killing performance. From our perspective, the queries ran quickly, in just one or two seconds. But the way the driver was polling for query completion and pulling down the results made the queries seem like they were taking seconds or even minutes longer. This impact was exacerbated when there were a lot of query results, since the driver would often pull down all of the results one page at a time even if the user didn’t need to see all of the results. Sometimes they’d even crash because they ran out of memory.</p><p>We had been spending many engineer years making the queries fast, shaving off fractions of a second here and there from query times. But the connectors that most of our users were using added far more latency than we had saved. What’s more, we were completely blind to that fact. No one at Google actually used the JDBC drivers, and while we ran full suites of benchmarks every night, those benchmarks didn’t actually reflect the end-to-end performance our users were seeing.</p><p>Like the drunk looking for his keys under a streetlight, we looked only at the performance we could measure on our servers. The query time that users were seeing was invisible to us, and we considered it someone else’s problem. To actually fix the problem, and not just put band-aids on it, required us to reframe how we thought about performance.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="performance-is-subjective">Performance is Subjective</h2><p>Performance must be measured from the user’s perspective, not the database’s. It is a UX problem and, like any UX problem, can’t really be described in a single number. This is surprising to many people, since they think performance, like car racing, is an objective thing. Just because you can say that a Lamborghini is faster than a Prius, they believe you should also be able to say that My database is faster than Your database. But just like a Lamborghini might not get me to work any faster than a Prius (or a bicycle, if there is traffic), the actual workload for a database is going to determine which one is faster.</p><p>Subjectivity gets a bad rap; people associate it with saying, “Well, there is no way of telling which one is better, so it doesn’t matter which one we choose.” But just because the difference between a Ford F150 pickup truck and a Tesla Roadster is subjective, it doesn’t mean that my experience with both would be equivalent. Databases are the same way; if we say the performance differences between Clickhouse and Redshift are subjective, it doesn’t mean they are equivalent. It just means that which one is faster depends on how they are being used.</p><p>A couple of years ago, Clickhouse released <a href="https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/">Clickbench</a>, a benchmark that showed that Clickhouse was faster than a couple dozen databases they tested against. This was surprising to me, since at the time I was working at SingleStore, and we believed that we were broadly faster than Clickhouse. After digging into the benchmark, we saw that the benchmark didn’t do any JOINs, so operated out of a single table, and also relied heavily on counting distinct items.</p><img alt="img2" sizes="90vw,

If you do a lot of log analysis and need to compute distinct users to your website, this could be a good proxy for performance. That said, if you’re running a more traditional data warehousing workload using a star schema, Clickbench is going to be misleading.</p><p>Vendor benchmarks tend to focus on things that the vendor does well. The below is a diagram from “<a href="https://hannes.muehleisen.org/publications/DBTEST2018-performance-testing.pdf">Fair Benchmarking Considered Difficult</a>” describing the typical vendor benchmark result.</p><img alt="img3" sizes="90vw,

For example, BigQuery shows up very poorly in benchmarks, but the actual experience of many people is that the performance is magical. BigQuery shows up well in person because it doesn’t have any knobs and is largely self-tuning. A highly-tuned SingleStore instance will crush BigQuery at most tasks, but do you have time to spend tuning your schemas? And what happens when you add a new workload?</p><p>The DuckDB website used to have a disclaimer that said, “Please don’t complain about performance, we’re trying to focus on correctness before we try to make it fast.” Not all databases apply the same approach. You can make a car faster by removing safety gear like airbags, traction control, crumple zones, emissions controls, etc. But most people don’t want to drive a car like that. Databases are no different; you can make them faster if you remove overflow checks, don’t flush writes, give approximate results to certain operations, or don’t provide ACID guarantees. Some of the systems that do well on these benchmarks apply these kinds of short-cuts, but I wouldn’t want to use them except in controlled circumstances.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="rates-of-change">Rates of change</h2><p>Last year when I set out to create a company on top of DuckDB, a number of people pointed out to me that if you Googled DuckDB performance, a <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/">benchmark</a> would come up where DuckDB got pretty badly beaten. Wasn’t I worried? Why not choose a “faster” one?</p><p>I wasn't concerned for two reasons. First, I think performance is of secondary importance. But second, DuckDB had demonstrated something that made current benchmarks moot; they improve incredibly quickly. Partly because of some architectural decisions, partly because the code base is relatively new and clean, and partly because the engineers involved are super talented, DuckDB gets better at an extraordinary rate.</p><p>And it turned out I was right to not be concerned. The most recent <a href="https://duckdb.org/2023/04/14/h2oai.html">published</a> results of that same benchmark against the latest DuckDB release show they went from the middle of the pack to leading by a healthy margin.</p><p>The broader point is that when you choose a database, the database is not frozen at that point in time. You’ll likely end up sticking with your decision for several years. The performance and features of your database are going to change a lot between now and next year, and even more so between now and five years from now.</p><p>A very important variable, then, is not just what the database can do now, but what it will be able to do a year in the future. If a bug in a database causes you to choose a competitor, that’s going to seem like a silly reason in just a few weeks if that bug has been fixed. This holds true with performance; if two different databases are improving at different rates, you’re most likely better off choosing the faster moving one. Your future self will thank you.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="no-magic-beans">No Magic Beans</h2><p>If you take a bunch of databases, all actively maintained, and iterate them out a few years, performance is going to converge. If Clickhouse is applying a technique that gives it an advantage for scan speed today, Snowflake will likely have that within a year or two. If Snowflake adds incrementally materialized views, BigQuery will soon follow. It is unlikely that important performance differences will persist over time.</p><p>As clever as the engineers working for any of these companies are, none of them possess any magic incantations or things that cannot be replicated elsewhere. Each database uses a different bag of tricks in order to get good performance. One might compile queries to machine code, another might cache data on local SSDs, and a third might use specialized network hardware to do shuffles. Given time, all of these techniques can be implemented by anyone. If they work well, they likely will show up everywhere.</p><p>George Fraser, the CEO of Fivetran did an interesting <a href="https://www.fivetran.com/blog/warehouse-benchmark">post</a> comparing performance of the main data warehouse vendors over time; while there was a pretty big dispersion in 2020, by 2022 they are much more closely clustered together. In 2020, the fastest time was 8 seconds and the slowest was 18, in 2022 three of the vendors were around 7 seconds and the slowest was 9.</p><img alt="img4" sizes="90vw,

Shared nothing databases are at a disadvantage vs shared disk, and it took Redshift many years to switch to a primarily shared disk architecture. Lakehouses that rely on persisting metadata to an object store will have a hard time with rapid updates; this is built into the model. But these types of differences tend to show up in margins; there is, for example, no fundamental reason why Redshift would be faster or slower than Snowflake in the long run.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="the-problems-are-between-chair-and-keyboard-between-keyboard-and-database">The problems are between chair and keyboard &amp; between keyboard and database</h2><p>To a user, the important measure of performance is the time between when they have a question and when they have an answer; that can be very different from the time it takes the database to run a query.</p><p>If you step back and think about it from their point of view, there are a lot more levers you can use to achieve the goal of minimizing the time between question formulation and answer. You can make it easier to pose the question. You can make it easier to turn query results into something they can understand. You can help them get feedback when they’re not asking the right question. You can help them understand when the data has problems. You can help them get the data they need in the right place and the right shape to be able to ask the question in the first place. While these aren’t typically thought of as performance issues, improvements can speed up the workflows of analysts and data engineers to a larger degree than a better query plan.</p><p>Snowflake did a great job of making it easier to write queries. Whereas many SQL dialects are opinionated about being consistent about syntax and that there should be “one way” to do everything, Snowflake designers had the goal of making SQL that users type “just work.” For example, in Snowflake SQL, if you want to compute the difference between two dates, you can use either DATEDIFF or TIMEDIFF; both work with any reasonable type. You can specify a granularity, or not. You can use quotes around the granularity, or not. So if you just type a query, as long as the intention can be gleaned, it should “just work.” This is one of the reasons that analysts like Snowflake, since they don’t have to spend their time looking things up in the documentation.</p><p>DuckDB has innovated along these lines, as well, with their “<a href="https://duckdb.org/2023/08/23/even-friendlier-sql.html">Friendlier SQL</a>” effort, which adds a number of innovations to the SQL language to make it easier to write your queries. One example is “GROUP BY ALL.” When you write an aggregation query, it is easy to forget to list one of the fields in the GROUP BY clause. This is especially the case when you evolve queries, because you have to make changes in multiple different places. The GROUP BY ALL syntax makes it easier to both write and maintain your queries because you only need to change the query in one place (i.e. SELECT list) rather than the aggregation. This was so useful that soon after they released the feature, several other database vendors raced to add similar functionality.</p><p>Data isn’t always in a convenient format for querying. A huge amount of the world’s data is in CSV files, many of which are poorly constructed. Despite this, most Database vendors don’t take them seriously. In BigQuery, I wrote our first CSV splitter, and when it turned out to be a trickier problem than expected, we put a new grad engineer on the problem. It was never great, couldn’t do inference, and got confused if different files had slightly different schemas. It turns out the <a href="https://hannes.muehleisen.org/publications/ssdbm2017-muehleisen-csvs.pdf">CSV parsing</a> is actually hard.</p><p>If two engineers using two different databases need to read CSV data and compute a result, the one who is able to ingest their CSV file correctly the most easily is likely going to get the answer first, regardless of how fast their database is at executing queries. CSV file inference can therefore be thought of as a performance feature.</p><p>The way databases handle results has massive impacts on user experience. For example, a lot of times people run a “SELECT *” query to try to understand what’s in the table. Depending on how the database system is architected, this query can be instantaneous (returning a first page and a cursor, like MySQL), can take hours for large tables (if it has to make a copy of the table server-side, like BigQuery), or can run out of memory (if it tries to pull down all of the data into the client). Do clients have a long-running connection to the server, which can have trouble with network hiccups? Or do they poll, which can mean the query can complete in between polling cycles and make the query appear slower?</p></section>
<section><h2 id="on-sour-grapes">On Sour Grapes</h2><p>I’m a co-founder of a company building on DuckDB. This post might sound like something someone would write if they were working on a database that wasn’t fast, didn’t do well in benchmarks, or wasn’t focusing on performance. So I should mention that DuckDB is <em>fast</em>.

<section><h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion…</h2><p>None of the most successful database companies got that way by being faster than their competitors. Redshift was king for a while, and the thing that let Snowflake in the door was maintainability, not performance on benchmarks. Databases whose primary selling point was performance did not perform well in the market. Databases who made it easy to get jobs done fared a lot better.</p><p>To summarize:</p><ul>
<li>There are no magic beans; barring architectural differences, performance will converge over time.</li>
<li>Database engines evolve at very different speeds; the one who is moving most quickly will be the one that wins in the end.</li>
<li>Beware the database vendor that cares most about performance; that will slow them down in the long run.</li>
<li>There is no single metric of database performance; a “fast” database might be terrible on your workload.</li>
<li>The important feature of a database is how quickly you can go from idea to answer, not query to result.</li>
</ul><p>Faster queries are obviously preferable to slower ones. But if you’re choosing a database, you’re better off making sure you’re making your decision based on factors other than raw speed.</p><p>Happy Querying!</p></section></div></div>]]></description>

<p>On 15 September 1595, a Genoese man-about-town called Salvagio de Aste was spotted breaking the law. The record in Genoa’s state archives describes with remarkable precision what Salvagio was wearing that autumn day as he strolled through the square of San Siro. He must have cut a dashing figure. He sported “an embroidered cap, a silk doublet of many colours with gold buttons on the sleeves, two rings with white stones on his fingers, a jerkin and embroidered hose in black silk”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medievalists.net/2014/10/02/fashion-police-16th-century-italy/renaissance-fashion/" rel="attachment wp-att-53011"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.medievalists.net/wp-content/plugins/gumlet/assets/images/pixel.png" alt="Renaissance Fashion" width="612" height="535" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" data-gmsrc="http://www.medievalists.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Renaissance-Fashion.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The detail with which Salvagio’s attire was noted is no accident: his showy and costly clothing was his crime. His colourful and lavishly embellished costume had fallen foul of Genoa’s Magistrato delle Pompe, whose role it was to enforce the sumptuary laws that regulated what men and women could wear. Patrolling the streets and squares of the bustling city as arbiters of the level of ostentation that was deemed appropriate, the sumptuary magistrates were quite simply the Fashion Police.</p>
<p>The role of these magistrates, and their (largely unsuccessful) attempts to moderate excessive spending, is one strand of research into clothing in early modern Genoa by Giulia Galastro, a PhD candidate at Cambridge University. In particular, she is interested in the ways in which the materiality of fabric is interwoven with the fabric of society in Genoa – a centre of the Italian silk trade and a city famous for its production of sumptuous velvets and other luxurious textiles.</p>
<p>Sumptuary laws restricted the use of precisely these textiles, along with expensive decoration such as embroidery with gold and silver thread. It also covered jewellery and ostentatious modes of transport, such as the lady in a litter seen in this image taken from a travelogue (owned by Strahov Monastery) of a Bohemian nobleman, who visited Genoa at the beginning of the 17th century.</p>
<p>Italy wasn’t alone in having sumptuary laws – the obsession with legislating against costly clothes spread across Europe during the Middle Ages. In England, James VI and I abolished sumptuary laws in 1604 but continued to control dress by other means. “The purpose of the laws is a matter of some debate. Their wording suggests concern that luxury goods could damage the morals of those who consumed them. Fashion itself was seen as immoral: its transitory nature stoked an acquisitive lust for new goods,” said Galastro.</p>
<p>Financial considerations were also at play. A 15th-century Genoese law bemoaned “a great quantity of money which is kept dead and wrapped up in clothing and jewels, [and] if converted into trade might bring great return and profits”. Some scholars, such as the historian Jane Bridgeman, have argued that the laws were an indirect tax on wealth, working on the tacit assumption that the rich would be prepared to pay to get around them.</p>
<p>“Part of the problem is that not much evidence for how the laws were enforced has been preserved, so it’s difficult to know how – and whether – they worked in practice. That’s what makes the Genoese sumptuary records so special. The rare survival of notes kept by the sumptuary magistrates gives us a glimpse of the laws in action, and of clothes in use. We can begin to build up a picture of who was wearing what, when and where,” said Galastro.</p>

<p>The records suggest that residents of Genoa routinely ignored the sumptuary laws. In the four years from 1594 to 1598, the magistrates recorded more than 560 contraventions of the regulations. The foppish Salvagio was among the repeat offenders. Three days after being admonished on 15 September 1595 he was back in San Siro, wearing exactly the same outfit. On 5 November he was there again, wearing a leather jerkin impregnated with musk.</p>
<p>The sumptuary magistrates were caught up in a game of catch-me-if-you-can as Genoa’s dandies defied and subverted the rules. The feckless Salvagio broke the law at least a further four times, suggesting that whatever fine was imposed was no deterrent to a man determined to strut his stuff.</p>
<p>“It is likely that any fines imposed were modest in comparison with the cost of the offending garments. A whole outfit in silk velvet, embroidered with precious metal threads, could come close to the price of a sports car today: if you could afford to buy the clothes, you could afford to pay the fine – or the bribe,’ said Galastro.</p>
<p>In analysing the records of the Genoese sumptuary laws, Galastro made a startling discovery. She said: “Contrary to widely held beliefs, male offenders outnumber females. In terms of overall sumptuary offences, there are 289 men to 242 women. If we focus on offences concerning dress, however, the disparity is more striking: 269 men to 99 women. In other words, there were almost three times as many men breaking the law on clothing as women.”</p>
<p>Historians have often presumed that, where sumptuary laws mention men at all, it is for dressing too femininely, but Galastro’s research suggests something different.</p>
<p>“It’s interesting that the majority of the offences relate to an outfit of black silk – taffeta, satin or velvet – ornamented with some sort of precious metal stitching or with lace. Just such an outfit appears in a portrait of an anonymous Genoese nobleman by the artist van Dyck which, to modern eyes, looks relatively sober. But black was a clear status symbol in Renaissance culture. Black dye was one of the most difficult to fix effectively, so we should be careful how we interpret these apparently ‘plain’ portraits,” said Galastro.</p>

<p>Anthony van Dyck worked in Genoa for six years from 1621 and painted a series of exquisite portraits of the local aristocracy. These show the city’s elite wearing luxurious garments. He moved to London in 1632 where his portraits such as ‘Lord John Stuart and his brother Lord Bernard Stuart’, circa 1638, show men wearing much more colourful and flamboyant clothing.</p>
<p>Clothes are made to be worn and the wearing of them is a form of performance – seldom more so than on the streets of a fashionable Mediterranean city humming with life. “If you pair the sumptuary records with literary sources, it seems that what was disquieting to the sumptuary magistrates in Genoa was a particular form of vaunting, flaunting masculine dress,” said Galastro.</p>
<p>In his 1620 commentary on the Characters of Theophrastus, the Genoese writer Ansaldo Ceba describes the effrontery of the young man who will “when he is wearing breeches alla Spagnola, or an embroidered doublet, circulate around the city so sedulously that you can’t help bumping into him in church, in the square, or on the corner… You needn’t think of leaving until you have admired him from head to toe. Indeed he will compel you to do so, now by opening his cloak, now by planting himself in front of you like a bulwark”.</p>
<p>Infringements of the sumptuary laws weren’t confined to the elite: artisans too were under scrutiny. Some were caught by the sumptuary magistrates while making luxury clothes. On 20 May 1595, the wife of Gioannetino the cheese-maker was spotted sitting on her doorstep sewing a man’s silk shirt, dyed in costly crimson, with gold and silver braids three fingers’ thick. Later in the summer three tailors were also caught working on luxury items.</p>
<p>These artisans were caught in a dilemma: their livelihoods depended on making luxury goods. “It is estimated that some 60% of the Genoese population was involved in the production of textiles and clothing – from the women employed to unwind silk filament from cocoons through the dyers and weavers in their workshops to the hundreds of tailors and seamstresses,” said Galastro.</p>
<p>It was an era when people had a hands-on relationship with textiles, choosing and purchasing fabrics in consultation with their tailors with the arrival of new textiles and trimmings eagerly awaited. The vocabulary of fabrics and fashion was fabulously diverse – colours such as ‘incarnadine’ (the red of raw flesh) – most of these words lost to us today.</p>
<p>“What you wore, and how you wore it, was a matter of deep significance,” said Galastro.</p>
