    <section>
        <p>This week-end project started by browsing the <a href="https://prim.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en">open-data repository</a> of Paris’ public transport network, which contains <a href="https://prim.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/catalogue-data?type=api">various APIs</a> to query <a href="https://prim.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/apis/idfm-ivtr-requete_globale">real-time departures</a>, <a href="https://prim.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/apis/idfm-disruptions_bulk">current disruptions</a>, etc.
The <a href="https://prim.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/reutilisations">data reuse section</a> caught my eye, as it features external projects that use this open data.
In particular, the <a href="https://ratpstatus.fr/">RATP status website</a> provides a really nice interface to visualize historical disruptions on metro, RER/train and tramway lines.</p>

A usual day of disruptions on <a href="https://ratpstatus.fr/">ratpstatus.fr</a>.</p>

<p>Under the hood, the <a href="https://github.com/wincelau/ratpstatus">ratpstatus.fr GitHub repository</a> contains <a href="https://github.com/wincelau/ratpstatus/tree/main/datas">all the JSON files</a> queried from the open-data API, every 2 minutes for almost a year now.
A repository with 188K commits and more than 10 GB of accumulated data at the last commit alone (as measured by <code>git clone --depth=1</code>) is definitely an interesting database choice!
To be clear, this post isn’t in any way a critique of that.
RATP status is an excellent website providing useful information that runs blazingly fast<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and smoothly without the usual bloat you see on the web nowadays.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the 10 GB of data got me to wonder: can we compress that better, by spending a reasonable amount of time (i.e. a week-end project)?
In this deep dive post, I’ll explain how I used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interning_(computer_science)"><em>interning</em> design pattern</a> in Rust to compress this data set by a factor of two thousand!
We’ll investigate how to best structure the interner itself, how to tune our data schema to work well with it, and likewise how serialization can best leverage interning.</p>

<p>If you’ve got lots of JSON files accumulating in your storage, you should read on!</p>

<h2 id="importing-the-data-135"><span><a href="#importing-the-data-135"></a></span>Importing the data (135%)</h2>

<p>The first step of this experiment was to import the source data.
To give a bit more context, each data point was a JSON file with many entries looking like this.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"disruptions"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>

    </span><span>},</span><span>
  </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s import this data into our program!
If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, this programming language makes it very easy to deserialize data from all sorts of formats via libraries like <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/"><code>serde</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/serde_json/"><code>serde_json</code></a>.
I’m depending on the following versions in my <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html"><code>Cargo.toml</code> manifest</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>serde</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1.0.217"</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"derive"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span>
<span>serde_json</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1.0.137"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that, we can define a data schema as regular Rust structs/enums and simply annotate them with <code>serde</code>’s <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.217/serde/derive.Deserialize.html"><code>Deserialize</code> derive macro</a> to automatically implement deserialization for it.
I recommend using the <a href="https://serde.rs/container-attrs.html#deny_unknown_fields"><code>deny_unknown_fields</code> attribute</a> to make sure unknown JSON fields aren’t silently ignored.
These attributes are documented separately on the <a href="https://serde.rs/attributes.html">serde.rs website</a> (not on <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/">docs.rs</a>).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>serde</span><span>::</span><span>Deserialize</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Deserialize)]</span>
<span>#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Data</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[serde(rename</span> <span>=</span> <span>"statusCode"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>status_code</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>disruptions</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Disruption</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>lines</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Line</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>

    <span>last_updated_date</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>One can then trivially deserialize a JSON file into a <code>Data</code> struct with functions like <a href="https://docs.rs/serde_json/1.0.137/serde_json/fn.from_reader.html"><code>serde_json::from_reader()</code></a>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Open a file for reading.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>File</span><span>::</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
<span>// Add a layer of buffering for performance.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>reader</span> <span>=</span> <span>BufReader</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>
<span>// Deserialize the JSON contents into a Data.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>Data</span> <span>=</span> <span>serde_json</span><span>::</span><span>from_reader</span><span>(</span><span>reader</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To give more details about the specific data schema I’m importing, each <code>Disruption</code> contains informative fields, as well as a list of time periods during which it applies.
For example, there may be construction work on a line every evening for a month, so there would be an <code>ApplicationPeriod</code> for each of these evenings.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Deserialize)]</span>
<span>#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]</span>

    <span>end</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The data also contains an index by <code>Line</code>s, listing all the objects (e.g. stations) impacted by disruptions on each metro line.</p>

<div id="schema-line"><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Deserialize)]</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Lastly, I wanted to estimate how much space these objects take in memory, in order to benchmark the improvements obtained by interning methods.
Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.size_of.html"><code>std::mem::size_of()</code> function</a> returns the “stack” size of an object, but that’s not sufficient as it ignores any data indirectly allocated on the heap (such as via a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec</code></a> collection).
Therefore, I defined a new trait and implemented it for the needed types.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>EstimateSize</span><span>:</span> <span>Sized</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>/// Returns the number of bytes indirectly allocated on the heap by this object.</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>allocated_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span><span>;</span>

    <span>/// Returns the total number of bytes that this object uses.</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>estimated_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>mem</span><span>::</span><span>size_of</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>self</span><span>.allocated_bytes</span><span>()</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>EstimateSize</span> <span>for</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>allocated_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>0</span>  <span>// Nothing allocated on the heap.</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>EstimateSize</span> <span>for</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>allocated_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span>  <span>// Each item is one byte long. Ignores the string capacity.</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>EstimateSize</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>EstimateSize</span> <span>for</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For compound types (structs), the implementation visits all the fields.
In principle, this could automatically be implemented by a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html#derive-macros">derive macro</a> (like serde’s <code>Deserialize</code>), but creating a new macro seemed overkill given the scale of my experiment.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>EstimateSize</span> <span>for</span> <span>Data</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that, reading all the files from May 2024 gave the following result: expanding the 1.1 GB of JSON files into in-memory structs increased the size by 35% (commit <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/d961e6e5f0cce53c2b328a7fd70482811e80f26e">d961e6e</a>).
Not in the right direction… let’s start optimizing!</p>

<div><pre><code>Parsed 1137178883 bytes from 30466 files (+ 21 failed files)
Expanded to 1531039733 bytes in memory (relative size = 134.63%)

<h2 id="interning"><span><a href="#interning"></a></span>Interning</h2>

<p>In this section, I’ll present the basics of the interning pattern, and how to apply it to various types.</p>

<h3 id="strings-47"><span><a href="#strings-47"></a></span>Strings (47%)</h3>

<p>The first use case that comes to mind in terms of interning is strings, as evidenced by the <a href="https://lib.rs/keywords/interning">top Rust interning libraries</a>.
We’re not going to use any of these packages, as my goal was to learn more about the inner details of interning.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon a blog post by <em>matklad</em> from 2020 titled <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/03/22/fast-simple-rust-interner.html"><em>Fast and Simple Rust Interner</em></a>, and my first iteration is inspired by this design.
The main difference is that I wrapped strings into an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc</code></a> (reference-counted wrapper) to avoid duplicating them in memory.
If the interner is intended to be used from multiple threads, I’d use an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc</code></a> instead, but I’m keeping things simple for this experiment.</p>

<p>So what is an interner?
It’s essentially a table of strings, consisting of a vector of strings paired with a hash map that allows looking up if a string is already in the database, and if so at which index in the vector.</p>

<p>An interned string is then an index in the interner table.
The main advantage of this setup is to reduce the amount of memory used by the program, because an integer index is usually smaller than the full string.
This is especially effective when there are many repeated strings.</p>

Memory layout of strings without and with interning.</p>

<p>There are several possible designs to represent an interned string object: as a first iteration I’ve chosen to pair the index with a reference to the interner that contains it.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>IString</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>interner</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>StringInterner</span><span>,</span>

    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>lookup</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Rc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.interner</span><span>.lookup</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>At this point, you might have noticed that I’ve declared <code>StringInterner</code> and <code>StringInternerImpl</code> types.
What’s the difference?</p>

<p>The answer is that once an <code>IString</code> captures an interner handle <code>&amp;StringInterner</code>, the underlying <code>StringInterner</code> cannot be mutated anymore via an <code>intern()</code> function taking a <code>&amp;mut self</code> parameter, as it would break <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/borrow/alias.html">Rust’s aliasing rules</a>: there cannot be both a <code>&amp;StringInterner</code> and a <code>&amp;mut StringInterner</code> pointing to the same thing at the same time.
This is quite unfortunate, as it prevents interning more than one string!</p>

<p>The way to resolve this conflict is to use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/interior-mutability.html"><em>interior mutability</em></a> via the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code>RefCell</code> type</a>.
By defining a <code>StringInterner</code> as a <code>RefCell&lt;StringInternerImpl&gt;</code>, we can intern more values without needing a <code>&amp;mut self</code> reference to the interner.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Default)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>StringInterner</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>inner</span><span>:</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>&lt;</span><span>StringInternerImpl</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>StringInterner</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// This function takes an immutable reference!</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// The borrow_mut() method performs runtime checks and releases a</span>
        <span>// mutable reference if it's safe to do so (or panics).</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.inner</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>()</span><span>.intern</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>lookup</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Rc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.inner</span><span>.borrow</span><span>()</span><span>.lookup</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With this setup, we can for example overload the comparison operator <code>==</code> to directly compare interned strings with regular strings.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>PartialEq</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>IString</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'_</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>eq</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Lastly, I’ve defined new structs for the data schema using the interned string type in place of all strings.
This means adding a lifetime <code>'a</code> everywhere, which isn’t quite ergonomic, but we’ll revisit this pattern <a href="#dropping-the-reference-28">later</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Disruption</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>I’ve also defined functions to convert data from the original structs to their interned counterparts, as well as comparison functions to validate that the interned data is semantically equivalent to the original (and confirm that my benchmarks are not cheating).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ApplicationPeriod</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that, we can already see the effectiveness of interning: each string appeared on average 425 times in the input data, the in-memory data is three times smaller than the baseline, and twice smaller than the original JSON files (commit <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/5297faabef807c535bba8c29ca665c72957f3ca0">5297faa</a>).
We’re still quite far from the headline of this post though!</p>

<div><pre><code>Parsed 1137178883 bytes from 30466 files (+ 21 failed files)

<h3 id="arbitrary-types-76"><span><a href="#arbitrary-types-76"></a></span>Arbitrary types (7.6%)</h3>

<p>The next step was to realize that strings aren’t the only objects that repeat a lot in the input data.
For example, a <code>Disruption</code> may last maybe an hour if it’s unexpected, or something like a month if it’s planned maintenance work.
Given that the input data is a time series sampled every 2 minutes, it’s expected that a given disruption will show up many times.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the interning technique isn’t unique to strings: any data that can be put into a vector and a hash map should work as well.
So we can use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics.html">generics</a> to make it work for arbitrary types that implement <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Eq.html"><code>Eq</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.Hash.html"><code>Hash</code></a> (to work with a hash map).</p>

<h3 id="dropping-the-reference-28"><span><a href="#dropping-the-reference-28"></a></span>Dropping the reference (2.8%)</h3>

<p>One thing you may have noticed is how the reference to an <code>Interner</code> proliferates well beyond the <code>Interned</code> struct.
It forces us (1) to add a lifetime <code>'a</code> everywhere and (2) to use interior mutability which causes the <code>Interner</code>/<code>InternerImpl</code> split.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Interned</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>interner</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>Interner</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Crucially, it also means inflated memory usage due to a lot of duplication: a struct like <code>Disruption&lt;'a&gt;</code> contains at least 7 references to the same string interner!
So what if we just got rid of it?</p>

<p>In the current design, the <code>Interned</code> type is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5004162/what-does-it-mean-for-a-data-structure-to-be-intrusive"><em>intrusive</em></a> (as it’s aware of the surrounding <code>Interner</code>).
We can instead externalize the interner, and let the caller provide a reference to the interner when needed.</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>One difficulty with this simplified design is how to implement comparison and hashing methods on <code>Interned&lt;T&gt;</code>.
Indeed, these operators have a fixed API given by traits such as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html"><code>PartialEq</code></a>, so an interner reference cannot be provided as an additional value to the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html#tymethod.eq"><code>eq()</code></a> function for example.</p>

<p>To solve this issue, we can remark that an interned index fully represents the underlying object (within the realm of an interner): two values will be interned to the same index if and only if they are equal.
So rather than doing a deep (recursive) comparison, we can simply compare the indices, i.e. <code>derive</code> their implementations for <code>Interned</code>.
Likewise for hashing.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Hash,</span> <span>PartialEq,</span> <span>Eq)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Interned</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* ... */</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the difficulty remains when we want to compare an <code>Interned&lt;T&gt;</code> with a <code>T</code>.
In that case, we really need to look up the underlying value and perform a deep comparison.
For that purpose, I ended up defining a new <code>EqWith</code> trait that allows passing the interner as a helper object for the comparison.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>EqWith</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Rhs</span><span>,</span> <span>Helper</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>eq_with</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Rhs</span><span>,</span> <span>helper</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Helper</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Eq</span> <span>+</span> <span>Hash</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>EqWith</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Interner</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>Interned</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>eq_with</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>interner</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Interner</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Can we half it again?</p>

<p>Yes!
The <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/03/22/fast-simple-rust-interner.html">original blog post</a> by <em>matklad</em> was using a <code>u32</code> index, rather than <code>usize</code>.
This is indeed a fairly reasonable choice for objects that are supposed to be referenced multiple times.
In my case, the dataset didn’t contain any type with more than a million distinct objects, so there was enough margin.</p>

<h2 id="tuning-the-schema"><span><a href="#tuning-the-schema"></a></span>Tuning the schema</h2>

<p>Using general interning techniques wasn’t the end of the journey.
Indeed, we can leverage business knowledge about the data to optimize it even more.</p>

<h3 id="sorting-sets-15"><span><a href="#sorting-sets-15"></a></span>Sorting sets (1.5%)</h3>

<p>One common pattern in this data was a field containing a set of objects (themselves interned).
For example, a <code>Line</code> contains a set of impacted objects stored as a <code>Vec&lt;Interned&lt;ImpactedObject&gt;&gt;</code>, and each <code>ImpactedObject</code> contains a set of disruption IDs as a <code>Vec&lt;IString&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Line</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
    <span>short_name</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
    <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
    <span>network_id</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
    <span>impacted_objects</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Interned</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ImpactedObject</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>ImpactedObject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>typ</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
    <span>disruption_ids</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>IString</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What’s interesting is that these sets don’t have a particular order, semantically speaking: we only care about which objects are impacted on a given metro line, not whether one impacted object is “before” another (whatever that means).
However, in Rust the <code>Vec</code> collection type is semantically ordered!</p>

<p>This means that two <code>ImpactedObject</code>s with the same <code>typ</code>, <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> fields but <code>disruption_ids</code> equal to <code>[123, 42, 73]</code> in one case and <code>[73, 123, 42]</code> in the other would be considered different in terms of hashing and equality, even though they are semantically the same.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the API was returning such sets in arbitrary order from one call to the next (which I guess makes sense if they internally represent them using hash tables or hash sets).
So one object containing a set of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> items could be represented as up to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo stretchy="false">!</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N!</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> JSON representations appearing distinct from the perspective of the interner (number of permutations of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> items).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the problem compounds: a <code>Line</code> contains a set of <code>ImpactedObject</code>s which themselves contain sets of <code>IString</code>.
Consider the following example: each of the two <code>ImpactedObject</code>s has <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo stretchy="false">!</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3! = 6</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> possible representations and there are <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">!</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2! = 2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> possible orderings of these two objects, so this <code>Line</code> has up to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>72</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">6 \cdot 6 \cdot 2 = 72</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> representations.
And that’s a fairly simple example, in reality the sets could be longer than 3 disruptions.
In practice, the <code>Interner&lt;Line&gt;</code> contained the most number of objects (97090), totaling 14 MB which was 45% of the optimized bytes.</p>

<p>To mitigate this problem, we can canonicalize such sets, the easiest way being to sort them.
However, adding ordering operators (via the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html"><code>PartialOrd</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html"><code>Ord</code></a> traits) for all the structs in the schema would be annoying.
But that’s not required: we only need to order sets of <code>Interned&lt;T&gt;</code>, and we can do that by simply ordering the underlying indices!
Indeed, all we need is a canonical order, we don’t care if this order reflects the semantics of the objects.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot derive <code>PartialOrd</code> on <code>Interned&lt;T&gt;</code> if the underlying <code>T</code> doesn’t itself implement it.
This is a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26925">known and long-standing limitation</a> of <code>derive</code> (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/7671">more than 10 years old</a>!).</p>

<p>So we have to implement the comparison traits manually on <code>Interned&lt;T&gt;</code>, which isn’t <em>that</em> bad.

<p>I then chose to create an <code>InternedSet&lt;T&gt;</code> abstraction, that will sort the items in canonical order.
Note the use of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort_unstable"><code>sort_unstable()</code></a> function, which is more efficient than the generic <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort"><code>sort()</code></a>.
Also note that we store the set as a boxed slice <code>Box&lt;[_]&gt;</code> instead of a <code>Vec&lt;_&gt;</code>, which is more compact for immutable sequences as it doesn’t require storing a capacity field to potentially grow the vector.</p>

<p>At this point, the <code>Data</code> root structs used half of the optimized size.
You might have noticed that it contained only optional fields.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Data</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>status_code</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>IString</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>IString</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>disruptions</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>InternedSet</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Disruption</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, in practice, the fields that are set come together: either the object contains an error, with <code>status_code</code>, <code>error</code> and <code>message</code> fields, or it contains useful data with <code>disruptions</code>, <code>lines</code> and <code>last_updated_date</code> fields.
So a better representation is to use an enumeration with two variants.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Data</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Success</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>disruptions</span><span>:</span> <span>InternedSet</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Disruption</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
        <span>lines</span><span>:</span> <span>InternedSet</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Line</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
        <span>last_updated_date</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>Error</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>status_code</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
        <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
        <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This separation brings two benefits: the schema is more sound semantically and takes less space in memory.
Indeed, an <code>Interned&lt;T&gt;</code> uses 4 bytes (a <code>u32</code> index) but an <code>Option&lt;Interned&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> uses 8 bytes: 1 bit for the option state and the rest to align to a multiple of 4 bytes.</p>

<p>The improvement was more modest this time (commit <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/c8ac2611348f271c8deffeb26b11aee022387baa">c8ac261</a>).</p>

<h3 id="splitting-structs-082"><span><a href="#splitting-structs-082"></a></span>Splitting structs (0.82%)</h3>

<p>Another thing you may have noticed about the <code>ImpactedObject</code> example is that it contains both fields that are constant (type, identifier, name) and fields that change over time (list of disruptions).
This means that each time a disruption is added or removed from the list, a new <code>ImpactedObject</code> is created and added to the interner, even if the “header” fields that define the object haven’t changed.
A more optimized approach is to extract the fixed fields into a separate object, and to add a new interner for it.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ImpactedObject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Fixed part of an object.</span>
    <span>object</span><span>:</span> <span>Interned</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Object</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>disruption_ids</span><span>:</span> <span>InternedSet</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>

<span>// New struct grouping the fixed fields of an object.</span>

    <span>typ</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>

    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>IString</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that this new design doesn’t change the total number of <code>ImpactedObject</code>s (55373), but makes each one smaller: one <code>u32</code> index for an <code>Interned&lt;Object&gt;</code> instead of three <code>IString</code> indices.
There are however much fewer <code>Object</code>s (1679) because each one is referenced by many <code>ImpactedObject</code>s (commit <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/8914a64497362cab7847796d60a27aeb117134b5">8914a64</a>).</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The improvement was small this time, but if we look at the second half of an <code>ImpactedObject</code> we can observe that several objects may be affected by the exact same set of disruptions, for example because they represent stations on the same line.
By adding another layer of indirection and interning the interned set, we can again reduce redundancy.
In practice there were only 9127 distinct sets of disruption IDs (commit <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/fcff0d5f1e9bc1089382170f5ed7f097190c48de">fcff0d5</a>).</p>

<h3 id="specializing-types-064"><span><a href="#specializing-types-064"></a></span>Specializing types (0.64%)</h3>

<p>After all these optimizations, strings were using half of the optimized space: each <code>Interner</code> is a table that other objects can reference by index.
In practice, the string interner contained values of very heterogeneous semantics: some strings were long error messages in HTML format, some were simple names of places, some were identifiers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUIDs</a> and others were timestamps in human-readable format.
The latter two are particularly interesting: instead of storing them as plain strings, we could parse them into more compact and semantically rich formats.</p>

<p>For UUIDs, we can simply use the <code>Uuid</code> type from the <a href="https://docs.rs/uuid/"><code>uuid</code></a> crate as a drop-in replacement.
Internally, this type uses only 16 bytes to store each identifier, instead of 36 bytes for strings like <code>67e55044-10b1-426f-9247-bb680e5fe0c8</code> (overhead of hexadecimal encoding + separators).</p>

<p>For timestamps, I opted for the <a href="https://docs.rs/chrono/"><code>chrono</code></a> crate, aiming to store each one in 8 bytes (64-bit number of seconds since the Unix epoch) rather than 15 to 24 bytes for something like <code>20240428T044500</code> or <code>2024-05-01T00:59:25.384Z</code>.
There was a difficulty however: some timestamps were encoded in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339">RFC 3339</a> format with millisecond precision in the UTC time zone, others were a naive date + time in seconds implicitly in the Paris time zone.
In that case, I used the <a href="https://docs.rs/chrono-tz/"><code>chrono-tz</code></a> crate to handle the conversion and canonicalize them to UTC.</p>

<p>There is a caveat however when the time zone is implicit: on days when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">daylight saving</a> starts or end, the times between 2am and 3am may either be ambiguous (we don’t know if we’re in the CET or CEST time zone when the time jumps back from 3am to 2am) or invalid (when the time jumps from 2am to 3am).
That said, the metro network is normally closed at this time, so a small imprecision isn’t too dramatic.
It would be more annoying for the scheduling of night trains for example.</p>

<h2 id="serialization"><span><a href="#serialization"></a></span>Serialization</h2>

<p>At this point, we basically have an implicit in-memory database.
The next step is to serialize it, to see how interning plays out with persistence.
Serialization is also an important step to validate that the claimed space improvements are real.
Lastly, it’s an opportunity to further compress the data.</p>

<p>In Rust, the de-facto serialization framework is <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/"><code>serde</code></a>, which we’ve already used to <a href="#importing-the-data-135">import the JSON input</a>.
Serde supports many formats out-of-the-box, via extension crates, so I’ve decided to try a few of them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8949">CBOR</a>, via <a href="https://docs.rs/ciborium/"><code>ciborium</code></a>,</li>
  <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259">JSON</a>, via <a href="https://docs.rs/serde_json/"><code>serde_json</code></a>,</li>
  <li><a href="https://postcard.jamesmunns.com/">Postcard</a>, via <a href="https://docs.rs/postcard/"><code>postcard</code></a>,</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://docs.rs/bincode/"><code>bincode</code></a> crate (no specification available).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="writing-custom-deserializers-with-serde-029"><span><a href="#writing-custom-deserializers-with-serde-029"></a></span>Writing custom (de)serializers with Serde (0.29%)</h3>

<p>Usually, all you have to do is to annotate each type in your schema with <code>#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]</code> and Serde provides you (de)serialization functions out-of-the-box, which is the whole appeal of the framework.
However, this wouldn’t be very efficient for the <code>Interner&lt;T&gt;</code> table, which contains the same objects twice (in a vector and in a hash map).
Additionally, Serde’s <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.217/serde/trait.Serialize.html#impl-Serialize-for-Rc%3CT%3E">documentation</a> mentions that even though <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc</code></a> is (de)serializable if you opt into the <code>rc</code> feature, it copies the underlying content each time it’s referenced, which isn’t optimal nor semantically equivalent.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Interner</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>vec</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Rc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Rc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this case, we don’t want to serialize both the vector of objects and the lookup table of indices: the whole interner state can be recovered from the vector alone.
Indeed, if we deserialize the objects in the same order, they will get the same indices.
And hopefully, Serde makes it easy to serialize a sequence.</p>

<p>Indeed, the docs for <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.217/serde/trait.Serialize.html"><code>Serialize</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.217/serde/trait.Serializer.html"><code>Serializer</code></a> quickly guide us to a solution, namely the <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.217/serde/trait.Serializer.html#tymethod.serialize_seq"><code>serialize_seq()</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.217/serde/trait.Serializer.html#method.collect_seq"><code>collect_seq()</code></a> methods (the latter works well with functional-style iterators).</p>

<p>Deserialization is more complex, which isn’t surprising as it needs to handle potential errors in the serialized stream.
Ultimately, you need to check the <a href="https://serde.rs/impl-deserialize.html">guide directly on Serde’s website</a>, as the regular API documentation doesn’t explain the details.</p>

<p>One needs not only to manipulate the <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.217/serde/trait.Deserialize.html"><code>Deserialize</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.217/serde/trait.Deserializer.html"><code>Deserializer</code></a> traits, but also write a <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.217/serde/de/trait.Visitor.html"><code>Visitor</code></a> and (in this case) manipulate a <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.217/serde/de/trait.SeqAccess.html"><code>SeqAccess</code></a>.
There’s a lot more boilerplate, but it works out.</p>

<p>Here is a comparison of the serialization formats at this point, sorted by encoded size.
Postcard is a clear winner at 3.2 MB, much less than JSON at 65 MB in pretty-printed form or 26 MB in minified form (commit <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/b5013e6ceed00263e4744ea4f6a7ce27b1e83b8d">b5013e6</a>).</p>

<p>It’s also interesting to compare the encoding and decoding times, as the more compact formats tend to be faster to process too.
Take them with a grain of salt though, that’s not a proper benchmark but a single data point on my machine, and without using any optimized library like <a href="https://docs.rs/simd-json/"><code>simd_json</code></a>.</p>

<p>Once we have serialized the database into bytes, we can apply general-purpose compression to it.
Indeed, even after interning we expect some amount of redundancy: for example disruption messages follow templates where only some details vary.</p>

<p>I didn’t really want to investigate the various Rust compression libraries, as I thought that spawning a command would be simpler for this experiment.
Indeed, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html"><code>Command</code></a> type in the Rust standard library allows to easily run other programs, passing them arguments and inputs in a safe way, and collecting the output.
In principle, one should configure <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Stdio.html#method.piped"><code>Stdio::piped()</code></a> to interact with stdin/stdout/stderr of the child process, and we’re good to go… or so I thought.</p>

<p>Indeed, while this naive implementation worked for simple examples with a short input, it seemingly deadlocked once I tried to compress larger inputs!</p>

<p>The answer lies in the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pipe.7.html">Linux manual for pipes</a>.
When a parent and child process communicate via stdin/stdout/stderr, this is done via a so-called <em>pipe</em>.
Under the hood, the kernel provides a buffer where one process can write and the other process can read.</p>

<p>However, to avoid exhausting the system resources, this buffer has a limited size.
In particular, <code>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size</code> sets the maximum size (in bytes) of one pipe, which is 1 MiB on my system.
Additionally, <code>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard</code> and <code>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-soft</code> set the maximum number of pages that one user can create in terms of pipes (across all its processes), which is 64 MiB on my system.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat</span> /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size
1048576
<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard
0
<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-soft
16384
</code></pre></div>

<p>Back to invoking <code>gzip</code>: the problem is that if the input is too large, the <code>write_all(input)</code> call will be blocked until the child (gzip) process reads from the pipe.
The <code>gzip</code> process will indeed start reading from it, but will also want to write compressed output as soon as possible to its standard output (to limit its own memory usage).
However, with the naive implementation, my parent process isn’t reading this output yet until it’s done writing all the input.
So the compressed output will fill its pipe too.</p>

<p><a href="https://gendignoux.com/blog/images/rust-interning-2000x/pipes-writing.rcvX_WUfg9Zh.svg"><img src="https://gendignoux.com/blog/images/rust-interning-2000x/pipes-writing.rcvX_WUfg9Zh.svg" width="840" height="275" loading="lazy" alt="Diagram of a compression process' stdin and stdout pipes filling up"></a>
Linux pipes around a compression process.</p>

<p>At some point, we’ll end up in a situation where my parent process is blocked on writing more input to the stdin pipe (waiting for gzip to read it) while the child gzip process is blocked on writing more compressed output to the stdout pipe (waiting for the parent process to read it).
In other words: an inter-process deadlock!</p>

<p><a href="https://gendignoux.com/blog/images/rust-interning-2000x/pipes-full.WTvcH5bPcbn8.svg"><img src="https://gendignoux.com/blog/images/rust-interning-2000x/pipes-full.WTvcH5bPcbn8.svg" width="840" height="275" loading="lazy" alt="Diagram with full stdin and stdout pipes"></a>
Full pipes causing a deadlock.</p>

<p>Be really careful about this limitation: even if you think that you won’t need to write more than 1 MiB (or whatever <code>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size</code> says on your system), the total per-user limit may restrict pipes to only one page (once <code>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-soft</code> is reached) which is usually 4 KiB, i.e. much lower than the 1 MiB default.</p>

<p>To remediate that, we need to make sure to both write uncompressed input and read compressed output at the same time, i.e. use threads.
We can still use the convenient functions <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html#method.write_all"><code>write_all()</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html#method.read_to_end"><code>read_to_end()</code></a> as long as they happen in parallel threads.</p>

<p>I ended up creating a utility function to automate this pattern of writing all of an input slice and reading all of the output.
Note the use of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/fn.scope.html"><code>std::thread::scope()</code></a>, which allows to capture an input slice with non-static lifetime.</p>

<p>Back to the original topic, I’ve benchmarked a few common compression algorithms.
What they show is that the size difference between formats tends to get smaller after compression.
At this point, we’ve reached the 2000x size reduction mark on the most compact formats: from 1.1 GB down to 530 KB for the May 2024 data (commit <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/b7281f5da83da3235ec88348a409aefe17c15ac9">b7281f5</a>).</p>

<p>However, similar sizes after compression doesn’t mean you should use JSON and forget about it: (de)serialization and (de)compression speed are faster with the more optimized formats like Postcard!</p>

<p>Another aspect that was out of scope for my experiment is the impact on code size: I expect the simpler formats to also compile to smaller code.
Be mindful of it especially if you’re deploying code for embedded systems or to <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> for a website.</p>

<h3 id="tuple-encoding"><span><a href="#tuple-encoding"></a></span>Tuple encoding</h3>

<p>Upon inspecting the serialized outputs more closely, I noticed that a lot of <code>_phantom</code> strings were present in the JSON or CBOR outputs.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>11</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"_phantom"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>null</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Something like <code>Interned&lt;T&gt;</code> which I would expect to be serialized as a simple integer was taking much more space.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Interned</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>_phantom</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>fn</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Indeed, by default Serde serializes each struct as a map, which causes two problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>field names are serialized as keys in a map,</li>
  <li>zero-sized types like <code>PhantomData</code> are serialized even though they don’t contain any information and should be trivial to re-create.</li>
</ol>

<p>This default might be useful if your types evolve over time (fields added, removed or renamed) and you want to retain some level of “out-of-the-box” compatibility, but that’s a design choice<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
In my case however, the <code>Interned&lt;T&gt;</code> abstraction was so ubiquitous that it meant a lot of redundancy.</p>

<p>After digging into it, I found <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/297">these</a> <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/1648">issues</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/request-for-implementation/issues/3">this discussion</a> by the maintainer of Serde, which boiled down to serializing a struct as a tuple rather than as a map.
Given that tuples don’t have field names, that should address the problem.
This feature request never got implemented in the <code>serde</code> crate itself, but a separate <a href="https://docs.rs/serde_tuple/"><code>serde_tuple</code></a> crate provides the <code>Serialize_tuple</code> and <code>Deserialize_tuple</code> derive macros.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>serde_tuple</span><span>::{</span><span>Deserialize_tuple</span><span>,</span> <span>Serialize_tuple</span><span>};</span>

<span>#[derive(Serialize_tuple,</span> <span>Deserialize_tuple)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Interned</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>_phantom</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>fn</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This mitigated the first issue (commits <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/a9924e982e24805bf7f1cdbe417e4da4e10d4158">a9924e9</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/cec535911616652401202d6d7ff4367cb938123c">cec5359</a>).
However, the <code>PhantomData</code> still appeared in the serialized output as a <code>null</code> value.</p>



<p>Given how ubiquitous the <code>Interned</code> type is, I ended up <a href="#writing-custom-deserializers-with-serde-029">writing a custom serializer</a> once again.</p>

<p>For the affected formats (CBOR and JSON), these optimizations reduced the encoded size by 72% to 75%.
The reduction was more modest after compression, ranging from 11% to 33% (commit <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/356bc0af128b19365a18145a12f816e90f9686d3">356bc0a</a>).</p>

<p>Note that formats like Postcard and Bincode already perform this optimization by default, leveraging the fact that they are <a href="https://postcard.jamesmunns.com/wire-format#non-self-describing-format">not self-describing</a>.
By using the <code>serde_tuple</code> crate, you drop part of the self-describing guarantees for other formats like JSON too, as the sender and receiver must agree on the schema (e.g. the specific order of fields in each struct) to be able to communicate without data corruption.</p>

<h3 id="optimizing-sets-revisited"><span><a href="#optimizing-sets-revisited"></a></span>Optimizing sets revisited</h3>

<p>I’ve <a href="#sorting-sets-15">previously described</a> how sets of objects could be better unified by sorting them.
The naive (default) approach to serialize them is a list of interned IDs.
However, in practice these IDs are often sequential, because the underlying objects were created around the same time.
For example, all the disruptions that happened on the same day would appear next to each other in the <code>Interned&lt;Disruption&gt;</code> table.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>70</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>72</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>73</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>74</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>75</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>77</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>78</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>79</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>80</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>81</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>So instead of serializing the IDs directly, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding">delta encoding</a>: serializing each ID as the difference from the previous ID.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>70</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This is beneficial for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>common serialization formats use variable-length encoding, meaning that small numbers are encoded in fewer bytes than larger numbers,</li>
  <li>if most of these differences are small numbers, there should be more redundancy that the compression algorithms should be able to exploit.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a <a href="#writing-custom-deserializers-with-serde-029">custom Serde serializer</a>, delta encoding is fairly straightforward to implement within each set.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>InternedSet</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>set</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>[</span><span>Interned</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>

<p>While differential encoding didn’t affect the Bincode format (which encodes integers with a fixed size), the serialized size decreased by 9% to 19% for the others.
The size after compression saw a marked decrease (8% to 16%) with gzip and brotli, and a more modest one (4% to 8%) with xz (commit <a href="https://github.com/gendx/rust-interning/commit/4ea388f81630ba8750b258e824a120f37979549c">4ea388f</a>).</p>

<p>In practice, we can go one step further: not only were the deltas often small, but they were also often 1s, with long sequences of consecutive elements.
So I decided to add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">run-length encoding</a> on top.
Note that because the IDs <a href="#sorting-sets-15">have been sorted</a>, the deltas are guaranteed to be non-negative, making a simple dual delta/RLE encoding possible: interpret a negative number <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as a run of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> consecutive elements, and a non-negative number as a delta from the previous element.</p>

<p>Conceptually, interning is a simple technique, yet we’ve seen that it can lead to many choices and optimizations.
It’s commonly applied to strings, but in practice what really made a difference was broadly interning all sorts of data structures!</p>

<p>At the end of this article, we have implicitly built one of the simplest relational database designs (without all the querying/SQL part).
It comes a few limitations, which are fine for a time series:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>append-only</strong>: we can’t modify nor delete existing objects,</li>
  <li><strong>in-memory</strong>: the serialized form doesn’t support random access of a value at an arbitrary index, so we need to deserialize the whole database in memory,</li>
  <li><strong>single-writer</strong>: to increment the index when interning a new object without synchronization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Something that should be fairly simple to add is supporting incremental updates: given that the interning tables are append-only with incremental indices, you could easily take a snapshot of the database and later create a diff containing only the new objects added since the snapshot.
Multiple reader nodes could then be implemented on top of that, which would give us a replicated database: the writer would broadcast incremental updates to the readers from time to time.</p>

<p>Now, practically, should you use one of the <a href="https://lib.rs/keywords/interning">countless existing interning crates</a>, or <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/1/24/build-it-yourself/">write it yourself</a>?
The answer is that it depends on what you’re doing!</p>

<p>Do you care about a very optimized in-memory layout for strings?
The naive <code>Rc&lt;String&gt;</code> representation I’ve shown may not be ideal.
Are you fine with a single global interner or do you want to manipulate local interner arenas like I’ve shown in this post?
Do you need to serialize your data, and if so should the serialization be compact?</p>

<p>You might even have come up with the interning pattern yourself without knowing it had a name nor that plenty of libraries implement it: that’s perfectly fine too!
Hopefully this post can help you evaluate the existing libraries and make an informed decision to reinvent the wheel or not.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Mar 2, 2025<!-- --> - ⏱️ <!-- -->4 minutes to read</p></div><p>As a long-time Apple user, I've always appreciated the seamless integration of
hardware and software that is the signature of the Apple ecosystem. However,
recent experiences with my iPad Air 11" M2 has left me questioning whether
Apple has lost sight of what once made their products exceptional.</p>
<h2>A Brief Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>November 6, 2024</strong>: Visited the Apple Store in Turin with my new iPad Air
11" M2 experiencing significant lag and overheating when using Notes and
Freeform with Apple Pencil Pro.</li>
<li><strong>November 13, 2024</strong>: Received a replacement unit after store
representatives suggested a hardware swap.</li>
<li><strong>February 27, 2025</strong>: The replacement unit is now exhibiting identical
performance issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Premium Hardware, Struggling Software</h2>
<p>In November, I visited the Apple Store in Turin to address persistent issues
with my iPad Air 11" M2 running iPadOS 18.1. Despite having cutting-edge
hardware, I've been experiencing significant lag when using basic Apple
applications like Notes and Freeform.</p>
<p>The performance issues don't stop at sluggish response times. During these
standard use cases, my iPad frequently overheated, making it uncomfortable to
hold and raising concerns about potential long-term hardware damage.</p>
<p>What made this particularly frustrating is that these aren't third-party
applications pushing the hardware to its limits. These are Apple's own
applications that should theoretically be optimized for their hardware.</p>
<p>The Apple Store staff were courteous and professional, following their standard
troubleshooting protocols. After demonstrating the issues in person, the
support representative suggested a hardware replacement. However, after further
discussion, we both concluded this was likely a software problem rather than a
hardware defect.</p>
<p>I think this highlights a growing challenge for Apple's retail support model:
how do you troubleshoot software issues when the traditional solution has been
to replace hardware? When software quality declines, the entire support
infrastructure feels misaligned.</p>
<p>This experience feels symptomatic of a broader decline in Apple's software
quality.</p>
<p>My replacement iPad Air 11" M2 with the Apple Pencil Pro is once again
struggling with basic tasks. Despite multiple iPadOS updates since my original
complaint (we're now on 18.3.1), the fundamental issues remain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significant lag when using Apple's own Notes and Freeform applications</strong>:
Input latency increases dramatically after about 5-10 minutes of use, with
stroke rendering delayed by up to 5 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Device overheating during standard usage scenarios</strong>: CPU temperatures
reach concerning levels (based on device heat) during basic pencil input tasks</li>
<li><strong>Poor responsiveness with the Apple Pencil Pro</strong>: Palm rejection fails
intermittently, and pressure sensitivity becomes inconsistent</li>
</ul>
<p>This recurrence with a replacement device confirms what I suspected last
November - this is a software optimization problem, not a hardware defect.</p>
<h2>Details Worth Noting</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thermal Management Failures</strong>: The M2 chip should throttle performance
before reaching uncomfortable external temperatures, suggesting the thermal
management system isn't properly engaging;</li>
<li><strong>Memory Management Problems</strong>: The gradual degradation in performance points
to memory leaks or improper garbage collection in Apple's drawing applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since my original complaint, I've discovered
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadOS/search/?q=overheating">numerous</a> forum threads
and social media discussions from iPad users experiencing similar issues. This
suggests a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents.</p>
<p>Most concerning is that multiple software updates have failed to address these
fundamental performance issues while introducing new features that add more
strain to the system (like Apple Intelligence, but that's a story for another
day).</p>
<h2>Reconsidering the "Apple Tax"</h2>
<p>For years, many of us have willingly paid the "Apple tax", the premium price
for Apple products justified by superior user experience, design, and ecosystem
integration. But if software quality continues to decline, this value
proposition becomes increasingly difficult to defend.</p>
<p>The persistence of these issues through multiple software updates suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Feature prioritization over optimization</strong>: Engineering resources appear
focused on new capabilities rather than fixing existing performance problems;</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate performance testing</strong>: Real-world usage scenarios with Apple's
own applications aren't being adequately tested.</li>
</ol>
<p>As customers paying premium prices for Apple products, we at least deserve:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Acknowledgment of known performance issues;</li>
<li><strong>Focus on fundamentals</strong>: Updates focused solely on performance and
stability;</li>
<li><strong>Extended support</strong>: Consideration for extended warranties when software
issues impact hardware lifespan.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Apple experience was once defined by the joy of using products that "just
worked." Today, that promise feels increasingly hollow as software struggles to
keep pace with hardware capabilities. As users and customers, we need to
vocally advocate for the quality-focused Apple we once knew.</p>
<p>After months of hoping for improvement, I'm faced with difficult decisions
about my future in the Apple ecosystem. This extended iPad issue has severely
damaged my confidence in new Apple products.</p>
<p>I call on Apple to return to its roots - creating products that prioritize user
experience over feature checklists. The company that once proudly created
products that "just work" needs to reclaim that ethos.</p></article></div>]]></description>

We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.</p><p>The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:</p><pre><code>    * Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (70+ currently).
    * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.
    * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.
    * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.
</code></pre><p>
We do have a small cloud footprint, but run primarily on bare metal. We are looking for people who can not just configure services offered by the public clouds, but who deeply understand what lies below; people who could build their own cloud. That sounds a bit pretentious and it’s not exactly what we do, but it does involve many of the same aspects.</p><p>A very recent example of what I personally find fascinating: last week Ethereum’s Holesky testnet experienced loss of liveness. This is a real-world, globally distributed system that implements Byzantine fault tolerance, with multiple independent implementations of the protocol. Several of these implementations had a bug in an update, which caused a split in the network. The protocol is designed to handle this situation in theory, but in practice it is triggering previously unexplored failure modes in the implementations, that are hard to test for in synthetic small-scale tests. I think there are very few places where you get to be involved in a planet-scale distributed system exhibiting “interesting” behavior, especially one that is not in control of a single entity. Of course, there is also the less fun part that the testnet is now broken, alerts are firing, and it’s hard and chaotic to coordinate a fix when the network is not controlled by a single entity. Fortunately it’s a testnet.</p><p>Apply at <a href="https://careers.chorus.one/o/platforms-engineer-remote" rel="nofollow">https://careers.chorus.one/o/platforms-engineer-remote</a>.</p></div></td></tr>

We developed our own convenience library on top of Puppeteer that make tests easier to write and more reliable than Puppeteer, Playwright, or Taiko (all of which we used previously). The tests can run locally (on Linux/MacOS development machines) and they run automatically on push to our build servers. The build servers are modern bare metal servers with Ampere and AMD CPUs with enough RAM to run dozens of test networks in parallel.</p><p>We have a simple review/interview/hiring process and low employee turnover.</p><p>Contact careers@tetmon.com and include your GitHub profile or attach examples of your work.</p></div></td></tr>

Manufacturing is important. It’s the fundamental industry on which everything else is built. We take it for granted. In 1989, 35% of the entire software industry was manufacturing systems. Back then, services, hand holding, customization, and consulting were necessary to get the systems to where they are today. What was the first massive burst in productivity from technology has stagnated into incremental diminishing returns and exponentially increasing complexity. We can only continue to add complexity for so much longer until the whole system collapses.
"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction."
Manufacturing is important. We must deliver a touch of technological genius to reintroduce simplicity, efficiency, and integration.</p><p>Investors: Besssemer, Battery, Bain, Schematic, Motivate

It spanned from 18 to 30, and he glue-sticked little pictures of his favorite authors next to the age at which they’d published their first novels. At 21, Bret Easton Ellis</span><em>.</em><span> At 24, Martin Amis. At 25, Michael Chabon and Zadie Smith. At 26, Philip Roth. At 27, John Updike. He cut out a picture of his own face, and stuck it to the timeline among them. Every year, on his birthday, he moved his face one spot forward. Every year, he passed another one of his idols.</span></p><p><span>All of the writers he admired were considered (at one time, at least) exceptional young writers, and he wanted nothing more than to be like them: an exceptional young</span><em> </em><span>writer. Writing a book, in and of itself, mattered less to him than doing it at a supernaturally young age. To be a prodigy, a wunderkind—that’s what aroused his ambitions. From the blurry vantage of Youth, failing to publish a novel before his 30</span><sup>th</sup><span> birthday would be his life’s ultimate failure.</span></p><p>And, ultimately, he failed. He turned 30, then 31, and had nowhere to stick his cut-out face.</p><p><strong>To do a thing young is a shortcut to greatness.</strong><span> Everything you do right is evidence of your great potential, and all your mistakes are the mistakes of inexperience, which will be corrected, surely, by the passing of time. To write a poor sentence at the age of nineteen is expected (and quickly forgiven). To write a poor sentence at the age of forty-five—shouldn’t you know better by now? In this manner, being a not-young writer is a lose-lose proposition, because this principle applies to brilliant sentences, too. In youth, they are a marvel; later, they’re table stakes. </span><em>Couples</em><span>, which John Updike wrote when he was thirty-six, is considered one of his great accomplishments. But </span><em>Villages</em><span>, which he wrote at the age of seventy-two, is just as good. But of course it’s good—it was written by the guy who wrote </span><em>Couples</em><span>!</span></p><p>The years that pass eat up your margin for error until there is no margin left. The mistakes you make are no longer flaws of inexperience, they are flaws of character. To be young is to be constantly on the precipice of perfection – just a little further and you’ll get there – but you never get there, and suddenly you’re old, and find yourself in a permanent state of imperfection, which you must reckon with.</p><p><strong>He managed to finish two novels before he turned twenty-five.</strong><span> Neither were published. Neither were “good”—they were a young person’s novels: overbearing, self-conscious, sloppy, prideful, subpar imitations of the kind of books exceptional young writers wrote. One of his unpublished novels was about a seven-year-old boy who writes an elaborate science-fiction thriller in his school notebook, and when the manuscript is discovered by his teacher, he is skipped ahead a grade, and there encounters all the familiar plot points you’d expect in a coming-of-age story: bullies, crushes, etc.</span></p><p>He never realized what a naked parallel that story was for his own ambitions: to be rewarded with advancement, not necessarily for the thing he did, but for how young he was when he did it. It wasn’t a specific accomplishment he’d invested all his pride and hope in, but a specific condition in which that accomplishment would be achieved. </p><p><span>And then, one day, that condition expired. He was no longer young, and therefore no longer a young writer, and therefore would never be an exceptional </span><em>young</em><span> writer.</span></p><p><span>But still, and yet, even so – contrary to all logic and in total disregard of quantum law – it remained his goal: to be a young writer, and to be discovered. The problem is: no one wants to discover a 45-year-old. 45-year-olds aren’t discovered, they’re </span><em>uncovered</em><span>, like toxic waste, or a political scandal, or the murderer at the end of an Agatha Christie book. </span><em>My god, that 45-year-old was lurking among us this entire time!</em></p><p><span>(</span><strong>And the 55 year-olds are saying: forty-five? </strong><span>That’s nothing! Quit complaining! But one cannot choose the age at which they feel old, just like you can’t help feeling cold when the temperature drops. Winter comes whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. So do birthdays. Just ask Virginia Woolf, who, at the age of fifty, wrote in her diary: “</span><em>I don't believe in ageing. I believe in forever altering one's aspect to the sun. Hence my optimism. And to alter now, cleanly and sanely, I want to shuffle off this loose living randomness: people; reviews; fame; all the glittering scales; and be withdrawn, and concentrated.</em><span>” </span></p><p>Nine years later, Virginia walked into a pond with her pockets full of rocks, shuffling off her loose living randomness, permanently altering her aspect to the sun. Was this an act of optimism? Was this the response of someone eager to venture forth into the dark territory past the penumbra of youth?)</p><p><strong>Post-Youth, he began reading books about The Second World War</strong><span>, and Ancient Greece, and the American Civil War, and Quantum Physics, and The History of The Universe, and took solace in the immensity of the world.</span></p><p><span>Why does one develop an interest in history later in life? Is it a dawning realization that we are stuck in our particular moment in time, forever to know only this one small sliver of history? It’s a bit like that with everything</span><em> </em><span>we experience: as the years pile on, we realize how narrowly we touch the world. Is that why retirees like to travel? These tour groups where old folks disembark slowly from buses – stair by stair, feet turned sideways – to explore ancient ruins for twenty minutes at a time? An attempt to cram in as much of the world as possible before it’s taken away from them?</span></p><p><span>In his youth, he vacationed differently. Everywhere he went was a place he could live, a potential future life. He could live </span><em>here</em><span>, he’d tell himself. Or he could meet a woman </span><em>there</em><span>, and start a family </span><em>there</em><span>, and become a citizen of </span><em>that</em><span> place. Mexico, Hong Kong, France, Italy, Western Indiana, etc. </span></p><p>Eventually, he met a woman and chose a place – the best woman and the best place – and his future was fixed. The world was good, but the world was no longer full of all these possibilities. What, then, fills the void where possibility once lived?</p><p><strong>In Youth, you fantasize about one day meeting your idols.</strong><span> You imagine yourself standing behind them in line at a coffee shop, gathering the courage to tap them on the shoulder, tripping over your tongue to tell them what their work has meant to you. In these imagined scenarios you are always still young, still an up-and-comer, still undiscovered and hiding within you the potential for galactic greatness, but then you get old, and now must imagine yourself in line at Au Bon Pain, tearful and sputtering praise at Zadie Smith, who is, in fact, only three years older than you, and what a creepy interaction that would be! A 45 year-old, fawning like that—repulsive, pathetic!</span></p><p>That’s how it feels, most of the time, to no longer be young: pathetic, repulsive.</p><p><strong>When you think of being young</strong><span> – when you think of Youth as a state of being – you might think about being twelve years-old and watching the opening credits of </span><em>Silence of the Lambs</em><span> on the VHS tape you bought secondhand at the video store with your allowance money. This might be a singular moment you’ve plucked from your brain (a specific time, a specific place) or perhaps a composite memory of all the times you watched </span><em>Silence of the Lamb</em><span>s throughout your pre-teen and teenage years, when you were probably too young to be watching it at all.</span></p><p>In that opening sequence, which you’ve seen a million times, Clarice Starling is running through the woods at the FBI training camp. She’s wearing a gray jogging suit. It’s autumn, the image is washed out, the credits are in black typeface. Moody music plays.</p><p><span>In Youth, you watched this and felt hundreds of feelings, imagined hundreds of futures. Swimming within you were all the serial killer stories you’d one day write, that would be turned into movies just like this, and orbiting just outside the atmosphere of your comprehension (but still in view) were all the unknowable details of the grown-up world you’d one day inhabit, all the ambitious and slightly masculine women in jogging suits you might one day meet and perhaps marry. You experienced the opening credits of </span><em>Silence of the Lambs </em><span>in a manner that was completely unique to your position in the world, which was: you were young and could do anything.</span></p><p><span>But today, when you watch that same sequence – on the television in your hotel room during a work trip to Newark, let’s say – you might find it representative, instead, of all the serial killer stories you </span><em>didn’t</em><span> write, and you might be cowed by all the knowledge now within your grasp about how hard it is to write a story in the first place, and how much Thomas Harris – who wrote the novel the movie was based on – hated the process of writing, how torturous is was for him, how much he suffered in front of the keyboard, and you might fear that you share the same psychological trait, that you might never take joy in sitting at a desk, just a shadow of joy, just a foolish hope for future joy, just a lottery ticket with trillion-to-one odds of winning joy. You might even think about Ted Tally, the writer who adapted Harris’ novel, who won an Oscar for it, who never found much success after that, and you might wonder where he is now, what he’s doing, and you might be disappoined that you never got a chance to meet him, the guy who penned all those oft-quoted Hannibal Lecter lines (even though they’re less quoted, now, than they used to be—culture, too, loses its Youth). You might even feel melancholy about all the ambitious and slightly masculine women you didn’t meet, or who you met and failed to charm, who mistook your gestures of affection for mockery and were offended, who couldn’t see that you were more like them than they were willing to admit: slightly masculine, and ambitious.</span></p><p>Yes, you might watch the first five minutes of this particular movie and reminisce (fondly, even) about all your illusions about the grown-up world and how the grown-up world laughed as it shattered them.</p><p><strong>He published a novel, eventually.</strong><span> It came out on his 37</span><sup>th</sup><span> birthday. Ten years later than Updike, thirteen later than Amis, fifteen later than Ellis. All debuts, by definition, feel like youthful acts, and so did his. But writing a book at thirty-seven earns you no extra credit—no one grades on a curve, no one is charmed by your precociousness. It was just another book written by a 37-year-old. A book that was not bad, maybe kinda okay, but definitely not great, because if it was great, why did it take him until he was thirty-seven to write it?</span></p><p><strong>But it’s not just your own Youth that you mourn.</strong><span> You have kids, eventually, and must watch their Youth expire, too—slowly leaking out of them, day by day, relentlessly, invisibly, like a cracked tire, like a party balloon you find weeks later behind the couch.</span></p><p>You might cry inexplicably when you pass down their too-small snowsuits to neighbours. You might be irrationally angry when you find out that your spouse has donated to charity all the board books you once read at bedtime. You might attend your 4-year-old daughter’s ballet recital, and, sitting in the dark auditorium, watching all the little bodies fumble sweetly across the stage, find yourself suddenly overwhelmed by thoughts of all the things that will inevitably happen to those bodies – the good and bad things, the pain and elation, the self-disgust and attempts at self-refinement – and you might feel a deep and disorienting sadness, a throbbing bubble in your stomach, which is the inverse of the comfortable smallness you feel when you read books about The History of The Universe. It’s a feeling akin to dread, and the thing you’re dreading (you’ll realize) is this: that Youth exists only so that it can be destroyed.</p><p><span>Even as you celebrate the milestones of their personhood – as they walk, and talk, and read, and order meals at a restaurant, and bake banana loaf with hardly any help, and start writing down their secret thoughts in a journal you come across while putting away their laundry and can’t stop yourself from reading – you still want your kids to maintain their Youth for as long as possible, to believe in the Tooth Fairy, to be scared of ghosts, to love dinosaurs, to hold on to their innocence even though you know that the longer they hold on, the more it will hurt them to lose it. And they </span><em>will</em><span> lose it, you can’t stop it, just like you can’t stop their hair from growing or their hearts from being broken.</span></p><p>So you watch your kids closely. You watch them sleep. You watch them watching the opening credits of a movie they’re too young for and wonder what they’re imagining about the world, about themselves, about the silly dreams coalescing in their heads, and if, when they watch those opening credits again, decades from now – preferably anywhere but a hotel in Newark – they’ll mourn their Youth and the silly dreams it conjured.</p><p><strong>But this silly desire to be an exceptional young writer wasn’t egoistic craving.</strong><span> It was a biological obligation. He couldn’t help it. He couldn’t turn it off. Even when he tried not to write, he was writing. He imagined paragraphs in his head, imagined whole novels, composed of sentences that weren’t even made up of words, just the </span><em>essence</em><span> of words, just the </span><em>gist</em><span> of language, letter-like shapes and colors that were combined in his head to generate the possibility of something that </span><em>could</em><span> be written. He knew no other way to live, no other way to fully exist in the world. He’d lived inside the bodies of the writers he read, and imagined, too, that people were living inside of his. It was the only form of intimacy he could understand, the only one he could bear.</span></p><p>Wanting to be seen and understood and appreciated is not a desire unique to the young. You might think it is. You might think a lot of desires are unique to youth. You are told that getting older is a process of shedding desire, but that’s not true: you retain into old age a keen awareness of the decades stretched out before you, and you desire – with a bewildered sort of desperation – to make them count for something. Silly dreams are only silly when they don’t come true. And they don’t cease to be silly until they’re discarded.</p><p>Like everyone and everything, he was slowly stripped of his Youth (or set free of it, if you’re the glass-half-full type), and the endless possibilities that perhaps never existed were nonetheless narrowed down to just this one: to be the person he’d become, to move his cut-out face one spot forward, to live this life until there was no more of it to live.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tolstoyan.substack.com/p/youth?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://tolstoyan.substack.com/p/youth?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tolstoyan.substack.com/p/youth/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://tolstoyan.substack.com/p/youth/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<h3 id="the-internals-of-postgresql">The Internals of PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL is a well-designed, open-source multi-purpose relational database system which is widely used throughout the world.</p>
<p>It is one huge system with the integrated subsystems, each of which has a particular complex feature and works cooperatively with each other.
Although understanding of the internal mechanism is crucial for both administration and integration using PostgreSQL, its hugeness and complexity make it difficult.</p>
<p>The main purposes of this document are to explain how each subsystem works, and to provide the whole picture of PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>This document covers versions 17 and earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22interdb.jp%22+site:acm.org" target="_blank">Some academic papers</a> have referred to this document.
The <a href="https://item.jd.com/12527505.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese version</a> of this document was published in June 2019.</p>

        FAQ
    </label></p><div id="expandcontent-4150a6975ad08e21debadfe8adff3496">

<p>Since publishing my content, I’ve been fortunate to receive a lot of positive feedback, which is truly gratifying.
However, unfortunately, I’ve encountered individuals in the past who tried to misuse my content for self-promotion <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<!--
However, unfortunately, I've had to deal with some unpleasant experiences in the past.
Here are a few examples:

- Repeated Manuscript Requests: Several individuals persistently requested my entire text for proofreading purposes.
Their intention, however, became clear soon: to plagiarize my work.
Althgough I offered them to ask proofreading a portion and I then review their results, they persisted to get all source (text + html framework) at once.
- Deceptive Publishing Proposal: One person pressured me to publish a book under his company name, not my name.
He misrepresented his motives, claiming he wanted to make my content widely recognized for my benefit, not his company's.
- Unauthorized Translations: I've encountered requests to surrender the text and rights for unauthorized translations into various languages several times.

These include companies that are still active in the PostgreSQL community.
-->
<p>These experiences have shaped the approach I’ve outlined below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who can use this document freely?<br>
If you are a teacher or a student belonging to an educational organization, you can freely use this document and figures in your study.
Anyone can use this document and figures with noncommercial meetings and lectures, if you state the link to this site and the copyright; otherwise, contact me.</li>
<li>Is it available for commercial contents?<br>
This content can be used under two options:
<ul>
<li>Revenue Share:
You can leverage this content after a revenue share agreement is signed.
Under this agreement, you’ll share 20% of the sales generated from using this content.</li>
<li>Full Buyout:
In very rare cases, I consider requests for full commercial use of all content on this site.
For a complete buyout of all content rights, the cost is €5,000,000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the author need any help to write?<br>
No. I am writing for my own enjoyment.
Even if you send me your article, I will never include it in my document.</li>
<li>Why doesn’t the author use the GitBook or other e-book formats/sites?<br>
I am using the best tools I need and I will decide what I use.
I am always trying a lot of tools for better explanations.
<br>
Simply put, this document is optimized to read on html file and it is hard to convert to other formats.
<br>
I do not have any plan to make PDF version and Smartphone versions because of same reason.</li>
<li>Why doesn’t the author use RSS to notify the update?<br>
I keep my domain and my server to provide my document; you can read when you want to read. What do you want more?</li>
<li>Why doesn’t the author waive the copyright of this document or use the creative commons license?<br>
I’d like to ask you what problems you have by that I keep on having the copyright of my document.</li>

                <p>Starting with Google Chrome 127, there will be a warning for uBlock Origin (uBO) in your <code>chrome://extensions/</code> page:</p>

<p>This is the result of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/mv2-deprecation-timeline" rel="nofollow">Manifest v2 support</a> being deprecated in favor of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3" rel="nofollow">Manifest v3</a>.</p>
<p>uBO is a Manifest v2 extension, hence the warning in your Google Chrome browser. There is no Manifest v3 version of uBO, hence the browser will suggest alternative extensions as a replacement for uBO:</p>
<p><img src="https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/585534/354626846-2dc9d217-5c52-441a-b406-e29180707df8.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3NDEwMDE3MDEsIm5iZiI6MTc0MTAwMTQwMSwicGF0aCI6Ii81ODU1MzQvMzU0NjI2ODQ2LTJkYzlkMjE3LTVjNTItNDQxYS1iNDA2LWUyOTE4MDcwN2RmOC5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMzAzJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDMwM1QxMTMwMDFaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT05ZDJlMDcwMWZlNTM3Nzk2NmRlZTY4Yjg1ODFlMzIzZTExZTZjOTY2N2Y5MTc4YjQ2MGI0ZDNmNGQyOGYxM2Q1JlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.XTb8DumKWRS7PpQIQlQUNtfG2m2VvfccDarDze6sglw" alt="b" content-type-secured-asset="image/png"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home">uBO Lite (uBOL)</a> is a pared-down version of uBO with a best effort at converting filter lists used by uBO into a Manifest v3-compliant approach, with a focus on reliability and efficiency as has been the case with uBO since first published in June 2014.</p>
<p>However the focus on reliability and efficiency in a Manifest v3 environment meant having to sacrifice many features beyond those not possible within a Manifest v3 framework.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-(FAQ)">official uBOL FAQ webpage</a> for more details about how uBOL compares to uBO.</p>
<p>Manifest v2 uBO will not be automatically replaced by Manifest v3 uBOL. uBOL is too different from uBO for it to silently replace uBO -- you will have to explicitly make a choice as to which extension should replace uBO according to your own prerogatives.</p>
<p>Ultimately whether uBOL is an acceptable alternative to uBO is up to you, it's not a choice that will be made for you.</p>
<p><h3>Will development of uBO continue?</h3><a id="user-content-will-development-of-ubo-continue" aria-label="Permalink: Will development of uBO continue?" href="#will-development-of-ubo-continue"></a></p>
<p>Yes, there are other browsers which are not deprecating Manifest v2, e.g. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2024/03/13/manifest-v3-manifest-v2-march-2024-update/" rel="nofollow">Firefox</a>.</p>
<p><h3>Links</h3><a id="user-content-links" aria-label="Permalink: Links" href="#links"></a></p>
<p>There also exists a related helpful discussion regarding an official way to extend Manifest v2 support in Chrome up to June 2025 via <code>ExtensionManifestV2Availability</code> policy: <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/discussions/2977#discussioncomment-8134456">Chrome Web Store migration plan?</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/us-economy-strength-rich-spending-2c34a571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, the top 10% also accounts for 50% of all consumer spending:</p>

<p>The top 10% is spending way more on an inflation-adjusted basis in the 2020s.</p>

<p>The wealthy class exist in a different stratosphere and there are wide-ranging implications here:</p>
<p><strong>Concentration is everywhere.&nbsp;</strong>The stock market is concentrated. So is the economy. This concentration could make markets and the economy riskier but it also makes them harder to handicap.</p>
<p>When you have wealth concentrated in the hands of the few it’s much more difficult to understand what’s going on using metrics that may have worked in the past.</p>
<p>This is why economic anecdotes aren’t very useful when trying to gauge the performance of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if the wealth effect slows?&nbsp;</strong>The top 10% is spending more in part because their financial assets have increased in value substantially. Stocks are up. Housing prices are up. Equity in businesses is up.</p>
<p>The stock market is not the economy, but it seems like the two are now more intertwined than they were in the past.</p>
<p><strong>I’m not sure what stops this. </strong>Wealth inequality is only getting worse in this country and frankly I’m not sure what stops this train. It feels like it’s unsustainable but the rich just keep getting richer.</p>
<p>Short of a financial crisis I don’t really see what slows this trend. Even then I’m not sure there would be much of a long-term impact. If there is a financial crisis, guess who has the means to ride out a storm and buy assets on the cheap? The top 10%.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t see wealth inequality getting better any time soon.</p>
<p>I’m fairly confident it’s only going to get worse from here.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Flow Matching and Diffusion Models</h2>
    <h2>MIT Computer Science Class 6.S184: Generative AI with Stochastic Differential Equations</h2>
<p>
Diffusion and flow-based models have become the state of the art for generative AI across a wide range of data modalities, including images, videos, shapes, molecules, music, and more! This course aims to build up the mathematical framework underlying these models from first principles. At the end of the class, students will have built a toy image diffusion model from scratch, and along the way, will have gained hands-on experience with the mathematical toolbox of stochastic differential equations that is useful in many other fields. This course is ideal for students who want to develop a principled understanding of the theory and practice of generative AI.
</p><h2 id="notes">Course Notes</h2>
  <p>
  The course notes serve as the backbone of the course and provide a self-contained explanation of all material in the class. In contrast, lectures slides will generally not be self-contained and are intended to provide accompanying visualizations during the lecture.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>We’re excited to share something special with you: <strong>VectorChord-BM25</strong>, a new extension designed to make PostgreSQL’s full-text search even better. Whether you’re building a small app or managing a large-scale system, this tool brings advanced BM25 scoring and ranking right into PostgreSQL, making your searches smarter and faster.</p>
<h3 id="heading-whats-new"><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>BM25 Scoring &amp; Ranking</strong>: Get more precise and relevant search results with BM25, helping you find what matters most.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Optimized Indexing</strong>: Thanks to the Block WeakAnd algorithm, searches are quicker and more efficient, even with large datasets.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Tokenization</strong>: Improved stemming and stop word handling mean better accuracy and smoother performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We built VectorChord-BM25 to be simple, powerful, and fully integrated with PostgreSQL—because we believe great tools should make your life easier, not more complicated. We hope you’ll give it a try and let us know what you think.</p>



<p>Before we get to the exciting news, let’s take a quick look at <strong>BM25</strong>, the algorithm that powers modern search engines. BM25 is a probabilistic ranking function that determines how relevant a document is to a search query.</p>
<p>The BM25 formula might look a bit intimidating at first, but let’s break it down step by step to make it easy to understand. Here’s it:</p>
<p>$$\text{score}(Q, D) = \sum_{q \in Q} \text{IDF}(q) \cdot \frac{f(q, D) \, (k_1 + 1)}{f(q, D) + k_1 \cdot \left(1 - b + b \cdot \frac{|D|}{\text{avgdl}}\right)}$$</p><p><strong>Term Frequency (TF)</strong>: The term f(q,D) represents how often the query term <em>q</em> appears in document <em>D</em>. The more a term appears in a document, the higher its relevance score. For example, if "AI" appears 5 times in Document A and 2 times in Document B, Document A gets a higher score for this term.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)</strong>: The term IDF(q) measures how rare or common the term <em>q</em> is across all documents. Rare terms (e.g., "NVIDIA") are given more weight than common terms (e.g., "revenue"). This ensures that unique terms have a greater impact on the relevance score.</p>
<p><strong>Document Length Normalization</strong>: The term ∣<em>D</em>∣ represents the length of document <em>D</em>, while avgdl is the average length of all documents in the collection. This part of the formula adjusts the score to account for document length, ensuring shorter documents aren’t unfairly penalized. For instance, a concise report won’t be overshadowed by a lengthy one that only briefly mentions the query term.</p>
<p><strong>Tuning Parameters</strong>: The parameters <em>k</em>1 and <em>b</em> allow the formula to be fine-tuned. <em>k</em>1 controls the extent to which term frequency impacts the score, while <em>b</em> balances the effect of document length normalization. These parameters can be adjusted to optimize results for specific datasets.</p>
<p>Consider searching a database of financial reports for "Tesla stock performance." A report that mentions "Tesla" ten times will score higher than one that mentions it only twice. However, the term "stock" might appear in many reports, so it’s given less weight than "Tesla," which is more specific. Furthermore, a short, concise report about Tesla’s stock performance won’t be overshadowed by a lengthy report that only briefly mentions Tesla.</p>
<h2 id="heading-existing-solution-in-postgres">Existing Solution in Postgres</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s take a look at the existing solutions for full-text search in PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL provides built-in support for full-text search through the combination of the <code>tsvector</code> data type and GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) indexes. Here’s how it works: text is first converted into a <code>tsvector</code>, which tokenizes the content into lexemes—standardized word forms that make searching more efficient. A GIN index is then created on the <code>tsvector</code> column, significantly speeding up query performance and enabling fast retrieval of relevant documents, even when dealing with large text fields. This integration of text processing and advanced indexing makes PostgreSQL a powerful and scalable solution for applications that require efficient full-text search.</p>
<pre><code><span>-- Create a table with a text column</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> documents (
    <span>id</span> <span>SERIAL</span> PRIMARY <span>KEY</span>,
    <span>content</span> <span>TEXT</span>,
    content_vector tsvector
);

<span>-- Insert sample data with tsvector conversion</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> documents (<span>content</span>, content_vector) <span>VALUES</span>
(<span>'PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source database system.'</span>, to_tsvector(...)),
(<span>'Full-text search in PostgreSQL is efficient and scalable.'</span>, to_tsvector(...)),
(<span>'BM25 is a ranking function used by search engines.'</span>, to_tsvector(...));

<span>-- Create a GIN index on the tsvector column</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> idx_content_vector <span>ON</span> documents <span>USING</span> GIN (content_vector);

<span>-- Query using tsvector, rank results with ts_rank, and leverage the GIN index</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>, <span>content</span>, ts_rank(content_vector, to_tsquery(<span>'english'</span>, <span>'PostgreSQL &amp; search'</span>)) <span>AS</span> <span>rank</span>
<span>FROM</span> documents
<span>WHERE</span> content_vector @@ to_tsquery(<span>'english'</span>, <span>'PostgreSQL &amp; search'</span>)
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>rank</span> <span>DESC</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>However, PostgreSQL has a limitation: it lacks modern relevance scoring mechanisms like BM25. Instead, it returns all matching documents and relies on <code>ts_rank</code> to re-rank them, which can be inefficient. This makes it challenging for users to quickly identify the most important results, especially when dealing with large datasets.</p>
<p>Another solution is ParadeDB, which pushes full-text search queries down to Tantivy for results. It supports BM25 scoring and complex query patterns like negative terms, aiming to be a complete replacement for ElasticSearch. However, it uses its own unique syntax for filtering and querying and delegates filtering operations to Tantivy instead of relying on Postgres directly. Its implementation requires several hooks into Postgres' query planning and storage, potentially leading to compatibility issues.</p>
<p>In contrast, VectorChord-BM25 takes a different approach. It focuses exclusively on bringing BM25 ranking to PostgreSQL in a lightweight and native way. We implemented the BM25 ranking algorithm and the Block WeakAnd technique from scratch, building it as a custom operator and index (similar to <code>pgvector</code>) to accelerate queries. Designed to be intuitive and efficient, VectorChord-BM25 <strong>provides a seamless API for enhanced full-text search and ranking, all while staying fully integrated with PostgreSQL’s ecosystem</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="heading-vectorchord-bm25">VectorChord-BM25</h2>
<p>Our implementation introduces a novel approach by developing the BM25 index and search algorithm from the ground up, while seamlessly integrating with PostgreSQL’s existing development interfaces to ensure maximum compatibility.</p>
<p>Inspired by the PISA engine, Tantivy, and Lucene, we incorporated the BlockMax WeakAnd algorithm to facilitate efficient score-based filtering and ranking. Furthermore, we employ bitpacking for ID compression to enhance overall efficiency and re-implemented a user data-based tokenizer to more closely align with ElasticSearch’s performance.</p>
<p>The table below compares the <strong>Top1000 Queries Per Second (QPS)</strong>—a metric that measures how many queries a system can process per second while retrieving the top 1000 results for each query—between our implementation and ElasticSearch across various datasets from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/xhluca/bm25-benchmarks">bm25-benchmarks</a>:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740189817247/5a81c020-1aa2-452d-8e8d-b9653c5b3489.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>On average, our implementation achieves <strong>3 times higher QPS</strong> compared to ElasticSearch across the tested datasets, showcasing its efficiency and scalability. However, speed alone isn’t sufficient—we also prioritize accuracy. To ensure relevance, we evaluated <strong>NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 10)</strong>, a key metric for assessing ranking quality.</p>
<div data-node-type="callout">
<p>💡</p>
<p><strong>NDCG@10</strong> (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at rank 10) is a metric that assesses the relevance of documents within the top 10 positions of a ranked list. It emphasizes not only the relevance of each document but also its position, ensuring higher-ranked relevant documents contribute more to the overall score.</p>
</div>

<p>The table below compares the NDCG@10 scores between VectorChord-BM25 and ElasticSearch across various datasets:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1740190423528/10f75122-34fc-4fa2-bb66-3e26e09516ec.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>We have dedicated substantial effort to align VectorChord-BM25 with ElasticSearch’s behavior, ensuring a fair and precise comparison. As demonstrated in the table, our implementation achieves NDCG@10 scores that are comparable across most datasets, with certain cases even surpassing ElasticSearch (e.g., trec-covid and scifact).</p>
<p>We’ll share the technical details of our alignment efforts in a later section, including how we addressed tokenization, scoring, and other critical components to achieve these results. Before that, let’s explore how to use VectorChord-BM25 in PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2 id="heading-quick-start">Quick start</h2>
<p>To get started with VectorChord-BM25, we’ve put together a detailed guide in our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord-bm25/">GitHub README</a> that walks you through the installation and configuration process. Below, you’ll find a complete example showing how to use VectorChord-BM25 for BM25 full-text search in Postgres. Each SQL snippet comes with a clear explanation of what it does and why it’s useful.</p>
<p>The extension consists of three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tokenizer</strong>: Converts text into a bm25vector, which is similar to a sparse vector that stores vocabulary IDs and their frequencies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>bm25vector</strong>: Represents the tokenized text in a format suitable for BM25 scoring.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>bm25vector Index</strong>: Speeds up the search and ranking process, making it more efficient.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to tokenize some text, you can use the <code>tokenize</code> function. It takes two arguments: the text you want to tokenize and the name of the tokenizer.</p>
<pre><code><span>-- tokenize text with bert tokenizer</span>
<span>SELECT</span> tokenize(<span>'A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'</span>, <span>'Bert'</span>);
<span>-- Output: {2474:1, 2829:1, 3899:1, 4248:1, 4419:1, 5376:1, 5831:1}</span>
<span>-- The output is a bm25vector, 2474:1 means the word with id 2474 appears once in the text.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>One unique aspect of the BM25 score is that it relies on a global document frequency. This means the score of a word in a document is influenced by how frequently that word appears across all documents in the set. To calculate the BM25 score between a bm25vector and a query, you’ll first need a document set. Once that’s in place, you can use the <code>&lt;&amp;&gt;</code> operator to perform the calculation.</p>
<p>Here is an example step by step. First, create a table and insert some documents:</p>
<pre><code><span>-- Setup the document table</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> documents (
    <span>id</span> <span>SERIAL</span> PRIMARY <span>KEY</span>,
    passage <span>TEXT</span>,
    embedding bm25vector
);

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> documents (passage) <span>VALUES</span>
(<span>'PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It has over 15 years of active development.'</span>),
(<span>'Full-text search is a technique for searching in plain-text documents or textual database fields. PostgreSQL supports this with tsvector.'</span>),
...
(<span>'Effective search ranking algorithms, such as BM25, improve search results by understanding relevance.'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Then tokenize it</p>
<pre><code><span>UPDATE</span> documents <span>SET</span> embedding = tokenize(passage, <span>'Bert'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Create the index on the bm25vector column so that we can collect the global document frequency.</p>
<pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> documents_embedding_bm25 <span>ON</span> documents <span>USING</span> bm25 (embedding bm25_ops);
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can compute the BM25 score between the query and the vectors. It’s worth noting that the BM25 score is negative—this is by design. A higher (less negative) score indicates a more relevant document. We intentionally made the score negative so that you can use the default <code>ORDER BY</code> clause to easily retrieve the most relevant documents first.</p>
<pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>, passage, embedding &lt;&amp;&gt; to_bm25query(<span>'documents_embedding_bm25'</span>, <span>'PostgreSQL'</span>, <span>'Bert'</span>) <span>AS</span> <span>rank</span>
<span>FROM</span> documents
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>rank</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span>;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="heading-other-tokenizers">Other Tokenizers</h3>
<p>In addition to BERT, VectorChord-BM25 also supports <code>Tocken</code> and <code>Unicode</code> Tokenizers. <code>Tocken</code> is a Unicode tokenizer pre-trained on the <code>wiki-103-raw</code> dataset with a minimum frequency (<code>min_freq</code>) of 10. Since it’s a pre-trained tokenizer, you can use it similarly to BERT.</p>
<pre><code><span>SELECT</span> tokenize(<span>'A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'</span>, <span>'Tocken'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><code>Unicode</code> is a tokenizer that builds a vocabulary list from your data, similar to the standard behavior in Elasticsearch and other full-text search engines. To enable this, you need to create a specific one for your data using <code>create_unicode_tokenizer_and_trigger(vocab_list_name, table_name, source_text_column, tokenized_vec_column)</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> documents (<span>id</span> <span>SERIAL</span>, <span>text</span> <span>TEXT</span>, embedding bm25vector);
<span>SELECT</span> create_unicode_tokenizer_and_trigger(<span>'test_token'</span>, <span>'documents'</span>, <span>'text'</span>, <span>'embedding'</span>);

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> documents (<span>text</span>) <span>VALUES</span> (<span>'PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system.'</span>);
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> documents_embedding_bm25 <span>ON</span> documents <span>USING</span> bm25 (embedding bm25_ops);
<span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>, <span>text</span>, embedding &lt;&amp;&gt; to_bm25query(<span>'documents_embedding_bm25'</span>, <span>'PostgreSQL'</span>, <span>'test_token'</span>) <span>AS</span> <span>rank</span>
    <span>FROM</span> documents
    <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>rank</span>
    <span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span>;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="heading-faster-than-elasticsearch-really">Faster than ElasticSearch (Really?)</h2>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgflip.com/6b4xz9.jpg" alt="math Memes &amp; GIFs - Imgflip"></p>
<p>To ensure our new plugin provides meaningful and relevant results—not just faster performance—we rigorously evaluated VectorChord-BM25 using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/xhluca/bm25-benchmarks">bm25-benchmarks</a>. We leveraged the widely recognized BEIR benchmark for information retrieval, focusing on two key metrics: <strong>QPS (Queries Per Second)</strong> to measure speed and <strong>NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 10)</strong> to assess relevance and ranking accuracy.</p>
<p>In our initial version, we were thrilled to see our system achieve <strong>3-5 times higher QPS</strong> compared to ElasticSearch. However, we also noticed that on certain datasets, our NDCG@10 scores were significantly lower than ElasticSearch’s. After a thorough analysis, we realized these gaps weren’t caused by our indexing implementation but rather by differences in tokenization approaches.</p>
<p>To address this, we invested considerable effort to align our tokenization process with ElasticSearch’s, ensuring a more accurate and fair comparison.</p>
<h3 id="heading-issue-1-stopword-list">Issue 1: Stopword List</h3>
<div data-node-type="callout">
<p>💡</p>
<p>A <strong>stopword</strong> is a common word filtered out during text processing because it adds little meaning—for example, words like "the," "is," and "at."</p>
</div>

<p>ElasticSearch defaults to using Lucene’s Standard Tokenizer, which relies on a relatively short stopword list. In contrast, our initial implementation utilized NLTK’s much more comprehensive stopword list. As a result, ElasticSearch’s searches include certain stopwords, leading to longer inverted index lists that require additional scanning time—ultimately impacting performance.</p>
<h3 id="heading-issue-2-stemming">Issue 2: Stemming</h3>
<div data-node-type="callout">
<p>💡</p>
<p>A <strong>stemmer</strong> reduces words to their base form, "running" and "ran" both become "run."</p>
</div>

<p>We initially used the <strong>snowball stemmer</strong> from the rust-stemmer library to handle word variations, but we observed discrepancies compared to ElasticSearch’s implementation. Upon investigation, we discovered that the rust-stemmer’s version of snowball was outdated. Following the guidelines from the official snowball repository, we regenerated the files using the latest version.</p>
<p>When we aligned both the <strong>stopword list</strong> and <strong>stemmer</strong> between our system and ElasticSearch, our performance advantage decreased from <strong>300% to 40%</strong>. Even so, on three datasets—nq, fever, and climate-fever—a noticeable performance gap persisted. A deeper comparison revealed a subtle but critical detail: in the bm25-benchmark, ElasticSearch preprocesses data differently from other frameworks, which contributed to the remaining discrepancy.</p>
<h3 id="heading-issue-3-data-preprocessing">Issue 3: Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p>In the BEIR dataset, each document includes both a title and a text field. While most frameworks concatenate these fields into a single string for indexing, ElasticSearch accepts JSON input and indexes the title and text separately. During querying, ElasticSearch performs a multi_match operation, searching both fields independently and combining their scores (using the higher score plus 0.5 times the lower score). This approach yields significantly better NDCG@10 results but requires searching two separate indexes, which can substantially impact performance.</p>
<p>To ensure a fair comparison, we re-ran our ElasticSearch tests by concatenating the title and text fields. With this adjustment, VectorChord-BM25 was able to match ElasticSearch’s results. Interestingly, ElasticSearch’s <strong>QPS (geometric mean)</strong> increased from <strong>135 to 341</strong> when using concatenated fields, making it <strong>25% faster</strong> than VectorChord-BM25’s <strong>271.91 QPS</strong> in Top10 query tests. However, in Top1000 tests, VectorChord-BM25 achieved a QPS of <strong>112</strong> compared to ElasticSearch’s <strong>49</strong>—making our implementation <strong>2.26 times faster</strong>.</p>
<p>This experience highlights the challenges of conducting fair performance comparisons between different BM25 full-text search implementations. The <strong>tokenizer</strong> is an exceptionally complex and influential component, and ElasticSearch’s intricate default settings add another layer of complexity to the evaluation process.</p>
<h2 id="heading-future">Future</h2>
<p>We’re still in the early stages of this project, and we’ve already pinpointed several areas for performance optimization. Tokenization is an inherently complex process—even for English, we face numerous decisions and trade-offs. Our next step is to <strong>fully decouple the tokenization process</strong>, transforming it into an independent and extensible extension. This will enable us to support multiple languages, allow users to customize tokenization for better results, and even incorporate advanced features like synonym handling.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to empower users to perform <strong>high-quality, relevance-based full-text searches</strong> on PostgreSQL with ease. Combined with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord/"><strong>VectorChord</strong></a>, we aim to deliver a <strong>first-class data infrastructure for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong>. After all, choosing PostgreSQL is always a solid decision!</p>

<p>Thomas Ptacek, a friend and expert witness in this lawsuit summed it up best in the court's hallway while walking within three feet of opposing counsel: <em>"This is fucking stupid"</em>.</p>

<p>His <a href="https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2025/02/09/fixing-illinois-foia/">companion post</a> explains why.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Working with the City of Chicago's parking ticket data—which I've<a href="https://mchap.io/using-foia-data-and-unix-to-halve-major-source-of-parking-tickets.html"> received through FOIA</a>—has always been a pain, especially in terms of knowing what exactly to request. In August 2018, I attempted to generally solve that problem, by submitting a request for the following:</p>

<pre><code><em>An index of the tables and columns within each table of CANVAS.
Please include the column data type as well.

Per the <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/dps/ContractAdministration/Specs/2011/Spec92488II.pdf">CANVAS specification</a>, the database in question is Oracle, 
so the below SQL query will likely yield the records pursuant to this request:

select utc.column_name as colname, uo.object_name as tablename, utc.data_type as type
from user_objects uo
join user_tab_columns utc on uo.object_name = utc.table_name
where uo.object_type = 'TABLE'
</em></code></pre>

<p>—<a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/canvas-database-schema-60175/"><i>CANVAS Database Schema request on Muckrock</i></a></p>

<p>After the City initially denied the request with an argument that the records' release would compromise network security, I took the denial to court where we initially won at-trial. The City then appealed, which we won as well. The case ultimately went up to the Illinois Supreme Court, where we lost unanimously. Better Government Association did a <a href="https://www.bettergov.org/2023/05/19/better-government-association-statement-supreme-court-foia-ruling-limits-transparency-significantly-broadens-exemptions-to-foia/">good explainer </a>of the consequences of that loss, which boils down to a significant broadening of public agencies' leeway to apply exemptions (i.e., withhold records or redact information) in response to FOIA requests. </p>

<h2>Why Go Through All of This?</h2>

<p>Under Illinois FOIA case law, if a request's responsive documents—the set of records or information within the scope of that request—are stored in a queryable database, a query must be written. The requester is not required to write the query. The law even requires the agency to give you the data in a format of your choice (protip: "excel format"). When it works, it's freaking great. Reality makes it difficult for a number of reasons, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>The FOIA officer will likely need to defer any querying to a colleague who is a "data person."</li>
<li>You can't just ask a question:<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/?q=%22does+not+compel+the+agency+to+provide%22">"FOIA does not compel the agency to provide answers to questions posed by the inquirer."</a></li>
<li>From the requester's perspective, "Is X column requestable?" isn't answerable without first attempting to request that column's data.</li>
<li>Requesting too many columns will likely lead to time-consuming back-and-forth, or a flat-out denial.</li>
<li>Even though Illinois FOIA requires that a requester be given a chance to narrow their request, FOIA officers sometimes just stop responding during this "conferral" process.</li>
</ul>

<p>To generally work through this problem, many folk will spend hours surfing through PDFs, reports, contracts, work products, etc, just to get a sense of what data might exist. This process is frustrating and often yields incomplete results.  Let's walk through my attempt with CANVAS.

</p><h2>First Attempts for Parking Ticket Data</h2>

<p>My <em><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25548155-first-foia/">very first</a></em> FOIA request was pretty narrow and sought the City's towing data. The City was unable to get me what I requested for reasons I can't seem to find, but it painted a picture that the Chicago doesn't <em>really</em> track how cars are towed. </p>

<p>A month later, the project began shifting towards parking ticket data in addition to towing data, so I <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25546093-1029-001/">requested:</a></p> 

<pre><code><em>all raw towing and parking violation records available in the CANVAS system and any records that are from imported/interpolated from non-CANVAS systems.</em></code></pre> 

<p>This request was denied. The Department of Finance argued that the request would take anywhere between 280 to 400 hours to complete:</p>

<pre><code><em>There are 55 million ticket records and 928K seizure records in CANVAS. As far as tow information, we only have knowledge of when a vehicle is towed due to a boot and released. The Department of Finance's application support vender estimates a minimum of 60-80 hours to design/develop/test and run the program.

In addition, since this is like a conversion to another system, we are not sure how long it would take to transfer so much data, a rough estimate would be an additional 80-120 hours to design a solution to get all the data on some kind of media for retrieval. Compliance with this request as currently written would take approximately 140-200 hours utilizing our vendor's resources to the exclusion of other work assignments.</em></code></pre>

<p>A couple months and some phone calls later, I submitted a narrower request, which was successfully fulfilled, because I included an explicit list of fields. After honing the request language a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25548154-foia-request-data/">a bit more</a>, I was eventually able to get the data used in the analysis of my <a href="https://mchap.io/using-foia-data-and-unix-to-halve-major-source-of-parking-tickets.html">first blog post.</a></p>

<h2> But Wait, Is There More?</h2>


<p>Despite getting the limited information I had requested, I still wanted to expand my analysis, which required knowing what other information exists within CANVAS. So, I submitted <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25546081-matt-chapman-canvas-information-foia-response-1/">another request</a> for high-level and low-level system information: 

</p><pre><code><em>
1. Code for CANVAS
2. Logs of CANVAS and/or CANVAS log analysis. 
3. Documentation for the operation of CANVAS, including how information is stored, what kind of database is used, along with any other technical documentation or generic documentation.
4. Any Wiki page related to CANVAS.
5. Any analysis of City parking ticket levels or trends.</em></code></pre><p>

The only records the City sent in response was a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25546082-matt-chapman-canvas-information-foia-document-1/">lackluster spreadsheet</a> with just 100 rows, broken down by ward. I'm still not sure if this was the only analysis <i>ever</i> done at the time, but let's get back to the meat of this blog post.

</p><p>1, 2, and 3 were denied because:

</p><pre><code><em>[The records] could be used in a security breach against CANVAS and jeopardize the security of the system, therefore it is being withheld.</em></code></pre>

<p>But with the goal of just figuring out what information exists, the request was extremely wide and could have been narrowed to something more akin to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dictionary">"data dictionary"</a>. To this day, I've never been able to get anything like a data dictionary from the City, though there <i>is</i> a contractual obligation—<a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/CANVAS/sbf2-65yk/data_preview">as described in the RFP spec for this $200 million system</a>—for the City to maintain something like that! But alas, at least in 2018, <a href="https://www.rpubs.com/argdata/420073">the City claimed</a> they don't have anything like it.

<h2>Requesting Database Records from All City Databases</h2>

<p>Sensing a pattern of a general failure to maintain data dictionaries, <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2013/october_2013/mayor_rahm_emanuelandthedepartmentofinnovationandtechnologylaunc.html">despite the City's public support for launching one</a>, I submitted a FOIA request to every City agency for the following: 

</p><pre><code><em>1. A short description of the database.
2. The names of the applications that are able to run queries/inserts.
3. All usernames and permissions
4. All database table names.
5. All column names in each table.
6. A description of each column.
7. Number of rows in each table.</em></code></pre>

<p>A couple weeks later, Chicago's Department of Law sent me <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25546087-database-foia-request-021315/">a letter on behalf of every agency</a> and denied all parts, 1 through 7, of that request. 

</p><p>First, they argued that they would need to "create a new document":</p>
<pre><code><em>First, no City Department is in possession of a document which contains the information you seek. The only way to compile the requested information, to the extent it is not exempt for one or more of the reasons noted below, would be to create a document.</em></code></pre>

<p>Then, they requested a pedantic clarification about what "database" means:</p>
<pre><code><em>Your request does not provide a definition of the term database. A commonly accepted definition of "database" is collection of pieces of information that is organized and used on a computer. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/database. Such a broad definition would include Excel spreadsheets. It would be unduly burdensome to the operations of each of the City's Departments to search every computer in use by its personnel in order to identify, open,review and catalogue each database and every Excel spreadsheet in the manner you request."</em></code></pre><p>

But even with all of that, they offered a helpful suggestion, and pointed to the City's "data dictionary":

</p><pre><code><em>Please note that in late 2013, the City of Chicago launched a publically available Data Dictionary which can be found at http://datadictionary.cityofchicago.org/. It is described as “a resource for anyone who is interested in understanding what data is held by City agencies and departments, how and if it may be accessed, and in what formats it may be accessed.”</em></code></pre><p>

Cool! It's a damn shame the system shutdown less than a year later, though.

</p><h2>"Metalicious": Chicago's Failed Data Dictionary</h2>
<p>A lot of government agencies have absolutely recognized the problem of the public not knowing what information exists, including Chicago. One such attempt at fixing this problem is to voluntarily make the columns and table names of their databases open to the public, like the Department of Justice's <a href="https://www.justice.gov/afp/media/1186431/dl?inline=">PDFs of table names, column names, and descriptions of both.</a>. There's even an <a href="https://resources.data.gov/">open specification</a> for government database schemas!</p><p>But even with agencies voluntarily making schema information public, such releases are effectively discretionary and are outside of the realm of FOIA.</p>

<p>One such release of discretionary information, as the Department of Law mentioned in their denial letter, is the 2013-released city-wide data dictionary project called "Metalicious". That's the actual name.</p>

<p>Metalicious was funded by a $300,000 John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation grant to UChicago's Chapin Hall, with the intended purpose of making table names, column names and descriptions of both publicly accessible. It's the City's "data dictionary".

</p><center><p><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/internet_archive_metalicious.png" alt="CANVAS!" title=""></p>

<em>Schema information of the Chicago Budget System on Metalicious (2016)</em></center>

<p>An example of a system whose database schema information is released was the Chicago Budget System (CBS). A total of 110 tables are listed, with descriptions and a link to each table's columns. An interesting table worth investigation on its own is, <code>BOOK_ALDERMANIC_PAYRATE</code>, which is described as, "data used for creating pay schedule for aldermanic staff published in the Budget Book". Good to know!</p><p>

Metalicious received <a href="https://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/city-of-chicago-launches-the-first-comprehensive-public-municipal-data-dictionary/">some attention</a> in civic data circles:</p>

<pre><code><em>Journalists and civic inquisitors can use it to determine what information is available when composing Freedom of Information Act requests. Based on my own experience, knowing what to even ask for has been a challenge. <strong>All that is over.</strong></em></code></pre>



<h2>All That Is Over: Its Inevitable Shutdown</h2>

<p>Within a few short years, the project ostensibly shut down and its front page was replaced with a message about being down for "temporary maintenance". That temporary maintenance has been ongoing for about nine years now. </p>

<center><p><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/data_dictionary_temporary_maintenance.png" alt="Down For Maintenance" title=""></p></center>


<p>Back in 2018, I asked the City's now-former Chief Data Officer Tom Schenk why it was shut down, and he explained:</p>

<p><code><pre><em>Metalicious was retired because of lack of resources to expand it (originally grant funded). It had some, but very, very small proportion of databases. There was security review of any published data and some information was withheld if we felt it could undermine the application security. By Info Sec policy, it is confidential information until a review deems it appropriate for public release--same as the open data workflow which mirrors the FOIA workflow.</em></pre></code></p><p>RIP.</p>

<h2>Requesting Metalicious</h2>

<p>Okay, that's not surprising, but since the first goal here was to figure out whether column and table names are requestable, I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190515215522/https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doit/provdrs/data_sciences.html">submitted my request for the MySQL dump of Metalicious</a>. As these things go, that request was also denied:</p>

<pre><code><em>Please be advised the Department of Innovation and Technology neither maintains nor possesses any records that are responsive to your FOIA request.</em></code></pre>

<p>So, I submitted another request and was sure to included a quote from a<a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2013/october_2013/mayor_rahm_emanuelandthedepartmentofinnovationandtechnologylaunc.html"> press release that was explicit about the Department's ownership of Metalicious.</a> 

</p><p>They eventually sent me a copy of a MySQL dump with about 150 databases' columns and table names, including their descriptions. Neat! Progress!</p>

<p>To me, this reasonably shows that the City <em>can</em> provide table names and column names of City databases under IL FOIA.</p>

<h2>The CANVAS Request and Trial</h2>

<p>This brings us back to the FOIA request for the CANVAS database schema, which was twice appealed and died at the Illinois Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The request included a SQL statement for the City to run in order to fulfil the request. I made some small mistakes that bit me later, which is ripe for another whole post. Essentially, the City denied the request by arguing that the release of this information would jeopardize the security of Chicago's systems:</p>

<pre><code><em>Your request seeks a copy of tables or columns within each table of CANVAS. The dissemination of these pieces of network information could jeopardize the security of the systems of the City of Chicago.  Please be advised that even if you were to narrow your request, certain records may be withheld from disclosure under the exemptions enumerated in the FOIA, including but not limited to the exemption set forthin 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(o).</em></code></pre>

<p>I disagree wholeheartedly and Thomas Ptacek goes into more detail in his <a href="https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2025/02/09/fixing-illinois-foia/">companion post.</a></p>


<p>Upon recieving this denial, I reached out to my attorneys at <a href="https://www.loevy.com/">Loevy &amp; Loevy</a> who agreed to sue.</p>


<h2>"Civic Hacker"</h2>

<p>Eventually there was a trial in January 2020. During the trial, the City's attorneys argued that my intent was nefarious:</p>

<pre><code><em>They are seeking the ability to have information that helps Mr. Chapman, civic hacker, go into the system and manipulate the data for whatever means he sees fit. That is not something that FOIA requires the City to do.</em></code></pre>

<p>I have no idea where they came up with the idea that I wanted to manipulate their data, especially considering that just four months earlier, I was asked to help the City with parking ticket reform. </p>

<p>While we were waiting for the trial date, Kate LeFurgy, Director of Comms for the Office of the Mayor, reached out to me and asked if I could help with some parking ticket analysis (for free). I agreed, and compiled a spreadsheet detailing how a large number of vehicles received a disproportionate number of tickets—groupings that highlight, for example, one vehicle which received at least three tickets per week for 41 continuous weeks.</p>

<pre><code><em>This is incredible. I can't thank you enough as to how helpful this was. I truly appreciate your time and talents on this work. It has been invaluable in shaping the reform measures we hope to put in place later this year.
-Kate LeFurgy | Fri, Aug 23, 2019</em></code></pre>

<p>Those good spirits did not last long, and LeFurgy did not respond to my emails asking for thoughts on the CANVAS litigation.</p>


<h2>Privacy When It's Convenient</h2>


<p>Chicago's expert witness, Bruce Coffing, said in court:</p>

<pre><code><em>In this particular case we are saying, I'm saying that from defending this, our constituents' information, their private information, one of the things that helps us defend that system is not making this [schema information] available.

It is not the only thing we do. We do many things. But I don't want to make it easier for the bad guys and bad gals out there to attack our system and let— put our constituents' private data at risk.</em></code></pre>

<p>This argument is striking to me, because the City has already shared so much private data through FOIA.</p>

<p>For instance, in 2018, when I requested parking ticket data from the Department of Finance, their FOIA officer told me that they could not include both license plates <em>and</em>the vehicles' registered address. To resolve this issue, they offered to remove license plate data and only provide addresses.</p>

<p>However, they had <em>already</em> given me the license plate data of millions of ticketed vehicles, in response to a different, earlier FOIA request. So, I received registered home addresses from one request, and license plates from another.</p>

<p>The responsive records from these two separate FOIA requests can easily be paired.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the extent of this problem, I <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/026992341cc47ff0">created this visualization</a> which shows the scale of private information disclosed by the Department of Finance: vehicle addresses from every U.S. state, including 11,057 unique addresses of Texas vehicles and 48,707 from Michigan.</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/tickets_address_observable.png" title=""></center>

<p>I've been told by a reliable source that the Department of Finance no longer sends license plates nor registered addresses in response to FOIA requests.</p>


<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>The whole point of this entire thing was to make it easier to request data through FOIA. Ultimately, the goal is to simply send a SQL statement to an agency for them to run, and avoid so much of the usual nonsense. Basically, an API.</p>

<p>Relatedly, these <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=2640&amp;GAID=17&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;LegID=150940&amp;SessionID=112&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session=&amp;GA=103">two</a> <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3076">bills</a> from last year were interesting, and sought to fix the IL Supreme Court's bad decision. But they didn't go anywhere during last year's session.</p>

<p>Fortunately this year, a <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=226&amp;GAID=18&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;LegId=157537&amp;SessionID=114&amp;GA=104">new bill</a> was filed with the addition of this language:</p>

<p><code><em><pre>[...] and shall include the identification and a plain-text description of each of the types or categories of information of each field of each database of the public body. [...] and shall provide a sufficient description of the structures of all databases under the control of the public body to allow a requester to request the public body to perform specific database queries.</pre></em></code>

That's pretty neat! I hope it passes.

	<div>
		
<p>Today, President Trump announced that the US Government would begin using taxpayer dollars to systematically buy up a variety of cryptocurrencies. Crypto prices shot up on the news.</p>



<p>This is revealing, as crypto boosters have argued for years that cryptocurrency has legitimate economic value as a payment system outside of the government’s purview.</p>



<p>Instead, those same crypto boosters are now tapping the White House for money — in US Dollars, coming from US taxpayers.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Crypto has been one of the biggest speculative bubbles of all time, maybe the single biggest ever. Millions of retail investors have piled into crypto assets in the hope and expectation that prices will continue to go up. (Notice how much of the chatter around crypto is always around prices, as opposed to non-speculative uses.)</p>



<p>However, every bubble bursts once it runs out of gamblers to put new money in, and it may be that the crypto community believes that that time is near for crypto, as they are now turning to the biggest buyer in the world — the US Government — for help.</p>



<p>This shows that all the claims that crypto leaders have made for years about crypto’s value as a currency outside of government control have been self-serving lies all along: the people who have most prominently argued that position are now begging the White House to hand them USD for their crypto.</p>



<p>It also reveals how much crypto has turned into a cancer on our entire society.</p>



<p>In previous Ponzi schemes, the government has often stepped in to defuse bubbles and protect retail investors from being taken in by scammers.</p>



<p>But in this wave, not only has the government not stepped in to stop the scam, it has now been captured by people with a vested interest in keeping it going as long as possible.</p>



<p>Our president and a number of members of his inner circles hold large amounts of cryptocurrency and have a vested interested in seeing its value rise — Trump’s personal memecoin being a particularly notable example. And many other people in the corridors of power in Washington and Silicon Valley are in the same boat. “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it”, and so some of the most prominent people in the country are now prepared to make any argument and implement any policy decision to boost the value of their crypto holdings.</p>



<p>How does this end?</p>



<p>Once the US taxpayer is tapped out, there’s not going to be any remaining larger pool of demand to keep crypto prices up, and in every previous speculative bubble, once confidence evaporates, prices will fall, probably precipitously. Unfortunately, as millions of people now have significant crypto holdings, and stablecoins have entangled crypto with fiat currency, the damage to the economy may be widespread. </p>



<p>The end of the crypto frenzy would, in the end, be a good thing. Cryptocurrency has a few legitimate uses, like helping citizens of repressive regimes avoid currency controls and reducing fees on remittances. But it has also enabled vast evil in the world. Diverting trillions of dollars away from productive investments into gambling is bad enough, but the untraceability of crypto has also enabled terrorist organizations, criminal networks, and rogue states like North Korea to fund themselves far more effectively than ever before. I’ve been hearing from my friends in the finance world that North Korea now generates a significant fraction, if not a majority, of its revenues by running crypto scams on Westerners, and that the scale of scams overall has grown by a factor of 10 since crypto became widely used (why do you think you’re getting so many calls and texts from scammers lately?)</p>



<p>I hope that the end of this frenzy of gambling and fraud comes soon. But in the meantime, let’s hope that not too much of our tax money goes to paying the scammers, and that when the collapse comes it doesn’t take down our entire economy with it.</p>

<p>As part of my work toward an upcoming post about a lost piece of very obscure Mac history that has finally been found, I’ve been playing around with old Apple-branded SCSI hard drives made by Quantum and Conner in the 1990s. What I’m about to describe is already common knowledge in the vintage computing world, but I thought it would be fun to share my take on it anyway.</p>



<p>What I’m talking about is how a lot of these hard drives just refuse to work anymore. This is very common with old Quantum ProDrive models, like the LPS or the ELS. The drive spins up, you don’t hear the expected pattern of click sounds at startup, and then after a few seconds, it spins back down.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>This Conner CP30175E drive has a similar problem, but it tries over and over again, playing a tone through the voice coil (I think) in between attempts.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Conner CP30175E hard drive doesn't stay spun up" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7pvs6h2LH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>These particular hard drives shown in the videos are both about 160 MB in capacity and were commonly used in computers during the early-to-mid 1990s. You can see they have Apple stickers, so they are definitely stock drives originally from a Mac. At least in the case of Quantum, there are a bunch of different capacities all affected by this same problem, ranging from 40 MB to 500 MB. Maybe even more than that — those are just the ones I’m aware of. I’m less familiar with Conner, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they similarly had a whole family of affected drives.</p>



<p>What’s causing this issue? Let’s open them up and find out.</p>



<p>There’s a common misconception in the computer world that as soon as you open a hard drive and expose it to a single particle of dust, you’ve completely destroyed it and it will never work again. Now to be fair, with many modern, higher-density drives it’s probably true — <a href="https://blog.westerndigital.com/helium-hard-drives-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some of them are even sealed with helium inside</a> — but older hard drives like the ones I’ve shown above are remarkably tolerant of being opened. That’s not to say I would leave it operating without the cover for an extended period of time, but for quick data recovery purposes in a decently clean environment, it’s fine.</p>



<p>Anyway, with the cover off, let’s take a look at what the drive is doing:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Quantum ProDrive ELS hard drive doesn't stay spun up - opened" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EknKvp3aHKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The platters spin up, but the head doesn’t move at all. Here are a few attempts at gently moving the head by hand with the drive powered off, and then powering it on. Would this fix it?</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Quantum ProDrive ELS hard drive doesn't stay spun up - manually moving head" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDBxAOnHFkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nope, it didn’t. The head would always just immediately go directly back to the center. Note that I had to unlatch the head before I could move it. That’s what I was pointing out with the screwdriver. This is due to <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4647997A/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quantum’s patented technology</a> (long expired) known as AIRLOCK, which automatically keeps the head stack latched in place near the spindle until the drive spins up. The purpose is to keep the head away from actual data on the platters when the drive is powered off, in case it is jolted. I circumvented the AIRLOCK functionality to see if starting out with the head away from the center of the platters would fix the problem, but obviously as you saw in the video, it didn’t.</p>



<p>Many years ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VepkXLCH3bM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">techknight shared his solution</a> for bypassing this problem. The temporary fix ended up being to manually move the head just like I did before, but it had to be after the platters were already spinning and the latch was free. Some people have needed to manually release the latch because the airflow isn’t good enough when the cover is off. I did not experience that issue — you can see it open up on its own just before I start moving the head:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Quantum ProDrive ELS hard drive doesn't stay spun up - temporary fix" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggZEcd9VSm4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Ah yes, after the head was freed, you got to hear the familiar click pattern that Quantum hard drives make as they’re running their seek test or calibration or whatever it is. That sound is still ingrained in my head after all these years as a little “startup click” that old computers make.</p>



<p>After the drive was working properly, my <a href="https://zuluscsi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZuluSCSI</a> immediately began dumping the contents using initiator mode — a super cool feature it provides, which is also available in the <a href="https://bluescsi.com/v2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlueSCSI v2</a> firmware fork. Normally these awesome SCSI emulator products are used as hard drive replacements, but initiator mode allows you to use them to connect to a physical drive (even a CD-ROM drive) and save the contents to an SD card — great for software preservation purposes!</p>



<p>Back to the “spinning up and right back down” problem, though: what causes it? Why did I have to manually move the head in order to make the drive start working? At the time of techknight’s video, the underlying cause wasn’t as well-known as it is now, but the culprit is a rubber bumper that slowly disintegrates into goo over the years. There are actually two bumpers that both get sticky — one at each extent of the head’s movement. The really troublesome bumper is the one that the head rests against while parked, toward the center of the platter. The other one prevents the head from falling off the outer edge of the platter.</p>



<p>The voice coil motor controlling the head isn’t strong enough to overcome this sticky rubber, so the head just sits there until the drive’s firmware gives up on trying and spins the platter down.</p>



<p>On some older Quantum drives, both of the rubber bumpers can easily be reached by removing the top magnet that is over the head, so theoretically you could replace them with new rubber tubing with the correct inner and outer diameter. On “newer” drives like this one, only the outer bumper is accessible by removing the magnet, which isn’t much help because that’s not the bumper that causes the problem.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper1-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper1-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper1-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper1-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper1-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Instead, the problematic bumper that the head sticks to while parked is actually under the platter, making replacement much less feasible. Here’s a view from my endoscope:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper2.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="614" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper2-1024x614.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper2-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper2-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper2-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bumper2.jpg 1415w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>At the top of the image is the platter. The bottom is the hard drive enclosure. On the right side, you can see the head resting against the bumper. I stuck some Kapton tape in there while I was playing with it and had the platter off, so that’s what the orange color is. Note that I switched to a different single-platter ProDrive LPS model for those last two pictures, but it has the exact same arrangement internally as the drive shown in the videos.</p>



<p>There is one solution readily available on eBay: a plastic insert that prevents the head from hitting the bumper. I don’t have any experience with this fix, but it has a bunch of positive reviews. You can find it by searching eBay for “Quantum ProDrive ELS Repair Insert”. If you’re looking for a long-term solution, that might be the way to go. It’s theoretically possible to remove the platter(s) to get to the bumper and replace it, but it’s a lot of work and very risky — especially on multi-platter drives where the platters have to stay in alignment with each other.</p>



<p>If your ultimate goal is just to get the data off of the drive, I have had a bunch of success with the simple method I showed of manually unsticking the head after the drive is totally spun up. Thanks to techknight for originally posting his very helpful video on this process!</p>



<p>Next, let’s move onto the Conner drive. There is not quite as much information on the internet about these. How did it behave with the cover removed?</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Conner CP30175E hard drive doesn't stay spun up - fix attempts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/66oSObJO7FA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I jumped the gun a bit in the video by not showing how it behaves without any intervention from my hand, but it’s the same problem. The head doesn’t move at all. I tried manually moving the head in the same way I was able to get the Quantum drive working, but the Conner drive just didn’t want to cooperate with me. Here’s a closer view where you can see the problem. First, here’s how it looks with the head parked:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerParked.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="578" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerParked-1024x578.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerParked-1024x578.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerParked-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerParked-768x434.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerParked-1536x867.jpg 1536w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerParked.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>And here’s how it looks after I move the head toward the outside of the platter, away from the parked position:</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s supposed to be an indentation in the dark piece where the head assembly touches it. It seems to be grabbing fairly tightly and preventing the head from moving away. The grip seems pretty strong here, though — I get the feeling this drive may be using another mechanism for intentionally keeping the head parked when it wants to, like something magnetic. I’m not 100% sure. I’m pretty sure that either way, the hole in the dark piece is not supposed to be there, though.</p>



<p>On this Conner drive, I was running out of ideas. It’s not mine — someone very kindly loaned it to me with a “no worries, it doesn’t work anyway” type of reassurance that I could tinker with it and try to recover data from it as part of my search. I was really desperate to inspect the data on it because it came from a Mac model that I knew could potentially contain the lost software I was looking for, but I just couldn’t get it to work.</p>



<p>I was about to give up and send it back, but then I randomly decided to hold a folded-over piece of Kapton tape in the way so that the head couldn’t move all the way back to the position where it would get stuck. This was the magic solution I needed in order to get this drive operational. As soon as I did that and powered it on, the drive performed its startup click pattern and then the ZuluSCSI immediately began dumping the drive:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I think this Conner drive is simply more picky about the timing of unsticking the head. I’m still performing essentially the same temporary fix that works with the Quantum drive, but I’m physically holding it back from ever getting stuck. Due to the way the platters stick up on this model, I was too afraid to put the cover back on right away, so I allowed the entire drive to dump with the cover removed. All the data read back perfectly.</p>



<p>I believe I have figured out somewhat of a permanent fix for this drive by adhering a piece of Kapton tape as shown below:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerKaptonTape.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="551" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerKaptonTape.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerKaptonTape.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerKaptonTape-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ConnerKaptonTape-768x413.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>To be honest, after all of the research I’ve done for this post, I’m concerned that this solution may be leaving the head in a vulnerable position when everything is powered off. When the platter spins down, the head doesn’t push itself up against the tape, so it may be resting over a spot on the platter where data is actually stored. I ended up buying another identical drive with the exact same problem, so I might perform some further experimentation with alternative solutions. Maybe if I only wrap the Kapton tape around the dark thing with the indentation (is it rubber?) rather than the entire metal enclosure, the head will still park properly but not get stuck. I’m not sure.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether my fix was correct, the exciting thing about this drive is that it ended up containing the long-lost information I was looking for, so this whole project was a huge success. An upcoming post will go into detail about the Apple factory-programmed data I was able to locate and preserve. This Conner drive has since been returned to its owner, and is confirmed to still be working in the original machine it came from. So not only did I recover the lost data, but I was even able to return the drive to working order so it could be reunited with the computer it was bundled in over 30 years ago.</p>



<p>I think this is a good reminder that we shouldn’t trust hard drives for long-term storage. Even if a drive is kept in pristine condition, there are components inside that might be aging in ways you would never begin to imagine. Keep multiple backups of any important data, and make sure you copy those backups onto a newer storage medium as the decades go by and technology evolves. Don’t rely on a 30-year-old hard drive still working 30 years later.</p>



<p>Anyway, I hope this post was interesting and educational. I thought it was fun to take the cover off and see how these hard drives operate. I have used both of these data recovery strategies on multiple Quantum and Conner hard drives and have experienced a whole bunch of success. As long as the head is just stuck in the parked position and there hasn’t been anything catastrophic like a head crash, these tricks definitely work for getting your data back. Would it be smart to open up a drive that’s fully functional? Probably not. For example, I own two Apple-marked IBM drives from the same era, and they both work great, so I’m not going to open them up to check for any rubber. But if your drive isn’t working and you have nothing to lose, why not give it a shot?</p>



<p>I’ll leave you with one fun tidbit I picked up while working on these hard drives. If you’ve ever wondered about the arrangement in terms of how the data is physically stored on the platters, I think I have an answer, at least on these Quantum and Conner drives. As I dumped the entire content of a 2-platter drive, the head stack started at the outside and slowly made its way toward the center. Then, a quarter of the way through the dump, it immediately jumped all the way back to the outside of the platter and continued reading inward again. It happened again at the halfway mark and once more at 3/4. This makes total sense because there are 4 total sides that can contain data. So each platter-side contains one consecutive chunk of data on the drive, and the data is stored outside to inside. How’s that for useless trivia?</p>



<p>Stay tuned for my post about what I actually recovered from that Conner drive!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.tangled.sh/intro">https://blog.tangled.sh/intro</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43234544">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          <p><a href="https://tangled.sh/" rel="nofollow">Tangled</a> is a new social-enabled Git collaboration
platform, built on top of the <a href="https://atproto.com/" rel="nofollow">AT Protocol</a>. We
envision a place where developers have complete ownership of their code,
open source communities can freely self-govern and most importantly,
coding can be social and fun again.</p>

<p>There are several models for decentralized code collaboration platforms,
ranging from ActivityPub’s (Forgejo) federated model, to Radicle’s
entirely P2P model. Our approach attempts to be the best of both worlds
by adopting atproto—a protocol for building decentralized social
applications with a central identity.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.tangled.sh/static/img/arch.svg" alt="tangled architecture"></p>

<p>Our approach to this is the idea of “knots”. Knots are lightweight,
headless servers that enable users to host Git repositories with ease.
Knots are designed for either single or multi-tenant use which is
perfect for self-hosting on a Raspberry Pi at home, or larger
“community” servers. By default, Tangled provides managed knots where
you can host your repositories for free.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture#app-views" rel="nofollow">App View</a> at <a href="https://tangled.sh/" rel="nofollow">tangled.sh</a> acts as a
consolidated “view” into the whole network, allowing users to access,
clone and contribute to repositories hosted across different knots—completely seamlessly.</p>

<p>Tangled is still in its infancy, and we’re building out several of its
core features as we <a href="https://tangled.sh/@tangled.sh/core" rel="nofollow">dogfood it ourselves</a>. We developed these
three tenets to guide our decisions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ownership of data</li>
<li>Low barrier to entry</li>
<li>No compromise on user-experience</li>
</ol>

<p>Collaborating on code isn’t easy, and the tools and workflows we use
should feel natural and stay out of the way. Tangled’s architecture
enables common workflows to work as you’d expect, all while remaining
decentralized.</p>

<p>We believe that atproto has greatly simplfied one of the hardest parts
of social media: having your friends on it. Today, we’re rolling out
invite-only access to Tangled—join us on IRC at <code>#tangled</code> on
<a href="https://libera.chat/" rel="nofollow">libera.chat</a> and we’ll get you set up.</p>

  <p><em><span>Last updated 2:30pm 2.27.25. Please check back regularly for updates.</span></em></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Together with all of American higher education, Cornell is entering a time of significant financial uncertainty. The potential for deep cuts in federal research funding, as well as tax legislation affecting our endowment income, has now been added to existing concerns related to rapid growth and cost escalations. It is imperative that we navigate this challenging financial landscape with a shared understanding and common purpose, to continue to advance our mission, strengthen our academic community, and deepen our impact.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>To ensure that we continue to thrive in an even more complex future, we must commit, across every part of our institution, to a sustainable budget today. To that end, we are initiating strategic budgetary adjustments that preserve shared governance and accountability among our central administrative units and all colleges, schools, and divisions.</span></p><h2><span>Overview&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Effective immediately, the university is implementing a position control process for all hiring. The pause best positions us, due to the increased level of review, to carefully and with due restraint, advance only those positions that are determined to be essential at this time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>Hiring managers must work with their&nbsp;</strong></span><a href="https://hr.cornell.edu/browse-self-service/find-your-hr-rep"><span><strong>local college and unit HR representative</strong></span></a><span><strong> to discuss all hiring so that decisions can be made in alignment with college or unit needs and budget constraints.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Positions determined by deans, vice provosts, and vice presidents to be mission-critical to their unit will be advanced for further review. Staff positions will be submitted to, and evaluated by, a new central position control committee reporting to the provost. For faculty hiring, colleges will work with their deans to consult with the provost.</span></p><h2><span>Details</span></h2><h3><span>Mission critical positions</span></h3><p>Determining mission critical positions within a college or unit requires a thoughtful evaluation of roles and responsibilities, aligned with the college, unit and institution's goals and objectives.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some suggestions to guide this process:</p><ol><li><strong>Identify Core Functions:</strong> Determine the essential functions that ensure the university's primary missions of education, research, and service. These might include teaching, research, student services, administrative support, and facility management.</li><li><strong>Assess Impact:</strong> Evaluate the impact of each position on the college or unit core functions. Consider the following:<ul><li><strong>Direct Impact:</strong> Does the position directly contribute to the delivery of core services (e.g., teaching, research)?</li><li><strong>Indirect Impact:</strong> Does the position support critical operations that enable core services (e.g., IT support, maintenance)?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Alternative Solutions: </strong>can someone else do the work, can technology be used to create efficiency, etc.?</li></ol><h3><span>Positions that are posted or awaiting position review and approval</span></h3><p><span>Local college and unit human resources teams will be reviewing staff positions that are currently posted or in the position classification process to confirm they are mission critical.</span></p><h3><span>Submitting an exception to the hiring pause</span></h3><p><span><strong>Hiring managers must work with their local HR team.&nbsp;</strong>All staff hiring exceptions will be submitted by HR through the position control committee. For faculty hiring, colleges will work with their deans to consult with the provost.</span></p><h3><span>Term appointments</span></h3><p><span>Term appointments should be carefully reviewed to determine whether the needs have changed and if the work is critical to continue. No extensions of term appointments may be made without discussing with your college or unit human resources representatives.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Temporary appointments, including agency and university appointments</span></h3><p><span>Temporary appointments should be carefully reviewed to determine if the temporary need is critical to continue. If it is, first consider reassigning the work to ongoing staff whose workload may be temporarily reduced. When this is not possible and the essential work remains, the college/unit may determine that continuation of existing temporary assignments is necessary. No new temporary hires may be made, or temporary terms extended without discussing with college or unit human resources representatives.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Domestic Contractors, Independent Contractors and other contingent labor</span></h3><p><span>As with all labor needs, it is necessary to carefully review the work being performed by the contingent labor force. Based upon the outcome of that review, it may be necessary to reopen contracts and/or agreements in light of the changing work expectations, timelines and deliverables. If, after these considerations, there continues to be a need to engage a contractor or contingent labor, you will need to consult with your Dean or VP first to discuss it as mission critical to elevate through the central review process.</span></p><h3>International independent contractors</h3><p><span>We ask that you consider all of your staff availability before deciding to engage an independent contractor. If you have employees in your organization who have available time, you should consider asking them to take on this work if possible. If, after these considerations, there continues to be a need to engage a contractor, you will need to consult with your Dean or VP first to discuss it as mission critical to elevate through the central review process.</span></p><h3><span>Fixed-term employment contract through a professional employment organization (PEO)</span></h3><p><span>Fixed-term employment contracts through a PEO must be submitted through the hiring pause review process and approved as mission critical. You should first determine whether needs have changed given the current situation. You may want to look first at asking other staff to take on the work if their workload permits before deciding to request an exception to the hiring pause.</span></p><h3><span>Rescinding offers</span></h3><p><span>Each offer situation should be carefully evaluated on a case by case basis. Hiring managers should work closely with their local human resource representative to evaluate each situation, review the offer letter and consider factors that may negatively impact the individual including, but not limited to,&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>Have they notified their current employer?</span></li><li><span>Have they resigned their current position?</span></li><li><span>What is the impact on Cornell critical work if start date is delayed?&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>North Milford Valley, in western Utah, is home to dormant volcanoes, subterranean lava deposits, and smatterings of obsidian—black volcanic glass—that Paiute peoples once collected for arrowheads and jewelry. Scalding groundwater still bubbles to the surface in places. In such a landscape, you remember that the planet’s hard exterior, where we spend our entire lives, is so thin that we call it a crust. Its superheated interior, meanwhile, burns with an estimated forty-four trillion watts of power. Milford was once a lead-, silver-, and gold-mining town, but when I visited the area on a sunny spring morning a scientist named Joseph Moore was prospecting for something else: heat.</p><p>Heat mined from underground is called geothermal—“earth heat,” in ancient Greek—and can be used to produce steam, spin a turbine, and generate electricity. Until recently, humans have tended to harvest small quantities in the rare places where it surfaces, such as hot springs. Moore’s mission, as a geologist at the University of Utah and the project leader of the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (<em>FORGE</em>), is to “develop the roadmap that is needed to build geothermal reservoirs anywhere in the world.” This road is long, and much of the map remains blank. The biggest problem is drilling miles through hot rock, safely. If scientists can do that, however, next-generation geothermal power could supply clean energy for eons.</p><p>During my trip, Moore’s corps of consultants and roughnecks were drilling the fifth borehole of their experimental project. Their rig, armed with a diamond drill bit, towered like a rocket over the rural landscape; miles of solar panels and wind turbines receded into the distance. The hole, which would eventually be L-shaped, was five thousand feet deep, and the team had another five thousand to go, horizontally. But, before they could drill any farther, they needed to install a hundred-and-fifty-ton steel tube in the hole, using special heat-resistant cement to glue it into place. The tube was like a massive straw that was meant to transport hot water and steam from an artificial underground reservoir—without contaminating local groundwater or triggering earthquakes.</p><p>At 6:15 <em>P.M</em>. on May 3rd, cement had started flowing into the hole. Four hours later, part of the cement folded in on itself. The next morning, the cement supply ran out; the men had miscalculated how much they needed. This brought the three-hundred-million-dollar operation to a maddening halt. Moore, in bluejeans and a <em>FORGE</em>-branded hard hat, called his supplier. The nearest batch of suitable cement was five hundred miles away, in Bakersfield, California. The truck would not arrive until after dark.</p><p>Right now, geothermal energy meets less than one per cent of humanity’s electricity and heating needs—a puny, almost irrelevant portion. Fossil fuels <a data-offer-url="https://www.eesi.org/topics/fossil-fuels/description#:~:text=Overview,percent%20of%20the%20world's%20energy." data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.eesi.org/topics/fossil-fuels/description#:~:text=Overview,percent%20of%20the%20world's%20energy.&quot;}" href="https://www.eesi.org/topics/fossil-fuels/description#:~:text=Overview,percent%20of%20the%20world's%20energy." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">power</a> about eighty per cent of human activity, pumping out carbon dioxide and short-circuiting our climate to catastrophic effect. Converts argue that geothermal checks three key boxes: it is carbon-free, available everywhere, and effectively unlimited. Crucially, it is also baseload, which means that, unlike solar panels or wind, it provides a constant flow of energy. Companies and governments have taken notice. “Over the last two years, I have watched this exponential spin-up of activity in geothermal,” Tony Pink, a drilling expert in Houston, told me, in 2023.</p><p>But there is a glaring risk of moon shots: often, they miss. “There’s basically zero chance that you’re going to develop a moon-shot technology and have it be commercial in five years, on a large-scale, worldwide,” Mark Jacobson, a Stanford engineering professor and the author of “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/No-Miracles-Needed-Technology-Climate/dp/1009249541" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/No-Miracles-Needed-Technology-Climate/dp/1009249541&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Miracles-Needed-Technology-Climate/dp/1009249541" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">No Miracles Needed: How Today’s Technology Can Save Our Climate and Clean Our Air</a>,” told me. That’s how long humanity has to lower emissions before climatic devastation, according to his <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/CountriesWWS.pdf">calculations</a>. “There’s a very decent chance you can do that with wind and solar,” he said. Perhaps, when resources and time are finite, trying and failing—or simply taking too long—could be worse than not trying at all.</p><p>In 1890, two brothers began drilling for hot water in Boise, Idaho; their company soon built the world’s first geothermal district heating system. In 1904, an Italian entrepreneur named Piero Conti constructed a geothermal turbine in Tuscany. It powered only five light bulbs, but Conti went on to build Larderello 1, the first-ever geothermal plant and the power source for a railway and two nearby villages. These early experiments illustrated one of geothermal’s key advantages: it can be used for both electricity and heating, which collectively account for around thirty-eight per cent of global climate emissions.</p><p>In the nineteen-sixties and seventies, Pacific Gas and Electric, a California utility company, built an industrial-scale geothermal electricity plant at the Geysers, a Yellowstone-esque collection of natural steam vents in Northern California. It became the largest of its kind, producing a third of America’s geothermal output. Geothermal increasingly seemed like a path to U.S. energy independence, and industry heavyweights such as Chevron and Phillips opened plants. But problems soon stacked up. High temperatures caused drilling equipment to fail. Profits proved paltry and investment scarce. “Everything was a challenge, and there was never enough money to solve all those engineering problems,” Jeff Tester, a longtime geothermal researcher, told me. Tester worked on a geothermal project at Los Alamos, which aimed to perfect directional drilling. “We were never able to do it because the techniques in the field were too immature,” he said.</p><p>Then, in the two-thousands, came a rapid expansion in fracking, a drilling method that injects fluid into hard rock, creating fractures through which fossil fuels can flow. A “shale revolution” unlocked huge stores of oil and gas, causing small earthquakes, polluting groundwater, and spewing greenhouse gases along the way. A useful side effect, however, was a Cambrian explosion of new drilling practices—such as horizontal drilling and magnetic sensing—that inspired a geothermal resurgence. In 2005, the Department of Energy commissioned Tester, then a professor at M.I.T., to revisit the subject; his team’s report, “The Future of Geothermal Energy,” calculated that just two per cent of the heat in the four miles below U.S. soil could meet the entire country’s energy needs—two thousand times over. “That report was inspirational to a lot of people, including myself,” Mark McClure, the C.E.O. of a company that provides software and consulting to the oil, gas, and geothermal industries, told me.</p><p>The next generation of geothermal-energy projects—including <em>FORGE</em>, in Utah—was not about harvesting natural steam but, rather, drilling to create steam. These projects, known as enhanced geothermal systems, or E.G.S., generally circulate water between underground wells. Hot rock then turns it into superheated steam, which can spin turbines and generate electricity.</p><p>Engineering such a system in hard, deep rock is a profound challenge. Moore, the <em>FORGE</em> geologist, said that wells need to be linked with a network of fractures in the rock, which he likened to cracks in a pane of glass. Consequently, many of his colleagues are former frackers. One of them, Paul Stroud, took me on a tour of the drilling rig; we walked thirty feet up a steep staircase to a walled-in control room known as “the doghouse.” “This is an older rig,” he told me, almost apologetically. We could see sharp, snowy peaks in the distance. An array of computer screens displayed the drill bit’s depth, speed, torque, and rate of penetration. The long list of variables spoke to the complexity of carving horizontal wells in deep, hot expanses of granite.</p><p>The cement truck from Bakersfield arrived around 8:30 <em>P.M</em>. By ten-thirty, the men were pouring cement again, gluing the enormous metal straw in place. Next, the team scanned the borehole with gamma rays. What drillers do not want to see are spaces around the cement column. The scan showed no spaces.</p><p>Well 16B(78)-32 was completed in July, 2023, not far from another well that had been drilled earlier. It was more than two miles long. The day after its completion, engineers successfully circulated fluid through artificial fractures between the two wells. The men were ecstatic. “Connectivity is the whole goal,” Moore said. “We achieved it.” But he was also thinking about all the steps that had to follow. No heat had been mined yet, no energy produced. “We need to drill more wells,” Moore told me soon afterward. “We need to get into hotter environments.”</p><p>Since then, many of these techniques have been proven. In the summer of 2023, Fervo, an E.G.S. startup, set a record for continuous flow rate between multiple wells. They broke it again last year. “It’s a really big deal,” McClure told me. The firm soon started building a four-hundred-megawatt commercial power plant near the <em>FORGE</em> site, gleaning much of its technical know-how from Moore’s team. In 2026, Fervo intends to start providing around-the-clock power to utilities in Southern California. Tech companies such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft have incorporated geothermal power into notoriously energy-hungry A.I. data centers. And Eavor Technologies, a Canadian company operating in southern Germany, is developing a commercial E.G.S. project that would provide heat and electricity to tens of thousands of homes. Moore is more bullish on geothermal than ever; in October, the D.O.E. awarded <em>FORGE</em> another eighty million dollars to continue its research into 2028. “I encourage this in every way possible,” he said. “We need to continue.”</p><p>A small number of engineers hope to progress beyond enhanced geothermal to “deep geothermal,” which would reach depths of six to twelve miles and temperatures in excess of eight hundred degrees Celsius. (This is about as hot as the tip of a candle flame.) Believers view deep geothermal as a climate savior; skeptics view it as a technically infeasible pipe dream. “I’m still on the negative side of ‘Will this work in reality?’&nbsp;” Philip Ball, a geothermal consultant, told me. Moore called the idea “bullshit.”</p><p>On a pleasant spring morning in 2023, I visited a deep-geothermal lab in Houston, a city that oil built. I plugged in my rental, a Chevy Bolt, near a warehouse operated by Quaise, a startup with fifty-five employees that began in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From the parking lot, I could see a neighbor’s two white horses.</p><p>Carlos Araque, a bearded and smooth-talking engineer from Colombia who founded Quaise, told me that he left the oil industry in 2017 to search for a renewable energy source “with the real potential to displace fossil fuels.” He predicted that by 2050 humanity’s energy consumption will have doubled. “Wind and solar won’t scale to the level that’s required by the civilization we’ve built on fossil fuels,” he said. “It’s physics.” A pound of oil contains far more energy than a one-pound rechargeable battery. He also claimed that solar and wind projects have run out of affordable land—something that Jacobson, the Stanford professor, deemed “incorrect.” (Jacobson <a data-offer-url="https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3539703-no-miracle-tech-needed-how-to-switch-to-renewables-now-and-lower-costs-doing-it/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3539703-no-miracle-tech-needed-how-to-switch-to-renewables-now-and-lower-costs-doing-it/&quot;}" href="https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3539703-no-miracle-tech-needed-how-to-switch-to-renewables-now-and-lower-costs-doing-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">estimates</a> that renewables require about half a per cent of the Earth’s landmass to cover humanity’s energy consumption.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The deepest hole ever drilled, the Kola Superdeep Borehole, in northwest Russia, extends seven miles underground and cost a hundred million dollars. The second-deepest hole, the German Continental Deep Drilling Programme, stretches 5.6 miles. “Temperature is really the challenge,” Ulrich Harms, a lead scientist on the German project, told me. In the early nineties, his team encountered rock that was more than two hundred and sixty-five degrees Celsius. Deep holes also have a tendency to collapse. “Borehole stability at great depths is an absolute great challenge,” he said. Quaise, which has raised a hundred million dollars, mostly from climate-focussed funds, initially wanted to drill to a depth of twelve miles, but now plans to stop at six, where it will encounter temperatures of three hundred to five hundred and fifty degrees Celsius—hot enough to turn water “supercritical,” dramatically increasing its energy density.</p><p>Central to Quaise’s system is the gyrotron, a tubular device that was invented by Soviet scientists in 1964. It works like a very, very powerful microwave, emitting “millimeter waves” that would vaporize your vegetables; they can generate temperatures of a hundred million degrees Celsius. (The U.S. military has pursued gyrotrons as “directed energy weapons.”) About a decade ago, Paul Woskov, an M.I.T. research engineer, showed that the technology could be used for “energy drilling” without a physical bit. Quaise’s scientists propose that the heat of a gyrotron could stabilize tunnel walls by vitrifying them into glass.</p><p>That morning, Henry Phan, the company’s V.P. of engineering, guided me into a shipping container and showed me a copper tube—a “waveguide”—that was pointed at a granite brick. We exited the container and gazed at a live video feed of the brick. Then a young project manager named Stephen Jeske tapped a button. An invisible microwave shot out of the tube and made the center of the brick look like a glowing white sun; an inky goo bubbled out.  Phan calmly sipped coffee from a company-branded mug.</p><p>We reëntered the shipping container, wearing masks, and smelled something acrid. Jeske put on mitts to pick up the brick, which looked like it had been pierced by a lightsabre. Webby filaments, known as “Pele’s hair,” normally found around volcanoes, had formed around the hole.</p><p>Jeske set the brick down on a table, amid several other mangled bricks. “Definitely don’t touch that,” he said. He pointed to a placard: “<em>WARNING: HOT!</em>”</p><inline-embed name="feature-default" attrs="[object Object]" childtypes="image" contenttype="callout:feature-default"><figure><p><span>Henry Phan (left) and Casey Rodgers, Quaise employees, in the test chamber for the “millimeter waves” device.</span></p></figure></inline-embed><p>On the other side of Houston, another geothermal company was making its pitch. Quaise’s only deep-geothermal competitor, a Slovakian startup called GA Drilling, was hosting an event that the company’s publicist had described as “history in the making.” Representatives from ExxonMobil, Repsol, and the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance  had come to see the Anchorbit, a thirty-foot-tall drilling tool that had been shipped from Slovakia. The tool was designed to prevent torsional vibration, or “stick slip,” which is when a physical drill bit starts to jerk and spin out of control. Eventually, such equipment could help enable advanced geothermal projects—but first the company wanted to sell the tech to drillers, including oil and gas companies. This was less a moon shot than a way to pay for a launchpad.</p><p>GA, which stands for “geothermal anywhere,” is betting that <a href="https://www.psfc.mit.edu/vision/what_is_plasma">plasma</a>, or superheated matter, can either drill into hard rock or soften it for conventional drills. (Lightning is plasma; so is the sun.) “Cheaper and deeper, that’s the point,” Igor Kocis, a slim fifty-year-old who serves as the company’s C.E.O., said during some introductory remarks. “We are talking, really, about multibillion-dollar markets that are still waiting for the energy business to be transformed into something that is sustainable, that is baseload, and that can deliver gigawatts of energy.”  A decade ago, the company built a laboratory prototype that they called the Plasmabit. To generate income, however, it had to turn its attention to the lower-tech Anchorbit.</p><p>We put on hard hats and clunky metal shoe coverings and marched outside into the Texas heat. The Anchorbit hung like a silver stalactite from a towering rig. Small knobs—“gripping elements”—studded its surface, to catch on to tunnel walls and stabilize the drilling process. A moment later, we heard whirring far below our feet. Soupy mud flowed up through the hole.</p><p>The audience, which had presumably seen a lot of drilling, seemed underwhelmed. “From a geothermal-drilling point of view, I was disappointed,” Malcolm Ross, a geothermal consultant and former Shell researcher, told me afterward. “I thought what they showed was very incremental, and not what I expected.” (Ross now works for Eavor Technologies.) The path to big, exciting breakthroughs apparently required small, boring steps. Some of them might lead nowhere.</p><inline-embed name="feature-default" attrs="[object Object]" childtypes="image" contenttype="callout:feature-default"><figure><p><span>Energy-industry representatives, including many from oil and gas companies, at a GA Drilling presentation.</span></p></figure></inline-embed><p>On November 15, 2017, the second-largest earthquake in South Korean history jolted through Pohang, a city of half a million people. More than a hundred were injured and nearly two thousand were displaced. Later, the earthquake was identified as “induced seismicity” from a nearby enhanced-geothermal project. Similar E.G.S.-related quakes have occurred in Switzerland, Germany, and Australia.</p><p>The South Korean government invited William Ellsworth, a Stanford geophysicist, to study the Pohang quake and whether a nearby geothermal facility had caused it. In a report, he wrote that engineers had failed to evaluate the risk posed by the site. He argued that geothermal facilities should always measure seismic activity and that they pose a risk to population centers. “You need to understand if you are inducing small earthquakes,” Ellsworth said. In a world of geothermal anywhere, we may feel quakes everywhere, too.</p><p>Still, when I reached Ellsworth, he seemed cautiously optimistic. “I don’t think the seismicity risks should be taken as any kind of a showstopper,” he said. Many E.G.S. projects already monitor seismicity; during a single fluid-injection test, in 2022, <em>FORGE</em> measured fifty thousand “seismic events.” The strongest, at half a magnitude, was unfeelable. “Earthquakes come up <em>all</em> the time when we’re talking to the public,” Moore told me. He hopes that any seismic events generated by working enhanced geothermal systems will also be imperceptible.</p><p>The risks from deep-geothermal companies like Quaise, however, are harder to predict. When temperatures rise above three hundred and fifty degrees Celsius, rock becomes soft and pliable. “We don’t know the conditions under which rocks at those depths and high temperatures initiate earthquakes,” Ellsworth told me. This year, Araque, the Quaise founder, hopes to raise three hundred million dollars and make progress on five commercial pilot projects; the deepest is supposed to extend three miles underground. (GA Drilling has found its first major customer for the Anchorbit, the Brazilian energy conglomerate Petrobras, but has not yet developed a commercial-scale Plasmabit.)</p><p>The geothermal industry seems relatively hopeful about the new Trump Administration. <a href="https://youngkim.house.gov/2024/04/16/rep-young-kims-bill-to-boost-geothermal-energy-gains-traction/">Three</a> <a data-offer-url="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7370/text/dhg-408466" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7370/text/dhg-408466&quot;}" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7370/text/dhg-408466" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bipartisan</a> <a href="https://naturalresources.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=416710">bills</a>, recently passed in the House and awaiting approval in the Senate, would cut the permitting process for geothermal projects from a few years to a handful of months. Geothermal advocates also see promise in Trump’s Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, a former oil-field-services C.E.O., and his company, Liberty Energy, is a Fervo investor, as an encouraging sign. (The Sierra Club accused him of being “hell-bent on abusing his power to prolong the use of deadly fossil fuels.”)</p><p>Jacobson argued that to meet current climate goals, money is best spent on electric vehicles, heat pumps, induction cooktops, and the like—not geothermal ventures. “By far, the best option is to deploy what we have as fast as possible,” he told me. “Having a combination of geothermal with wind and solar is terrific. But it’s really a question of whether you can scale up.” According to his <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/21-USStates-PDFs/21-USStatesPaper.pdf">models</a>, most countries could transition to nearly a-hundred-per-cent solar, wind, and hydropower in a way that would pay for itself within six years. Many of the needed technologies, including batteries that could solve the baseload problem, are commercially available.</p><p>The climate, meanwhile, continues on a treacherous path of warming. Hurricanes, heat waves, and fires are escalating, yet in 2023 governments spent hundreds of billions of dollars subsidizing oil and gas companies. In January, President Trump announced a “national energy emergency” in his Inaugural Address. He said that Americans must unlock the power underneath their feet. “We will drill, baby, drill,” he declared. Unfortunately for the planet, he was not talking about the role of geothermal energy in solving the climate crisis. He was talking about the fossil fuels that created the crisis in the first place.&nbsp;♦</p><inline-embed name="feature-default" attrs="[object Object]" childtypes="image" contenttype="callout:feature-default"><figure><p><span>GA Drilling’s Anchorbit on a drilling rig.</span></p></figure></inline-embed><p><em>Reporting for this story was supported in part by a grant from the Institute for Journalism and Natural Resources</em>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-permalink-context="/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/">

<p>2nd March 2025</p>



<p>A surprisingly common complaint I see from developers who have tried using LLMs for code is that they encountered a hallucination—usually the LLM inventing a method or even a full software library that doesn’t exist—and it crashed their confidence in LLMs as a tool for writing code. How could anyone productively use these things if they invent methods that don’t exist?</p>
<p>Hallucinations in code <strong>are the least harmful hallucinations you can encounter from a model</strong>.</p>
<p>The real risk from using LLMs for code is that they’ll make mistakes that <em>aren’t</em> instantly caught by the language compiler or interpreter. And these happen <em>all the time</em>!</p>

<p>The moment you run LLM generated code, any hallucinated methods will be instantly obvious: you’ll get an error. You can fix that yourself or you can feed the error back into the LLM and watch it correct itself.</p>
<p>Compare this to hallucinations in regular prose, where you need a critical eye, strong intuitions and well developed fact checking skills to avoid sharing information that’s incorrect and directly harmful to your reputation.</p>
<p>With code you get a powerful form of fact checking for free. Run the code, see if it works.</p>
<p>In some setups—<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">ChatGPT Code Interpreter</a>, <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a>, any of the growing number of “agentic” code systems that write and then execute code in a loop—the LLM system itself will spot the error and automatically correct itself.</p>
<p>If you’re using an LLM to write code without even running it yourself, <em>what are you doing?</em></p>
<p>Hallucinated methods are such a tiny roadblock that when people complain about them I assume they’ve spent minimal time learning how to effectively use these systems—they dropped them at the first hurdle.</p>
<p>My cynical side suspects they may have been looking for a reason to dismiss the technology and jumped at the first one they found.</p>
<p>My less cynical side assumes that nobody ever warned them that you have to put a lot of work in to learn how to get good results out of these systems. I’ve been exploring <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">their applications for writing code</a> for over two years now and I’m still learning new tricks (and new strengths and weaknesses) almost every day.</p>

<h4 id="qa">Manually testing code is essential</h4>

<p>Just because code looks good and runs without errors doesn’t mean it’s actually doing the right thing. No amount of meticulous code review—or even comprehensive automated tests—will demonstrably prove that code actually does the right thing. You have to run it yourself!</p>
<p>Proving to yourself that the code works is your job. This is one of the many reasons I don’t think LLMs are going to put software professionals out of work.</p>
<p>LLM code will usually look fantastic: good variable names, convincing comments, clear type annotations and a logical structure. This can lull you into a false sense of security, in the same way that a gramatically correct and confident answer from ChatGPT might tempt you to skip fact checking or applying a skeptical eye.</p>
<p>The way to avoid <em>those</em> problems is the same as how you avoid problems in code by other humans that you are reviewing, or code that you’ve written yourself: you need to actively exercise that code. You need to have great manual QA skills.</p>
<p>A general rule for programming is that you should <em>never</em> trust any piece of code until you’ve seen it work with your own eye—or, even better, seen it fail and then fixed it.</p>
<p>Across my entire career, almost every time I’ve assumed some code works without actively executing it—some branch condition that rarely gets hit, or an error message that I don’t expect to occur—I’ve later come to regret that assumption.</p>

<h4 id="tips">Tips for reducing hallucinations</h4>
<p>If you really are seeing a deluge of hallucinated details in the code LLMs are producing for you, there are a bunch of things you can do about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try different models. It might be that another model has better training data for your chosen platform. As a Python and JavaScript programmer my favorite models right now are Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking turned on, OpenAI’s o3-mini-high and GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (for Python).</li>
<li>Learn how to use the context. If an LLM doesn’t know a particular library you can often fix this by dumping in a few dozen lines of example code. LLMs are incredibly good at imitating things, and at rapidly picking up patterns from very limited examples. Modern model’s have increasingly large context windows—I’ve recently started using Claude’s new <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10167454-using-the-github-integration">GitHub integration</a> to dump entire repositories into the context and it’s been working extremely well for me.</li>
<li>Chose <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a>. I genuinely find myself picking libraries that have been around for a while partly because that way it’s much more likely that LLMs will be able to use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll finish this rant with a related observation: I keep seeing people say “if I have to review every line of code an LLM writes, it would have been faster to write it myself!”</p>
<p>Those people are loudly declaring that they have under-invested in the crucial skills of reading, understanding and reviewing code written by other people. I suggest getting some more practice in. Reviewing code written for you by LLMs is a great way to do that.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Bonus section</em>: I asked Claude 3.7 Sonnet "extended thinking mode" to review an earlier draft of this post—"<code>Review my rant of a blog entry. I want to know if the argument is convincing, small changes I can make to improve it, if there are things I've missed.</code>". It was quite helpful, especially in providing tips to make that first draft a little less confrontational! Since you can share Claude chats now <a href="https://claude.ai/share/685cd6d9-f18a-47ef-ae42-e9815df821f1">here’s that transcript</a>.</p>
