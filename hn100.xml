<p>Last night when the clock struck midnight, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/thousands-of-workers-go-on-strike-at-ford-gm-and-stellantis-plants/">nearly 13,000 workers at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis went on strike</a> after the so-called "Big Three" car companies failed to reach an agreement with United Auto Workers (UAW). By Friday morning, UAW discovered that X, the platform formerly known as Twitter—in what appeared to be a petty move by platform owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk—had stripped their account's verified status, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/09/15/uaw-strike-twitter-verification-elon-musk/">The Intercept reported</a>.</p>
<p>The move seemingly makes it harder for UAW to maximize reach for its posts on X, just as workers have begun striking, demanding better wages and other benefits.</p>
<p>Ford has claimed that the deal UAW was negotiating would have doubled automaker labor costs, and the Intercept noted that often wage increases won by union workers "trickle down" to non-unionized workers like Tesla's. That perhaps worried Musk, who seemingly has a financial interest in keeping autoworker wages low and a history of union-busting. Earlier this year, Musk lost a court battle and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/musk-loses-in-court-has-to-delete-tweet-threatening-tesla-workers-who-join-union/">had to delete a tweet that threatened Tesla workers attempting to unionize</a>.</p>
<p>A UAW official told The Intercept that the union had paid for X verification and confirmed that the account had been marked as verified until earlier today when UAW said it was removed without any notification from X.</p>
<p>By midday Friday, UAW's verified check was reinstated. The Intercept's reporter, Ryan Grim, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryangrim/status/1702721056190980574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1702721056190980574%7Ctwgr%5Eb17609a20274718334e922e6a2f9960348e94b9f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2F2023%2F09%2F15%2Fuaw-strike-twitter-verification-elon-musk%2F">posted on X</a>, writing, "Elon put the blue check back up. Maybe the Big Three will fold this fast too."</p>
<p>To a request for comment, X only sent Ars an auto-response, saying, "Busy now, please check back later." (To be fair, in this case "check back later" is a good summary of what happened.)</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>According to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/tesla-uaw-gm-ford-stellantis-contract-talks">Axios</a>, Tesla pays lower wages than the Big Three automakers currently faced with striking workers, with Tesla paying "an estimated labor cost of $45 to $50 per hour" compared to "about $64 to $67 per hour."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1702431940987543888">post on X</a>, Musk claimed that Tesla pays more than UAW's required wages.</p>
<p>"We pay more than the UAW btw, but performance expectations are also higher," Musk said. "Quite a few of our factory techs who work on the line have become millionaires over the years from company stock grants."</p>
<p>Musk's stake in the strike could go beyond wage questions, though. UAW's negotiations also seek to expand benefits for union workers involved "in the production of electric vehicles and the batteries needed to power them," The Intercept reported, and those conversations could also impact Tesla operations.</p>
<p>On top of the backlash over Musk's union-busting tweet, Tesla has a history of violating labor laws.</p>
<p>The company previously was found in violation of labor laws for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/teslas-ban-on-pro-union-shirts-is-illegal-and-must-be-rescinded-nlrb-rules/">banning workers from wearing pro-union shirts</a>. Last year, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered Tesla to revise its policies "to make clear that it does not prohibit production associates from wearing black union shirts."</p>
<p>There was also tension earlier this year when Tesla Autopilot Buffalo-based workers tried to unionize, alleging that they were being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/tesla-autopilot-workers-try-to-unionize-are-tired-of-being-treated-like-robots/">treated "like robots"</a> and pressured to skip bathroom breaks.</p>
<p>And most recently in April, the NLRB again ruled that Tesla violated labor laws when managers at an Orlando repair shop illegally silenced workers attempting to discuss pay and working conditions, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-broke-us-labor-law-by-silencing-workers-official-rules-2023-04-26/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p>Whether X was really attempting to limit reach of UAW's posts at a critical moment—or there is some other possible justification for removing the verification—is still unknown. But UAW didn't let the setback stop it from returning to the platform to amplify strikers' demands as soon as the blue check was back.</p>
<p>In the moments after X reinstated UAW's verification, the union began posting in support of strikers <a href="https://twitter.com/UAW/status/1702730915841990705">in Ohio</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/UAW/status/1702737525922562432">Missouri</a>, some of them chanting, "No justice, no jeeps!"</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em>This past month I’ve been working on a project that I’m eager to write way too many words about. But for now, it’s not ready to talk about in public. Meanwhile, I either have way too many words about topics that I’m confident nobody wants to hear about or too few words about topics that folks tend to find interesting.</em></p><p><em>In lieu of publishing something too unappealing or too trite, I’ve decided to tell a (true!) story that’s been rattling around in the back of my head for more than a few years.</em></p><p>In 2016 I joined Uber. I’d followed a director from Box who had been offered to lead Business Intelligence at Uber. She told me about a team that she thought I’d be perfect for—it was called “Crystal Ball” and it was doing some of the most incredible work she’d come across. I’d put in two good years at Box and seen it through an IPO and was ready for something new, so I jumped.</p><p>Uber was weird from the get-go. The first week (dubbed “Engucation”) was a mix of learning how to do things that I’d never need to do in the role that I held and setting up benefits and taking compliance classes. Travis Kalanick joined us for a Q&amp;A where he showed off pictures of the self-driving car that the ATG arm of the company was building (it just looked like an SUV with cameras) and the more visually impressive mapping car that was gathering data for the self-driving project (it looked like a weird Dalek on wheels).</p><p>When I met the members of the Crystal Ball team, it was about four people (not including myself). Everyone was heavily biased towards back-end. I was given a brief tour to the fourth floor of 1455 Market St to understand the problem that the team was solving.</p><p>“You see all these desks?”</p><p>“Yeah”</p><p><span>“This is where the data scientists sit. They build data science models in R. They run those models on data that they download from Vertica</span></p><p><span>.”</span></p><p>“Okay”</p><p>“The problem is that the models are slow and take up a lot of resources. So the data scientists have multiple laptops that they download the data to, then run the models overnight. When the data scientists arrive in the morning, the laptops whose models didn’t crash have data that’s maybe usable that day.”</p><p>“What about the other laptops?”</p><p>“We don’t have the data we need and we lose money.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>This was a big problem for the business: they needed a way to take two kinds of inputs (data and code) and run the code to produce useful outputs. Or, hopefully useful. Testing a model meant running it, so the iteration cycle was very close to one iteration per day per laptop.</p><p>The team, when I joined, had the beginnings of a tool to automate this. It was called “R-Crusher” and it was essentially a system for scheduling work. They were able to make some API calls and code would be downloaded and executed, and an output file would appear in a directory eventually. As the first (self-professed) front-end engineer on the team, it was my job to build the tool to expose this to the rest of the company.</p><p><span>I was grateful that I didn’t need to write any “real” code. I lived in the world of React building UIs with Uber’s in-house front-end framework</span></p><p><span> (“Bedrock”). Any time I needed something, I could ask the back-end folks to update the R-Crusher API and I’d get some notes a few hours later to unblock me.</span></p><p><span>The first version of the front-end for R-Crusher (“Wesley”</span></p><p><span>) was ready in very little time—maybe a few weeks from the point I joined? It was a joy.</span></p><p><span>The next 6-7 months were a hectic rush. I was tasked with hiring more front-end engineers. I built a front-end team</span></p><p><span> of seven people. We added user-facing features to Wesley and R-Crusher (“Can we have a text box that only takes capital letters?” “Can we make this text box allow a number whose maximum value is this other text box?”) and debugging tools for the team (“Can we see the output log of the running jobs?”).</span></p><p>There were effectively only two things that people were working on at Uber in 2016:</p><ol><li><p>The app rewrite/redesign (which launched in November 2016)</p></li><li><p>Uber China</p></li></ol><p><span>All of my work and the team’s work, ultimately, was to support Uber China. R-Crusher was a tool to help get the data we needed to compete with Didi. Nobody really cared very much about the processes for the US and any other country—we had less to lose and Lyft wasn’t seen as remarkable competition except in the handful of cities they were operating at scale. China was a make-or-break opportunity for Uber, China was only going to succeed if we had the data for it</span></p><p><span>, and the data was going to come (at least in part) from R-Crusher.</span></p><p>Over the summer of 2016, we came up against a new twist on the project. We had a model that ran overnight to generate data for anticipated ridership in China. That data wasn’t useful on its own, but if you fed it into a tab on a special Excel spreadsheet, you’d get a little interactive Excel tool for choosing driver incentives. Our job was to take that spreadsheet and make it available as the interface for this model’s data.</p><p><span>Now, this was no small feat on the back-end or front-end. First, the data needed to be run and moved to an appropriate location. Then, we had a challenging problem: we needed to take </span><em>all the logic</em><span> from this spreadsheet (with hundreds if not thousands of formulas across multiple sheets) and turn it into a UI that Uber China city teams could log into to use. The direction we got from the head of finance at Uber (who, for whatever reason, was seemingly responsible for the project) was “take </span><em>this</em><span> [the spreadsheet] and put it in on the website [Wesley].”</span></p><p>We asked how we could simplify the UI to meet the resource constraints (engineer time) we had. “The city teams only know how to use Excel, just make it like Excel.” We tried explaining why that was hard and what we could confidently deliver in the time allotted. “Every day that we don’t have this tool as specced, we’re losing millions of dollars.” There was no budging on the spec.</p><p>The back-end folks tried pushing the project over to the front-end side—there was just no time to convert the spreadsheet to Python or R code. On the front-end, the naive answer was “well I guess we’ve got a lot of JavaScript to write.” But I had something up my sleeve.</p><p>In 2015, I had built a prototype of a tool at Box. Box had a collaborative note-taking product called Box Notes (based on Hackpad). I had the idea to make a similar project for working with numbers: sometimes you didn’t need a full spreadsheet, you just needed a place to put together a handful of formulas, format it with some headings and text, and share it with other people. Sort of like an ipython notebook for spreadsheets. I called it Box Sums.</p><p><span>When I built this, I created a simple React-based spreadsheet UI</span></p><p><span> and a super basic spreadsheet formula engine. A few hundred lines of code. And if you dropped an XLS/XLSX file onto the page, I used a Node library to parse it and extract the contents.</span></p><p>I demoed Box Sums to the Box Notes team at some point, and they nitpicked the UI and implementation details (“What if two people type in the same cell at the same time? They’ll just overwrite each other.” 🙄). Nothing came of it, but I took the code and shoved it into my back pocket for a rainy day.</p><p>My idea was to take this code and spruce it up for Uber’s use case. Fill in all the missing features in the spreadsheet engine so that everything the spreadsheet needed to run was supported. The back-end could serve up a 2D array of data representing the ridership data input, and we'd feed that in. And the UI would simply make all but the cells that were meant to be interactive read-only instead.</p><p><span>I </span><em>wasn’t</em><span> going to be Excel, but it would behave sort of like Excel, it would read an Excel file as input, and it would Excel formulas on some data. That was about as close to “just make it like Excel” that we were going to get. And it also meant that we could skip the process of translating thousands of dense formulas to JavaScript.</span></p><p><span>I got to work polishing up the code. I parsed the XLS file and extracted all the formulas. I found all of the functions those formulas used, and implemented them in my spreadsheet engine. I then went through and implemented all the fun syntax that I hadn’t implemented for my demo at Box (like </span><a href="https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/relative-absolute-reference-excel/" rel="">absolute cell references</a><span>, where inserting </span><code>$</code><span> characters into cell references makes them keep their column/row when you drag the corner of the cell, or referencing cells in other sheets).</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Uber 5th Floor – CALIFORNIA DRYWALL&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Uber 5th Floor – CALIFORNIA DRYWALL" title="Uber 5th Floor – CALIFORNIA DRYWALL" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A photo of the literal couch that I worked from to build this. Courtesy of California Drywall’s portfolio of building interiors that they helped construct.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>I sat in the black mirrored wall “spaceship hallway” of 1455’s fifth floor with my headphones playing the same handful of songs on repeat. I spent the early days fixing crashes and debugging errant </span><code>NaN</code><span>s. Then I dug into big performance issues</span></p><p><span>. And finally, I spent time polishing the UI.</span></p><p>When everything was working, I started checking my work. I entered some values into the Excel version and my version, and compared the numbers.</p><ul><li><p>Excel’s output: 3.03</p></li><li><p>My output: 3.01</p></li></ul><p>Hmm</p><ul><li><p>Excel’s output: 1.002</p></li><li><p>My output: 1.000</p></li></ul><p><span>The answers were all </span><em>almost</em><span> correct. After a week of work, I was very pleased to see the sheet working to the extent that it was, but having answers that were very, very close is objectively worse than having numbers that are wildly wrong: very wrong numbers usually always mean a simply logic problem. Almost-correct numbers mean something more insidious.</span></p><p>I started stepping through the debugger as the calculation engine crawled the spreadsheet’s formula graph. I compared computed values to what they were in the Excel version. The sheer size of the spreadsheet made it almost impossible to trace through all of the formulas (there were simply too many), and I didn’t have another spreadsheet which exhibited this problem.</p><p>I wrote unit tests. They all passed.</p><p>I started reading about how Excel represents floating point numbers—maybe JavaScript’s doubles were somehow different than Excel’s notion of a double? This led nowhere.</p><p>I googled for esoteric knowledge about Excel, rounding, or anything related to non-integer numbers that I could find. It all led nowhere.</p><p>Just as I was about to resign myself to stepping through the thousands of formulas and recomputations, I decided to head down to the fourth floor to just ask one of the data scientists.</p><p>I approached their desks. They looked up and had a look of recognition.</p><p>“Hey guys. I’m working on the driver incentive spreadsheet. I’m trying to mimic the calculations that you have in Excel, but my numbers are all just a little bit off. I was hoping you might have some ideas about what’s going on.”</p><p>“Can I take a look?” I showed him my laptop and he played with a few numbers in the inputs. “Oh, that’s the circ.”</p><p>“The ‘circ’?”</p><p>Another data scientist looked up, “The circular reference.”</p><p>“I’m sorry?”</p><p>“We use a circular reference in Excel to do linear regression.”</p><p><span>My mind was blown. I had thought, naively perhaps, that circular references in Excel simply created an error. But this data scientist showed me that Excel </span><em>doesn’t</em><span> error on circular references—if the computed value of the cell converges.</span></p><p>You see, when formulas create a circular reference, Excel will run that computation up to a number of times. If, in those computations, the magnitude of the difference between the most recent and previous computed values for the cell falls below some pre-defined epsilon value (usually a very small number, like 0.00001), Excel will stop recomputing the cell and pretend like it finished successfully.</p><p>Yeah, really.</p><p>I thanked the data scientists and returned to the spaceship hallway to think about what the fuck I was going to do next.</p><p>The changes I needed to make were pretty straightforward. First, it required knowing whether a downstream cell was already computed upstream (for whatever definitions of “downstream” and “upstream” you want to use; there’s not really a good notion of “up” and “down” in a spreadsheet or this graph). If you went to recompute a cell with a formula that referenced an already-recomputed cell, you’d simply keep track of the number of times you computed that cell. If the recomputed value was close enough to the previous value that it fell below the epsilon, you simply pretended like you didn’t recompute the cell and moved on. If it didn’t, you’d continue the process until the number of iterations that you’re keeping track of hit some arbitrary limit (for me, 1000), at which point you’d bail.</p><p>The changes took a day and a half to make. And would you believe, it worked. The outputs were exactly what they should have been. I wrote tests, I integrated the damn thing into Wesley, and I brought it to the team. We delivered the project in the second week of July.</p><p>Two things happened. The first was of little consequence but I enjoy telling the story. Rakesh, the team lead working on the back-end, asked me where I got the Excel component.</p><p>“I made it.”</p><p>“But where did you get the Excel engine?”</p><p>“I made it.”</p><p>“But how are you running Excel in the browser?”</p><p>“Everything you see is built by me, from scratch.”</p><p>He simply couldn’t believe that I’d written a full spreadsheet engine that ran in the browser. All things considered, it was maybe only five thousand lines of code total. A gnarly five thousand lines, but (obviously) not intractable. His assumption about the sheer complexity of that option was that it wasn’t a reasonable project to take on.</p><p>I do think that if I had challenged Rakesh—under no time pressure—to build a spreadsheet engine, he’d get to a working solution as well. My recollection is that he was a very competent engineer. Despite that, I think his intuition about the complexity and scope were based on bad assumptions about what we were ultimately accomplishing, and it’s a good case study in estimating reasonable project outcomes. It goes to show that the sheer imagined complexity of a possible solution is enough to disqualify it in some folks’ minds, even if it's the best possible outcome.</p><p>The second thing that happened was we shipped. We got the Uber China city team members logging in and using the tool. They plugged away at it, and to my knowledge, the numbers it produced drove driver incentives.</p><p>That was the third week of July.</p><p>The last week of July, the head of finance rushed over to our desks.</p><p>“Why can you see the formulas?”</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“When you click in the cells of the spreadsheet you can see the formulas. You shouldn’t be able to do that.”</p><p>“You said to make it just like Excel.”</p><p>“People working for Didi apply for intern jobs at Uber China and then exfiltrate our data. We can’t let them see the formulas or they’ll just copy what we do!”</p><p>Apparently that was a thing. I remember being only half-surprised at the time. I hadn’t considered that our threat model might include employees leaking the computations used to produce the numbers in question. Of course, short of moving the computations up to the server, we couldn't *really* protect the formulas, but that was beyond the scope of what we were being asked to do.</p><p>The fix was straightforward: I updated the UI to simply not show formulas when you clicked in cells. Easy enough, I guess.</p><p><span>The first week of August 2016, Uber China was sold to Didi. Most of us found out because our phones started dinging with news stories about it. We all stopped working and waited until an email arrived a couple hours later announcing the deal internally. If I remember correctly, I just left the office and headed home around lunch time because our team didn’t have anything to do that </span><em>wasn’t</em><span> Uber China-related (yet).</span></p><p><span>After Uber China evaporated, the tool was unceremoniously ripped out of Wesley. It was a bespoke UI for a data job that would never run again. We were never asked to build Excel in the browser again</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p>I feel no sense of loss or disappointment. I wasn’t disappointed at the time, either.</p><p>My first reaction was to publish the code on Github.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/WebSheets" rel="">https://github.com/WebSheets</a></p><p>My second reaction was to move on. There was maybe a part of me—my younger self—that was disappointed that this major piece of code that I’d labored over had been so gently used before being retired. I wasn’t recognized for it in any material way. My manager didn’t even know what I’d built.</p><p>On the other hand, we as engineers need to be real with ourselves. Every piece of code you write as an engineer is legacy code. Maybe not right now, but it will be. Someone will take joy in ripping it out someday. Every masterpiece will be gleefully replaced, it’s just a matter of time. So why get precious about how long that period of time is?</p><p>I often hear fairly junior folks saying things to the effect of “I’m here to grow as an engineer.” Growing as an engineer is mutually exclusive with the longevity of your output as an engineer. “Growing as an engineer” means becoming a better engineer, and becoming a better engineer (directly or indirectly) means getting better at using your skills to create business value. Early in your career, the work you do will likely have far less longevity than the work you do later on, simply because you gain maturity over time and learn to build tools that tend to be useful for longer.</p><p>Sometimes the business value your work generates comes in the way of technical output. Sometimes it’s how you work with the people around you (collaborating, mentoring, etc.). Sometimes it’s about how you support the rest of the team. There are many ways that business value is created.</p><p>The end (demise?) of Uber China implicitly meant that there was no business value left to create with this project. Continuing to push on it wouldn’t have gotten me or the business anywhere, even if what I'd done was the best possible solution to the problem.</p><p><span>Sometimes that’s just how it is. The devops saying “</span><a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/" rel="">Cattle, not pets</a><span>” is apt here: code (and by proxy, the products built with that code) is cattle. It does a job for you, and when that job is no longer useful, the code is ready to be retired. If you treat the code like a pet for sentimental reasons, you’re working in direct opposition to the interests of the business.</span></p><p><span>As much as I’d love to work on Uber Excel (I'm ashamed to admit that I thought of “Uber Sheets" far too long after I left the company), I was hired to solve problems. Having Excel in the browser was a useful solution, but the problem </span><em>wasn’t</em><span> showing spreadsheets in the browser: the problem was getting a specific UI delivered to the right users quickly.</span></p><p>It’s easy to treat a particularly clever or elegant piece of code as a masterpiece. It might very well be a beautiful trinket! But we engineers are not in the business of beautiful trinkets, we’re in the business of outcomes. In the same way that a chef shouldn’t be disappointed that a beautiful plate of food is “destroyed” by a hungry customer eating it, we shouldn’t be disappointed that our beautiful git repos are marked as “Archived” and shuffled off the production kube cluster.</p><p>The attitudes that we have towards the things that we make are good indicators of maturity. It’s natural for us to want our work to have staying power and longevity. It’s extremely human to want the validation of our beautiful things being seen and used and recognized; it means we’ve done well. On the other hand, our work being discarded gives us an opportunity to understand what (if anything) we could have done better:</p><ol><li><p>Did we build something that didn’t meet the project constraints?</p></li><li><p>Did we build what was requested, but what was requested wasn’t the right thing to ask for?</p><ol><li><p>Was the core problem misunderstood?</p></li><li><p>Did the requested solution actually address the needs of the end user?</p></li></ol></li><li><p>What questions didn’t we ask the stakeholders that could have better-aligned our output with the business need that triggered the request to engineering?</p></li><li><p>Were the expectations that we set around the project inaccurate or vague?</p></li><li><p>Did the project need to be as robust as what was delivered? Could a simpler or less clever solution solved the need equally well?</p></li><li><p>Did we focus on the wrong success criteria?</p><ol><li><p>Did we even have success criteria beyond “build what was requested?”</p></li></ol></li><li><p><span>Who could have been consulted before or after delivery of the project to validate whether all of the </span><em>actual</em><span> project requirements were satisfied?</span></p></li></ol><p>You won’t have the opportunity to take lessons away from the project if you see the sunsetting of the project as a failure: there’s often much to learn about what non-technical aspects of the project broke down. Perhaps there aren’t any, and maybe management is just a group of fools! But often that’s not the case; your delicately milled cog wasn’t ripped out of the machine because it was misunderstood, it was ripped out because it didn’t operate smoothly as a part of the larger system it was installed in.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 18:27:57 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/09/mckinsey-how-to-measure-software-developer-productivity">https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/09/mckinsey-how-to-measure-software-developer-productivity</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37527259">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div _ngcontent-appid-c225="" id="articleDetail"><p>You'll scarcely find a more controversial and hotly contested topic than metrics of software development productivity. Some think the notion of measuring productivity at all is an insult while others think it can be boiled down to just the <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2022/11/lines-of-code-productivity-software-development">lines of code produced.</a></p>

<p>Naturally, both these <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2022/11/lines-of-code-as-a-tool-for-assessing-developers">extremes</a> are wrong. And yet the "right" answer remains elusive.</p>

<p>Enter McKinsey. The&nbsp;consultancy made a fair few enemies when it said<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/yes-you-can-measure-software-developer-productivity" target="_blank"> yes, you can measure developer productivity</a>. Its framework below amalgamates two of the most popular existing frameworks, DORA and SPACE, with additional opportunity-focused metrics.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/binaries/content/gallery/efinancial-careers/articles/2023/mckinsey.jpg"></p>

<p>Many are not enthused. The critics include Dave Farley, formerly head of software development for low latency FX and crypto exchange LMAX Ltd. He says he's a fan of one of the metrics used, DORA, which has a focus on outcomes over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/07/bad-software-engineering-teams">the process</a>. However, he likens the difference between DORA and other metrics to "the difference between astronomy and astrology."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farley refutes the preoccupation with individual development metrics and says, "being smart in how we structure and organize our work is much more important than the level of individual genius or otherwise in the team." He references a now ancient book of essays on software engineering, The Mythical Man Month, and its idea that "nine women can't make a baby in one month."</p>

<p>&nbsp;Kent Beck, ex-fellow at payroll infrastructure <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/07/how-to-get-a-job-in-fintech">fintech</a> Gusto, and Gergely Orosz, formerly an engineering manager for Uber's payments platform and previously developer on JPMorgan's equity derivatives desk, also disagree with the McKinsey methodology. Their conclusions are that the report is "absurdly naive," and would "do far more harm than good" to companies that implement it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They suggest alternatives. - Focus on individual engineers, hoping to monitor and boost their own productivity. They set developers a challenge to "only have one red test at a time when using test driven development," and "set a goal to merge a pull request every day."</p>

<p>At a business level, they suggest a performance metric of "at least one customer-facing thing per team, per week," while rewarding "business impact." Though the former sounds easy, they say it "in practice is very hard to achieve." The latter is even more ambiguous and abstract than productivity itself, but they say the goal is that it "incentivizes software engineers to understand the business."</p>

<p>Are these developers making a fuss over nothing? Or is the McKinsey report a foreboding sign of what's to come in the world of engineering? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://csvbase.com/blog/5</link>
            <guid>37526047</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 16:59:15 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://csvbase.com/blog/5">https://csvbase.com/blog/5</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37526047">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>When was the Dollar highest against the Euro?</p>
<p>Here is a small program that calculates it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl -s https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist.zip <span>\</span>
<span>|</span> gunzip <span>\</span>
<span>|</span> sqlite3 <span>':memory:'</span> <span>'.import /dev/stdin stdin'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>"select Date from stdin order by USD asc limit 1;"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The output: <code>2000-10-26</code>.  (Try running it yourself.)</p>
<p>How it works:</p>
<p>The <code>curl</code> bit downloads the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html">official historical data that the European
Central Bank
publishes</a>
on the position of the Euro against other currencies.  (The <code>-s</code> flag just
removes some noise from standard error.)</p>
<p>That data comes as a zipfile, which <code>gunzip</code> will decompress.</p>
<p><code>sqlite3</code> queries the csv inside.  <code>:memory</code> tells sqlite to use an in-memory
file.  After that, <code>.import /dev/stdin stdin</code> tells sqlite to load standard
input into a table called <code>stdin</code>.  The string that follows that is a SQL
query.</p>
<h2>Cleanup in column 42</h2>
<p>Although pulling out a simple max is easy, the data shape is not ideal.  It's
in "wide" format - a <code>Date</code> column, and then an extra column for every
currency.  Here's the csv header for that file:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Date,USD,JPY,BGN,CYP,CZK,DKK,EEK,GBP,HUF,LTL,LVL,MTL,[and on, and on]
</pre></div>
<p>When doing filters and aggregations, life is easier if the data is in "long"
format, like this:</p>

<p>Switching from wide to long is a simple operation, commonly called a "melt".
Unfortunately, it's not available in SQL.</p>
<p>No matter, you can melt with pandas:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl -s https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist.zip <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
gunzip <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
python3 -c <span>'import sys, pandas as pd</span>
<span>pd.read_csv(sys.stdin).melt("Date").to_csv(sys.stdout, index=False)'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There is one more problem.  The file mungers at ECB have wrongly put a trailing
comma at the end of every line.  The makes csv parsers pick up an extra, blank
column at the end.  Our sqlite query didn't notice, but these commas interfere
with the melt, creating a whole set of junk rows at the end:</p>
<p><img src="https://csvbase.com/blog-static/melts-are-for-melts.png" alt="csv file in terminal with junk at the end"></p>
<p>The effects of that extra comma can be removed via pandas by adding one more
thing to our method chain: <code>.iloc[:, :-1]</code>, which effectively says "give me all
rows ("<code>:</code>") and all but the last column ("<code>:-1</code>").  So:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl -s https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist.zip <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
gunzip <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
python3 -c <span>'import sys, pandas as pd</span>
<span>pd.read_csv(sys.stdin).iloc[:, :-1].melt("Date")\</span>
<span>.to_csv(sys.stdout, index=False)'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Does everyone who uses this file have to repeat this data shitwork?</p>
<p>Tragically, the answer is yes.  As they say: "data janitor: nobody's dream,
everyone's job".</p>
<p>In full fairness, though, the ECB foreign exchange data is probably in the top
10% of all open data releases.  Usually, getting viable tabular data out of
someone is a much more tortuous and involved process.</p>
<p>Some things we didn't have to do in this case: negotiate access (for example by
paying money or talking to a salesman); deposit our email address/company
name/job title into someone's database of qualified leads, observe any quota;
authenticate (often a substantial side-quest of its own), read any API docs at
all or deal with any issues more serious than basic formatting and shape.</p>
<p>So <code>eurofxref-hist.zip</code> is, relatively speaking, pretty nice actually.</p>
<p>But anyway - I'll put my cleaned up copy <a href="https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist">into a csvbase
table</a> so you, dear reader, can
skip the tedium and just have fun.</p>
<p>Here's how I do that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl -s https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist.zip <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
gunzip <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
python3 -c <span>'import sys, pandas as pd</span>
<span>pd.read_csv(sys.stdin).iloc[:, :-1].melt("Date")\</span>
<span>.to_csv(sys.stdout, index=False)'</span> <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
<span># this is the new bit: \</span>
curl -n --upload-file - <span>\</span>
<span>'https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist?public=yes'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>All I've done is add another <code>curl</code>, to HTTP PUT the csv file into csvbase.
<code>--upload-file -</code> uploads from standard input to the given url (via HTTP PUT).
If the table doesn't already exist in csvbase, it is created.  <code>-n</code> adds my
<a href="https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist/docs#authentication">credentials</a>
from my <code>~/.netrc</code>.  That's it.  Simples.</p>
<h2>Drawing pretty graphs</h2>
<p>Alright, now the data cleaning phase is over, let's do some more interesting stuff.</p>
<p>Let's graph the data:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl -s https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
grep USD <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
cut --delim<span>=</span>, -f <span>2</span>,4 <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
gnuplot -e <span>"set datafile separator ','; set term dumb; \</span>
<span>plot '-' using 1:2 with lines title 'usd'"</span>
</pre></div>
<p><img src="https://csvbase.com/blog-static/dumb-term.png" alt="a gnuplot graph in drawn in the
terminal"></p>
<p>That's somewhat legible for over 6000 datapoints in an 80x25 character
terminal.  You can make out the broad trend.  A reasonable <a href="https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Data-Ink_Ratio">data-ink
ratio</a>.</p>
<p>(If you're wondering how
<a href="https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist">https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist</a>
returns a webpage to your browser but a csv file to curl, see an <a href="https://csvbase.com/blog/2">earlier
blogpost</a>.)</p>
<p><code>gnuplot</code> is like a little mini-programming language of it's own.  Here's what
the above snippet does:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>set datafile separator ','</code> - says it's a csv</li>
<li><code>set term dumb</code> - draw ascii-art!</li>
<li><code>plot -</code> plot the data coming from standard input</li>
<li><code>using 1:2 with lines</code> draw lines from columns 1 and 2 (the date and the rate
respectively)</li>
<li><code>title 'usd'</code> name the line</li>
</ul>
<p>You can, of course, also draw graphs to proper images:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl -s https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
grep USD <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
cut --delim<span>=</span>, -f <span>2</span>,4 <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
gnuplot -e <span>"set datafile separator ','; set term svg; \</span>
<span>set output 'usd.svg'; set xdata time; set timefmt '%Y-%m-%d'; \</span>
<span>set format x '%Y-%m-%d'; set xtics rotate; \</span>
<span>plot '-' using 1:2 with lines title 'usd'"</span>
</pre></div>
<p><img alt="a gnuplot graph of usd:eur" src="https://csvbase.com/blog-static/usd.svg">
</p>
<p>Outputting to SVG is only a bit more complicated than ascii art.  In order for
it look decent you need to help gnuplot understand that it's "timeseries"
data - ie: that the x axis is time; give a format for that time and then tell
it to rotate the markings on the x axis so that they are readable.  It's a bit
wordy though: let's bind it to bash function so we can reuse it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>plot_timeseries_to_svg <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># $1 is the first param</span>
    gnuplot -e <span>"set datafile separator ','; set term svg; \</span>
<span>    set output '</span><span>$1</span><span>.svg'; set xdata time; set timefmt '%Y-%m-%d'; \</span>
<span>    set format x '%Y-%m-%d'; set xtics rotate; \</span>
<span>    plot '-' using 1:2 with lines title '</span><span>$1</span><span>'"</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Rolling averages, new tools and the csvbase mnemonic</h2>
<p>So far, so good.  But it would be nice to try out more sophisticated analyses:
let's try putting a nice rolling average in so that we can see a trend line:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl -s https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
duckdb -csv -c <span>"select Date, avg(value) over \</span>
<span>(order by date rows between 100 preceding and current row) \</span>
<span>as rolling from read_csv_auto('/dev/stdin')</span>
<span>where variable = 'USD';"</span> <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
plot_timeseries_to_svg rolling
</pre></div>
<p><img alt="a rolling averaged gnuplot graph of usd:eur" src="https://csvbase.com/blog-static/rolling.svg">
</p>
<p>Smooth.  If you don't have <code>duckdb</code> installed, it's not hard to adapt the above
for <code>sqlite3</code> (the query is the same).  DuckDB is a tool I wanted to show
because it's a lot like sqlite but instead is columnar (rather than
row-oriented).  However for me the main value is that it has a lot of easy
ergonomics.</p>
<p>Here is one of them: you can load csvs into table files straight from HTTP:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- it works with csvbase!</span>
<span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> </span><span>eurofxref_hist</span><span> </span><span>AS</span><span> </span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span></span>
<span>read_csv_auto</span><span>(</span><span>"https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p><img src="https://csvbase.com/blog-static/duckdb-download.png" alt="eurofxref-hist in duckdb"></p>
<p>That's pretty easy, and DuckDB does a reasonable job of inferring types.  There
are a lot of other usability niceties too: for example, it helpfully detects
your terminal size and abridges tables by default rather than flooding your
terminal with an enormous resultset.  It has a progress bar for big queries!
It can output markdown tables!  Etc!</p>
<h2>Open data is also an open API</h2>
<p>A lot is possible with a zipfile of data and just the programs that are either
already installed or a quick <code>brew install</code>/<code>apt install</code> away.  I remember how
impressed I was when I was first shown this <code>eurofxref-hist.zip</code> by an old hand
from foreign exchange when I worked in a bank.  It was so simple: the simplest
cross-organisation data interchange protocol I had then seen (and probably
since).</p>
<p>A mere zipfile with a csv in it seems so diminutive, but in fact an enormous
mass of financial applications use this particular zipfile every day.  I'm
pretty sure that's why they've left those commas in - if they removed them now
they'd break a lot of code.</p>
<p>When open data is made really easily available, it also functions double duty
as an open API.  After all, for the largeish fraction of APIs in which are less
about calling remote functions than about exchanging data, what is the
functional difference?</p>
<p>So I think the ECB's zipfile is a pretty good starting point for a data
interchange format.  I love the simplicity - and I've tried to keep that with
csvbase.</p>
<p>In csvbase, every table has a single url, following the form:</p>
<p><code>https://csvbase.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;table_name&gt;</code></p>
<p>eg</p>
<p><a href="https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist">https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist</a></p>
<p>And on each url, there are four main verbs:</p>
<p>When you <code>GET</code>: you get a csv (<a href="https://csvbase.com/blog/2">or a web page, if you're in a
browser</a>).</p>
<p>When you <code>PUT</code> a new csv: you create a new table, or overwrite the existing one.</p>
<p>When you <code>POST</code> a new csv: you bulk add more rows to an existing table.</p>
<p>When you <code>DELETE</code>: that table is no more.</p>
<p>To authenticate, just use <a href="https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/eurofxref-hist/docs#authentication">HTTP Basic
Auth</a>.</p>
<p>Could it be any simpler?  If you can think of a way: <a href="mailto:cal@calpaterson.com">write me an
email</a>.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>I said above that most SQL databases don't have a "melt" operation.  The ones
that I know of that do are
<a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/unpivot">Snowflake</a> and
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-using-pivot-and-unpivot?view=sql-server-ver16">MS SQL
Server</a>.
One question that SQL-knowers frequently ask is: why does anyone use R or
Pandas at all when SQL already exists?  A key reason is that R and Pandas are
very strong on data cleanup.</p>
<p>One under-appreciated feature of bash pipelines is that they are multi-process.
Each program runs independently, in it's own process.  While curl is
downloading data from the web, grep is filtering it, sqlite is querying it and
perhaps curl is uploading it again, etc.  All in parallel, which can,
surprisingly, make it <a href="https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html">very competitive with fancy cloud
alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>Why was the Euro so weak back in 2000?  It was launched, without coins or
notes, in January 1999.  The Euro was, initially, a sort of in-game currency
for the European Union.  It existed only inside banks - so there were no notes
or coins for it.  That all came later.  So did belief - early on it didn't look
like the little Euro was going to make it: so the rate against the Dollar was
0.8252.  That means that in October 2000, a Dollar would buy you 1.21 Euros (to
reverse exchange rates, do <code>1/rate</code>).  Nowadays the Euro is much stronger: a
Dollar would buy you less than 1 Euro.</p>

<p>Google makes a big deal out of its partnership with iFixit and the availability of replacement parts for its products, but one Google product that doesn't seem fixable is the Pixel Watch. After spotting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/10q3i5j/any_repairs_possible/">some posts</a> from <a href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/221719013/pixel-watch-cracked-screen?hl=en">Pixel Watch users</a> seeking a remedy after cracking the glass and coming up with no clear answers, The Verge got Google to confirm that, even 11 months after launch, there is no repair plan right now. Google can't fix your watch. There are no parts.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson told The Verge "At this moment, we don’t have any repair option for the Google Pixel Watch. If your watch is damaged, you can contact the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options."</p>
<p>Damage like a cracked display isn't covered under any kind of warranty, so buying a new device is the only official option. And with no parts stream to power the unofficial repair industry, the only way to actually fix a Pixel Watch would be to destroy another one. That's a repair model that can work for very popular devices where there are many devices to salvage, but with Pixel Watches being a rarely sold item, you'll be hard-pressed to find any spare parts. That's a shame because iFixit's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pixel-watch-teardown-shows-off-ugly-insides-gives-strong-first-gen-vibes/">repair analysis</a> found a device that wasn't all that hard to take apart, and it wouldn't be difficult to replace the screen if you could get one.
</p><p>The Pixel Watch really needs repair options, too. The whole top half of the watch is one big glass hemisphere, so it's <a href="https://twitter.com/chriswelch/status/1580245453492260865">not difficult</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/y2yppb/i_broke_my_pixel_watch_screen_but_it_simply/">bang</a> one of the glass corners into something and shatter the watch. This might all seem like it's against the spirit of Google's big <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/pixel-phone-repairs/">repairability announcement</a> in 2022, but that blog post says the program is for Pixel <em>phones</em>, not any of the other stuff Google sells. With the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/09/google-shows-off-the-pixel-8-and-pixel-watch-2-ahead-of-launch/">Pixel Watch 2</a> coming out soon, we'll be sure to ask Google if there are any repair plans this time.</p>

    <p>This article focuses on improving the modeling performance of LLMs by finetuning them using carefully curated datasets. Specifically, this article highlights strategies that involve modifying, utilizing, or manipulating the datasets for instruction-based finetuning rather than altering the model architecture or training algorithms (the latter will be topics of a future article). This article will also explain how you can prepare your own datasets to finetune open-source LLMs.</p>

<p>Note that the <a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/">NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge</a> is currently underway, aiming to train a Large Language Model on a single GPU within a 24-hour period, which is super interesting for practitioners and researchers interested in LLM efficiency. The techniques discussed in this article have direct relevance to this competition, and we will delve into how these dataset-centric strategies could potentially be applied within the challenge setting. Additionally, the article will offer suggestions for new experiments you might consider trying.</p>

<p>What is instruction-finetuning, and why should we care?</p>

<p>Instruction finetuning is a method used to improve the performance of language models like ChatGPT and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1694778155820217&amp;usg=AOvVaw3DfjwSmu9UDiKXYfwwNURe">Llama-2-chat</a> by having the model generate outputs for a range of example inputs paired with desired outputs. It allows for more controlled and desired behavior of the model in specific applications or tasks. Also, it can enhance the reliability, specificity, and safety of AI systems in real-world use cases.</p>

<p><img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2023/optimizing-llms-dataset-perspective/image1.png" alt="img">
<em>Annotated figure from <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1694778155821067&amp;usg=AOvVaw0b9IRsqGEu2lM_iI5nMzZM">InstructGPT paper</a></em></p>

<p>Instruction finetuning uses a dataset consisting of instruction-response pairs to improve an LLM’s instruction-following capabilities. Such a dataset for instruction finetuning typically consists of three components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Instruction text</li>
  <li>Input text (optional)</li>
  <li>Output text</li>
</ol>

<p>The example below lists two training examples, one without and one with an optional input text:</p>

<p><img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2023/optimizing-llms-dataset-perspective/image3.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>LLMs are then finetuned on these instruction datasets via next-token prediction (similar to pretraining). The difference from pretraining is that the model sees the whole instruction and input text as a context before it’s tasked to carry out the next-token prediction to generate the output text in an autoregressive fashion, illustrated below.</p>

<p><img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2023/optimizing-llms-dataset-perspective/image2.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>This above-mentioned process for finetuning an LLM to generate the desired output in an iterative, token-wise fashion is also referred to as supervised finetuning.</p>

<p>In practice, there is an additional optional finetuning stage following supervised finetuning, which uses additional preference data and ranking labels from human annotators who compare responses generated by LLMs. This process is also known as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), but it is out-of-scope for this article, which focuses on the instruction datasets themselves. (However, I have an optional article on RLHF <a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/llm-training-rlhf-and-its-alternatives">here</a> if you want to learn more.)</p>

          The Finetuning Pipeline and Dataset Origins <a href="#the-finetuning-pipeline-and-dataset-origins">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>When finetuning LLMs, datasets for instruction finetuning can be sourced in multiple ways:</p>

<p><strong>1. Human-created:</strong> Expert annotators can provide explicit instructions and feedback, creating datasets for instruction finetuning. This is particularly useful for domain-specific tasks or for reducing particular biases or unwanted behaviors.</p>

<p><strong>2. LLM-generated:</strong> We can generate a vast amount of potential input-output pairs using an existing LLM (if the terms of service permit). These can then be refined or rated by humans for quality and then used to finetune a new LLM. This method is usually more efficient than the abovementioned human-created approach because an available LLM, such as GPT-4 (via the API interface), can generate a large number of potential examples in a short time.</p>

<p>The LLM finetuning pipeline using human-created or LLM-generated data is summarized in the recent and excellent <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10792">Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models</a></em> survey:</p>

<p><img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2023/optimizing-llms-dataset-perspective/image5.png" alt="img">
<em>Figure from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10792">Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models</a> paper</em></p>

<p>Additionally, we can also potentially combine both human-created and LLM-generated instruction data to get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>The upcoming sections will discuss LLM-generated and human-created datasets for instruction finetuning in more detail, including the recent research highlights.</p>
      <h2 id="llm-generated-datasets">
        
        
          LLM-generated datasets <a href="#llm-generated-datasets">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Dataset labeling has been a bottleneck in machine learning ever since. As a human annotator, simple labeling tasks like categorizing an image as “cat” or “dog” are already considered laborious when it has to be done at scale.</p>

<p>Tasks requiring long-form text annotations can be even more time-consuming and challenging. So, a lot of effort has been devoted towards generating datasets for instruction finetuning automatically using existing LLMs.</p>



<p><strong>Self-Instruct</strong></p>

<p>One of the most prominent and widely used methods for LLM-generated datasets is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560">Self-Instruct</a>.</p>

<p>So, how does it work? Briefly, it involves four stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Seed task pool with a set of human-written instructions (175 in this case) and sample instructions;</li>
  <li>Use a pretrained LLM (like GPT-3) to determine the task category;</li>
  <li>Given the new instruction, let a pretrained LLM generate the response;</li>
  <li>Collect, prune, and filter the responses before adding them to the task pool.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2023/optimizing-llms-dataset-perspective/image4.jpg" alt="img"></p>

<p>An early popular application of Self-Instruct was the <a href="https://github.com/gururise/AlpacaDataCleaned">Alpaca dataset</a>, which consists of 52k LLM-generated instruction-response pairs. Alpaca was used to create the first finetuning <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971">Llama v1</a> model earlier this year.</p>



<p><strong>Backtranslation</strong></p>

<p>Another interesting type of approach involves working backward from the responses and generating the corresponding instructions via LLMs.</p>

<p>In other words, rather than gathering datasets for instruction finetuning from human writers, it’s possible to employ an LLM to produce instruction-response pairs (also known as distillation).</p>

<p>In a paper titled <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06259">Self-Alignment with Instruction Backtranslation</a></em>, researchers refined LLMs via “instruction backtranslation” and found that this method surpasses those trained on distillation datasets like Alpaca.</p>

<p>Note that the <a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/">NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge</a>, which is centered around training 1 LLM for 1 Day on 1 GPU, does not permit LLM-generated datasets.</p>

<p>So, in the next section, <em>High-Quality Datasets</em>, we will focus on human-generated instruction datasets that we can use as an alternative.</p>

<p>If you are interested in participating in the <a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/">NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge</a>, I’ve written a <a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt/blob/main/tutorials/neurips_challenge_quickstart.md">quick starter tutorial here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A Note About LLM-generated Datasets and Imitation Models</strong></p>

<p>Before we jump into the discussion of human-generated datasets for instruction finetuning, I wanted to share a brief word of caution regarding LLM-generated datasets. Yes, generating datasets via LLMs may sound too good to be true, so it is important to evaluate LLMs finetuned on LLM-generated datasets extra carefully.</p>

<p>For instance, in a recent <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15717">The False Promise of Imitating Proprietary LLMs</a></em> paper, researchers observed that crowd workers gave high ratings to LLMs trained on LLM-generated data. However, these so-called “imitation models” primarily replicated the style of the upstream LLMs they were trained on rather than their factual accuracy.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>In the previous section, we discussed datasets generated by LLMs. Now, let’s switch gears and examine a high-quality, human-generated dataset, which is also allowed in the <a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/">NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge</a>.</p>

<p><strong>LIMA</strong></p>

<p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206">The LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment</a></em> paper shows that quality trumps quantity when instruction finetuning datasets.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers carefully selected 1,000 instruction pairs to finetune the 65-billion-parameter Llama-v1 model, known as LIMA, using supervised finetuning.</p>

<p>Notably, other finetuned Llama models, such as Alpaca, were trained on a considerably larger dataset of 52,000 LLM-generated instruction pairs. In selected benchmarks, LIMA outperformed models that employed Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) methods, including ChatGPT and GPT-3.5.</p>

<p>This section explains how to finetune open-source LLMs on instruction datasets like LIMA using the <a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt">Lit-GPT repository</a>.</p>

<p>(Note that the <a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/">NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge</a> organizers cleared LIMA for the competition. The NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge organizers also selected Lit-GPT as the starter kit since the code is relatively easy to use and customize, which is an essential prerequisite for exploring new research directions.)</p>

<p>As of this writing, the currently supported models in Lit-GPT are the following:</p>

<p>For this brief walkthrough, we will use the 7B parameter <a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt">Llama 2 base model</a> and finetune it on LIMA.</p>

<p>Assuming you have cloned the Lit-GPT repository, you can get started via the following three steps:</p>

<p>1) Download and prepare the model:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>HF_TOKEN</span><span>=</span>your_token

python scripts/download.py <span>\</span>
 <span>--repo_id</span> meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>python scripts/convert_hf_checkpoint.py <span>\</span>
 <span>--checkpoint_dir</span> meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
</code></pre></div>

<p>2) Prepare the dataset:</p>

<div><pre><code>python scripts/prepare_lima.py <span>\</span>
 <span>--checkpoint_dir</span> checkpoints/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
</code></pre></div>

<p>3) Finetune the model using low-rank adaptation (LoRA):</p>

<div><pre><code>python finetune/lora.py <span>\</span>
 <span>--checkpoint_dir</span> checkpoints/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf <span>\</span>
 <span>--data_dir</span> data/lima
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that the –checkpoint_dir argument is required for preparing the dataset in step 2 because the dataset preparation is model-dependent. Different LLMs may use different tokenizers and special tokens, so it’s important to prepare the dataset accordingly.</p>

<p>I am skipping a detailed explanations of the LoRA finetuning procedure to keep this article focused on the dataset perspective. However, if you are interested in learning more, you can see my article <a href="https://lightning.ai/pages/community/finetuning-falcon-efficiently/">Finetuning Falcon LLMs More Efficiently With LoRA and Adapters</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, you may also find my <a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt/blob/main/tutorials/neurips_challenge_quickstart.md">NeurIPS 2023 LLM Efficiency Challenge Quickstart Guide</a> article helpful, where I walk through the setup, finetuning, and model evaluation step by step.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Tip</strong></p>

<p>According<a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/question"> to the official competition rules</a>, the maximum context length used for the evaluation is 2,048 tokens. Hence, I recommend preparing the dataset with a maximum length of 2,048 tokens:</p>

<div><pre><code>python scripts/prepare_lima.py <span>\</span>
  <span>--checkpoint_dir</span> checkpoints/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf <span>\</span>
  <span>--max_seq_length</span> 2048
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively you can edit the  <a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt/blob/main/finetune/lora.py%23L37">finetune/lora.py</a><a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt/blob/main/finetune/lora.py%23L37"> file</a> and change <code>override_max_seq_length = None</code> to <code>override_max_seq_length = 2048</code> to reduce the GPU memory requirements.</p>

<p>In addition, I also suggest modifying the set max_iter setting and change it to <code>max_iter = 1000</code> to finetune for ~1 pass over the LIMA dataset, which consists of 1k training examples.</p>

<p><img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2023/optimizing-llms-dataset-perspective/image9.png" alt="img"></p><hr>



<p>For reference, finetuning a 7B parameter model on 52k instruction pairs, such as in Alpaca, takes about 1 hour on an A100 GPU when using LoRA with default settings. Note that LIMA is 50x smaller than Alpaca, so finetuning will only take a few minutes.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>As of this writing, there are currently multiple finetuning datasets supported in <a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt">Lit-GPT</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2023/optimizing-llms-dataset-perspective/image12.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt/blob/main/tutorials/prepare_dataset.md">Dolly</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt/blob/main/tutorials/prepare_dataset.md%23lima">LIMA</a> datasets are human-generated and should thus be fine for use in the <a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/">NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are interested in using different datasets to customize LLMs for your projects, the next section will briefly explain how this works.</p>
      <h2 id="preparing-new-and-custom-datasets">
        
        
          Preparing New and Custom Datasets <a href="#preparing-new-and-custom-datasets">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>In addition to the existing datasets mentioned above, you might be interested in adding new datasets or using your own datasets to finetune custom open-source LLMs.</p>

<p>There are two main ways to prepare a dataset for the LLMs in Lit-GPT:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using the scripts/prepare_csv.py script to read an instruction dataset from a CSV file.</li>
  <li>Creating a custom scripts/prepare_dataset.py script similar to LIMA, which we used earlier.</li>
</ol>

<p>The easiest way to prepare a new dataset is to read it from a CSV file using the  scripts/prepare_csv.py script in Lit-GPT. All you need is a CSV file that has the three column headers as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2023/optimizing-llms-dataset-perspective/image10.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>Assuming you exported this dataset as MyDataset.csv, you can then prepare and finetune the model as follows:</p>

<p>1) Prepare the dataset:</p>

<div><pre><code>python scripts/prepare_csv.py <span>\</span>
  <span>--csv_dir</span> MyDataset.csv <span>\</span>
  <span>--checkpoint_dir</span> checkpoints/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
</code></pre></div>

<p>2) Finetune the model using low-rank adaptation (LoRA):</p>

<div><pre><code>python finetune/lora.py <span>\</span>
  <span>--data_dir</span> /data/csv <span>\</span>
  <span>--checkpoint_dir</span> checkpoints/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
</code></pre></div>

<p>There are additional options for determining the random seed or train/split available that you can access via</p>

<div><pre><code>python scripts/prepare_csv.py <span>--help</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you are interested in the second option, creating a prepare_dataset.py script similar to LIMA, I added an explanation to the <a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt/blob/main/tutorials/prepare_dataset.md%23preparing-custom-datasets-for-instruction-finetuning">Lit-GPT documentation here</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="additional-datasets-to-consider">
        
        
          Additional Datasets to Consider <a href="#additional-datasets-to-consider">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The previous section covered how to prepare custom datasets for open-source LLMs in Lit-GPT. If you don’t have your own dataset you want to experiment with but want to experiment with existing datasets (for example, the NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge is restricted to publicly available datasets), here are a few pointers for datasets to explore.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/">NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge</a> in mind, the list focuses on human-generated English datasets, not LLM-generated datasets.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1">Open Assistant</a></strong> (multi-lingual) is a collection of assistant-like conversations created and annotated by humans. It contains 161,443 messages in 35 languages, enriched with 461,292 quality evaluations, resulting in more than 10,000 comprehensively annotated conversation trees. This dataset results from a global crowdsourcing initiative that engaged over 13,500 volunteers.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08773">Natural Instructions</a></strong> is an English instruction dataset handcrafted with 193K entries, spanning 61 unique NLP tasks.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207">P3 (Public Pool of Prompts)</a></strong> is an instruction finetuning dataset constructed using 170 English NLP datasets and 2,052 English prompts. Prompts, sometimes named task templates, map a data instance in a conventional NLP task (e.g., question answering, text classification) to a natural language input-output pair.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13688">Flan 2021</a></strong> is an English instruction dataset compilation created by converting 62 popular NLP benchmarks (including SNLI, AG News, and others) into pairs of language inputs and outputs.</p>
      <h2 id="research-directions-to-explore">
        
        
          Research Directions to Explore <a href="#research-directions-to-explore">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Now that we have covered the why and how related to instruction-finetuning, what interesting research directions can we explore to boost the performance of open-source LLMS?</p>



<p><strong>Merging Datasets</strong></p>

<p>Besides the P3 and Flan 2021 datasets mentioned above, I have not seen attempts to create larger datasets by combining datasets from multiple sources. For instance, it could make sense to experiment with combinations of LIMA and Dolly, and so forth.</p>



<p><strong>Dataset Ordering</strong></p>

<p>Following up on the dataset merging idea mentioned above, it could be interesting to explore the role of visiting different data points in different orders (for example, sorted or shuffled by the type of instruction). Besides the pretraining experiments done in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01373">Pythia paper</a>, I have not seen any studies on dataset ordering in the context of instruction finetuning.</p>



<p><strong>Multiple-Epoch Training</strong></p>

<p>Due to the large dataset size requirements, LLMs are usually pretrained for less than one epoch, which means that they don’t revisit data points multiple times. While computational costs are one reason for this, another is that LLMs can be prone to overfitting. Nonetheless, with many overfitting-reduction techniques at our disposal, studying multi-epoch training in the context of LLMs would be interesting.</p>

<p>For instance, it’s possible to train LLMs on a small dataset like LIMA in a few minutes. Would it make sense to iterate over the dataset multiple times?</p>



<p><strong>Automatic Quality-filtering</strong></p>

<p>Does it make sense to adopt dataset filtering as a default?</p>

<p>Related to the LIMA study discussed earlier, the <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08701">AlpaGasus: Training A Better Alpaca with Fewer Data</a></em> paper also emphasizes that a larger dataset isn’t necessarily advantageous for finetuning LLMs. In the <em>AlpaGasus</em> study, the researchers employed ChatGPT to pinpoint low-quality instruction-response pairs in the original 52,000-instance Alpaca dataset. They discovered that reducing this to just 9,000 high-quality pairs actually enhanced performance when training Llama-v1 LLMs with 7 billion and 13 billion parameters.</p>

<p><img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2023/optimizing-llms-dataset-perspective/image11.jpg" alt="img">
<em>Annotated figure from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08701">AlpaGasus paper</a></em></p>

<p>However, as mentioned earlier, the <a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/">NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge</a> does not permit LLM-generated datasets. So, this Alpaca-based Alpagasus dataset would not be useful for this competition.</p>

<p>A viable alternative to AlpaGasus might be to use an LLM to filter human-generated (instead of LLM-generated) datasets. However, I’m uncertain if using LLM-based dataset filtering is allowed, so it would be important to confirm with the organizers on their Discord channel before using such datasets in the competition.</p>

<p>The upcoming sections will explain how to use datasets such as LIMA for training the latest open-source LLMs. Additionally, I will also highlight interesting research directions to try in the <a href="https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/">NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>This article covered instruction finetuning and explained the advantages of LLM-generated and human-generated datasets. We also went over a quick tutorial explaining how to finetune open-source LLMs with different datasets and how to use our own datasets to create custom LLMs. Compared to proprietary APIs and services, such custom LLMs can help leverage specific datasets at your company, improve LLMs on certain use cases, and give you full privacy control.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>Erasing your digital footprint could get a lot easier by 2026.</p><p>California lawmakers on Thursday passed a bill known as the Delete Act that would allow consumers, with a single request, to have every data broker delete their personal information. Data brokers include a variety of businesses that gather and sell people’s personal information, such as their address, marital status and spending habits. Those companies include credit reporting agencies, people-search sites and data analytic firms that work with political campaigns.</p><p>The Senate approved the legislation Thursday, a day after it was passed by the Assembly. The bill heads to the governor’s desk for consideration.</p><p>Under <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB362" target="_blank">Senate Bill 362</a>, the California Privacy Protection Agency by January 2026 would create a way for consumers to ask that their records be erased through a single request. Roughly 500 <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/data-brokers" target="_blank"><u>data brokers</u></a> are registered in California, so reaching out to every single broker can be time-consuming. </p><p>Currently, it’s not always clear what information consumer data companies have or share. Businesses also might deny deletion requests or not respond.</p><p>The passage of SB 362 builds upon a sweeping data privacy bill lawmakers passed in 2018 with the California Consumer Privacy Act, which gave consumers the right to ask businesses to delete their personal data but through an unwieldy process.</p><p>Sen. Josh Becker (D-Menlo Park) said on the Senate floor that the bill would allow consumers to get sensitive information held by data brokers, including about reproductive healthcare and geolocation, erased. </p><p>“This bill will help Californians actually exercise the right to delete their information from data brokers and protect our right to privacy,” Becker said. </p><p>The California attorney general’s office sent a letter to Becker on Tuesday expressing support for the bill. In the letter, the office said the right to delete information from businesses is limited to data collected from the consumer. Data brokers might not always collect data directly from the consumer, creating a “loophole” in California’s privacy law. </p><p>Businesses, including advertisers, lobbied aggressively against the legislation, saying it would “destroy California’s data-driven economy.” Businesses use data to serve  personalized ads, and credit bureaus use personal information to verify people’s identities. </p><p>Dan Smith, president and CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Assn., said in a statement that the bill could have “unintended consequences.” The association represents credit bureaus and background-check companies. </p><p>“The bill undermines consumer fraud protections, hurts small businesses’ ability to compete, and solidifies the big platforms’ data dominance,” Smith said. “It also empowers third parties to request to delete consumers’ data with no guardrails.”</p><p>The bill’s supporters say consumers would have more control over their personal data online, which data brokers often collect without their consent or knowledge. They also point to scenarios in which people’s personal data could end up in the hands of scammers and other bad actors. </p><p>Amid resistance from businesses, Becker made changes to the bill. Consumers could exclude certain data brokers from their deletion request and there are exemptions. Starting in August 2026, data brokers would be required to delete all personal information of the consumer at least once every 45 days. An earlier version of the bill gave data brokers 31 days to do this. They would also be barred from selling or sharing new personal data.</p><p>If a data broker denies a deletion request because it can’t verify it, the request would be processed “as an opt-out of the sale or sharing of the consumer’s personal information.”</p> </div></div>]]></description>

While Google gave people the option to turn off their “location history” and explicitly stated the company would not track the places they went if they chose this option, the company “continued to collect and store that user’s location data through other sources”, including through a user’s “web and app activity” tracker, which the attorney general said continues to be on by default.</p><p>The AG’s office further alleged that Google “deceived users about their ability to opt out of advertisements targeted to their location”.</p><p>While Google is not admitting any fault as part of the settlement, the company did agree to several other terms in addition to paying $93m. Those conditions include being more transparent about its location tracking practices; notifying users before location information is used to build ad profiles to target specific people; and getting approval from Google’s internal privacy working group before making any material changes to privacy.</p><p>José Castañeda, a Google spokesperson, told the Guardian: “Consistent with improvements we’ve made in recent years, we have settled this matter, which was based on outdated product policies that we changed years ago.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-8">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-8" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Google previously <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2022-11-14/40-states-settle-google-location-tracking-charges-for-392m" data-link-name="in body link">settled a similar lawsuit</a> brought by 40 states’ attorneys general, which levied the same allegations about its deceptive location privacy practices, for nearly $392m in 2022.</p></div></div>]]></description>

consumer goods companies are not cooperating in efforts to cut the price of thousands of staples despite a fall in the cost of raw materials.</p><p>In this he is backed by the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, who in June summoned 75 big retailers and consumer groups to his ministry urging them to cut prices. After a new round of meetings last month, Le Maire said Unilever, Nestlé and PepsiCo were among companies not toeing the line on prices.</p><p>Lindt’s “chocolat au lait extra fin” was one of three of the Swiss chocolatier’s products named by Carrefour in its shrinkflation list.</p><p>“Lindt &amp; Sprüngli increased its prices group-wide on average by 9.3% in line with local cost structures,” a company spokesperson told Reuters. “We have made a concerted effort to compensate for increased costs by increasing efficiency as much as possible. Therefore, we have only passed on the costs we could not absorb ourselves in the form of price increases to our customers.”</p><p>PepsiCo did not respond to a request for comment. Nestlé and Unilever declined to comment.</p><p>Consumer groups say shrinkflation is a widespread practice, which supermarkets like Carrefour are also guilty of in their own-label products.</p><p>The shrinkflation warnings are in all French Carrefour stores, and will last until the targeted suppliers agree to price cuts, Bompais said. The retailer could extend warnings to other goods, but does not plan to extend the initiative to other countries.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pikuma.com/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor">https://pikuma.com/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37522700">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The history of both <i>Vi &amp; Vim</i> goes hand in hand with the history of open-source software itself. This article is a trip back to the origins of UNIX text editors. Let's look at the important players and historical events that shaped their evolution.</p><div>
                        <p>I went to East London last week to visit my wife's alma mater, <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Queen Mary University</a>. As I stopped to grab a cup of coffee, I received a message saying that <a href="https://moolenaar.net/" target="_blank">Bram Moolenaar</a>, the creator of Vim, had passed.</p>
                        <p>To be honest, with a new family member keeping me busy at home, and a new course on MIPS assembler that I'm recording for <a href="https://pikuma.com/courses" target="_blank">my school</a>, I am finding very difficult to keep up with the latest news. So, I confess that I received the news of Bram's passing almost a week too late.</p>
                        <p>I did not know Bram personally and I am far from being a Vim <i>connoisseur,</i> but the fact that I was visiting Queen Mary University forced me to stop for a moment and reflect on how that place was connected to the long and vibrant history of Vim.</p>
                        <p>Queen Mary University had an important role in the history of the Vim editor. It was here that, in 1973, the first UNIX system of the UK was installed, and it was also here that professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Coulouris_(computer_scientist)%22" target="_blank">George Coulouris</a> developed an editor called <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gc/history/" target="_blank">em</a>. The creation of <i>em</i> ended up snowballing into the development of <i>vi</i> and many other <i>vi clones</i> after that.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/queen-mary-university.png" alt="queen mary college"></p><div><p><a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Queen Mary University of London</a>, where George Coulouris taught in 1976.</p></div>
                        <h3>Ed</h3>
                        <p>The UNIX shell is extremely text-heavy. Executables are invoked via text, parameters are passed via text, streams of data flow up and down the system via text, and virtually everything in the OS shell is done with tokens of text. It is no surprise that UNIX users are so passionate about text editors.</p>
                        <p>We should probably start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)" target="_blank">ed</a>, which was a command-line editor created by Ken Thompson designed to work well with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter" target="_blank">teleprinters</a> rather than display terminals.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/teleprinter.png" alt="teleprinter unix"></p><p>Teletype Model 15 teleprinter.</p>
                        <p>Ed is what we call a <i>line editor.</i> Editing one line at a time made perfect sense for <i>teleprinters,</i> but with the popularity of video displays taking over, most users found frustrating having to work with <i>ed.</i> That included Queen Mary's George Coulouris, who considered <i>ed's</i> commands to be cryptic and not suitable for <i>"mortals".</i></p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/ed-editor.png" alt="ed editor"></p><p>Ed (line) editor.</p>
                        <p>Ken Thompson's <i>ed</i> was inspired by another editor called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED_(text_editor)" target="_blank">QED</a> (quick editor). QED was also a line-oriented editor for teleprinters developed for the <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/181/730" target="_blank">SDS 940 console</a>. Ken Thompson rewrote QED using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL" target="_blank">BCPL</a> to run on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics" target="_blank">MULTICS</a> (the precursor to UNIX).</p>
                        <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: Ed became the defacto line-mode editor for UNIX, and it remains a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX" target="_blank">POSIX</a> standard to this very day. After all, <a href="https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs249/Resources/ed_is_the_standard_text_editor.html" target="_blank"><i>"Ed is the standard text editor"</i></a>.</p>

                        <h3>Em</h3>
                        <p>Following a series of frustrations with <i>ed,</i> in February of 1976, while acting as a lecturer at Queen Mary College, Coulouris decided to enhance <i>ed</i> using Ken Thompson's original source code as a starting point. That's how the editor <a href="https://github.com/rsdoiel/em-1.0.0" target="_blank">em</a> (Ed for Mortals) came to be.
                        </p><p>Coulouris' <i>em</i> was designed to work well with display terminals. It was a single-line-at-a-time visual editor, and it was also one of the first programs on UNIX to make heavy use of <i>"raw terminal input mode",</i> in which the running program (rather than the terminal device driver) handled all keystrokes.</p>
                        <p>But George Coulouris was not the only one disappointed with <i>ed.</i> Across the pond, more people were getting frustrating working with Ken Thompson's line editor</p>
                        
                        <h3>Vi</h3>
                        <p>When Thompson visited <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a> in 1976, he brough with him a broken Pascal compiler for UNIX that needed to be fixed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy" target="_blank">Bill Joy</a>, a student from UC Berkeley, was in charge of fixing Thompson's Pascal system. As days passed, Joy noticed that <i>ed</i> was holding him back.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/uc-berkeley.jpg" alt="uc berkeley"></p><p><a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>, where Bill Joy was a graduate student when he developed <i>vi.</i></p> 
                        <p>In the summer of 1976, when George Coulouris visited UC Berkeley, he brought a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECtape" target="_blank">DECtape</a> containing <i>em</i> and showed it to various people at the university. Some considered this new type of text editor to be a resource hog, while others, including Bill Joy, were impressed with Coulouris' program.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/bill-joy.jpg" alt="bill joy"></p><p>Bill Joy was a graduate student at UC Berkeley and wrote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi" target="_blank">vi</a> text editor.</p>  
                        <p>Inspired by Coulouris' <i>em,</i> and by their own tweaks to Ken Thompson's <i>ed,</i> Bill Joy and Chuck Haley (both graduate students at UC Berkeley) created a new editor called <i>en.</i> Soon after, they "extended" the <i>en</i> editor and created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_(text_editor)" target="_blank">ex</a>. In October of 1977, Bill Joy added a full-screen visual mode to <i>ex,</i> which came to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi" target="_blank">vi</a>.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/vi-code-green.png" alt="vi text editor"></p><p>The <i>vi</i> editor is able to render and edit text in full-screen mode.</p>  
                        <p>Both <i>vi</i> and <i>ex</i> share their code. You can think of <i>vi</i> as launching <i>ex</i> with an extra parameter to enable the capability to render and edit the text onto a computer display terminal. In reality, <i>vi</i> is basically <i>ex's visual mode</i>.</p>
                        <p>The name "vi" comes from the abbreviated ex command (vi) to enter the visual mode from within the editor. Later, as most of us probably know, <i>vi</i> became the actual executable name that we invoke from the UNIX shell.</p>
                        <p>Joy also mentioned that many features of <i>vi</i> were inspired by an editor called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(editor)" target="_blank">Bravo</a>. Bravo was a bimodal text editor developed at Xerox PARC for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto" target="_blank">Xerox Alto</a>.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/xerox-alto.jpg" alt="xerox alto"></p><p>Bravo was a WYSIWYG document editor with multi-font capability using Xerox Alto's bitmap display.</p>  
                        <p>It's also important to mention that Bill Joy used an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A" target="_blank">ADM-3A</a> terminal to develop <i>vi.</i> In the ADM-3A, the <strong>Escape</strong> key is located on the far-left of the keyboard, similar to where the <strong>Tab</strong> key is located in most modern keyboards.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/adm3a-keyboard.jpg" alt="adm 3a terminal keyboard"></p><p>Many <i>vi</i> shortcuts and navigation keys that we still use today were based on the ADM-3A keyboard layout.</p>
                        <p>Besides ADM-3A's influence on vi key shortcuts, we must also note that Bill Joy was developing his editor connected to an extremely slow 300 baud modem.</p>
                        <p>Bill Joy is quoted in an <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2003/09/11/bill_joys_greatest_gift/" target="_blank">interview</a> on his process of writing <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>:</p>
                        <blockquote>"It took a long time. It was really hard to do because you've got to remember that I was trying to make it usable over a 300 baud modem. That's also the reason you have all these funny commands. It just barely worked to use a screen editor over a modem. It was just barely fast enough. A 1200 baud modem was an upgrade. 1200 baud now is pretty slow. 9600 baud is faster than you can read. 1200 baud is way slower. So the editor was optimized so that you could edit and feel productive when it was painting slower than you could think. Now that computers are so much faster than you can think, nobody understands this anymore."</blockquote>
                        <p>Joy also compares the development of <i>vi</i> and <i>Emacs</i>:</p>
                        <blockquote>"People doing Emacs were sitting in labs at MIT with what were essentially fibre-channel links to the host, in contemporary terms. They were working on a PDP-10, which was a huge machine by comparison, with infinitely fast screens. So they could have funny commands with the screen shimmering and all that, and meanwhile, I'm sitting at home in sort of World War II surplus housing at Berkeley with a modem and a terminal that can just barely get the cursor off the bottom line... It was a world that is now extinct."</blockquote>
                        <p>Bill Joy was also the one responsible at Berkeley for the creation of the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution" target="_blank">BSD</a> UNIX release in 1978, which included the editor <i>ex.</i> That helped amplify the popularity of his editor beyond the walls of UC Berkeley.</p>
                        <p>Most users were spending all their time in <i>ex's visual mode,</i> so Bill Joy decided to create an hard link called "<strong>vi</strong>" and add it to the second distribution of BSD in May of 1979.</p>
                        <p>Joy also claims that most of <i>vi's</i> popularity came from the fact that it was readily available and bundled with BSD, while other editors, like Emacs, could cost hundreds of dollars.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Vi Clones</h3>
                        <p>Many clone editors were developed based on <i>vi.</i> The idea was to either improve the original editor by adding features to it or port the <i>vi experience</i> to other platforms (Atari ST, Amiga, MS-DOS, OS/2, etc.). Bram Moolenaar's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Vim</a> started out as one of these ports.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Stevie</h5>
                        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Stevie</a> (ST Editor for VI Enthusiasts) was a <i>vi clone</i> developed for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST" target="_blank">Atari ST</a>.</p>
                        <p>Tim Thompson wrote the original version of Stevie and posted its source code as a free software to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.sys.atari.st?pli=1" target="_blank">comp.sys.atari.st</a> newsgroup on June of 1987. Stevie was later also ported to UNIX, OS/2, and Amiga.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/stevie-atari-st.jpg" alt="stevie atari st"></p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Stevie</a> text editor running on the Atari ST.</p>
                        <p>One super important detail is that Stevie was programmed from scratch and did not use any of <i>vi's</i> source code. The <i>vi</i> code was based on <i>ed's</i>, which was developed under AT&amp;T. Theoretically, that meant <i>vi</i> could only be used by those with an AT&amp;T source license. That's also why many <i>vi clones</i> would choose to use Stevie's source code instead of <i>vi's.</i></p>

                        <h5>Elvis</h5>
                        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Elvis</a> is an editor that holds a special place in my heart, since it was the first <i>vi clone</i> I've ever used professionally. I used to live in the south of Brazil, and I just got my first job as a computer programmer.</p>
                        <div>
                            <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/elvis-editor-logo.png" alt="elvis editor logo" width="180"></p>
                            <p>Elvis was my first contact with the whole <i>vi "way of doing things"</i>. We used Elvis back in the 90s to edit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS" target="_blank">MUMPS</a> and <a href="https://zimdatabases.com/" target="_blank">ZIM</a> source code to run on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX" target="_blank">HP-UX</a> and <a href="https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/29890" target="_blank">Solaris</a> servers. My first job was to migrate the old MUMPS database to use this shiny 4th gen. programming language called ZIM (which is now defunct).</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Many of our customers had their servers located in remote rural areas of the country, which meant internet connection was extremely slow or inexistent. If you ever had to connect and edit text on server where everything you type takes many seconds to appear on the screen, you soon understand what Bill Joy said about <i>vi</i> commands being funny-looking and often invoked via single-letter instructions.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/elvis-text-editor.png" alt="elvis vi clone"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Elvis</a> was one of the first <i>vi clones</i> to offer support for GUI and syntax highlighting.</p>
                        <p>Elvis creator, Steve Kirkendall, started thinking of writing his own editor after <i>Stevie</i> crashed on him, causing him to lose hours of work and damaging his confidence in the editor.</p>
                        <p><i>Stevie</i> stored the edit buffer in RAM, which Kirkendall believed to be impractical on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix" target="_blank">MINIX</a> operating system. One of Kirkendall's main motivation for writing his own <i>vi clone</i> was that his new editor stored the edit buffer in a file instead of storing it in RAM. Therefore, even if his editor crashed, the edited text could still be retrieved from that external file.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: When asked about why the name "Elvis", Kirkendall mentioned that at least part of the reason he chose the name was to see how many people would ask him why he chose the name! Besides that, it is common for <i>vi clones</i> to contain the letters "vi" somewhere in their names.</p>
                        <p>Elvis pioneered many ideas that were adopted in later clones. It was admired for its conciseness and for the number of features available, besides being the first clone to provide syntax highlighting and to generalize syntax highlighting to multiple file types.</p>
                        <p>The creator of MINIX, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_S._Tanenbaum" target="_blank">Andrew Tanenbaum</a>, asked the community to choose between <i>Stevie</i> and <i>Elvis</i> to be adopted as the main text editor for their OS. <i>Elvis</i> was chosen and it's the default text editor on MINIX until today.</p>

                        <h3>Vim</h3>
                        <p>And we finally arrive at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Vim</a>! Vim is arguably the most popular <i>vi clone</i> ever. It grew and evolved to become a monster program with a vibrant community that keeps growing. It almost feels wrong to call Vim a <i>vi clone</i>, but historically that's exactly what Vim was.</p>
                        <p>Inspired by a previous port of <i>Stevie</i> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga" target="_blank">Commodore Amiga</a>, Bram Moolenaar began working on Vim for the Amiga in 1988.</p>
                        <p>Yes, you read that right... Vim was originally developed for the Commodore Amiga! I'm always surprised to see that not many programmers know that, including those that use Vim daily.</p>
                        <p>Vim's first public release (v1.14) happened in 1991.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/vim-amiga.png" alt="vim editor amiga"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Vim</a> v1.14 running on the Commodore Amiga's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workbench_(AmigaOS)" target="_blank">Workbench</a>.</p>
                        <p>As you can see in the image above, the name "Vim" was an acronym for "Vi IMitation". The name changed to "Vi iMproved" in 1993.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: A public copy of Vim for the Amiga was included in <a href="http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/amiga/fish/501-600/ff591/" target="_blank">Fred Fish's disk #591</a>. Fred Fish was a computer programmer known for his work on GNU's <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/" target="_blank">GDB</a> and also for releasing a series of freeware disks for the Amiga. The <a href="http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/amiga/fish/" target="_blank">Fish Disks</a> series ran from 1986 to 1994. Fish would distribute his disks around the world, which were then distributed at computer stores and Amiga enthusiast clubs.</p>
                        <p>Basing Vim on <i>Stevie's</i> source code instead of using the original <i>vi</i> code meant the program could be distributed without requiring the AT&amp;T source license. Vim is released under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/vim-license.txt" target="_blank">Vim licence</a>, which includes some charityware clauses that encourage users to consider donating to children in Uganda.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/vim-start-screen.png" alt="vim start screen"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Vim</a> start screen.</p>
                        <p>Moolenaar was an advocate of a NGO based in Kibaale, Uganda, which he founded to support children whose parents have died of AIDS. In 1994, he volunteered as a water and sanitation engineer for the Kibaale Children's Centre and made several return trips over the following twenty-five years.</p>
                        <p>Vim's interface, like <i>vi</i>, is not based on menus or icons, but on commands given to a text interface. Vim also has a GUI mode that allows users to use menus and toolbars, but the most popular Vim mode is still its <i>text user interface</i> under the UNIX command-line.</p>
                        <p>Vim has a <i>vi compatibility mode,</i> but when that mode is not used, Vim has many enhancements over vi. Some examples are Unicode support, regular expressions, autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and many other small IDE-like features.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Vim Today</h5>
                        <p>Unlike the other <i>vi clones,</i> Vim is still actively developed and has a large community of users and developers. New features are still being developed and added to the text editor every year, making it even more powerful.</p>
                        <p>It also goes without saying that, besides its native features, Vim can be expanded to include one of the many (many!) third-party <a href="https://vimawesome.com/" target="_blank">plugins</a>. Combined with a powerful custom scripting language, <a href="https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/" target="_blank">VimScript</a>, Vim can be transformed into an incredibly productive programming tool.</p>
                        <p>I've decided to not mention any Vim plugin or entertain the idea of listing different Vim configurations in this article, since that was not the original goal of this blog post. If you ever watched any of <a href="https://pikuma.com/courses" target="_blank">my lectures</a>, you'll see that I <strong>do</strong> use Vim, but my editor configuration is extremely vanilla and, honestly, probably underwhelming. Besides some small cosmetic changes, the only plugin I added is one called <a href="http://ycm-core.github.io/YouCompleteMe/" target="_blank">YouCompleteMe</a>. But, as I mentioned, I'm sure there are better online resources out there if all you want is to pimp your Vim.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/origins-of-vim-text-editor/vim-modern.png" alt="vim text editor ide"></p><p>Vim can be expanded with plugins that will almost transform your editor into an IDE-like program.</p>
                        <p>Some important milestones from the early days of Vim's development:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1988</strong>: (Vim 1.0) Development of Vi IMitation on the Amiga</li>
                            <li><strong>1991</strong>: (Vim 1.14) First public release on Fred Fish disk #591</li>
                            <li><strong>1993</strong>: (Vim 1.22) Port to UNIX and renamed to Vi Improved</li>
                            <li><strong>1994</strong>: (Vim 3.0) Multiple windows</li>
                            <li><strong>1996</strong>: (Vim 4.0) Graphical User Interface</li>
                            <li><strong>1998</strong>: (Vim 5.0) Syntax highlighting</li>
                            <li><strong>2001</strong>: (Vim 6.0) Folding and multi-language</li>
                            <li><strong>2006</strong>: (Vim 7.0) On the fly spell checker and support for tabs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Vim is now more than 30 years old!

                        <p>Brem Moolenaar's text editor is legendary among software developers; it has repeatedly been named in surveys as one of the most widely used text editors or IDEs, and it is still the default text editor in many modern Linux distros.</p>
                        <p>Moolenaar continued to update Vim until just a few weeks before his passing. Computing as we know it today was built in no small part by individuals like Bram, and few open source tools are as legendary and impactful as Vim.</p>
                        <p>It's humbling to look back and contemplate the history of these editors as they played a direct role in the history of computer science itself.</p>
                        <p>Being here at a Queen Mary University building, where those events took place almost 50 years ago, and using Vim to write this article is nothing short of surreal! As I stare at my blinking Vim cursor, I am overwhelmed by a warm feeling, very similar to the sensation I get when I stare at the ocean or a hundred-year old tree. It invites us to reflect on the years that came before us and the events that helped shape modern life as we know it.</p>

  <p>Tim Perry recently claimed in an article that <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/android-14-breaks-system-certificate-installation/">“Android 14 blocks all modification of system certificates, even as root”</a>. This sparked <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391521">significant discussion on Hacker News</a>. Thankfully my tests show that it is still possible to adjust the system certificate store in Android 14.</p>

<p><strong>Update Sept. 15 2023, 6:21 AM PT:</strong> After I’d already written this post but before I posted it, it looks like Perry already discovered that he can <a href="https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-server/commit/965fd8d9b287af0e4b305d828d5e8e1aa52dce36">solve this problem</a> for his purposes by bind mounting the <code>/apex/</code> mount back to the <code>/system/</code> partition in the namespace of <code>zygote</code> and the children of <code>zygote</code>. The core of the idea came from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@tbodt/111029869755316309">a Mastodon thread with @tbodt and @tmw</a>. This post still provides a slightly alternative method, so it is still relevant, as well as still being relevant to the broader discussion.</p>

<h3 id="users-can-still-revoke-system-certificate-trust-through-the-settings-app">Users Can Still Revoke System Certificate Trust Through the Settings App</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.g1a55er.net/images/android-14-system-ca/trust-anchor-toggles.png" alt="" width="250"></p>

<p>The headline of Perry’s article asserts that even root users cannot “modify” the system certificates at all. In fact, even in Android 14, all users can still remove certificate authorities (CAs) from the list of trusted CAs in the Settings app, just like they could in previous versions of Android.</p>

<p>To confirm that the Settings app still works, I used an Android 14 emulator to revoke trust from all the Amazon and Starfield Technologies CAs. I then accessed <a href="https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/">Amazon Trust Services Repository’s</a> test pages using Chrome. They failed to load due to an untrusted CA. I also confirmed the revocation of trust persists across reboots.</p>

<p>Based on this, I think the headline of Perry’s article is overly strong. Most of the more impassioned comments on Hacker News took the headline’s strong claim at face value. It is important to be clear: users still retain ultimate control over the trust anchors in Android 14.</p>

<h3 id="developers-can-still-add-trusted-system-certificates-via-adb">Developers Can Still Add Trusted System Certificates via ADB</h3>

<p>When I revisited the article after reading Perry’s comments on HN and Mastodon, it became clear that his primary concern was the inability to easily add temporary system CAs via ADB. This feature is critical for his product, <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/">HTTP Toolkit</a>. It is also critical for many other security researchers and app developers, myself included.</p>

<p>While Perry correctly notes that the traditional method no longer functions with Android 14, the feature hasn’t been discarded.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37392354">initially anticipated</a> a deep dive into APEX and its signing intricacies. Thankfully, a simpler, albeit somewhat crude, workaround exists for this as a proof-of-concept. <strong>This is not suitable for production use. For a production environment, it’s crucial to carefully limit SELinux and tmpfs security options to grant only the minimal privileges. Alternatively, one can construct a properly signed repacked APEX.</strong></p>

<div><pre><code><span># These commands assume a root shell. </span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Deal with the fact that there will be executables on the /apex tmpfs</span>
<span># !! Not suitable for production usage !! </span>
setenforce 0
mount <span>-o</span> remount,exec /apex
<span># Make a copy of the current conscrypt APEX contents</span>
<span>cp</span> <span>-r</span> <span>-p</span> /apex/com.android.conscrypt /apex/com.android.conscrypt-bak
<span># Lazily unmount because conscrypt might be in active use</span>
umount <span>-l</span> /apex/com.android.conscrypt
<span>rm</span> <span>-rf</span> /apex/com.android.conscrypt
<span># Put contents of conscrypt APEX on /apex tmpfs mount</span>
<span>mv</span> /apex/com.android.conscrypt-bak /apex/com.android.conscrypt
<span># Soft userspace reboot to get everything back into a consistent state </span>
killall system_server
<span># Clear system trust anchors, if desired</span>
<span>mv</span> /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts-bak
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://www.g1a55er.net/images/android-14-system-ca/meme.jpg" alt="" width="400"></p>

<p>Executing these steps clears the system CA list in the “Trusted credentials” section of the Settings app - the result desired in the original post.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.g1a55er.net/images/android-14-system-ca/empty-system-ca-list.png" alt="" width="300"></p>

<p>After this setup, adding trusted certificates is almost identical to prior versions. The only change is using /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts as the destination path. I confirmed this by adding my personal CA as a system trust anchor.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.g1a55er.net/images/android-14-system-ca/personal-ca-system-ca-list.png" alt="" width="300"></p>

<p>This process only necessitates root access and doesn’t require altering /system. If you need persistence beyond a single boot, you’ll need to modify the /system partition, just as in older Android versions. Be prepared for the slight complexity of either deleting or repacking the com.android.conscrypt APEX. I leave that as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<h3 id="verdict-all-is-well-that-ends-well">Verdict: All Is Well That Ends Well</h3>

<p>Yes, Android 14 has altered the behavior of its system certificate store. But users’ freedoms remain intact. The modifications just add a layer of indirection facilitating over-the-air updates to the certificate store. Given Android’s update delays have <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/21/extending-android-compatibility.html">previously hurt CAs like LetsEncrypt</a>, this is a positive move. I can see how the new layer may seems complicated at first, but it does have to meet some pretty tough constraints<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Kudos to Perry for highlighting this change. Various tools will need to be updated to work with Android 14. Once that is done, I am optimistic that security researchers, developers, and reverse engineers will retain their previous capabilities to tinker and make.</p>

<h3 id="disclosures">Disclosures</h3>

<p>I am friends with Googlers and former Googlers, but I have never worked for Google. I have previously worked as a security-focused developer for a small Android OEM, which is why this caught my attention. I do not currently work for anyone, so these opinions can only be my own.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>TikTok has been fined €345m (£296m) for breaking EU data law in its handling of children’s accounts, including failing to shield underage users’ content from public view.</p><p>The Irish data watchdog, which regulates TikTok across the EU, said the Chinese-owned video app had committed multiple breaches of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gdpr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">GDPR</a> rules.</p><p>It found TikTok had contravened GDPR by placing child users’ accounts on a public setting by default; failing to supply transparent information to child users; allowing an adult accessing a child’s account on the “family pairing” setting to enable direct messaging for over-16s; and not properly taking into account the risks posed to under-13s on the platform who were placed on a public setting.</p><p>The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) said users aged between 13 and 17 were steered through the sign-up process in a way that resulted in their accounts being set to public – meaning anyone can see an account’s content or comment on it – by default. It also found that the “family pairing” scheme, which gives an adult control over a child’s account settings, did not check whether the adult “paired” with the child user was a parent or guardian.</p><figure id="55cef811-e0c1-4f20-adf2-604d127a09de" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:4,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/02/tiktok-under-investigation-over-child-data-use&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;TikTok under investigation over child data use&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;55cef811-e0c1-4f20-adf2-604d127a09de&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>The DPC ruled that TikTok, which has a minimum user age of 13, did not properly take into account the risk posed to underage users who gained access to the platform. It said the public-setting-by-default process allowed anyone to “view social media content posted by those users”.</p><p>The Duet and Stitch features, which allow users to combine their content with other TikTokers, were also enabled by default for under-17s. However, the DPC found there had been no infringement of GDPR in terms of its methods for verifying users’ ages.</p><p>The DPC decision comes after TikTok was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches" data-link-name="in body link">fined £12.7m in April by the UK data regulator</a> for illegally processing the data of 1.4 million children under 13 who were using its platform without parental consent. The information commissioner said TikTok had done “very little, if anything” to check who was using the platform.</p><p>TikTok said the investigation looked at the company’s privacy setup between 31 July and 31 December 2020 and said it had addressed the problems raised by the inquiry. All existing and new TikTok accounts for 13- to 15-year-olds have been set to private – meaning only people approved by the user can view their content – by default since 2021.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-9">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-9" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>TikTok said: “We respectfully disagree with the decision, particularly the level of the fine imposed. The DPC’s criticisms are focused on features and settings that were in place three years ago, and that we made changes to well before the investigation even began, such as setting all under-16 accounts to private by default.”</p><p>The DPC also acknowledged it had been overruled by the European Data Protection Board, a body comprising EU member state data and privacy regulators, on some aspects of its decision. This meant it had to include a proposed finding by the German regulator that the use of “dark patterns” – the term for deceptive website and app designs that steer users into certain behaviours or making particular choices – breached a GDPR provision on fair processing of personal data.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>(If you are using gdb without pwngdb then you may need to <code>x/64a $rsp</code> to list the first 64 entries from the stack.)</p>
<p>The Stack Pointer <code>rsp</code> is at <code>0x7ffd4f48bd10</code>. Let's find out the end of the stack with <code>grep -F '[stack]' /proc/$(pidof none)/maps</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>7ffd4f46c000-7ffd4f48d000</span> <span>rw-p</span> <span>00000000</span> <span>00</span><span>:00</span> <span>0</span>         [<span>stack</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>The Kernel has allocated the stack memory from <code>0x7ffd4f46c000</code> to <code>0x7ffd4f48d000</code> - a total of 132 KB. It will grow dynamically up to 8MB (<code>ulimit -s</code> kilobytes). Our program (so far; see <code>rsp</code>) only uses the stack from the <code>rsp</code> address (<code>0x7ffd4f48bd10</code>) down to the same end of the stack (<code>0x7ffd4f48d000</code>) - a total of 4,848 bytes (<code>echo $((0x7ffd4f48d000 - 0x7ffd4f48bd10))</code> == 4848).</p>
<p>This is the 'birth' of the execution: The Kernel, in all its braveness, has passed control to our program. Our program is about to execute its very first instruction - to take its very first step (so to say).</p>
<p>What is on the stack right now is all the information the program gets from the Kernel to run. It contains the argument list, the environment variables and a lot of other interesting information.</p>
<p>For <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hackerschoice/zapper">Zapper</a> we had to manipulate the argument list, move stack values around, adjust the pointers and then pass control back to the program - without it falling over. It was prudent to understand a bit better what the Kernel had put on the stack.</p>
<p>Let's dump the stack:</p>
<pre><code><span>pwndbg&gt;</span> <span>dump</span> <span>binary</span> <span>memory</span> <span>stack.dat</span> <span>$rsp</span> <span>0x7ffd4f48d000</span>

</code></pre>
<p>Lots of pointers. Lots of strings. Lots of unknowns.</p>
<p>Let's follow the call from <code>execve()</code> to the new program's entry point.</p>
<p>The <code>execve()</code> calls the Kernel via a syscall which then calls <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/fs/exec.c#L2091">do_execve</a><a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.18/source/fs/exec.c#L1604">()</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694689587779/d00e7f77-f08b-45ae-8f5e-8c4317a08ca4.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Eventually, this ends up in <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/fs/exec.c#L1870"><code>do_execveat_common()</code></a>. The <code>bprm</code> structure is created and assigned all kinds of information about the program (see <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/include/linux/binfmts.h#L18">binfmts.h</a>).</p>
<p>Important to us, the program's filename, environment variables and options (<code>argv</code>) are copied from Kernel memory to the process's stack. The stack grows UP towards the lower addresses: The first item put on the stack (the <code>bprm-&gt;filename</code>) is thus at the largest address on the stack (the bottom) and above it (e.g. smaller addresses) comes the envp and then the argv.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694692329780/0d59e630-8ee6-46d7-9c4b-4b085d47ec81.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>We follow to <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/fs/exec.c#L1803"><code>bprm_execve()</code></a> where some checks are completed before calling <code>exec_binprm()</code>. From there into <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/fs/exec.c#L1709"><code>search_binary_handler()</code></a> where the Kernel checks if the binary is ELF, a shebang (<code>#!</code>) or any other type registered via the binfmt-misc module. The kernel then calls the appropriate function to load the binary.</p>
<p>In our case, it's an ELF binary and so <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L824"><code>load_elf_binary()</code></a> is called. The kernel creates the memory and thereafter maps the sections from the binary file into memory and also calls <code>begin_new_exec()</code> to set all credentials and permissions for the new process.</p>
<p>The kernel then checks if the ELF binary should be loaded by an interpreter (<code>ld.so</code>):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694695192603/88c3de6a-d9c7-47db-9cb9-ec9e50cbe616.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>or, in the case of a static binary like ours, loaded directly without an interpreter:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694695234011/ebddbec8-18c2-4a50-adbf-a458fa1898aa.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L174"><code>create_elf_tables()</code></a> is called. This is where all the stack magic happens that we are interested in.</p>
<p>First, the function <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L202">arch_align_stack()</a> adds a random amount of zeros to the stack (e.g. stack randomization) to make (some) buffer overflow exploits work (a little) less reliably. It also aligns the stack to 16 bytes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694700797913/5634c916-d11f-4969-b3f8-e36463c2b81c.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>The kernel then puts <code>x86_64\0</code> onto the stack and next adds 16 bytes of random data on top (which libc uses as a seed for its PRNG):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694696469130/3e834162-db00-4142-87e6-77be6bb79aeb.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>The kernel then creates the elf auxiliary table: A collection of (id, value) pairs that describe useful information about the program being run and the environment it is running in, communicated from the kernel to user space.</p>
<p>The list ends with a Zero Identifier and Zero value (e.g. 16 bytes of 0x00). There are about 20 entries (320 bytes) in the list.</p>
<p>The table starts with ARCH_DLINFO (which expands to AT_SYSINFO_EHDR + <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/include/uapi/linux/auxvec.h#L37">AT_MINSIGSTKSZ</a>). The 'Identifiers' are defined in <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/include/uapi/linux/auxvec.h">auxvec.h</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694698104767/d2eec03d-7591-46e3-b24d-909c23ce04e7.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>In <code>gdb</code> the elf auxiliary table looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[<span>...</span> <span>above</span> <span>is</span> <span>argc</span> <span>...</span>]
[<span>...</span> <span>above</span> <span>is</span> <span>argvp</span> <span>...</span>]

</code></pre>
<p>Thereafter the kernel allocates stack memory to store the elf-aux-table, the argv- and env-pointers and the argc value (+1) and aligns the top of the stack to 16 bytes:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694703139943/ea499340-0f4c-43ef-865d-7b3abb117915.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>...and then puts the argc, argv-pointers and env-pointers onto the stack:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694699550671/e81d5364-e1ca-4430-85d1-aed8ba36b5d9.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>...and then copies the elf_info (from above) on the stack (<a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L300">aligned</a>; below the env pointers).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694703262167/5b7d8832-4116-4bec-8d28-34bfefcf37fc.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p><em>(The clever reader may have noticed that 'RND16' does not start at an aligned address - 0x7ffca42297f9: It is because RND16 was put on the stack before the</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L303"><em>STACK_ROUND()</em></a> <em>call to put the elf-info table and env/argv pointers).</em></p>
<p>Now back in load_elf_binary(), the kernel sets the registers, clears some stuff and finally (!) calls <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.19.17/source/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L1348">START_THREAD()</a> to start the program.</p>
<p><strong>Afterthought</strong>: Someone pointed out the article at <a target="_blank" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/631631/">https://lwn.net/Articles/631631/</a> with better ASCII art than mine 🫶. The layout of the stack before execution (upside down; starting at the largest address and growing downwards towards the smaller addresses):</p>

<h3 id="heading-how-to-zapper">How to Zapper</h3>
<p>Wheeee. What a ride. For Zapper we ptrace() at the entry-point, increase the stack to make a copy of argv/env-strings, adjust all the pointers to point to 'our' copy of the argv/env-strings and ZERO the original ones to 0x00. The kernel does not know about it and still references the now zero'd argv/env-strings and ...wush..they are gone from the process list.</p>

Datatilsynet felt this insufficient, and that Meta should instead halt any data processing until an effective consent mechanism is activated.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither Facebook nor Instagram is banned in Norway. But the sentence underlines Datatilsynet efforts to persuade Meta to bring its data practices in line with EU standards. Norway’s DPA believes that Meta is brazenly exploiting its users by harvesting <a href="https://www.twipla.com/en/blog/what-constitutes-personal-data-gdpr">personal data</a> excessively, and without consideration - infringing on what is a human right under both the European Union and United Nations.</p><p>The challenges Meta faces in Norway are not isolated. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/Data-Protection-Commission-announces-conclusion-of-inquiry-into-Meta-Ireland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Irish Data Protection Commissioner</a>, which acts as Meta's lead EU regulator, called on the company to re-evaluate the legal foundations of its ad-targeting processes. The directive stemmed from allegations that Meta had made adjustments to its algorithms. Still, subsequent investigations by European courts determined that these changes didn't meet the stringent standards of European privacy regulations.</p></div></div><div id="c97249"><p>The crusade against Meta’s data practices has only intensified, with the decision in Norway seen by European regulators as the opportunity it is to get the company singing from their hymn sheet.</p><p>And while Norway isn’t a de facto member of the EU, its membership of the Single Market makes it EU-adjacent enough to sense that this ruling will be a common precedent across Europe. Put another way, it’s like this Scandinavian hammer blow to Meta will cause a ripple effect across Europe. For if Datatilsynet's decision is endorsed by the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">European Data Protection Board</a>, the fines imposed on Meta could become permanent, broadening their territorial scope to encompass the entirety of Europe.</p><p>As of now, the daily fines against Meta are scheduled to continue until November 3. With the stakes set high, and with increasing scrutiny from European nations, it remains to be seen how Meta will navigate this complex regulatory landscape.</p></div><div id="c97250"><p>This action against Meta is further evidence that European DPAs are finally learning how to effectively enforce GDPR standards, and it follows soon after <a href="https://www.twipla.com/en/blog/swedish-regulator-cracks-down-on-google-analytics-issues-1m-in-privacy-fines">similar legal action in Sweden against Google Analytics</a>. It’s also clear from recent events in Sweden that all business types are liable for the misuse of EU citizen data, and all signs point to fines and other penalties increasing in the future.</p><p>Businesses that want to stay compliant should move away from cookies and other digital tech that collects personal user data.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the arrival of privacy-first internet technologies like <a href="https://www.twipla.com/en/why-us/why-you-should-use-twipla">TWIPLA</a> means that they can still collect the data they need to drive business growth without infringing on the security of internet users or breaking data privacy requirements. <a href="https://app.visitor-analytics.io/register" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sign up today</a>, and start migrating your digital technologies away from those that collect personal data.</p></div><a href="https://app.visitor-analytics.io/register" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><div><div><h2>Get Started for Free</h2><p>Gain World-Class Insights &amp; Offer Innovative Privacy &amp; Security</p></div><p><img src="https://www.twipla.com/fileadmin/visitor-analytics/theme/images/twipla/mac-laptop.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></a></div><div><div><h6>You might also like</h6></div><div><div><p><span><img height="20" width="26" src="https://www.twipla.com/fileadmin/visitor-analytics/theme/newvisa/_mail-insigh.svg" alt="_mail-insigh.svg"></span></p><h4>Insights to Your Inbox</h4></div><p>Receive a monthly summary of website intelligence news, advice, and updates.

At times the water reached 20 metres high so people on the third floor were washed away to sea. Audit documents show these dams were not maintained for years.</p><p>“One can only hope that this leads to reflection in Libya and abroad about the need to elect a new single government.”</p><p>There is also concern that Derna and neighbouring Sousse, because of their proximity to Italy and Greece, were hubs for thousands of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean, and many of them will have been in poor housing close to the port.</p><p>Rashad Hamed, a data specialist consultant at the UN children’s fund, Unicef, said: “The humanitarian catastrophe in Derna, Libya, is different from the humanitarian catastrophe in Marrakech, Morocco. The Moroccan earthquake could not have been avoided or mitigated, while the Derna disaster was caused by negligence and gross negligence, the price of which was paid by thousands of victims.”</p><figure id="6c58ab8a-9fa6-41fd-b6ae-f45cdc270966" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b066774b18662ab17cd0e2eeeb1ffbc13f7cd75/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b066774b18662ab17cd0e2eeeb1ffbc13f7cd75/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b066774b18662ab17cd0e2eeeb1ffbc13f7cd75/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b066774b18662ab17cd0e2eeeb1ffbc13f7cd75/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b066774b18662ab17cd0e2eeeb1ffbc13f7cd75/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b066774b18662ab17cd0e2eeeb1ffbc13f7cd75/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A damaged road in Derna" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b066774b18662ab17cd0e2eeeb1ffbc13f7cd75/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A damaged road in Derna.</span> Photograph: Esam Omran Al-Fetori/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>He said the Wadi Derna dam “retained rainwater and the neglected spillway for the dam, which had not been cleaned for a long time, failed to drain the water.

<article id="post-367" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope">

	
	
<div ast-blocks-layout="true" itemprop="text">

		
		
<p>Recently Unity <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates">announced a pricing update</a> which changes the pricing model from a simple pay per seat to a model whereby developers have to pay per install. This isn’t restricted to paid installs or plays; it applies to every plain install.</p>



<p>This price change has some particularly grave consequences on mobile where revenue per install is highly variable. <a href="https://www.is.com/glossary/ad-revenue/">According to Ironsource</a> (A Unity company) for example, the average revenue per ad impression is $0.02. Unity would like to charge $0.20 per install after your app has made $200,000 over the past year. What this means is that every one of your users <strong>has</strong> to see at least 10 ads after installing your app to not have it cost you money. These numbers are averages. If your app is more popular in emerging markets then the revenue per ad would be significantly lower, making the problem far worse.</p>



<p>To make matters (even) worse, this change will be done retroactively on existing applications as well.</p>



<h4>How can they get away with this?</h4>



<p>It’s like if Microsoft decided that you had to pay per person who read your document made in Word. If they did you’d just stop using Word and instead switch over to Google Docs. An inconvenience perhaps, but not an existential threat to your survival as a document editor.</p>



<p>Video games, however, are not like this. Developing a game is a long, intricate process, often spanning months or even years. After this work is done simply jumping ship to a different engine is not easy requiring considerable amount of time and money. If it is possible at all, perhaps the development team of the game has since disbanded.</p>



<p><em>Pray they don’t alter the deal further…</em></p>



<h4>How open source helps</h4>



<p>Open source game engines, <a href="https://godotengine.org/">such as Godot engine</a>, protect your work by giving you rights to the engine that cannot be taken away, or altered. Under Godot’s <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit/">MIT license</a> every user gets the rights to use the engine as they see fit, modify and distribute it, the only requirement being that you must acknowledge the original creators and cannot claim the engine as your own creation. Note that this applies only to the engine! Your game is your own!</p>



<h4>Why not just switch to Unreal engine?</h4>



<p>While Unreal engine currently does not have terms like Unity’s, there’s nothing stopping them from doing something similar. In fact if Unity manages to get away with this it seems likely they will follow suit.</p>



<h4>How does Ramatak fit into this story?</h4>



<p>The Ramatak mobile studio enhances the open source Godot engine with the things you need for a mobile game: Ads, in app purchases, and analytics. And while Ramatak does charge for these services, if we were to try to alter the deal in way you are uncomfortable with you can simply take your game and use the open source version instead. You’d lose access to the Ramatak specific enhancements but your game is yours to do with as you please.</p>



<p>To underscore this point further: <a href="https://ramatak.com/2022/12/03/easy-to-leave/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ramatak.com/2022/12/03/easy-to-leave/">The first publication on our site</a> talks about how we consider our relationship with our users. We must simply offer something our users want since switching away from our offering to the open source version is so easy.</p>



<h4>In conclusion</h4>



<p>The (mobile) gaming landscape changes all the time, and we can’t predict what the next “big thing” will be. By using an open source engine you can be sure that whatever that “next thing” is, the engine won’t keep you from taking advantage of it. Nor would the engine be able to dictate your monetization strategy for you.</p>



<p>With Ramatak mobile studio, developers get the best of both worlds: the freedom and security of an open-source engine and the advanced, tailored features that modern mobile games require.</p>



<p>And most importantly: <strong>We can’t alter the deal</strong>.</p>

<pre>On the Impending Crypto Monoculture
===================================

A number of IETF standards groups are currently in the process of applying the
second-system effect to redesigning their crypto protocols.  A major feature
of these changes includes the dropping of traditional encryption algorithms
and mechanisms like RSA, DH, ECDH/ECDSA, SHA-2, and AES, for a completely
different set of mechanisms, including Curve25519 (designed by Dan Bernstein
et al), EdDSA (Bernstein and colleagues), Poly1305 (Bernstein again) and
ChaCha20 (by, you guessed it, Bernstein).

What's more, the reference implementations of these algorithms also come from
Dan Bernstein (again with help from others), leading to a never-before-seen
crypto monoculture in which it's possible that the entire algorithm suite used
by a security protocol, and the entire implementation of that suite, all
originate from one person.

How on earth did it come to this?

The Underlying Problem
----------------------

It would be easy to dismiss the wholesale adoption of Bernstein algorithms and
code as rampant fanboyism, and indeed there is some fanboyism present.  An
example of this is the interpretation of the data formats to use as "whatever
Dan's code does" rather than the form specified in widely-adopted standards
like X9.62 ("Additional Elliptic Curves (Curve25519 etc) for TLS ECDH key
agreement", TLS WG discussion), something that hasn't been seen since the C
language was defined as "whatever the pcc compiler accepts as input".

The underlying problem, though, is far more complex.

In adopting the Bernstein algorithm suite and its implementation, implementers
have rejected both the highly brittle and failure-prone current algorithms and
mechanisms and their equally brittle and failure-prone implementations.

Consider the simple case of authenticated encryption as used in the major
Internet security protocols TLS, SSH, PGP, and S/MIME (the remaining protocol
would be IPsec, but I've never written an IPsec implementation so I don't have
sufficient hands-on experience with it to comment on it in practice).  S/MIME
has an authenticated-encryption mode (encrypt-then-MAC or EtM) that's
virtually never used or even implemented, PGP has a sort-of integrity-check
mode that encrypts a hash of the plaintext in CFB mode, and both TLS and SSH
use the endlessly failure-prone MAC-then-encrypt (MtE) mode, with an ever-
evolving suite of increasingly creatively-named attacks stretching back 15
years or more (TLS recently adopted, after a terrific struggle on their
mailing list, an option to use EtM, but support in some major implementations
is still lagging).

What are the (standardised) alternatives?  Looking through a recent paper from
Real World Crypto ("The Evolution of Authenticated Encryption", Phil Rogaway),
we see the three options GCM, CCM, and OCB.  The GCM slide provides a list of
pros and cons to using GCM, none of which seem like a terribly big deal, but
misses out the single biggest, indeed killer failure of the whole mode, the
fact that if you for some reason fail to increment the counter, you're sending
what's effectively plaintext (it's recoverable with a simple XOR).  It's an
incredibly brittle mode, the equivalent of the historically frighteningly
misuse-prone RC4, and one I won't touch with a barge pole because you're one
single machine instruction away from a catastrophic failure of the whole
cryptosystem, or one single IV reuse away from the same.  This isn't just
theoretical, it actually happened to Colin Percival, a very experienced crypto
developer, in his backup program tarsnap.  You can't even salvage just the
authentication from it, that fails as well with a single IV reuse
("Authentication Failures in NIST version of GCM", Antoine Joux).

Compare this with old-fashioned CBC+HMAC (applied in the correct EtM manner),
in which you can arbitrarily misuse the IV (for example you can forget to
apply it completely) and the worst that can happen is that you drop back to
ECB mode, which isn't perfect but still a long way from the total failure that
you get with GCM.  Similarly, HMAC doesn't fail completely due to a minor
problem with the IV.

Then there's CCM, which is two-pass and therefore an instant fail for
streaming implementations, which is all of the protocols mentioned earlier
(since CCM was designed for use in 802.11 which has fixed maximum-size packets
this isn't a failure of the mode itself, but does severely limit its
applicability).

The remaining mode is OCB, which I'd consider the best AEAD mode out there (it
shares CBC's graceful-degradation property in which reuse or misuse of the IV
doesn't lead to a total loss of security, only the authentication property
breaks but not the confidentiality).  Unfortunately it's patented, and even
though there are fairly broad exceptions allowing it to be used in many
situations, the legal minefield that ensues makes it untouchable for most
potential users.  For example does the prohibition on military use cover the
situation where an open-source crypto package is used in a vendor library
that's used in a medical insurance app that's used by the US Navy, or where
banking transactions protected by TLS may include ones of a military nature
(both of these are actual examples that affected decisions not to use OCB).
Since no-one wants to call in lawyers every time a situation like this comes
up, and indeed can't call in lawyers when the crypto is several levels away in
the service stack, OCB won't be used even though it may be the best AEAD mode
out there.

(The background behind this problem can be found in Phil Rogaway's excellent
essay "The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work", which discusses aligning
crypto work with principles like the Buddhist concept of right livelihood,
applying it in an ethical manner.  Unfortunately, in the same way that the
current misguided attempts by politicians to limit mostly non-existent use of
crypto by terrorists and other equestrians only affects legitimate users (the
few terrorists who may actually bother with encryption won't care), so the
restriction of OCB, however well-intentioned, have the effect that a beautiful
AEAD mode that should be used everywhere is instead used almost nowhere).

The implementations of the algorithms aren't much better.  Alongside brittle,
failure-prone crypto modes and mechanisms, we also have brittle, failure-prone
implementations.  The most notorious of these is OpenSSL, which powers a
significant part of the world's crypto infrastructure not only directly (as a
TLS/SSL implementation) but also indirectly, when it's used as a component of
other applications like OpenSSH.  In fact one of the reasons given for
OpenSSH's adoption of the chacha20-poly1305 crypto mechanisms (alongside
Curve25519 and others) was that it finally allowed them to remove the last
vestiges of OpenSSL from their code.

The Reason for the Monoculture
------------------------------

Anyone who works with crypto on the Internet has had to endure 15-20 years of
constant breakage of the crypto they use, both of the algorithms and
mechanisms and of the implementations.  It's not even possible to give
references for this because the list of breakage is so long and extensive that
it would take pages and pages just to enumerate it all.

Take for example an organisation like Google.  Every single time that there's
been some break in a crypto mechanism, Google gets hit.  Again and again, year
in, year out.  So when they look to moving to ChaCha20 and Poly1305, it's not
Bernstein fanboyism, it's an attempt to dig themselves out of the current hole
where they get hit with a new attack every couple of months, and the breakage
just keeps recurring, endlessly.

What implementers are looking for is what Bernstein has termed boring crypto,
"crypto that simply works, solidly resists attacks, never needs any upgrades"
("Boring crypto", Dan Bernstein).  Bernstein and colleagues offer a silver
bullet, something that appears better than anything else that's out there at
the moment.

In this they have no real competition.  There's no AEAD mode that's usable,
the ECC algorithms and parameters that we're supposed to use are both tainted
due to NSA involvement and riddled with side-channels (the Bernstein
algorithms and mechanisms have been specifically designed to deal with both of
these issues), and so on.

Consider being lost in an endless desert.  If you see an oasis in the
distance, you head towards it even if the water is brackish and has camel dung
floating in it.  Bernstein et al are the oasis (or perhaps the mirage of an
oasis), in an endless desert of cryptosystems and implementations of
cryptosystems that keep breaking.

So the (pending) Bernstein monoculture isn't necessarily a vote for Dan, it's
more a vote against everything else.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I’m happy to announce that the generous people at <a href="https://futo.org/">FUTO</a> have granted the project $15,000 with no strings attached to help the search engine out with some more server power.</p><p>FUTO is a young Austin, TX-based organization “<em>dedicated to developing, both through in-house engineering and investment, technologies that frustrate centralization and industry consolidation</em>”. It’s one to keep an eye on, I believe their heart is in the right place and they have every possibility of making a real difference.</p><p>As for Marginalia Search, is very a timely windfall.</p><p>I’ve been pushing ever closer the limit of what’s possible to do on PC hardware for quite a while, and despite recent improvements and optimizations, I think I’m relatively close to some sort of upper limit. Maybe I can double the size of the index one more time, but I think that’s about as far as it’s going to go. Working with a system that’s always close to the limit in terms of RAM and disk space is tedious and slow in a way it doesn’t need to be, and the dinky size of the index is almost certainly one of the bigger limitations for the search engine.</p><p>The gist of the plan moving forward is something like this.</p><p>The search engine itself will move out of my apartment and onto proper enterprise-grade hardware in a server rack somewhere. My income from this work is unpredictable to say the least, so investing a known sum into hardware upfront and having a minimal burn rate from colocation is the only way forward where I’ll be able to sleep soundly at night (you can always find other uses for a server if things really go disastrously wrong).</p><p>I don’t believe the software itself will need extensive modifications to make use of the hardware, but it may be advisable to shard some of the processing to make better use of multiple disks and cores. This is trivial as most of the problem space is embarrassingly parallel all the way from crawler to search results page, you can just shard by domain and save for domain rankings the data flows as straight as a box of uncooked spaghetti.</p><p>The current production machine will be downgraded to a building and staging environment. Not having such an environment is the biggest pain point I have right now, many changes can’t be completely tested before deploying them in production. It’s not a very professional way of running a server and a leading cause of downtime and jank, but it’s also had to be that way because I’ve lacked the hardware.</p><p>The search engine software is ultimately still going to be designed for lower powered hardware. Not only do I think it’s important that there isn’t a prohibitive $15,000 entrance fee to running a search engine, it’s central to my programming philosophy to always target small hardware. This reveals performance problems early on while they are still easy to deal with. Anything that runs well on a small computer runs even better on a larger one. The converse is not true.</p><p>Exciting times ahead! Thanks FUTO and everyone else contributing to making this possible.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">MaplePad is an all-in-one Dreamcast controller, VMU, and Purupuru (rumble pack) emulator for Dreamcast portables and custom Dreamcast controllers. It runs on RP2040 and is usable with the Raspberry Pi Pico as well as custom MaplePad PCBs. See the <a href="https://github.com/mackieks/MaplePad/tree/main/hardware">hardware folder</a> for a wiring diagram.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> MaplePad is still a WIP. You may experience issues with <a href="https://segaretro.org/Windows_CE" rel="nofollow">Windows CE games</a>. In almost all problematic titles, disabling VMU and rumble through the MaplePad menu will make the game playable. Check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JzTGN29Ci8SeuSGkQHLN1p6ayQNWUcsNw77SMujkjbs/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Compatibility List</a> for details!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2>
<p dir="auto">With MaplePad you can cycle through 8 200-block internal VMUs with custom icons and colors, use an I2C or SPI OLED display to see the VMU screen in color and at 2x integer scale, and enjoy rumble that is 1:1 with the Performance TremorPak in most retail software (still some minor bugs!)</p>

What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time. It’s done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible.</p><p>Q: Why Did You Do This?</p><p>A number of reasons. I’ve thought this over for some time. In no particular order they are:</p><p>1) Practicality: When I first signed my creator-owned publishing contract with DC Comics, the company was run by honest men and women of integrity, who (for the most part) interpreted the details of that agreement fairly and above-board. When problems inevitably came up we worked it out, like reasonable men and women. Since then, over the span of twenty years or so, those people have left or been fired, to be replaced by a revolving door of strangers, of no measurable integrity, who now choose to interpret every facet of our contract in ways that only benefit DC Comics and its owner companies. At one time the Fables properties were in good hands, and now, by virtue of attrition and employee replacement, the Fables properties have fallen into bad hands.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I can’t afford to sue DC, to force them to live up to the letter and the spirit of our long-time agreements; since even winning such a suit would take ridiculous amounts of money out of my pocket and years out of my life (I’m 67 years old, and don’t have the years to spare), I’ve decided to take a different approach, and fight them in a different arena, inspired by the principles of asymmetric warfare. The one thing in our contract the DC lawyers can’t contest, or reinterpret to their own benefit, is that I am the sole owner of the intellectual property. I can sell it or give it away to whomever I want.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose to give it away to everyone. If I couldn’t prevent Fables from falling into bad hands, at least this is a way I can arrange that it also falls into many good hands. Since I truly believe there are still more good people in the world than bad ones, I count it as a form of victory.</p><p>2) Philosophy: In the past decade or so, my thoughts on how to reform the trademark and copyright laws in this country (and others, I suppose) have undergone something of a radical transformation. The current laws are a mishmash of unethical backroom deals to keep trademarks and copyrights in the hands of large corporations, who can largely afford to buy the outcomes they want.</p><p>          In my template for radical reform of those laws I would like it if any IP is owned by its original creator for up to twenty years from the point of first publication, and then goes into the public domain for any and all to use. However, at any time before that twenty year span bleeds out, you the IP owner can sell it to another person or corporate entity, who can have exclusive use of it for up to a maximum of ten years. That’s it. Then it cannot be resold. It goes into the public domain. So then, at the most, any intellectual property can be kept for exclusive use for up to about thirty years, and no longer, without exception.</p><p>          Of course, if I’m going to believe such radical ideas, what kind of hypocrite would I be if I didn’t practice them? Fables has been my baby for about twenty years now. It’s time to let it go. This is my first test of this process. If it works, and I see no legal reason why it won’t, look for other properties to follow in the future. Since DC, or any other corporate entity, doesn’t actually own the property, they don’t get a say in this decision.</p><p>Q: What Exactly Has DC Comics Done to Provoke This?</p><p>Too many things to list exhaustively, but here are some highlights: Throughout the years of my business relationship with DC, with Fables and with other intellectual properties, DC has always been in violation of their agreements with me. Usually it’s in smaller matters, like forgetting to seek my opinion on artists for new stories, or for covers, or formats of new collections and such. In those times, when called on it, they automatically said, “Sorry, we overlooked you again. It just fell through the cracks.” They use the “fell through the cracks” line so often, and so reflexively, that I eventually had to bar them from using it ever again. They are often late reporting royalties, and often under-report said royalties, forcing me to go after them to pay the rest of what’s owed.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately though their practices have grown beyond these mere annoyances, prompting some sort of showdown. First they tried to strong arm the ownership of Fables from me. When Mark Doyle and Dan Didio first approached me with the idea of bringing Fables back for its 20</span><sup>th</sup><span> anniversary (both gentlemen since fired from DC), during the contract negotiations for the new issues, their legal negotiators tried to make it a condition of the deal that the work be done as work for hire, effectively throwing the property irrevocably into the hands of DC. When that didn’t work their excuse was, “Sorry, we didn’t read your contract going into these negotiations. We thought we owned it.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, during talks to try to work out our many differences, DC officers admitted that their interpretation of our publishing agreement, and the following media rights agreement, is that they could do whatever they wanted with the property. They could change stories or characters in any way they wanted. They had no obligation whatsoever to protect the integrity and value of the IP, either from themselves, or from third parties (Telltale Games, for instance) who want to radically alter the characters, settings, history and premises of the story (I’ve seen the script they tried to hide from me for a couple of years). Nor did they owe me any money for licensing the Fables rights to third parties, since such a license wasn’t anticipated in our original publishing agreement.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they capitulated on some of the points in a later conference call, promising on the phone to pay me back monies owed for licensing Fables to Telltale Games, for example, in the execution of the new agreement, they reneged on their word and offered the promised amount instead as a “consulting fee,” which avoided the precedent of admitting this was money owed, and included a non-disclosure agreement that would prevent me from saying anything but nice things about Telltale or the license.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so on. There’s so much more, but these, as I said, are some of the highlights. At that point, since I disagreed on all of their new interpretations of our longstanding agreements, we were in conflict. They practically dared me to sue them to enforce my rights, knowing it would be a long and debilitating process. Instead I began to consider other ways to go.</p><p>Q: Are You Concerned at What DC Will Do Now?</p><p>No. I gave them years to do the right thing. I tried to reason with them, but you can’t reason with the unreasonable. They used these years to make soothing promises, tell lies about how dedicated they were towards working this out, and keep dragging things out as long as possible. I gave them an opportunity to renegotiate the contracts from the ground up, putting everything in unambiguous language, and they ignored that offer. I gave them the opportunity, twice, to simply tear up our contracts, and we each go our separate ways, and they ignored those offers. I tried to go over their heads, to deal directly with their new corporate masters, and maybe find someone willing to deal in good faith, and they blocked all attempts to do so. (Try getting any officer of DC Comics to identify who they report to up the company ladder. I dare you.) In any case, without giving them details, I warned them months in advance that this moment was coming. I told them what I was about to do would be “both legal and ethical.” Now it’s happened.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that my contracts with DC Comics are still in force. I did nothing to break them, and cannot unilaterally end them. I still can’t publish Fables comics through anyone but them. I still can’t authorize a Fables movie through anyone but them. Nor can I license Fables toys nor lunchboxes, nor anything else. And they still have to pay me for the books they publish. And I’m not giving up on the other money they owe. One way or another, I intend to get my 50% of the money they’ve owed me for years for the Telltale Game and other things.</p><p>          However, you, the new 100% owner of Fables never signed such agreements. For better or worse, DC and I are still locked together in this unhappy marriage, perhaps for all time.</p><p>          But you aren’t.</p><p>          If I understand the law correctly (and be advised that copyright law is a mess; purposely vague and murky, and no two lawyers – not even those specializing in copyright and trademark law – agree on anything), you have the rights to make your Fables movies, and cartoons, and publish your Fables books, and manufacture your Fables toys, and do anything you want with your property, because it’s your property.</p><p>          Mark Buckingham is free to do his version of Fables (and I dearly hope he does). Steve Leialoha is free to do his version of Fables (which I’d love to see). And so on. You don’t have to get my permission (but you might get my blessing, depending on your plans). You don’t have to get DC’s permission, or the permission of anyone else. You never signed the same agreements I did with DC Comics.</p><p>          It was my absolute joy and pleasure to bring you Fables stories for the past twenty years. I look forward to seeing what you do with it.</p><p>For questions and further information you can contact Bill Willingham at:</p><p><a href="mailto:william.thomas.willingham@gmail.com" rel="">william.thomas.willingham@gmail.com</a><span>&nbsp; Please include “Fables Public Domain” in the subject line, so I don’t assume you’re another Netflix promotion.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Information</h2>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What ClassiCube is</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A complete re-implementation of Minecraft Classic 0.30, with <strong>optional</strong> additions</li>
<li>Partially supports some features of Minecraft Classic versions before 0.30</li>
<li>Lightweight, minimal memory usage compared to original Minecraft Classic</li>
<li>Much better performance than original Minecraft Classic</li>
<li>Works with effectively all graphics cards that support OpenGL or Direct3D 9</li>
<li>Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and in a web browser</li>
<li>Also runs on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Haiku, IRIX, SerenityOS</li>
<li>Although still work in progresses, also runs on various consoles</li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What ClassiCube isn't</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It does not work with Minecraft Java or Bedrock edition servers</li>
<li>It does not have a survival mode (nor will such a mode be added)</li>
<li>It does not support logging in with Mojang/Minecraft accounts</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> When running from within VirtualBox, disable Mouse Integration, otherwise the camera will not work properly</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Instructions</h4>
<p dir="auto">Initially, you will need to run ClassiCube.exe to download the required assets from minecraft.net and classicube.net.<br>
Just click 'OK' to the dialog menu that appears when you start the launcher.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Singleplayer</strong>
Run ClassiCube.exe, then click Singleplayer at the main menu.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Multiplayer</strong>
Run ClassiCube.exe. You can connect to LAN/locally hosted servers, and classicube.net servers if you have a <a href="https://www.classicube.net/" rel="nofollow">ClassiCube account</a>.</p>
<h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><em>Stuck on OpenGL 1.1?</em></h5>
<p dir="auto">The most common reason for being stuck on OpenGL 1.1 is non-working GPU drivers - so if possible, you should try either installing or updating the drivers for your GPU.</p>
<p dir="auto">Otherwise:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>On Windows, you can still run the OpenGL build of ClassiCube anyways. (You can try downloading and using the MESA software renderer from <a href="http://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/llvmpipe/windows/" rel="nofollow">here</a> for slightly better performance though)</li>
<li>On other operating systems, you will have to <a href="#Compiling">compile the game yourself</a>. Don't forget to add <code>-DCC_BUILD_GL11</code> to the compilation command line so that the compiled game supports OpenGL 1.1.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiling</h2>
<p dir="auto"><em>Note: The various instructions below automatically compile ClassiCube with the recommended defaults for the platform. <br>
If you (not recommended) want to override the defaults (e.g. to compile OpenGL build on Windows), see <a href="https://github.com/UnknownShadow200/ClassiCube/blob/master/doc/overriding-defaults.md">here</a> for details.</em></p>

   <p>A historic strike at the Detroit Three automakers is now underway. </p>   <p>For the first time ever, <a href="https://www.npr.org/live-updates/uaw-strike-ford-stellantis-gm">the United Auto Workers union is striking</a> against all Big Three automakers at once, after it failed to clinch a deal on a new contract by the 11:59 p.m. deadline on Thursday.</p>   <p>But the UAW strike won't mean all of the nearly 150,000 union members who work at the three automakers will walk off their jobs en masse.</p>   <p>Instead, workers at three Midwest auto plants — a General Motors assembly plant in Wentzville, Missouri, a Stellantis assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio, and part of a Ford plant in Wayne, Mich. — were the first to walk off the job under UAW president Shawn Fain's "stand up strike" strategy.</p>   
   <p>For now, that means the strike involves just under 13,000 workers — less than 9% of UAW membership at the three companies. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1199673719" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>But additional locations could follow at a moment's notice, depending on how bargaining with the companies progresses — a strategy intended to ramp up the pressure on companies by keeping them guessing about how their operations would be disrupted.</p>   <p>"This is our generation's defining moment," Fain told UAW members at a Facebook Live event on Thursday night. "The money is there, the cause is righteous, the world is watching." </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1199673750" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The targeted strikes are a departure from the UAW's traditional playbook, which has usually involved having all union members at a single company walk off the job at once.</p>   <p>The UAW has also opted to negotiate with all three automakers at once, in another departure from its previous methods.</p>   <h3>"We do deserve what we deserve"</h3>   <p>Previously, the UAW had picked one automaker to hash out a deal with, focusing its actions on that company until it got a deal — and then pushed the other two of the Big Three members to more or less match that deal.</p>   <p>Still, Fain did not rule eventually having all union workers at the Big Three automakers walk off the job at once.</p>   
   <p>Carrie Bellestri works on the assembly line at the Ford plant in Michigan that's on strike. She's been at Ford for 29 years and said the announcement of a strike at her plant came as a shock.</p>   <p>"At first I was kind of scared — then reality hit. But we do deserve what we deserve," Bellestri said. "I work my butt off every day, and I don't make enough money to do it, to support my family."</p>   <p>President Biden voiced his support for the UAW on Friday, after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/13/1198764355/biden-united-auto-workers-uaw-union-strike-2024">saying little in the lead-up</a> to the strike deadline. He said he is dispatching to Detroit acting Labor Secretary Julie Su as well as Gene Sperling, one of his White House economic advisers. </p>   <p>"Auto companies have seen record profits, including in the last few years, because of the extraordinary skill and sacrifices of the UAW workers," Biden said. "Those record profits have not been not been shared fairly, in my view, with those workers."</p>   <div id="res1199673805">

   <h3>A confrontational approach</h3>   <p>As the first-ever democratically elected leader of the UAW, Fain, a long-time union member himself, has taken a more confrontational approach to negotiations than his predecessors — including filming himself throwing Big Three automaker proposals in the trash. </p>   <p>He has repeatedly doubled down on the union's key economic demands – including 40% pay raises he says would be in line with CEO wage increases, the restoration of pension and retiree healthcare and cost of living adjustments. </p>   <p>"The Big Three can afford to immediately give us our fair share," Fain told UAW members on Wednesday. </p>   <p>Fain has called out previous UAW leaders for cutting deals with the automakers that he says did not favor the union's 150,000 members who work at these companies.</p>   <p>During the 2008 financial crisis, the UAW made major concessions to help auto companies get back on their feet. </p>   <p>Workers are still feeling the effects of those concessions to this day — a key dynamic underpinning this year's negotiations. </p>   
   <p>"We just want the wages that they gave up during the recession of '08," said Brandon Bell, who works on the engine line at the Ford plant in Michigan that's currently on strike. "We're tired of giving — we want to receive this time."</p>   <p>Bell said he joined the picket line as soon at the strike began at midnight. </p>   <h3>Big 3 profits have soared</h3>   <p>Under Fain, the UAW has also hinged its demands on the automakers' profits in recent years, as well as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/13/1198938942/high-ceo-pay-inequality-labor-union-uaw-workers">pay disparities</a> between top executives and rank-and-file union members. </p>   <p>Collectively, the Big Three automakers have seen their profits soar during the pandemic when factors including parts shortages led to surging car prices, padding the profit margins of companies.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1199673874" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>In a Facebook Live event on Wednesday night, Fain compared the companies' profits — up 65% over four years — to autoworkers' pay, which increased just 6% in that same timeframe. </p>   <p>CEO pay has also been a major issue of contention. </p>   <p>GM CEO Mary Barra, the highest-paid chief executive among the Big Three, made nearly $29 million in 2022. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that this is 362 times the median GM employee's paycheck.</p>   <p>In an interview with CNN on Friday morning, just hours after the launch of the strike, Barra responded to concerns about her pay raise far outpacing those of rank-and-file union members by pointing to the profit sharing and healthcare components of GM's proposal.</p>   <p>And in a video to workers on Thursday, Barra highlighted her background as a "second-generation GM employee who grew up in a union family," mirroring Fain's personal anecdotes in his address to UAW members earlier this week.  </p>   <p>"Ensuring the long-term success of our company is not only my job — it's a responsibility that hits home," Barra said.</p>   <div id="res1199674211">

   <h3>The automakers are frustrated</h3>   <p>All three automakers have budged on their initial wage proposals, from opening bids of 9 or 10%<strong> </strong>increases to as high as 20% in the most recent offers. The union argues those offers don't sufficiently account for years of stagnant wages. </p>   
   <p>But the companies say they've made genuine attempts to reach agreements. General Motors attempted to head off a strike with a down-to-the-wire offer on Thursday afternoon, a proposal Barra called a "compelling and unprecedented economic package."</p>   <p>"It addresses what you've told us is most important to you, in spite of the heated rhetoric from UAW leadership," Barra said in a statement about GM's latest offer, which would raise wages by 20% over the length of the contract.</p>   <p>The three companies have also put cost of living protections on the table — though the union says these offers wouldn't provide enough wage protection to keep up with inflation over the next four-and-a-half years. </p>   <p>Ford sources told reporters on Thursday that meeting the UAW's demands in full would completely halt new production due to much higher labor costs. </p>   <p>"If we signed up for the UAW's requests ... we would've lost $15 billion and gone bankrupt by now," Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNBC on Thursday. "There's no way we can be sustainable as a company."</p>   <p>UAW members would still have to ratify any deal struck between union negotiators and one of the automakers, and workers could choose to send their leaders back to the table to push for more.</p>   <div id="res1199674499">

   <h3>The summer of labor</h3>   <p>The UAW walkout is the 17th strike in the U.S. involving more than 2,000 workers so far this year, according to data from the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. </p>   <p>Many other unions have threatened to strike — in some cases resulting in substantial gains for workers. </p>   <p>After months of contentious negotiations that led 340,000 UPS workers to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/25/1189956641/ups-union-calls-off-strike-threat-after-securing-pay-raises-for-workers">brink of a strike</a>, the Teamsters union in July secured a 48% average total wage increase, over the course of the five-year contract, for existing part-time workers.</p>   <p>In August, the Allied Pilots Association, which represents 15,000 American Airlines <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/22/1176897959/united-american-airlines-southwest-pilots-contract-summer-travel-picket">pilots</a>, successfully pressured the airlines to increase pilots' pay by more than 46% over four years.</p>

   <p>But some labor experts say the autoworkers might not have the same leverage as UPS workers and pilots to get that big of a pay raise. </p>   <p>The Big Three automakers were once the main choice for many Americans. But today, the market is populated with foreign automakers such as Toyota and Volkswagen, which are not being impacted by strike threats and can continue to produce cars at a steady clip.</p>   <p>"They don't have exceptional leverage because there's a lot of competition," said Harry Katz, a professor of collective bargaining at Cornell University, referring to automakers' ability to shift production to the non-union South or abroad.</p>

  <h2>The genesis of B612</h2>
  <p>In 2010, <a href="http://www.airbus.com/" target="_blank" title="Visit Airbus website" rel="noopener">Airbus</a>
    initiated a
    research collaboration with <a href="http://enac.fr/" target="_blank" title="Visit ENAC website" rel="noopener"><abbr title="École Nationale de l'Aviation Civile">ENAC</abbr></a> and <a href="http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Visit Université de Toulouse III website">Université de Toulouse III</a> on
    a prospective
    study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of information on the
    cockpit screens, in particular in terms of legibility and comfort of reading, and to optimize the overall
    homogeneity of the cockpit.</p>

  <p>2 years later, Airbus came to find <a href="http://intactile.com/" target="_blank" title="Visit intactile DESIGN website" rel="noopener">Intactile DESIGN</a> to work on the design of the eight
    typographic
    variants of the font. This one, baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry" target="_blank" title="Saint‑Exupéry on Wikipedia" rel="noopener">Saint‑Exupéry</a>, benefited from a complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting" target="_blank" title="Learn what is hinting on Wikipedia" rel="noopener">hinting</a> on all the characters.</p>

<p>New surveillance footage appears to show Transportation Security Administration officers at Miami International Aiport going through travelers' bags and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/3-miami-tsa-officers-accused-of-stealing-from-airport-passengers-during-screenings/3067403/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/3-miami-tsa-officers-accused-of-stealing-from-airport-passengers-during-screenings/3067403/" target="_blank">allegedly stealing money during security screenings</a>.</p>

<p>Two TSA agents are facing charges in the alleged thefts following their arrests in July.</p>

<p>Josue Gonzalez and Labarrius Williams are facing grand theft charges. A third TSA agent was <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/charges-dropped-for-1-of-3-tsa-officers-accused-of-stealing-from-miami-airport-passengers/3085619/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/charges-dropped-for-1-of-3-tsa-officers-accused-of-stealing-from-miami-airport-passengers/3085619/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initially arrested but had her charges dropped</a>.</p>

<p>According to arrest reports, authorities started investigating thefts that had occurred at the airport's Security Checkpoint E.</p>


<p>Gonzalez was accepted into a state program where if he successfully completes it, his charges will get dropped.</p>

<p>For the next six months, Gonzalez must pay $700 to the two victims involved and he must do 25 hours of community service and give up his airport security credentials. </p>

<p>As for Williams, he was denied entry into the same program so he will head to trial. </p>

								One of three Transportation Security Administration officers at Miami International Aiport who were arrested after authorities said they were caught on camera stealing from passengers during security screenings is no longer facing charges.
							</p>
<p>Detectives discovered surveillance video showed the officers distracting passengers as they were being screened so they could steal money from their belongings, the reports said.</p>

<p>In one case, video provided by TSA showed Williams and Gonzalez removing $600 from a passenger's wallet as the passenger was being screened, the reports said.</p>

<p>In one of the videos released Monday, the two appear to be casually going through a pocket of a black bag. When one agent walks away, the other appears to take something from the bin and put in his pocket.</p>

<p>In another video, the agent appears to put his hand in a Louis Vuitton bag and pull something out of the pouch, setting the item to the side. Later down the conveyor belt, the same agent is seen grabbing that item before it gets screened.</p>

<p>Gonzalez and Williams have pleaded not guilty. They're awaiting their next court date.</p>

    </header>
    <p>You can only claim to be contrarian if people actually defend the opposite viewpoint. Well, one of the “best practices” I <a href="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2023-08-06-disagreeing-best-practices.html">disagree with</a> was recently <a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/09/use-abstraction-to-improve-function.html">featured in the Google Testing Blog</a> — usually a very good resource, there is a reason that post appeared in my newsreader!</p>
<p>The authors present two versions of a function and ask which one is the most readable.</p>
<p><img alt="createPizza" src="https://blog.separateconcerns.com/img/linear-code.png"></p>
<p>At first glance, we can already notice the presentation is a bit partisan :) In addition to the obvious background color bias, the authors ellipsed some code on the right-hand side, making both implementations appear roughly the same size when the right one is really much longer.</p>
<p>The authors argue that the function on the right is more readable because it does not mix levels of abstraction, and that makes it more “top-down”. Well, OK, but the function of the left reads linearly from the top of the screen to the bottom, whereas if you want to understand everything that happens on the right-hand side you need to jump back and forth.</p>
<p>You may tell me, sure, but you never need to look at the whole code, that is what abstraction is for! OK. Quick, tell me this: does the function that bakes the pizza also heat the oven, or do you need to preheat it first? Hint: there are <strong>two</strong> functions. One is called <code>bake</code> and takes a Pizza, and the other is called <code>bakePizza</code>…</p>
<p>Also, what happens if you pass a pizza to those functions twice? Are they idempotent or do you end up eating cinder?</p>
<p>So, you may have guessed that I do not like the code style on the right. But I have to admit something: it is somehow easier to understand than the code on the left. Is that because of the structure that separates the levels of abstraction? Let us see. What about that version?</p>
<pre><code>func createPizza(order *Order) *Pizza {
  // Prepare pizza
  pizza := &amp;Pizza{Base: order.Size,
                  Sauce: order.Sauce,
                  Cheese: “Mozzarella”}

  // Add toppings
  if order.kind == “Veg” {
    pizza.Toppings = vegToppings
  } else if order.kind == “Meat” {
    pizza.Toppings = meatToppings
  }

  oven := oven.New()
  if oven.Temp != cookingTemp {
    // Heat oven
    for (oven.Temp &lt; cookingTemp) {
      time.Sleep(checkOvenInterval)
      oven.Temp = getOvenTemp(oven)
    }
  }

  if !pizza.Baked {
    // Bake pizza
    oven.Insert(pizza)
    time.Sleep(cookTime)
    oven.Remove(pizza)
    pizza.Baked = true
  }

  // Box and slice
  box := box.New()
  pizza.Boxed = box.PutIn(pizza)
  pizza.Sliced = box.SlicePizza(order.Size)
  pizza.Ready = box.Close()

  return pizza
}
</code></pre>
<p>Do you recognize it? This is just the left-hand side function code, with function names from the right-hand side added as comments.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but this is my favorite. And it looks like the readability just came from explaining what we did properly here, not from extra abstraction layers and indirection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I stand by what I said earlier: do not extract small functions from linear code, especially if you only use them once. None of the benefits offsets the loss in linearity.</p>
<section id="One-more-thing">
<h2>One more thing</h2>
<p>I wasn’t sure if I wanted to mention this or not, but I ended up editing the post because there is something that bothers me with this function, and it is that business with the oven.</p>
<p>First, pre-heating the oven is self-contained and should probably be a method of the oven itself. But beyond that, this code makes no sense: why would you create a whole new oven to make a pizza? In real life, you get an oven <strong>once</strong>, and then you bake a whole lot of pizzas with it, without going through the whole heating cycle.</p>
<p>I know this is a synthetic example but this kind of issue actually occurs in real code and sometimes causes performance issues. It is likely that this code should <strong>take</strong> the oven as a parameter. Providing it is the job of the caller.</p>
<p>(And since you put the pizza in the box, you probably want an interface where you return the box, not the pizza. Oh well.)</p>

 Mathematicians study a variety of different mathematical structures, but perhaps the structures that are most commonly associated with mathematics are the <em>number systems</em>, such as the integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+Z%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+Z%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+Z%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf Z}}"> or the real numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}}">. Indeed, the use of number systems is so closely identified with the practice of mathematics that one sometimes forgets that it is possible to do mathematics without explicit reference to any concept of number. For instance, the ancient Greeks were able to prove many theorems in Euclidean geometry, well before the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian coordinates</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry">analytic geometry</a> in the seventeenth century, or the formal constructions or axiomatisations of the real number system that emerged in the nineteenth century (not to mention precursor concepts such as zero or negative numbers, whose very existence was highly controversial, if entertained at all, to the ancient Greeks). To do this, the Greeks used geometric operations as substitutes for the arithmetic operations that would be more familiar to modern mathematicians. For instance, concatenation of line segments or planar regions serves as a substitute for addition; the operation of forming a rectangle out of two line segments would serve as a substitute for multiplication; the concept of similarity can be used as a substitute for ratios or division; and so forth.
</p>
<p>
A similar situation exists in modern physics. Physical quantities such as length, mass, momentum, charge, and so forth are routinely measured and manipulated using the real number system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}}"> (or related systems, such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}^3}"> if one wishes to measure a vector-valued physical quantity such as velocity). Much as analytic geometry allows one to use the laws of algebra and trigonometry to calculate and prove theorems in geometry, the identification of physical quantities with numbers allows one to express physical laws and relationships (such as Einstein’s famous mass-energy equivalence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dmc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dmc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dmc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E=mc^2}">) as algebraic (or differential) equations, which can then be solved and otherwise manipulated through the extensive mathematical toolbox that has been developed over the centuries to deal with such equations.
</p>

However, as any student of physics is aware, most physical quantities are not represented <em>purely</em> by one or more numbers, but instead by a combination of a number and some sort of <em>unit</em>. For instance, it would be a category error to assert that the length of some object was a number such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{10}">; instead, one has to say something like “the length of this object is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{10}"> yards”, combining both a number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{10}"> and a unit (in this case, the yard). Changing the unit leads to a change in the numerical value assigned to this physical quantity, even though no physical change to the object being measured has occurred. For instance, if one decides to use feet as the unit of length instead of yards, then the length of the object is now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{30}"> feet; if one instead uses metres, the length is now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B9.144%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B9.144%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B9.144%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{9.144}"> metres; and so forth. But nothing physical has changed when performing this change of units, and these lengths are considered all equal to each other: </p>

It is then common to declare that while physical quantities and units are not, strictly speaking, numbers, they should be manipulated using the laws of algebra <em>as if</em> they were numerical quantities. For instance, if an object travels <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{10}"> metres in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{5}"> seconds, then its speed should be </p>

There is however one important limitation to the ability to manipulate “dimensionful” quantities as if they were numbers: one is not supposed to add, subtract, or compare two physical quantities if they have different dimensions, although it is acceptable to multiply or divide two such quantities.

These limitations may seem like a weakness in the mathematical modeling of physical quantities; one may think that one could get a more “powerful” mathematical framework if one were allowed to perform dimensionally inconsistent operations, such as add together a mass and a velocity, add together a vector and a scalar, exponentiate a length, etc. Certainly there is some precedent for this in mathematics; for instance, the formalism of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra">Clifford algebras</a> does in fact allow one to (among other things) add vectors with scalars, and in differential geometry it is quite common to formally apply transcendental functions (such as the exponential function) to a differential form (for instance, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville_measure">Liouville measure</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%21%7D+%5Comega%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%21%7D+%5Comega%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%21%7D+%5Comega%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\frac{1}{n!} \omega^n}"> of a symplectic manifold can be usefully thought of as a component of the exponential <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cexp%28%5Comega%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cexp%28%5Comega%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cexp%28%5Comega%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\exp(\omega)}"> of the symplectic form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\omega}">).

However, there are several reasons why it is advantageous to retain the limitation to only perform dimensionally consistent operations. One is that of error correction: one can often catch (and correct for) errors in one’s calculations by discovering a dimensional inconsistency, and tracing it back to the first step where it occurs. Also, by performing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis">dimensional analysis</a>, one can often identify the form of a physical law before one has fully derived it. For instance, if one postulates the existence of a mass-energy relationship involving only the mass of an object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{m}">, the energy content <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E}">, and the speed of light <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{c}">, dimensional analysis is already sufficient to deduce that the relationship must be of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE+%3D+%5Calpha+mc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE+%3D+%5Calpha+mc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE+%3D+%5Calpha+mc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E = \alpha mc^2}"> for some dimensionless absolute constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\alpha}">; the only remaining task is then to work out the constant of proportionality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\alpha}">, which requires physical arguments beyond that provided by dimensional analysis.

The use of units and dimensional analysis has certainly been proven to be very effective tools in physics. But one can pose the question of whether it has a properly grounded mathematical foundation, in order to settle any lingering unease about using such tools in physics, and also in order to rigorously develop such tools for purely mathematical purposes (such as analysing identities and inequalities in such fields of mathematics as harmonic analysis or partial differential equations).
</p>
<p>
The example of Euclidean geometry mentioned previously offers one possible approach to formalising the use of dimensions. For instance, one could model the length of a line segment not by a number, but rather by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class">equivalence class</a> of all line segments congruent to the original line segment (cf. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers#The_oldest_definition">Frege-Russell definition of a number</a>). Similarly, the area of a planar region can be modeled not by a number, but by the equivalence class of all regions that are <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Equidecomposable.html">equidecomposable</a> with the original region (one can, if one wishes, restrict attention here to measurable sets in order to avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox">Banach-Tarski-type paradoxes</a>, though that particular paradox actually only arises in three and higher dimensions). As mentioned before, it is then geometrically natural to multiply two lengths to form an area, by taking a rectangle whose line segments have the stated lengths, and using the area of that rectangle as a product. This geometric picture works well for units such as length and volume that have a spatial geometric interpretation, but it is less clear how to apply it for more general units. For instance, it does not seem geometrically natural (or, for that matter, conceptually helpful) to envision the equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dmc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dmc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dmc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E=mc^2}"> as the assertion that the energy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E}"> is the volume of a rectangular box whose height is the mass <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{m}"> and whose length and width is given by the speed of light <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{c}">.

But there are at least two other ways to formalise dimensionful quantities in mathematics, which I will discuss below the fold. The first is a “parametric” model in which dimensionful objects are modeled as numbers (or vectors, matrices, etc.) depending on some base dimensional parameters (such as units of length, mass, and time, or perhaps a coordinate system for space or spacetime), and transforming according to some representation of a <em>structure group</em> that encodes the range of these parameters; this type of “coordinate-heavy” model is often used (either implicitly or explicitly) by physicists in order to efficiently perform calculations, particularly when manipulating vector or tensor-valued quantities. The second is an “abstract” model in which dimensionful objects now live in an abstract mathematical space (e.g. an abstract vector space), in which only a subset of the operations available to general-purpose number systems such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}}"> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}^3}"> are available, namely those operations which are “dimensionally consistent” or invariant (or more precisely, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivariant_map">equivariant</a>) with respect to the action of the underlying structure group. This sort of “coordinate-free” approach tends to be the one which is preferred by pure mathematicians, particularly in the various branches of modern geometry, in part because it can lead to greater conceptual clarity, as well as results of great generality; it is also close to the more informal practice of treating mathematical manipulations that do not preserve dimensional consistency as being physically meaningless.

In the parametric approach to formalising units and dimension, we postulate the existence of one or more dimensional parameters; for sake of discussion, let us initially use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2C+L%2C+T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2C+L%2C+T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2C+L%2C+T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M, L, T}"> (representing the mass unit, length unit, and time unit respectively) for the dimensional parameters, though later in this discussion we will consider other sets of dimensional parameters. We will allow these parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}"> to range freely and independently among the positive real numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}^+}">, thus the parameter space (or <em>structure group</em>) here is given by the multiplicative group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{({\bf R}^+)^3}">. Later on, we will consider more general situations in which the parameter space is given by more general structure groups. (Actually, it would be slightly more natural to use a parameter space which was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_homogeneous_space">torsor</a> of the structure group, rather than the structure group itself; we discuss this at the very end of the post.)
</p>
<p>
We then distinguish two types of mathematical object in the “dimensionful universe”:
</p>
<ol>
<li> <em>Dimensionless objects</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x}">, which do not depend on the dimensional parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}">; </li>
<li> <em>Dimensionful objects</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+x_%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+x_%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+x_%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x = x_{M,L,T}}">, which depend on the dimensional parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}">.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Similarly with “object” replaced by “number”, “vector”, or any other mathematical object. (Strictly speaking, with this convention, a dimensionless object is a degenerate special case of a dimensionful object; one could, if one wished, talk about <em>strictly dimensionful</em> objects in which the dependence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x_{M,L,T}}"> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}"> is non-constant.) Our conventions will be slightly different when we turn to dimensionful <em>sets</em> rather than dimensionful <em>objects</em>, but we postpone discussion of this subtlety until later.
</p>
<p>
The distinction between dimensionless and dimensionful objects is analogous to the distinction between standard and (cheap) nonstandard objects in <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/a-cheap-version-of-nonstandard-analysis/">(cheap) nonstandard analysis</a>. However, whereas in nonstandard analysis the underlying parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\mathbf{n}}"> is usually thought of as an infinitely large parameter, in dimensional analysis the dimensional parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}"> are usually thought of as neither being infinitesimally small or infinitely large, but rather a medium-sized quantity taking values comparable to those encountered in the physical system being studied.
</p>
<p>
A typical example of a dimensionful quantity is the numerical length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bl+%3D+l_%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bl+%3D+l_%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bl+%3D+l_%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{l = l_{M,L,T}}"> of a physical rod <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{AB}">, in terms of a length unit which is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{L}"> yards (say) long.

The presence of the negative signs in <a href="#xml">(1)</a> may seem surprising at first, but this is due to the fact that <a href="#xml">(1)</a> is describing the effect of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_and_passive_transformation">passive change</a> of units rather than an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_and_passive_transformation">active change</a> of the object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x}">.</p>
<p>
(Note here one slight defect of this approach in modeling physical quantities, in that one has to select a preferred system of units (in this case, yards, seconds, and some unspecified mass unit) in order to interpret the parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}"> numerically. As mentioned above, one can avoid this by viewing the parameters as torsors rather than numbers; we will discuss this briefly at the end of this post.)

In the language of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory">representation theory</a>, the collection of dimensionful quantities of dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M^a L^b T^c}"> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_space#Weight_space_of_a_representation">weight space</a> of the structure group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3+%3D+%5C%7B+%28M%2CL%2CT%29%3A+M%2CL%2CT+%5Cin+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B+%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3+%3D+%5C%7B+%28M%2CL%2CT%29%3A+M%2CL%2CT+%5Cin+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B+%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3+%3D+%5C%7B+%28M%2CL%2CT%29%3A+M%2CL%2CT+%5Cin+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B+%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{({\bf R}^+)^3 = \{ (M,L,T): M,L,T \in {\bf R}^+ \}}"> of weight <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a%2Cb%2Cc%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a%2Cb%2Cc%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a%2Cb%2Cc%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{(a,b,c)}">. One can indeed view dimensional analysis as being the representation theory of groups such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{({\bf R}^+)^3}">, this viewpoint will become more prominent when we consider more general structure groups than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%2B%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{({\bf R}^+)^3}"> later in this section.

Note that with this definition, it is possible that some dimensionful quantities do not have any specific dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M^a L^b T^c}">, due to the dependence on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}"> being more complicated than a simple power law relationship. To give a (contrived) example, the dimensionful quantity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%5E%7B%5Csin%28M%2BT%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%5E%7B%5Csin%28M%2BT%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%5E%7B%5Csin%28M%2BT%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{L^{\sin(M+T)}}"> does not have any specific dimension attached to it.
</p>
<p>
We can manipulate dimensionful quantities mathematically by applying any given mathematical operation pointwise for each choice of dimensional parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}">.

On the other hand, this analysis helps explain why we almost never see such hybrid dimensional quantities appear in a physical problem, because while one can bound a positive quantity with a single dimension by a combination of positive quantities of different dimensions (as in <a href="#lv">(2)</a>), the converse is not possible: one cannot bound a positive quantity of hybrid dimension by a quantity with a single dimension. As a consequence, if one is trying to establish an inequality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cleq+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cleq+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cleq+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x \leq y}"> between two positive quantities of the same dimension by writing down a chain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cleq+z_1+%5Cleq+%5Cldots%5Cleq+z_n+%5Cleq+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cleq+z_1+%5Cleq+%5Cldots%5Cleq+z_n+%5Cleq+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cleq+z_1+%5Cleq+%5Cldots%5Cleq+z_n+%5Cleq+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x \leq z_1 \leq \ldots\leq z_n \leq y}"> of intermediate inequalities, one cannot have any of the intermediate quantities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{z_j}"> be of hybrid dimension, as this will necessarily cause one of the inequalities in the chain to fail as soon as one attempts to bound a hybrid quantity by a non-hybrid quantity.

We have already observed that to verify a dimensionally consistent statement between dimensionful quantities, it suffices to do so for a single choice of the dimension parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}">; one can view this as being analogous to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_principle">transfer principle</a> in nonstandard analysis, relating dimensionful mathematics with dimensionless mathematics. Thus, for instance, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%2C+m%2C+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%2C+m%2C+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%2C+m%2C+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E, m, c}"> have the units of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+L%5E2+T%5E%7B-2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+L%5E2+T%5E%7B-2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+L%5E2+T%5E%7B-2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M L^2 T^{-2}}">, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M}">, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL+T%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL+T%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL+T%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{L T^{-1}}"> respectively, then to verify the dimensionally consistent identity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dmc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dmc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dmc%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E=mc^2}">, it suffices to do so for a single choice of units <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}">.

Note that once we sacrifice dimensional consistency, though, we cannot then transfer back to the dimensionful setting; the identity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%3Dm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E=m}"> does not hold for all choices of units, only the special choice of units for which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{c=1}">. So we see a tradeoff between the freedom to vary units, and the freedom to work with dimensionally inconsistent equations; one can spend one freedom for another, but one cannot have both at the same time. (This is closely related to the concept of <em>spending symmetry</em>, which I discuss for instance <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/09/27/what-is-a-gauge/">in this post</a> (or in Section 2.1 of <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/spending-symmetry/">this book</a>).)

<p>
Thus far, we have only considered scalar dimensionful quantities: quantities which, for each choice of dimensional parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}">, take values in a number system such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}}">. One can similarly consider vector-valued or matrix-valued dimensionful quantities, with only minor changes (though see below, when we consider coordinate systems to themselves be a dimensional parameter). We remark though that one could consider vectors in which different components have different dimensions. For instance, one could consider a four-dimensional vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x%2Cy%2Cz%2Ct%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x%2Cy%2Cz%2Ct%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x%2Cy%2Cz%2Ct%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{(x,y,z,t)}"> in which the first three components <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x,y,z}"> have the dimension of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{L}">, while the final component <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{t}"> has the dimension of time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{T}">.

(See also <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/12/27/tricks-wiki-use-basic-examples-to-calibrate-exponents/">this blog post</a> for an equivalent way to establish these conditions, using rescaled test functions instead of dimensional analysis; as mentioned earlier, the relation between these two approaches is essentially the difference between <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/12/27/tricks-wiki-use-basic-examples-to-calibrate-exponents/">active and passive transformations</a>.)</p>
<p>
We saw earlier that hybrid inequalities (in which the right-hand side contains terms of different dimension) are not as useful or “efficient” as dimensionally pure inequalities (in which both sides have the same, single dimension). But it is often possible to <em>amplify</em> a hybrid inequality into a dimensionally pure one by optimising over all rescalings; see <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/09/05/amplification-arbitrage-and-the-tensor-power-trick/">this previous blog post</a> for a discussion of this trick (which, among other things, amplifies the inhomogeneous Sobolev inequality into the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality).

One can also assign dimensions to higher rank <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor">tensors</a>, such as matrices, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{k}">-vectors, or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{k}">-forms; the notation here becomes rather complicated, but is perhaps best described using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_index_notation">abstract index notation</a>. The dimensional consistency of equations involving such tensors then becomes the requirement in abstract index notation that the subscripts and superscripts on the left-hand side of a tensor equation must match those on the right-hand side, after “canceling” any index that appears as both a subscript and a superscript on one side. (Abstract index notation is discussed further in <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/03/26/285g-lecture-0-riemannian-manifolds-and-curvature/">this previous blog post</a>.)

Thus we see a rigorous distinction between the concepts of position and displacement vector that one sometimes sees in introductory linear algebra or physics courses. Note for instance that one can add a position vector to a displacement vector to obtain another position vector, or a displacement vector to a displacement vector to obtain a further displacement vector, but when adding a position vector to another position vector, one obtains a new type of vector which is neither a position vector nor a displacement vector. (On the other hand, convex combinations of position vectors still give a position vector as output.) The dimensional analysis distinction between position and displacement vectors can be useful in situations in which the ambient plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{P}"> has no preferred origin, allowing for a clean action by the Euclidean group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%282%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%282%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%282%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E(2)}"> (or at least the translation subgroup <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}^2}">).</p>

In a similar vein, one can dimensionally analyse physical quantities in spacetime using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group">Poincaré group</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BSO%283%2C1%29+%5Cltimes+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%7B3%2B1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BSO%283%2C1%29+%5Cltimes+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%7B3%2B1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BSO%283%2C1%29+%5Cltimes+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%7B3%2B1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{SO(3,1) \ltimes {\bf R}^{3+1}}"> as the structure group, in which case the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity">principle of special relativity</a> can be interpreted as the assertion that all physical quantities transform cleanly with respect to this group action (as opposed to having a hybrid transformation law, or one which privileges a specific reference frame). Similarly, if one enlarges the structure group to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism_group">diffeomorphism group</a> of spacetime, one recovers the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity#General_principle_of_relativity">principle of general relativity</a> (though an important caveat here is that if the spacetime is topologically non-trivial, one needs to work with <em>local</em> coordinate charts (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology)">atlases</a> of such charts, and the structure group needs to be relaxed to a looser concept, such as that of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudogroup">pseudogroup</a>) rather than a single global coordinate chart, which greatly complicates the parametrisation space). Using a group of gauge transformations instead as the symmetry group leads to a mathematical framework suitable for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_transformation#Classical_gauge_theory">gauge theory</a>; and so forth.

<p><b> —  2. The abstract approach  — </b></p>
<p>
The parameteric approach described above is essentially the one which is emphasised in physics courses, in which any mathematical representation of a physical object includes a description of how that representation transforms with respect to elements of the relevant structure group, so that in effect all coordinatisations of the object are considered simultaneously. However, in pure mathematics it is often more preferable to take a more abstract, “coordinate free” approach, in which explicit use of coordinates is avoided whenever possible, in order to keep the mathematical framework as close as possible to the underlying geometry or physics of the situation, and also in order to allow for easy generalisation to other contexts of mathematical interest in which coordinate systems become inconvenient to use (as we already saw in the case of general relativity on a topologically non-trivial situations, in which global coordinate systems had to be replaced by local ones), or completely unavailable (e.g. in studying more general topological spaces than manifolds). With this abstract, minimalistic approach, one models objects as elements of abstract structures in which only the bare minimum of operations (namely, the “geometric”, “physical”, or “dimensionally consistent” operations) are permitted, viewing any excess structure (such as coordinates) as superfluous ontological baggage to be discarded if possible.
</p>
<p>
We have already implicitly seen this philosophy when discussing the example of different coordinatisations of a three-dimensional vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{V}">. One can simply forget about coordinatisations altogether, and view <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{V}"> as an abstract vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV+%3D+%28V%2C0%2C%2B%2C%5Ccdot%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV+%3D+%28V%2C0%2C%2B%2C%5Ccdot%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV+%3D+%28V%2C0%2C%2B%2C%5Ccdot%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{V = (V,0,+,\cdot)}">, with the only operations initially available on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{V}"> being that of addition and scalar multiplication, which obey a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Definition">standard set of compatibility axioms</a> which we omit here.

<p>
One can add or remove structures to this vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{V}">, depending on the situation. For instance, if one wants to remove the preferred origin from the vector space, one can work instead with the slightly weaker structure of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space">affine space</a>, in which no preferred origin is present. In order to recover the operations of Euclidean geometry, one can then place a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_metric">Euclidean metric</a> on the affine space; in some situations, one may also wish to add an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(vector_space)">orientation</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_measure">Haar measure</a> to the list of structures. By adding or deleting such structures, one changes the group of isomorphisms of the space (or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupoid">groupoid</a> of isomorphisms between different spaces in the same category), which serve as the analogue of the structure group in the parametric viewpoint. For instance, for a three-dimensional vector space with no additional structure, the group of isomorphisms is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BGL_3%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BGL_3%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BGL_3%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{GL_3({\bf R})}"> (or more precisely, the group is isomorphic to this matrix group). Adding a Euclidean metric on this space reduces the group to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO_3%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO_3%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO_3%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{O_3({\bf R})}">, but then deleting the origin increases it again to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_3%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_3%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_3%28%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{E_3({\bf R})}">, and so forth. In the Kleinian approach to geometry as described by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program">Erlangen program</a>, the group of isomorphisms plays a primary role; indeed, one can view any given type of geometry (e.g. Euclidean geometry, affine geometry, projective geometry, spherical geometry, etc.) as the study of all structures on a given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_space">homogeneous space</a> that are invariant with respect to the action of the group of isomorphisms.
</p>
<p>
Many foundational mathematical structures (e.g. vector spaces, groups, rings, fields, topological spaces, measure spaces, etc.) are routinely presented in this sort of abstract, axiomatic framework, without reference to explicit coordinates or number systems. (But there are some exceptions; for instance, the standard definition of a smooth manifold (or a complex manifold, etc.) makes reference to an altas of smooth coordinate charts, the standard definition of an algebraic variety or scheme makes reference to affine charts, and so forth.) One can apply the same abstract perspective to scalars, such as the length or mass of an object, by viewing these quantities as lying in an abstract one-dimensional real vector space, rather than in a copy of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}}">.

For instance, to continue the example of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}"> system of dimensions from the previous section, we can postulate the existence of three one-dimensional real vector spaces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5EM%2C+V%5EL%2C+V%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5EM%2C+V%5EL%2C+V%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5EM%2C+V%5EL%2C+V%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{V^M, V^L, V^T}"> (which are supposed to represent the vector space of possible masses, lengths, and times, where we permit for now the possibility of negative values for these units). As it is physically natural to distinguish between positive and negative masses, lengths, or times, we endow these one-dimensional spaces with a total ordering (obeying the obvious compatibility conditions with the vector space structure), so that these spaces are ordered one-dimensional real vector spaces. However, we do not designate a preferred unit in these spaces (which would identify each of them with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}}">).
</p>

(Note that the usual definitions of integral and dimension (as limits of Riemann sums and Newton quotients respectively) can be extended to this abstract dimensionful setting, so long as one keeps track of the dimensionality of all objects involved.) But if a statement is dimensionally consistent and can be proven in a dimensionless framework, then it should be provable in the abstract dimensionful setting as well (indeed, if all else fails, one can simply pick a set of coordinates to express all the abstract quantities here numerically, and then run the dimensionless argument). So, while the abstract framework is apparently less powerful than the parameterised framework due to the restricted number of operations available, in practice it can be a more useful framework to work in, as the operations that remain in the framework tend to be precisely the ones that one actually needs to solve problems (provided, of course, that one has chosen the right abstract formalism that is adapted to the symmetries of the situation).
</p>

It is possible to convert the abstract framework into the parametric one by making some non-canonical choices of a reference unit system. For instance, in the abstract <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}"> dimensional system, after selecting a reference system of units <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_0+%5Cin+V%5EM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_0+%5Cin+V%5EM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_0+%5Cin+V%5EM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M_0 \in V^M}">, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_0+%5Cin+V%5EL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_0+%5Cin+V%5EL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_0+%5Cin+V%5EL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{L_0 \in V^L}">, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT_0+%5Cin+V%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT_0+%5Cin+V%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT_0+%5Cin+V%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{T_0 \in V^T}">, one can then identify <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}^{M^a L^b T^c}}"> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}}"> by identifying <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_0%5Ea+L_0%5Eb+T_0%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_0%5Ea+L_0%5Eb+T_0%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_0%5Ea+L_0%5Eb+T_0%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M_0^a L_0^b T_0^c}"> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{1}">, so that any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cin+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cin+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cin+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%5E%7BM%5Ea+L%5Eb+T%5Ec%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x \in {\bf R}^{M^a L^b T^c}}"> gets identified with some real number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+x+%5Cin+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+x+%5Cin+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+x+%5Cin+%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\tilde x \in {\bf R}}">.

One way to avoid this (which was alluded to previously) is to interpret <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}"> not as scalars in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}}">, but rather as elements of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\bf R}}">-torsors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5EM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5EM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5EM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{V^M}">, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5EL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5EL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5EL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{V^L}">, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%5ET%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{V^T}"> respectively. With this modification to the parametric framework, the reference units <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_0%2CL_0%2CT_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_0%2CL_0%2CT_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_0%2CL_0%2CT_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M_0,L_0,T_0}"> can now be omitted. On the other hand, by turning the parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%2CL%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{M,L,T}"> into abstractly dimensionful quantities instead of dimensionless scalars, one loses some of the power of the parametric model, namely the power to perform numerical operations even if they are dimensionally inconsistent, and so one may as well work entirely in the abstract setting instead.
