<p>If you’re anything like me, when you’re starting a project, there’s a paralyzing period of indecision while you try to figure out how to build it. In the JavaScript world, that usually boils down to picking a framework. Do you go with Ol’ Reliable, a.k.a. React? Something slimmer and trendier, like Svelte or Solid? How about kicking it old school with a server-side framework and HTMX?</p>
<p>When I was writing my <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">CRDT blog post series</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/og/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">An Interactive Intro to CRDTs | jakelazaroff.com</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">CRDTs don't have to be all academic papers and math jargon.

Here’s an example: a toy collaborative pixel art editor.</p>

<p>Even though I’ve written before — and still believe — that <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">React is a good default option</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/og/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">No One Ever Got Fired for Choosing React | jakelazaroff.com</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a project without a framework.</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">jakelazaroff.com/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>, the constraints of a project should determine the technology decisions. In this case, I chose to use vanilla JS web components. I want to talk about why.</p>
<p>There was one guiding principle for this project: although they happened to be built with HTML, CSS and JS, these examples were <strong>content, not code</strong>. In other words, they’d be handled more or less the same as any image or video I would include in my blog posts. They should be portable to any place in which I can render HTML.</p>

I really like Astro, but it’s reasonable to assume that this website won’t run on it forever.</p>
<p>One thing that has made these migrations easier in recent years is keeping all my content in plain text files written in Markdown. Rather than dealing with the invariably convoluted process of moving my content between systems — exporting it from one, importing it into another, fixing any incompatibilities, maybe removing some things that I can’t find a way to port over — I drop my Markdown files into the new website and it mostly Just Works.</p>
<p>Most website generators have a way to include more complex markup within your content, and Astro is no different. The MDX integration allows you to render Astro components within your Markdown files. Those components have access to all the niceties of the Astro build system: you can write HTML, CSS and JS within one file, and Astro will automagically extract and optimize everything for you. It will scope CSS selectors and compile TypeScript and let you conditionally render markup and do all sorts of other fancy stuff.</p>
<p>The drawback, of course, is that it all only works inside Astro. In order to switch to a different site generator, I’d have to rewrite those components. I might need to split up the HTML, CSS and JS, or configure a new build system, or find a new way to scope styles. So Astro-specific features were off limits — no matter how convenient.</p>
<p>But Markdown has a secret weapon: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">you can write HTML inside of it</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Daring Fireball: Markdown Syntax Documentation</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://daringfireball.net/graphics/favicon.ico#html" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>! That means any fancy interactive diagrams I wanted to add would be just as portable as my the rest of my Markdown as long as I could express them as plain HTML tags.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Web components</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.cd6c4a5a.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Web Components - Web APIs | MDN</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.cbbd161b.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a> hit that nail square on the head. They’re a set of W3C standards for building reusable HTML elements. You use them by writing a class for a custom element, registering a tag name and using it in your markup. Here’s how I embedded that pixel art editor before:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>pixelart-demo</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>pixelart-demo</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>That’s the honest-to-goodness HTML I have in the Markdown for this post. That’s it! There’s no special setup; I don’t have to remember to put specific elements on the page before calling a function or load a bunch of extra resources.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-cheating" id="user-content-fnref-cheating" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup> Of course, I do need to keep the JS files around and link to them with a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. But that goes for any media: there needs to be <strong>some</strong> way to reference it from within textual content. With web components, once the script is loaded, the tag name gets registered and works anywhere on the page — even if the markup is present before the JavaScript runs.</p>
<p>Web components encapsulate all their HTML, CSS and JS within a single file, with no build system necessary. Having all the code for a component in one place significantly reduces my mental overhead, and I continue to be a huge fan of single-file components for their developer experience. While web components aren’t <strong>quite</strong> as nice to write as their Astro or Svelte counterparts, they’re still super convenient.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-frameworks" id="user-content-fnref-frameworks" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Everything is nicely contained within this one file. There is that one import at the top, but it’s an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">ES module import</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.cd6c4a5a.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">JavaScript modules - JavaScript | MDN</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">This guide gives you all you need to get started with JavaScript module syntax.</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.cbbd161b.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a> — it doesn’t rely on any sort of build system. As long as I keep all the files together, the browser will sort everything out.</p>
<p>Another nice thing about Web components is shadow DOM, which isolates the component from the surrounding page. I think shadow DOM is often awkward when you want to share styles between your components and the rest of your app, but it’s perfect when you do truly want everything to be isolated. Just like images and videos, these components will look and act the same no matter where they’re used.</p>
<p>Sorry — they’re not <strong>just</strong> like images and videos. Web components can expose attributes that allow you to configure them from the outside. You can think of them as native props. Voilà:</p>


<p>Two input ranges with different accent colors. In this case, I’m just setting a CSS variable, which is one of the few things allowed into the shadow DOM:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>range-slider</span> <span><span>style</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span><span>--accent</span><span>:</span> #0085F2</span><span>"</span></span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>range-slider</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s a more complex example:</p>
<pixelart-demo debug="true" resolution="20"></pixelart-demo>

<p>And here’s the markup. It uses attributes to alter the component’s behavior, setting the resolution to 20 and showing debug information on every pixel:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>pixelart-demo</span> <span>debug</span> <span>resolution</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>20<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>pixelart-demo</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you were wondering what those calls to <code>getAttribute</code> and <code>hasAttribute</code> were doing in the web component class, now you know. This was particularly useful when reusing the same component for different stages of a tutorial, allowing me to enable certain features as the tutorial progressed.</p>
<p>The other part of the equation was using vanilla JS. There are frameworks that compile to web components — most notably Lit (although I’d call it more of a library) but also Stencil, Svelte, and probably others. I’m sure they’re all wonderful tools that would have made my life easier in a lot of ways. But frameworks are dependencies, and dependencies have a bunch of tradeoffs. In this case, the tradeoff I’m most worried about is maintenance.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-vendoring" id="user-content-fnref-vendoring" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup></p>
<p>That goes for TypeScript, too. By my count, the last 15 versions of TypeScript have had breaking changes — many of them new features that I was happy to have, even though I had to change my code to accommodate them. But as much as I love TypeScript, it’s not a native substrate of the web. It’s still a dependency.</p>
<p>There’s a cost to using dependencies. New versions are released, APIs change, and it takes time and effort to make sure your own code remains compatible with them. And the cost accumulates over time. It would be one thing if I planned to continually work on this code; it’s usually simple enough to migrate from one version of a depenency to the next. But I’m not planning to ever really touch this code again unless I absolutely need to. And if I <strong>do</strong> ever need to touch this code, I <strong>really</strong> don’t want to go through multiple years’ worth of updates all at once.</p>

The more dependencies a website had, the more difficult it was to restore.</p>
<p>I’ve been building on the web for almost 20 years. That’s long enough to witness the birth, rise and fall of jQuery. Node.js was created, forked into io.js and merged back into Node. Backbone burst onto the scene and was quickly replaced with AngularJS, which was replaced with React, which has been around for only half that time and has <strong>still</strong> gone through like five different ways to write components.</p>
<p>But as the ecosystem around it swirled, the web platform itself remained remarkably stable — largely because the stewards of the standards painstakingly ensured that no new change would break existing websites.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-smooshgate" id="user-content-fnref-smooshgate" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">5</a></sup> The <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">original Space Jam website</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Space Jam</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://www.spacejam.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">www.spacejam.com/1996/</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a> from 1996 is famously still up, and renders perfectly in modern browsers.

<p>If we want that sort of longevity, we need to avoid dependencies that we don’t control and stick to standards that we know won’t break.

For all its warts, the web has become the most resilient, portable, future-proof computing platform we’ve ever created — at least, if we build with that in mind.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="preview-section-introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2><section id="s0005"><p id="p0010">Loyalty is a foundational moral principle, or virtue, that people usually value and aspire to embody in their social and business relations (Altman, 2008; Coughlan, 2005; Fiske, 1991, Fiske, 1992; Graham et al., 2011, Graham et al., 2013, Graham et al., 2018; Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007; Haidt &amp; Joseph, 2007; Reichheld, Markey Jr, &amp; Hopton, 2000; Shweder, Much, Mahapatra, &amp; Park, 1997; Souryal &amp; McKay, 1996; Van Kenhove, De Wulf, &amp; Steenhaut, 2003). Those who display loyalty to their countries, families, companies, religious organizations, sports teams, and other groups are publicly venerated (at least among their own group members), and the value placed on loyalty is emphasized in national oaths of allegiance, military and business mottos, anthems, literature, film, awards, and codes of conduct (Coleman, 2009; Connor, 2007; Hildreth, Gino, &amp; Bazerman, 2016; Kruger, 2021; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Souryal &amp; McKay, 1996). Individuals with reputations for loyalty (relative to those without such reputations) are considered to be better friends (Shaw, DeScioli, Barakzai, &amp; Kurzban, 2017), employees (Hirschman, 1970; McGinley &amp; Shi, 2022), and leaders (Fehr, Yam, &amp; Dang, 2015). Loyalty can also facilitate prosocial behavior by encouraging people to help others in their organizations and communities, and it can foster trust and cooperation among group members to achieve shared goals (Graham et al., 2011; Hirschman, 1970; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003). Disloyalty, in contrast, tends to elicit disgust, contempt, and moral outrage among observers, often damaging personal and professional reputations (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995; Haidt, 2003; McManus, Kleiman-Weiner, &amp; Young, 2020; Rousseau, 2001; Rozin, Lowery, Imada, &amp; Haidt, 1999).</p><p id="p0015">Decades of research across the fields of organizational behavior, psychology, evolutionary biology, and business ethics have identified numerous positive outcomes of loyalty and negative outcomes of disloyalty (Berry, Lewis Jr, &amp; Sowden, 2021; Haidt, 2003; Hirschman, 1970; Kruger, 2021; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003; Sinn &amp; Hayes, 2017; Van Kenhove et al., 2003). But is loyalty always beneficial? Although people tend to value loyalty as a moral virtue, it is possible that loyal people are disproportionately (and ironically) targeted for potentially harmful and unfair managerial practices in the contemporary workplace. Employing complementary methods and designs, we investigate whether and why loyalty could lead to deleterious consequences for those who are loyal. More specifically, we first investigate whether workers who have reputations for loyalty are perceived to be more exploitable, because loyal individuals are expected to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty.<sup>1</sup> We then investigate whether those employees who agree to poor treatment boost their reputations for being loyal. If workers are perceived to be more exploitable because of their reputations for loyalty and if agreeing to poor treatment boosts workers' reputations for loyalty, these bidirectional causal relations have the potential to create a vicious circle of suffering for certain workers.</p><section id="s0010"><p id="p0020">Researchers across different fields have examined several constructs related to loyalty that describe different components of interpersonal bonds and social relationships (e.g., feelings of attachment, commitment, identification, liking, love; Abrams &amp; Hogg, 1988; Brewer, 1999; Schrag, 2001; Mowday, Steers, &amp; Porter, 1979; O'Reilly &amp; Chatman, 1986; Mael &amp; Ashforth, 1992; Rubin, 1973; Seligman, Fazio, &amp; Zanna, 1980; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979; Scott, 1965; Sternberg, 1986). Much of what makes loyalty unique and distinct from related constructs is its inherent <em>moral</em> nature (Hildreth et al., 2016). That is, loyalty is a <em>moral</em> principle or virtue. The quintessential moral nature of loyalty is important because it creates a strong expectation, or perhaps even an obligation or imperative, to act in an individual's or group's interest, because it is the morally right thing to do (Hildreth et al., 2016).</p><p id="p0025">The inherent moral nature of loyalty is reflected in recent theorizing. For example, Shweder et al. (1997) argue that there are three distinct, cross-cultural “codes of morality” – community, autonomy, and divinity – that drive human action, with loyalty being central to the code of community. Drawing on insights from cultural anthropology, evolutionary psychology, and social psychology, <em>Moral Foundations Theory</em> (MFT) contends that loyalty is one of five innate foundations of morality that emerged to contend with scarce resources and social challenges (Graham, Haidt, &amp; Nosek, 2009; Graham et al., 2013, Graham et al., 2018, Graham et al., 2011; Haidt &amp; Joseph, 2007). Taking a social-relational approach to morality, <em>Relationship Regulation Theory</em> (Rai &amp; Fiske, 2011) posits four fundamental and distinct moral motives or obligations—unity, hierarchy, equality, and proportionality—that drive moral action, with loyalty being central in the motive/obligation for unity (see also, Fiske, 1991, Fiske, 1992). According to each of these theories, people take concerns about loyalty to exist within the purview of morality, and loyalty operates to bind our groups together, making them more cohesive and coordinated in ways that usually facilitate group success.</p><p id="p0030">Loyalty may give rise to an expectation that people should act in ways that favor the objects of their loyalty. Indeed, this expectation for action is built into Hirschman's seminal treatise on Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (Hirschman, 1970; see also, Barry, 1974) and the Attitude-Based Framework of Loyalty (Oliver, 1999). One specific kind of action that might be expected of the loyal is that they make <em>personal sacrifices</em> for the objects of their loyalty. That is, they might be expected to act in accordance with an individual's or group's interests, even when doing so comes at a personal cost. Several operationalizations of loyalty in business ethics explicitly refer to this expectation for self-sacrifice. For example, Elegido (2013) refers to loyalty as a “deliberate commitment to further the best interests of one's employer, even when doing so may demand sacrificing some aspects of one's self-interest beyond what would be required by one's legal and other moral duties” (p. 496). Hart and Thompson (2007) account of loyalty “involve[s] self-sacrifice in the face of alternatives” (p. 300). Schrag (2001) remarks that the loyal are expected to “sacrifice convenience or immediate advantage for the sake of the person or group or organization” (p. 45) (see also, Zdaniuk &amp; Levine, 2001). Due to the inherent moral nature of loyalty, self-sacrifice for the objects of one's loyalty should be considered as the morally right thing to do. This expectation for self-sacrifice may, therefore, take the form of an obligation or imperative. Although operationalizations of loyalty often come with an expectation for self-sacrifice, there is no empirical evidence linking loyalty to an expectation for self-sacrifice. We empirically investigate whether lay people expect the loyal to self-sacrifice for the objects of their loyalty.</p><p id="p0035">Over the past few decades, many different definitions of loyalty have proliferated both within and between fields. But a necessary precondition of any definition of loyalty is that at least two objects (e.g., individuals, groups, organizations) exist, with at least one being the object of loyalty. Most definitions of loyalty also involve <em>partiality</em> (i.e., favorable bias) toward an object (Brewer &amp; Brown, 1998; Hildreth et al., 2016; Hirschman, 1970; Oliver, 1999). Accounting for the inherent moral nature of loyalty, we broadly define loyalty as the moral principle of partiality toward an object, which gives rise to expectations (or perhaps obligations or imperatives) for action on behalf of the object of loyalty (e.g., self-sacrifice). See Hildreth et al. (2016) for a similar definition of loyalty.</p></section><section id="s0015"><p id="p0040">What exactly constitutes a case of exploitation? Many (now) illegal practices are clearly exploitative (e.g., sex trafficking) to the point of being self-evident. But in other cases, what counts as exploitative might be less clear, and people often disagree over whether specific cases of worker treatment are exploitative or not (Kim, Campbell, Shepherd, &amp; Kay, 2020; Mayer, 2007; Shelby, 2002). Much of the business ethics literature adopts a fairness-based account of exploitation, according to which exploitation occurs when an agent or entity <em>takes unfair advantage of</em> another agent or entity (Snyder, 2010; Wertheimer, 1996; Zwolinski, 2012). The (un)fairness of a transaction between agents/entities is typically measured by how the <em>benefits</em> resulting from the transaction are distributed (Wertheimer, 1996). Applied to an organizational context, it would be exploitative for management, representing the organization's goals and interests, to have some workers work excessively or engage in tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible reward (Kim et al., 2020). In such cases, workers are not rewarded for their behavior, and management receives all the benefits. In other words, management benefits at the expense of the workers.<sup>2</sup></p><p id="p0045">One might argue that it is not truly exploitative for managers to merely ask, but not require, certain workers to work excessively or to do tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible rewards. If workers are only asked, and not required, to work excessively or do tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible reward, then employees could still freely choose whether to acquiesce. In line with Kim et al. (2020), however, we argue that when there is a significant power difference between agents/entities in a transaction, agents/entities with less power may not feel free to decline the more powerful agent/entity's request. Applied to an organizational context, management controls outcomes necessary and vital to workers (e.g., promotion, job security, health insurance (at least in the U.S.), bonuses, etc.), so workers are put in a particularly vulnerable position when asked to do extra work or do tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible rewards. They may feel as though they can't decline such requests from management, or else they could be harmed.</p><p id="p0050">For our series of studies, we adapted materials from Kim et al. (2020) to ensure that we capture unfair transactions between management and their workers where management reaps the benefits at the expense of the workers. We make it clear that workers who work excessively or perform uncomfortable tasks unrelated to their job duties do not receive any extra pay or tangible reward. In our cases, management benefits at the expense of workers. The cases of exploitation used in our series of studies also count as exploitation under other theoretical accounts (e.g., vulnerability-instrumentalization views; Goodin, 1985, Wood, 1995).<sup>3</sup> But, more importantly, we also pre-test the cases of exploitation used in our studies to ensure that people tend to agree, on average, that they are exploitative. What matters most for addressing our hypotheses is that lay people tend to believe these cases of poor worker treatment are exploitative – not whether some particular normative, philosophical account is right.</p></section><section id="s0020"><p id="p0055">We have now characterized the central constructs under investigation – loyalty and exploitation. But what exactly is the relationship between loyalty and exploitation? We hypothesize bidirectional causal links between loyalty and exploitation that could create a vicious circle of suffering for contemporary workers. In one direction, we hypothesize that workers with reputations for loyalty (relative to other workers without such reputations) will be perceived as more exploitable in the workplace, because of the lay assumption that loyal people are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty. Consider a manager who wants some additional work done. The manager intends to ask a worker to stay late to do extra work and to work on some of their upcoming vacation days, but the manager isn't offering extra compensation or any other reward for that matter. The manager intends to take unfair advantage of a worker, benefitting at the expense of the worker. On our account, the manager should presume that loyal workers would be particularly likely to do this extra work and work on their vacation days, because loyalty comes with an expectation for self-sacrifice to management (or to the organization as a whole). Staying late to do extra work and working on vacation days without compensation or any other rewards are, definitionally and quintessentially, self-sacrificing behaviors. In contrast, the manager shouldn't expect disloyal workers to self-sacrifice for the manager or for the organization as a whole; it seems improbable that they would agree to engage in potentially harmful and unfair practices that predominantly benefit management and the larger organization.</p><p id="p0060">We expect to find evidence corroborating the hypothesis that workers with reputations for loyalty (relative to other workers without such reputations) will be perceived as more exploitable, because of the assumption that loyal individuals are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty. However, there is a case to be made for the competing hypothesis: that managers would attempt to protect or reward employees for their loyalty by <em>not</em> targeting them for exploitative practices. Hiring and retaining loyal employees is highly desirable to organizations (Hirschman, 1970; McGinley &amp; Shi, 2022), as loyal employees offer numerous benefits to management and the larger organization (Hirschman, 1970; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003). If managers are interested in retaining and motivating more desirable employees, they should presumably refrain from taking unfair advantage of them in ways that could cause them to suffer. They shouldn't treat loyal employees poorly by asking them to, for example, work on their scheduled days off or work late without reward. Our studies were designed to impartially adjudicate between these competing hypotheses.</p><p id="p0065">We not only expect to find evidence for a causal link from loyalty reputation to exploitation; we also expect that workers who agree to be exploited by management (relative to workers who refuse) will obtain stronger reputations for loyalty, due to the very act of agreeing to submit to exploitative practices. When a person acts in ways indicative of them possessing some trait, then that person should gain a reputation for possessing that trait (assuming others were exposed to the person's actions; Emler, 1990). So, when a person acts in ways that are indicative of loyalty toward some object and when other people see those actions, that person should acquire a reputation for being loyal. Consider a worker who has agreed to poor treatment in several ways over time: they have agreed to work late on several occasions and on many of their vacation days for no rewards. These are actions that are indicative of loyalty to management; they show partiality toward management at personal cost. The worker should, therefore, gain a reputation for loyalty.</p><p id="p0070">Despite the now considerable literature detailing positive outcomes of loyalty and negative outcomes of disloyalty (Haidt, 2003; Hirschman, 1970; Kruger, 2021; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003), evidence in favor of our hypotheses would suggest that those who seem loyal are more likely to suffer potentially harmful and unfair treatment in the workplace. Such evidence would call into question the value of loyalty, at least for certain individuals in certain contexts.</p></section><section id="s0025"><p id="p0075">Across four studies, we investigate whether loyal employees are selectively and ironically targeted by managers for exploitation in hypothetical scenarios, whether this targeting of loyal workers for exploitation is mediated by the expectation that loyal individuals are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty, and whether those who agree (versus refuse) to be exploited in the workplace acquire stronger reputations for loyalty. To start, in Study 1, participants were presented with a worker who had acquired a reputation for loyalty, disloyalty, or neither loyalty nor disloyalty. We test whether managers express greater willingness to ask workers with a reputation for loyalty to be exploited than workers without such a reputation. Study 1 also probes mechanism, testing whether managers are more willing to ask loyal employees to be exploited because of the assumption that loyal people are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty.</p><p id="p0080">Study 2 then tests for specificity of process. We do not expect a reputation for possessing just any moral virtue to encourage targeting for exploitation. Instead, we expect loyalty to be unique among moral virtues insofar as a reputation for loyalty (as opposed to other moral virtues) is what encourages managers to target workers for exploitation. To offer some evidence that loyalty is unique, we compare loyalty to two other common moral virtues that people usually value and aspire to exemplify – fairness and honesty. Loyalty, fairness, and honesty are all closely related moral virtues. Based on evidence coalesced across 20 countries, loyalty, fairness, and honesty all appear in Schwartz (1992) universal psychological structure of human values, with loyalty and honesty in the same value cluster of Benevolence and with fairness in the closely related neighboring cluster of Universalism. In addition, research and theory on moral identity and the self-concept consider virtues like loyalty, fairness, and honesty to be closely interconnected (Hildreth et al., 2016; Kihlstrom &amp; Klein, 1994) and central in people's constructed self-concepts (Aquino &amp; Reed II, 2002; Stanley &amp; De Brigard, 2019).</p><p id="p0085">Studies 3 and 4 reverse the causal pathway from loyalty reputation to exploitation, testing whether workers who agree (versus refuse) to be exploited are seen as more loyal in the eyes of managers. Assessing bidirectional causal links between loyal reputation and exploitation is important because evidence in favor of bidirectional causal links could be indicative of a vicious circle of harm and suffering for workers. Study 4 also tests whether the certainty with which managers believe that a case of poor worker treatment is exploitative predicts their judgments about the loyalty of employees who agree to be treated poorly. We expect that the more certain managers are that a practice is exploitative, the more loyal they will judge employees who agree to this poor treatment.</p></section><section id="s0030"><p id="p0090">For all studies, we report all exclusion criteria, all materials and conditions included, and all independent and dependent measures. We ensured ample power across studies by seeking at least 100 participants per condition after expected exclusions. In each study, the sample size was determined before any data analysis. To best address our hypotheses, we recruited samples of managers with at least one year of experience. These managers were not permitted to access more than one study. Studies 1, 2, and 4 were all formally pre-registered, and we did not deviate from these pre-registrations.

<p dir="auto">OpenAPI DevTools is a Chrome extension that generates OpenAPI specifications in real time from network requests. Once installed it adds a new tab to Chrome DevTools called <code>OpenAPI</code>. While the tool is open it automatically converts network requests into a specification.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Features</em>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Instantly generate an OpenAPI 3.1 specification for any website or application just by using it</li>
<li>Automatically merges new request &amp; response headers, bodies, and query parameters per endpoint</li>
<li>Click on a <a href="https://www.abstractapi.com/api-glossary/path-parameters" rel="nofollow">path parameter</a> and the app will automatically merge existing and future matching requests</li>
<li>View the specification inside the tool using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/redoc" rel="nofollow">Redocly</a> and download with a click</li>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-usage" dir="auto"><a href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The specification will automatically populate based on JSON requests that fire as you browse the web. In the settings menu you can filter hosts and parameterise paths in URLs. Once you do so all matching existing and future requests to that endpoint will be merged. This process is irreversible, but you can clear the specification and restart at any time.</p>
<p dir="auto">When the same endpoint responds with different data, such as a value that is sometimes a string and sometimes null, the specification for that value will be <em>either</em> string or null. All information is accounted for in the final specification. If you see something missing from a request, trigger a request that contains the missing information.</p>

<section>
    <p>
        Flawless is an execution engine for durable computation. It will run your code until completion
        even <span>in the presence of hardware or software failure<span>.
    </span></span></p>
    <p>
        We aspire to allow <b>builders</b> to create amazing experiences for others. And the best user
        experiences require complex UIs holding complex state, but trying to model all the state inside
        your database can be challenging. At the same time, you don't want the user to lose progress by
        accidentally refreshing the page, making continues persistence a
        requirement for modern applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Flawless allows you to model this persistent state with just code and local variables, raising
            the bar when it comes to expressing complex behaviors inside applications.</span>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>
        Workflows in flawless are written in <b>Rust</b>, in fact they are just regular Rust functions.
        This means that they can contain arbitrary logic. But instead of native code, the functions
        are compiled to WebAssembly and executed in a completely deterministic environment. The only
        nondeterminism is introduced when interacting with the "real world", like performing HTTP requests
        or generating random numbers. WebAssembly requires us to explicitly handle the non-deterministic
        execution.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use that knowledge to persist a log of non-deterministic side effects. This means that if
        the execution of a workflow is ever interrupted, we can just re-run it and catch up to the same
        state without the need to perform the side effects again.

        This makes the amount of data we need to persist minimal, and the rest is just re-calculated
        on-demand in case of failure. A nice side effect of this model is that the whole system is
        observable. We can take any finished or still running workflow and analyze the exact execution
        path it took to get into the current state. With a completely deterministic execution environment,
        impossible to reproduce bugs become a problem of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice how flawless takes away the burden of persisting the state. You just write business logic
        and can be assured that all the actions are going to run until completion, even if you need to
        occasionally restart the server because of maintenance. Once you start the flawless engine back
        up, <span>the workflows are going to seamlessly continue executing from where
            they stopped</span>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-10-25-2%5E18-dollars-to-open-source.html">https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-10-25-2%5E18-dollars-to-open-source.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38010244">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
Yesterday I read a great article from Sentry entitled
<a href="https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-500-000-dollars-to-open-source-maintainers/">"We
Just Gave $500,000 to Open Source Maintainers"</a>, and it made me wonder
just how much <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a> had spent
on supporting open source software over the years.  Ever since
<a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-12.html">December 2009</a>
Tarsnap has spent 100% of its December operating profits on supporting
open source software — which, since needs for support aren't limited
to December, means that Tarsnap hands out money throughout the year, and
at the end of the year (when I know how much profit Tarsnap made in
December) I send whatever is left in the "budget" to the
<a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation</a>.
Going through 14 years of accounting spreadsheets brought me to a total
of $274,482 — or in binary terms, slightly over 2^18 USD.
</p><p>
The largest recipient of this funding every year has been the FreeBSD
Foundation, and to date they have received $173,920.  It's hard to
overstate the importance of the work the Foundation does; they provide
hardware which keeps the FreeBSD project running, they fund a myriad
of independent projects, and they have full-time developers who get
thrown in to fixing whatever needs to be fixed from time to time.
While FreeBSD is unusual among open source projects in that the FreeBSD
project governance is entirely independent of the FreeBSD Foundation,
the FreeBSD project would be immeasurably worse off without the support
of the FreeBSD Foundation.
</p><p>
The second largest recipient of support from Tarsnap has been the
<a href="https://www.bsdnow.tv/">BSD Now</a> podcast, which has received
$47,500 to date.  Now at their 529th episode, they fill an important
niche in the BSD world, being one of the only places people can hear
what's going on across all the BSD operating systems.  As developers,
we're generally lousy at communication, and while technical journalists
(e.g., Phoronix) sometimes report on things happening in the BSD world,
they generally lack the technical knowledge to be consistently accurate.
BSD Now, being produced by <i>actual developers</i>, bridges the two
solitudes.
</p><p>
Third comes <a href="https://www.bsdcan.org/">BSDCan</a>, which has
received $23,188 to date.  In addition to being in Canada — which,
as a Canadian, I have to admit influences me somewhat — BSDCan is
the largest BSD conference in the world and plays an essential role in
bringing together developers to discuss and learn about each others'
work.  Email and IRC are great, but sometimes face-to-face conversations
make a huge difference.
</p><p>
Next comes the annual FreeBSD developer summits held at BSDCan.  These
"piggy back" on BSDCan in the sense that they can take advantage of the
fact that BSDCan is already getting a lot of people to travel to one
spot — but BSDCan does not pay for the rooms, A/V, coffee, or any
of the other miscellaneous costs associated with running a developer
summit.  Tarsnap has contributed $11,062 to those.
</p><p>
While most of the money Tarsnap contributes to open source software is
focused on the BSD world — that's what Tarsnap uses — it does
provide funding for an
<a href="https://awards-search.sfu.ca/Home/AwardDetail/72006">annual
award</a> at my Alma Mater for students who contribute to open source
software.  To date Tarsnap has contributed $7,839 to this.
</p><p>
Finally there's a bunch of miscellaneous sponsorships — conferences,
developers, travel grants, etc. — adding up to $10,972.  (Or maybe
a bit more; there were a lot of these and I might have missed some while
I was putting together my list.)
</p><p>
Tarsnap's 2^18 USD of financial support for open source software over the
past 14 years is only a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed, and
indeed I wish we could contribute more; Tarsnap would not exist without
all of the open source software if runs on.  On the other hand, maybe it's
not a bad total for a two-person company; there are certainly much larger
companies which contribute far less.
</p><p>
If you're at a startup which relies heavily on open source software, please
take a moment to ask yourself: How much does your company contribute back?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>30th September 2023</p>

<p>I build a lot of command-line tools in Python. It’s become my favorite way of quickly turning a piece of code into something I can use myself and package up for other people to use too.</p>
<p>My biggest CLI  projects are <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a>, <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>, <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/">shot-scraper</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>—but I have dozens of others and I build new ones at the rate of at least one a month. A fun recent example is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/blip-caption">blip-caption</a>, a tiny CLI wrapper around the Salesforce BLIP model that can generate usable captions for image files.</p>
<p>Here are some notes on what I’ve learned about designing and implementing CLI tools in Python so far.</p>
<h4 id="starting-with-a-template">Starting with a template</h4>
<p>I build enough CLI apps that I developed my own <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">Cookiecutter</a> template for starting new ones.</p>
<p>That template is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">simonw/click-app</a>. You can create a new application from that template directly on GitHub, too—I wrote more about that in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/28/dynamic-github-repository-templates/">Dynamic content for GitHub repository templates using cookiecutter and GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
<h4 id="arguments-options-and-conventions">Arguments, options and conventions</h4>
<p>Almost all of my tools are built using the <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a> Python library. Click encourages a specific way of designing CLI tools which I really like—I find myself annoyed at the various tools from other ecosystems that don’t stick to the conventions that Click encourages.</p>
<p>I’ll try to summarize those conventions here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commands have arguments and options. Arguments are positional—they are strings that you pass directly to the command, like <code>data.db</code> in <code>datasette data.db</code>. Arguments can be required or optional, and you can have commands which accept an unlimited number of arguments.</li>
<li>Options are, usually, optional. They are things like <code>--port 8000</code>. Options can also have a single character shortened version, such as <code>-p 8000</code>.
<ul>
<li>Very occasionally I’ll create an option that is required, usually because a command has so many positional arguments that forcing an option makes its usage easier to read.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some options are flags—they don’t take any additional parameters, they just switch something on. <code>shot-scraper --retina</code> is an example of this.</li>
<li>Flags with single character shortcuts can be easily combined—<code>symbex -in fetch_data</code> is short for <code>symbex --imports --no-file fetch_data</code> <a href="https://github.com/simonw/symbex/blob/1.4/README.md#usage">for example</a>.</li>
<li>Some options take multiple parameters. <code>datasette --setting sql_time_limit_ms 10000</code> is an example, taking both the name of the setting and the value it should be set to.</li>
<li>Commands can have sub-commands, each with their own family of commands. <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html">llm templates</a> is an example of this, with <code>llm templates list</code> and <code>llm templates show</code> and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-templates-help">several more</a>.</li>
<li>Every command should have help text—the more detailed the better. This can be viewed by running <code>llm --help</code>—or for sub-commands, <code>llm templates --help</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click makes it absurdly easy and productive to build CLI tools that follow these conventions.</p>
<h4 id="consistency-is-everything">Consistency is everything</h4>
<p>As CLI utilities get larger, they can end up with a growing number of commands and options.</p>
<p>The most important thing in designing these is <em>consistency</em> with other existing commands and options (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/160#issuecomment-1682995315">example here</a>)—and with related tools that your user may have used before.</p>
<p>I often turn to GPT-4 for help with this: I’ll ask it for examples of existing CLI tools that do something similar to what I’m about to build, and see if there’s anything in their option design that I can emulate.</p>
<p>Since my various projects are designed to complement each other I try to stay consistent between them as well—I’ll often post an issue comment that says “similar to functionality in X”, with a copy of the <code>--help</code> output for the tool I’m about to imitate.</p>
<h4 id="cli-interfaces-are-an-api---version-appropriately">CLI interfaces are an API—version appropriately</h4>
<p>I try to stick to <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> for my projects, bumping the major version number on breaking changes and the minor version number for new features.</p>
<p>The command-line interface to a tool is absolutely part of that documented API. If someone writes a Bash script or a GitHub Actions automation that uses one of my tools, I’m cautious to avoid breaking that without bumping my major version number.</p>
<h4 id="include-usage-examples-in---help">Include usage examples in --help</h4>
<p>A habit I’ve formed more recently is trying to always including a working example of the command in the <code>--help</code> for that command.</p>
<p>I find I use this a lot for tools I’ve developed myself. All of my tools have extensive online documentation, but I like to be able to consult <code>--help</code> without opening a browser for most of their functionality.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my more involved examples—the help for the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#converting-data-in-columns">sqlite-utils convert</a> command:</p>
<pre><code>Usage: sqlite-utils convert [OPTIONS] DB_PATH TABLE COLUMNS... CODE

  Convert columns using Python code you supply. For example:

      sqlite-utils convert my.db mytable mycolumn \
          '"\n".join(textwrap.wrap(value, 10))' \
          --import=textwrap

  "value" is a variable with the column value to be converted.

  Use "-" for CODE to read Python code from standard input.

  The following common operations are available as recipe functions:

  r.jsonsplit(value, delimiter=',', type=&lt;class 'str'&gt;)

      Convert a string like a,b,c into a JSON array ["a", "b", "c"]

  r.parsedate(value, dayfirst=False, yearfirst=False, errors=None)

      Parse a date and convert it to ISO date format: yyyy-mm-dd
      
      - dayfirst=True: treat xx as the day in xx/yy/zz
      - yearfirst=True: treat xx as the year in xx/yy/zz
      - errors=r.IGNORE to ignore values that cannot be parsed
      - errors=r.SET_NULL to set values that cannot be parsed to null

  r.parsedatetime(value, dayfirst=False, yearfirst=False, errors=None)

      Parse a datetime and convert it to ISO datetime format: yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS
      
      - dayfirst=True: treat xx as the day in xx/yy/zz
      - yearfirst=True: treat xx as the year in xx/yy/zz
      - errors=r.IGNORE to ignore values that cannot be parsed
      - errors=r.SET_NULL to set values that cannot be parsed to null

  You can use these recipes like so:

      sqlite-utils convert my.db mytable mycolumn \
          'r.jsonsplit(value, delimiter=":")'

Options:
  --import TEXT                   Python modules to import
  --dry-run                       Show results of running this against first
                                  10 rows
  --multi                         Populate columns for keys in returned
                                  dictionary
  --where TEXT                    Optional where clause
  -p, --param &lt;TEXT TEXT&gt;...      Named :parameters for where clause
  --output TEXT                   Optional separate column to populate with
                                  the output
  --output-type [integer|float|blob|text]
                                  Column type to use for the output column
  --drop                          Drop original column afterwards
  --no-skip-false                 Don't skip falsey values
  -s, --silent                    Don't show a progress bar
  --pdb                           Open pdb debugger on first error
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="including---help-in-the-online-documentation">Including --help in the online documentation</h4>
<p>My larger tools tend to have extensive documentation independently of their help output. I update this documentation at the same time as the implementation and the tests, as described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/">The Perfect Commit</a>.</p>
<p>I like to include the <code>--help</code> output in my documentation sites as well. This is mainly for my own purposes—having the help visible on a web page makes it much easier to review it and spot anything that needs updating.</p>
<p>Here are some example pages from my documentation that list <code>--help</code> output:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli-reference.html">sqlite-utils CLI reference</a></li>
<li><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html">LLM CLI reference</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/cli-reference.html">Datasette CLI reference</a></li>
<li>
<code>shot-scraper</code> embeds help output on the relevant pages, e.g. <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/screenshots.html#shot-scraper-shot-help">shot-scraper shot --help</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://s3-credentials.readthedocs.io/en/stable/help.html">s3-credentials command help</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these pages are maintained automatically using <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/cog">Cog</a>. I described the pattern I use for this in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/python/cog-to-update-help-in-readme">Using cog to update --help in a Markdown README file</a>, or you can <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/1.0a7/docs/cli-reference.rst">view source</a> on the Datasette CLI reference for a more involved example.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/?p=530">https://www.mamedev.org/?p=530</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38008461">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
							<p>Some long-anticipated updates landed in October, making MAME&nbsp;0.260 a
							very exciting release!  Firstly, there are some general updates to MAME
							itself.  After a few false starts, MAME now supports bgfx video output
							with Wayland on Linux.  As requested by users, you can finally use delta
							CHD files for clone systems and software items.  This allows for major
							disk space savings in some cases when you have multiple versions of a
							system or software item.  There’s also an updated version of PortAudio
							included.</p>
							
							<p>Two very different systems from Casio have been promoted to working
							this month.  The first is the CZ-101 compact keyboard synthesiser.  It
							used Phase Distortion Synthesis, which was Casio’s patent-avoiding
							answer to Yamaha’s DX series.  To help you load patches, MAME can now
							feed SysEx files to emulated MIDI input ports. The other is the Loopy,
							a game console released exclusively in Japan and marketed primarily to
							girls.  While sound output, the sticker printer, and the frame grabber
							accessory are not emulated (yet), you can try out the system’s entire
							library of eleven software titles.</p>
							
							<p>Several Korean arcade games were added this month, including a
							Solitaire card game from F2&nbsp;System that uses a dedicated control panel
							and features some rather disturbing pre-rendered 3D animations.  A few
							Merit games were added as well.  Other improvements include more
							emulated NuBus and PDS cards for Macs, Cumana&nbsp;DFS disk image support for
							the Acorn Electron, and support for an MSX Flash cartridge.</p>
							
							<p>That’s all we’ve got time to highlight here, but of course there’s
							much more.  You can read about everything that was updated this month in
							the <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0260.txt">whatsnew.txt
							file</a>.  Source code and 64-bit Windows binary packages are available
							from <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/release.html">the download
							page</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft is making some interesting (and potentially controversial) moves to try and encourage users to its browser, Edge, instead of its arch-rival Google Chrome. If you want to download the installer for Google Chrome using Edge (which is the only web browser pre-installed in Windows 10 and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11">Windows 11</a>), Microsoft now apparently demands to know why in a poll.&nbsp;</p><p>If you use Edge for any browsing, you’ll probably have noticed that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-edge-is-bombarding-people-with-ads" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-edge-is-bombarding-people-with-ads">it’s already peppered with ads, banners, and pop-ups</a> to urge you to keep Edge as your default browser, and it looks like <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> thinks it’s not been putting enough pressure on its users.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/">NeoWin made the discovery</a> when trying to download Chrome while using Microsoft Edge.

<p>A <b>Judas goat</b> is a trained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat" title="Goat">goat</a> used in general animal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herding" title="Herding">herding</a>. The Judas goat is trained to associate with sheep or cattle, leading them to a specific destination. In stockyards, a Judas goat will lead sheep to slaughter,<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> while its own life is spared. Judas goats are also used to lead other animals to specific pens and onto trucks. They have fallen out of use in recent times,<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> but can still be found in various smaller slaughterhouses in some parts of the world, as well as conservation projects.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle#Domestication_and_husbandry" title="Cattle">Cattle herders</a> may use a Judas steer to serve the same purpose as a Judas goat. The technique, and the term, originated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_drives_in_the_United_States" title="Cattle drives in the United States">cattle drives in the United States</a> in the 1800s.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kacirk2005_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kacirk2005-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>The term is a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, an apostle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus Christ</a> who betrayed Jesus according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>.

<p>The phrase has also been used to describe a goat that is used to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_goat" title="Feral goat">feral goats</a> that are targeted for eradication. The Judas goat is usually sterilised, outfitted with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter" title="Transmitter">transmitter</a>, painted in red and then released. The goat then finds the remaining herds of feral goats, allowing hunters to exterminate them.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The podcast <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolab" title="Radiolab">Radiolab</a></i> dedicated a portion of its episode on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands" title="Galápagos Islands">Galápagos Islands</a> to how feral goats affected the environment on the islands and how Judas goats were used to help return the islands to nature.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>  This technique is now used to target other invasive species, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camels_in_Australia" title="Camels in Australia">camels in Australia</a>, pigs in America, rats in Mexico and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_dog" title="Raccoon dog">raccoon dogs</a> in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

Some feral goats were able to find cover in the rugged terrain and eradication efforts were hindered by frequent naval bombardment operations. Between 1989 and 1991, a dozen radio-collared Judas goats were used on the island to locate the remaining feral goats. 263 goats were killed.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Nothing is permanent. Everything changes. That’s the one thing we know for sure in this world,” Calvin says to Hobbes in the first panel of a two-panel strip that ran in more than two thousand newspapers on Monday, July 17, 1995. The two friends are in a wagon, plummeting perilously forward into the unseen—a common pastime for them. Outside the world of the cartoon, it’s less than half a year before Bill Watterson, thirty-seven at the time, will retire from producing his wildly beloved work. “Calvin and Hobbes,” which débuted in 1985, centered on six-year-old Calvin and his best friend, Hobbes, a tiger who to everyone other than Calvin appears to be a stuffed animal. Six days a week, the strip appeared in short form, in black-and-white, and each Sunday it was longer and in color. The second panel of the July 17th strip is wide, with detailed trees in the foreground, the wagon airborne, and Calvin concluding his thought: “But I’m still going to gripe about it.”</p><p>After retiring, Watterson assiduously avoided becoming a public figure. He turned his attention to painting, music, and family life. He kept the work he made to himself; he gave few, but not zero, interviews. (When asked in an e-mail interview that ran in 2013 in <em>Mental Floss</em> why he didn’t share his paintings, he replied, “It’s all catch and release—just tiny fish that aren’t really worth the trouble to clean and cook.”) Still, now and again his handiwork appeared. He wrote twice about Charles&nbsp;M. Schulz, the creator of “Peanuts,” whom he never met. For the charity of the cartoonist Richard Thompson, who had been given a diagnosis of Parkinson’s, Watterson illustrated three strips for “Pearls Before Swine,” by Stephan Pastis, and also donated a painting for auction. In other words, he came out for the team.</p><p>In 2014, he gave an extensive and chatty interview to Jenny Robb, the curator of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum, on the occasion of his second show there. Robb asked if he was surprised that his strip was still so popular. “It seems the less I have to do with it, the higher the strip’s reputation gets!” he said. In the interview, he comes across as levelheaded, not egotistical, not very pleased with electronic devices, the Internet, the diminished size of cartoons—and also quietly intense, like the dad figure in the strip, who enthusiastically sets out on a bike ride through heavy snow. As a college student at Kenyon, Watterson spent much of a school year painting his dorm-room ceiling like that of the Sistine Chapel, and then, at the end of the year, painted it back dorm-room drab.</p><p>My ten-year-old daughter makes a detailed argument (it involves bicycles, ropes, and scratch marks) that Hobbes is indisputably real; millions of us have the more decisively illusory experience of having grown up with Watterson. But we haven’t! Will we be disturbed if, now that time has passed, he has changed? When word came out that Watterson was releasing a new book this year—“The Mysteries,” a “fable for grown-ups,” written by Watterson and illustrated in collaboration with the renowned caricaturist John Kascht—there was more than passing interest. There were also very few clues about the content, save that there’s a kingdom in trouble, living in fear of mysteries. With a different artist, I might interpret this as an enticement, but it seems more likely that Watterson is merely averse to marketing—he did no publicity for his first “Calvin and Hobbes” collection, and fought for years to prevent Hobbes and Calvin from appearing in snow globes, on pajamas, on chip-bag clips, on trading cards. (“If I’d wanted to sell plush garbage, I’d have gone to work as a carny,” he once said.) Yet Calvin and Hobbes are still everywhere, and forever young. Somewhere on the outskirts of Cleveland, their creator is probably irked that his old characters are pouncing into all these reviews of this other endeavor. As Calvin put it, the universe should have a toll-free hotline for complaints.</p><p>“The Mysteries” is clothbound and black, about eight inches square, with gray endpapers. The title font looks medieval; the text font looks contemporary. Words appear on the left page of each spread: one or two sentences in black, surrounded by a field of white. The images appear on the right, taking up most of the page, framed by a thick black line. Some of the illustrations appear to be photographs of small clay sculptures alongside elements composed in graphite and maybe paint—but the materials aren’t specified. Think Chris Van Allsburg’s “Jumanji” gone darker, crossed with Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis.” The characters, unnamed, are drawn from that strange eternal medieval world of fantasy: knights, wizards, a king; peasants with faces like Leonardo grotesques, wearing kerchiefs or hoods. There are forty-three sentences in total, and one exclamation point. The magic of condensation that is characteristic of cartoons is also here, in a story with a quick, fairy-tale beginning: “Long ago, the forest was dark and deep.”</p><p>It all sounds rather sombre, but also it doesn’t take long to read it nine or ten times. (The illustrations, slower to process, do much of the storytelling work.) The story is: Unseen mysteries have kept the populace in a state of fear. In response, a king bids his knights to capture a mystery, so that perhaps its “secrets could be learned” and its “powers could be thwarted.” When mysteries are caught, the public finds them disappointing, ordinary. One illustration is of a vender at a newspaper stand, looking askance. Below him are newspapers with headlines such as “So what?,” “Yawn,” and “Boring.” But modern technologies begin to appear: cars, skyscrapers, televisions. Mastering the secrets of the mysteries brought about a lot of technological marvels, and made the people less fearful. Or you might say insufficiently fearful: the woods are cut down, the air becomes acrid, and eventually the land looks prehistoric, desiccated, hostile to life. In one read, “The Mysteries” is a nephew of Dr. Seuss’s “The Lorax.”</p><p>It’s also kin to the ancient story of Prometheus, a myth we now associate with technological advancements. Prometheus took pity on the struggling humans, and stole fire from the gods to share it with them. And how has that magnificently useful fire gone for the humans? Pretty well by some measures, pretty catastrophically by others. If only humans heeded the warnings within mysteries as well as they followed the blueprints for making Teflon pans and missiles. I don’t think I’ll spoil the plot of “The Mysteries” if I say that the story finds a distinctive and unsettling path to its final three words, which are “happily ever after.”</p><p>“It’s a funny world, Hobbes,” Calvin says, plummeting again down a hill in a wagon with his friend. “But it’s not a hilarious world,” he says, as they fall out of their wagon. “Unless you like sick humor,” Hobbes says after he and Calvin have both crashed to the ground.</p><p>Watterson has said, of the illustrations in “Calvin and Hobbes,” “One of the jokes I really like is that the fantasies are drawn more realistically than reality, since that says a lot about what’s going on in Calvin’s head.” Only one reality in “Calvin and Hobbes” is drawn with a level of detail comparable to the scenes of Calvin’s imagination: the natural world. The woods, the streams, the snowy hills the friends career off—the natural world is a space as enchanted and real as Hobbes himself.</p><p>Enchantment! If disenchantment is the loss of myth and illusion in our lives, then what is the chant that calls those essentials back? An ongoing enchantment is at the heart of “Calvin and Hobbes.” It’s at the heart of “Don Quixote” and “Peter Pan,” too. These are stories about difficult and not infrequently destructive characters who are lost in their own worlds. At the same time, these characters embody most of what is good: the gifts of play, of the inner life, of imagining something other than what is there. If “The Mysteries” is a fable, then its moral might be that, when we believe we’ve understood the mysteries, we are misunderstanding; when we think we’ve solved them and have moved on, that error can be our dissolution.</p><p>Calvin offers the means of enchantment for seeing reality properly. This is well illustrated in the June 3, 1995, daily. (The brief black-and-white weekday strips of “Calvin and Hobbes” often feel as whole as the epic Sunday ones.) Calvin is digging a deep hole and Hobbes asks why. Calvin answers that he’s looking for buried treasure. Has he found any? Calvin replies, “A few dirty rocks, a weird root, and some disgusting grubs.” In the final panel, Hobbes: “On your first try??” Calvin: “There’s treasure everywhere!”</p><p>While rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” comics for this piece, I was surprised that almost all of them were not entirely forgotten. If I saw them on a crowded subway platform, I would recognize them, even after years of separation. Some of the silliest and most untethered of the strips have stayed with me the most: one in which Hobbes repeats the word “smock” again and again, just happy to say it; another in which Calvin writes down, “How many boards would the Mongol hoard, if the Mongol hordes got bored?”—then crumples up the paper.</p><p>Watterson has written, “Whenever the strip got ponderous, I put Calvin and Hobbes in their wagon and send them over a cliff. It had a nice way of undercutting the serious subjects.” “The Mysteries” doesn’t entirely lack that lightness—the contrast of modern and medieval in the illustrations is often funny—but humor is not its main tool. Reading “The Mysteries” after rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” reminded me of the Brothers Grimm story “The Goblins.” Goblins steal a mother’s child and replace it with a ravenous changeling. When the woman asks a neighbor for advice on how to get her child back, she is told to make the changeling laugh, because “when a changeling laughs, that’s the end of him.” She makes him laugh (by boiling water in eggshells? A trick perhaps lost across the centuries), and the goblins take the changeling away and return her child. She counters tragedy with a deliberate silliness—and it succeeds, even as the dark persists. In that sense, the old strip and the new fable work best, maybe, together. I’m also reminded of the strip in which Hobbes says, “I suppose if we couldn’t laugh at things that don’t make sense, we couldn’t react to a lot of life.”</p><p>One of the cozy pleasures of “Calvin and Hobbes” is the prominence of the seasons. This was felt even more acutely when the comics appeared daily in the paper, as they did throughout my childhood, when my brother used to call the Sunday comics insert “the intellectual pages.” (Now we both read the nearly comic-free online news instead of the material papers, into which, Watterson has said, “little jokes” were placed as a respite from “atrocities described in the rest of the newspaper.”) In the fall, a leaf pile transforms into a Calvin-eating monster; in winter, Calvin sculpts a snowman swimming away from snow-shark fins; spring is rainy, and in summer the days are just packed. Time hurries along through the year, but the years never pass—a great comfort. In “The Mysteries,” time’s arrow can’t be missed for a moment. Though the story starts in the misty forever-medieval, it quickly javelins forward. By its close, aeons have passed, and the perspective is no longer even earthbound. The book reads like someone saying goodbye. The outcome feels inevitable.</p><p>Calvin isn’t the only comic-strip character who doesn’t age. The characters in “Peanuts” never grow up, either. Schulz drew the strip for fifty years, and the final strip was published the day after he died. George Herriman drew “Krazy Kat” for more than thirty years, through to the year of his death, 1944. The characters in “Krazy Kat” also didn’t age or really change much: Krazy Kat is a black cat forever in love with Ignatz, a white mouse who serially hits Krazy with bricks, an action that Krazy misinterprets as a sign of love. Watterson has expressed admiration for both Schulz and Herriman. Yet Watterson, after ten years, moved on to other interests.</p><p>“Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography,” by David Michaelis, makes vivid that no amount of success ever separated Schulz from his sense of himself, carried over from childhood, as a lonely and overlooked “nothing.” In 2007, Watterson reviewed the biography for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and reminded readers that “Peanuts” had as much darkness—fear, sadness, bullying—as it had charm. “Schulz illustrates the conflict in his life, not in a self-justifying or vengeful manner but with a larger human understanding that implicates himself in the sad comedy,” Watterson wrote. “I think that’s a wonderfully sane way to process a hurtful world.” Herriman, born in the nineteenth century in New Orleans to a mixed-race family, often presented himself, in his adult life, as Greek. It would be oversimplifying to say that Herriman’s background fuelled “Krazy Kat,” just as it would be oversimplifying to say that Schulz was forever a Charlie Brown—but it would be delusional to think that the persistent situations and sentiments of those comics weren’t inflected by their makers’ lives. As Krazy Kat put it, in that magic mixed-up Kat language, “An’ who but me can moddil for me, but I!”</p><p>Watterson must have been working out something in his strip, too. By his own account, he had a pretty nice childhood, with supportive parents and a house that bordered a mysterious wood. It’s possible that Watterson quit because he tired of the demanding work, or because he’d said all he had to say, or because he was worn out by the legal battles over his characters. But maybe he just changed. Growing up is always a loss—a loss of an enchanted way of seeing, at the very least—and for some people growing up is more of a loss than for others. Perhaps part of what drove Watterson, “Ahab-like” by his own telling, back to the drawing board with his boy and his tiger day after day was a subconscious commitment to staying a child. Maybe he chose to stop publishing because, in some way, for whatever reasons, he became O.K. with growing up.</p><p>In a Sunday strip on April 22, 1990, Calvin’s dad tells Calvin and Hobbes a bedtime story, by request, that is about Calvin and Hobbes. All he does, pretty much, is describe, to his rapt audience, the first part of their actual day. Calvin complains that his dad ends the story too early, that he hasn’t even gotten to lunchtime. His dad says the story has no end, because Calvin and Hobbes will go on writing it “tomorrow and every day after.” The friends are pleased to learn they’re in a story that doesn’t end.</p><p>Here’s another story, kindred to “The Mysteries,” about a knight who journeys into a dark and unknown wood. The first scene of “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” which is thought to have been written in the late fourteenth century, takes place in Camelot during New Year’s festivities. A good time, with feasting and friends, is interrupted by the arrival of a stranger: a massive knight, whose skin and hair are all green, who is dressed all in green, who is riding an all-green horse. The knight carries a huge axe and makes a strange proposal, in such a way that the honor of the whole court feels at stake. He invites someone to swing at his neck with his axe; in return, he will have a chance, a year and a day later, to swing the same axe at the neck of the volunteer, who ends up being Sir Gawain. The resonance of the story with facing the perils of a dark and unknown wood, of nature itself, is pretty clear.</p><p>Gawain chops off the head of the Green Knight, who then picks up his head; says, See you in a year; and rides away. Pretty quickly, the feasting and the merry mood return. How, I remember thinking the first time I read the tale, could this possibly end? It’s not satisfying if the Green Knight is killed, or if Gawain is. Maybe both of them die, I supposed.</p><p>But no. Gawain keeps his word, despite the perilous terms. En route to his meeting with the Green Knight, in the Green Chapel, he tries to behave well with the seductive wife of the lord who graciously hosts him. Then he bravely bares his neck for the terrifying Green Knight—but he learns it was an enchantment! To me, the ending follows from both good behavior and enchantment—good behavior being something Calvin despises, and enchantment being the realm in which he is king.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Drug store giant CVS revealed late last week that it is voluntarily pulling some common cold and flu medicines from its shelves because they don't work—while many other ineffective products remain on the shelves.</p>
<p>The move by CVS comes after an advisory panel for the Food and Drug Administration last month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/the-spectacular-downfall-of-a-common-useless-cold-medicine/">voted unanimously that the common decongestant, phenylephrine, is ineffective at treating a stuffy nose</a>. But it comes ahead of the FDA itself acting on the vote, which will likely lead the agency to revoke phenylephrine's approval, eventually.
</p><p>In a statement to Ars, a CVS spokesperson suggested the FDA advisory panel's vote was the impetus for the change, but that it would "follow direction from the FDA."</p>
<p>"We are removing a small number of oral decongestant products that contain phenylephrine as the only active ingredient from CVS Pharmacy stores but will continue offering many other oral cough and cold products to meet consumer needs," CVS's statement read. It didn't provide additional details on which or how many products would be removed, or when the removals would be complete.</p>
<p>The culling of phenylephrine products from drug-store shelves is a long-sought win for both researchers and consumers. Since at least 2007, researchers have expressed doubt about the effectiveness of phenylephrine, which is in popular oral medicines with brand names including Sudafed, Mucinex, Nyquil, and Benadryl. The small studies from the 1960s and 1970s that formed the basis of the FDA's initial approval in 1976 were found to be seriously flawed. And three large clinical trials since 2007 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/10/common-decongestant-may-be-worthless-study-finds/">showed the drug doesn't work</a>. Pharmacological studies showed why: Phenylephrine is highly metabolized in the gut, with less than 1 percent of active drug remaining bioavailable. Consumers, meanwhile, were largely in the dark, spending nearly $2 billion in 2022 on these products that researchers have said for years don't work.
</p><p>But as these useless drugs finally vanish from CVS shelves, left behind is an entire class of products that are equally useless: homeopathic products.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>“Snake oil” remains</h2>
<p>These bogus treatments are based on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2007/09/the-pseudoscience-behind-homeopathy/">centuries-old pseudoscience and have repeatedly been proven to be no more effective than placebo</a>. In fact, if they were to prove effective, it would upend fundamental scientific understandings. For decades, consumer advocates and watchdogs <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/outrage-of-the-month-fda-guidance-on-homeopathic-drugs-an-ongoing-public-health-failure/">have railed against them</a>, yet these products are readily available on the shelves of every major drug store.</p>
<p>Homeopathy relies on two false ideas: the "law of similars" aka "like cures like," meaning a substance that causes a specific symptom in a healthy person can treat conditions and diseases in an ill person with that same symptom; and the "law of infinitesimals," which states that diluting a supposedly curative substance renders it more potent at treating medical conditions. As such, homeopathic products often start with bizarre, sometimes toxic substances that end up being diluted into oblivion in ritualistic procedures. The result is simply water or inactive filler ingredients. Homeopaths have acknowledged this and sometimes counter that water molecules have a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_memory#:~:text=%5BBenveniste's%5D%20latest%20theory%2C%20and,to%20a%20container%20of%20ordinary">memory</a>" of substances (they don't).</p>
<figure><img alt="A homeopathic product lurking on a CVS shelf alongside real medicines." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pasted-image-0-copy.jpeg" width="624" height="351"><figcaption><p>A homeopathic product lurking on a CVS shelf alongside real medicines.</p><p>CFI</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sound absurd? It is. And yet, homeopathic products are not only available in major drug stores and retailers around the country, they're often sold on the same shelves, side by side with evidence-based medicines that have gone through rigorous FDA safety and efficacy evaluations.</p>
<p>The FDA does have the authority to regulate homeopathic products. But, based on the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, homeopathic products are generally <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1513393">considered exempt from pre-market FDA safety and efficacy reviews</a> as long as the active ingredient is included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, a published list of substances approved by homeopaths. As such, homeopathic products enter the market without any FDA review—and sit on shelves with FDA-approved, evidence-based medicines.</p>
<p>"Most people don't know what this stuff is," Nicholas Little, vice president and legal director for the consumer advocacy organization the Center for Inquiry (CFI), said of homeopathic products in an interview with Ars.</p>

<p>Hundreds of driverless cars are now an everyday part of traffic in San Francisco as they shuttle passengers across town, but how safe are they and how do they compare to human drivers?  Waymo, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, just released a new study that attempts to shed light on its own track record as one of San Francisco's largest driverless car companies.  The findings, described as first-of-its-kind research, make the case that Waymo's driverless fleet is able to steer clear of certain types of collisions at a higher rate than human drivers.</p>

<p>“It shows that we’re safe,” said Trent Victor, Waymo Director of Safety Research and Best Practices. “We're seeing the fruits of our focus on safety.”</p>

<p>Waymo, in partnership with insurance giant Swiss Re, analyzed insurance liability claims in an effort to collect collision data involving both driverless vehicles and human-driven cars.  The study utilized 600,000 claims stretching over 125 billion miles to create a "baseline" for human driver collisions that could be compared against Waymo's record involving 3.8 million miles traveled without a human in the driver's seat.</p>

<p>Attempting to draw fair comparisons between the safety record of driverless cars versus human drivers is a complex feat that has repeatedly proven difficult for the autonomous vehicle industry, according to experts.</p>


<p>“The kind of reporting that is used in insurance is much more standardized than any other kind of collision data that you have around,” said Luigi Di Lillo, Head of Products and Partnerships for Swiss Re.&nbsp;“The novelty of this study is to connect the insurance claims data to safety directly.”</p>

<p>Waymo’s driverless vehicles, which currently operate in San Francisco and Phoenix, experienced 76% fewer accidents involving property damage compared to human-driven cars, according to the study.  For every million miles traveled, human drivers filed 3.26 property damage claims compared to 0.78 for Waymo's driverless cars.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>I think this is an opportunity for people to get to know Waymo as something that’s different than our competitors.</p><cite>Trent Victor, Waymo Director of Safety Research and Best Practices</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>“This is an amazing moment,” said Victor, who spoke to the Investigative Unit in his only television interview.  “I think this is an opportunity for people to get to know Waymo as something that’s different than our competitors.”</p>

<p>Waymo’s main competition is GM’s Cruise, which recently cut its fleet of driverless cars in half at the direction of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.&nbsp;The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/california-dmv-san-francisco-cruise-driverless-cars/3299222/" target="_blank">DMV announced its request</a> at the same time it revealed it was launching an investigation into Cruise’s safety record following a series of headline-making accidents, including a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/cruise-driverless-car-crash/3298626/" target="_blank">collision with a San Francisco fire truck</a>.&nbsp; According to Cruise, its vehicle had a green light when it struck the fire engine, which had its sirens on and appeared to be en route to an emergency scene.  </p>

<p>Following the state's request to reduce Cruise's fleet, a company spokesperson provided NBC Bay Area with a statement, noting "Cruise positively impacts overall road safety," adding that Cruise looks forward to "working with the DMV to make any improvements and provide any data they need to reinforce the safety and efficiency of our fleet."</p>

<p>While the DMV continues its investigation, Cruise’s driverless fleet will be capped at 50 cars during the day and 150 cars at night. In August, Waymo told state regulators it possessed a total fleet of 250 driverless cars in San Francisco, of which about 100 are on the road at any given time.&nbsp;Those figures remain largely unchanged, according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>

<p>Just last month, state regulators with the California Public Utilities Commission <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/cpuc-vote-driverless-car-operations-expansion-san-francisco/3293096/" target="_blank">granted approval</a> to both Waymo and Cruise to expand their ride-hailing services across San Francisco 24/7, with no limits on how many driverless cars they can put on the road.</p>

<p>Waymo’s new study also notes the company’s driverless vehicles have not been involved in a single crash resulting in “bodily injury,” however, some critics have questioned whether the cars have been on the road long enough to begin making fair comparisons to human drivers.&nbsp;For example, Waymo’s driverless cars have traveled roughly 4 million miles, but traffic-related fatalities are routinely measured per 100 million miles.  Across America's roadways last year, there were 1.37 fatalities for every 100 million miles traveled, totaling 42,795 lives lost in vehicle traffic crashes, according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/traffic-crash-death-estimates-2022" target="_blank">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.  Each year, human drivers log more than 3 trillion miles on the road.</p>

<p>“It’s interesting that we were able to show statistical significance with so little data,” Victor said.&nbsp;“That has to do with two things: one is that we have very robust baselines from Swiss Re, and the other is that we have incredible safety performance.”</p>

<p>Waymo did not release the raw data it used to come up with its findings, saying that information is “proprietary.” </p>

<p>"The information they released is the results of the study rather than all the details," said Steven Shladover, a research engineer with the Berkeley's Institute of Transportation Studies.  "Of course, as researchers, we like to look more at the details and the methods for the analysis."</p>

<p>Shladover said he was also "disappointed" the study grouped its findings for both San Francisco and Phoenix instead of sharing separate data points for each city.  While Waymo's study only offered combined figures, it examined different time spans for each city: Waymo's Phoenix data spanned more than four years (March 2019 to Aug. 1, 2023), while Waymo's San Francisco data incorporated less than two years' worth of driving (March 2022 to Aug. 1, 2023), according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>

<p>"It lumped them all together and those are quite different areas," he said.  "I think it would have been more interesting to see a comparison for San Francisco and then a separate comparison for Phoenix."</p>

<p>Leaders at Waymo and Swiss Re said they plan to eventually submit their study to a scientific journal so that it can be independently reviewed, however, neither company would say when that might happen.</p>

<p>“We are targeting the right journal,” said Di Lillo.&nbsp;“I’m very picky on that.”</p>

<p>
								Hundreds of driverless cars are now an everyday part of traffic in San Francisco, but how safe are they and how do they compare to human drivers?&nbsp;Google’s Waymo, one of the largest driverless car companies in the city, just released a new study that attempts to shed light on its own track record. Bigad Shaban has more.

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>October 24, 2023</strong></p>



<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles today issued the following statement on the immediate suspension of Cruise LLC’s deployment and driverless testing permits:</p>



<p><em>Public safety remains the California DMV’s top priority, and the department’s autonomous vehicle regulations provide a framework to facilitate the safe testing and deployment of this technology on California public roads. When there is an unreasonable risk to public safety, the DMV can immediately suspend or revoke permits. There is no set time for a suspension.</em></p>



<p><em>The California DMV today notified Cruise that the department is suspending Cruise’s autonomous vehicle deployment and driverless testing permits, effective immediately. The DMV has provided Cruise with the steps needed to apply to reinstate its suspended permits, which the DMV will not approve until the company has fulfilled the requirements to the department’s satisfaction. This decision does not impact the company’s permit for testing with a safety driver.</em></p>



<p><em><span>Today’s suspensions are based on</span> the following:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em><span>13 CCR §228.20 (b) (6)</span> – Based upon the performance of the vehicles, the Department determines the manufacturer’s vehicles are not safe for the public’s operation.</em></li>



<li><em><span>13 CCR §228.20 (b) (3)</span> – The manufacturer has misrepresented any information related to safety of the autonomous technology of its vehicles.</em></li>



<li><em><span>13 CCR §227.42 (b) (5)</span> – Any act or omission of the manufacturer or one of its agents, employees, contractors, or designees which the department finds makes the conduct of autonomous vehicle testing on public roads by the manufacturer an unreasonable risk to the public.</em></li>



<li><em><span>13 CCR §227.42 (c)</span> – The department shall immediately suspend or revoke the Manufacturer’s Testing Permit or a Manufacturer’s Testing Permit – Driverless Vehicles if a manufacturer is engaging in a practice in such a manner that immediate suspension is required for the safety of persons on a public road.</em></li>

										<p>
					This is a guest post by Kate Krauss, a digital rights advocate based in Philadelphia.				</p>
			
						<div itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>On Oct. 6, 23andMe announced the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">loss of customer data</a>&nbsp;to hackers who targeted Ashkenazi Jews. The data of as many as a million people was reportedly stolen and is currently being sold anonymously on the Internet. The hack exploited customers who reused passwords and the platform’s feature called “DNA Relatives,” linking one person to another.</p>
<p id="3524" data-selectable-paragraph="">We won’t easily forget this awful hack — but every year, tens of millions of Americans become victims of information leaks, so many that they have begun to blur together. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/chinese-hackers-stole-60000-emails-us-state-department-microsoft-hack-senate-2023-09-27/" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>, for one, has been hacked at least 10 times since 2018.</p>
<p id="4825" data-selectable-paragraph="">Victims range from ordinary people, like those in the 23andMe hack, to the most politically sensitive: the State Department’s China diplomats; the Secretary of Commerce. Hackers access people’s email and steal their social security numbers or their home addresses, and in one case, in-depth psychological profiles needed for top security clearances.</p>
<p id="ec6a" data-selectable-paragraph="">If we use the frog-in-hot-water analogy for Americans and their information privacy, this frog is dead.</p>
<h2 id="a27b">Weak laws let companies get away with weak security.</h2>
<p id="210e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Current US privacy laws are so ineffective that Europeans are afraid to send their data here lest it be hacked, leaked, or surveilled. This fear was the basis of the tensely negotiated “<a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_3752" rel="noopener">Data Privacy Framework</a>” between the EU and the US over whether and how to allow the personal data of European citizens to be sent to this country.</p>
<p id="3c18" data-selectable-paragraph="">Without the risk of a giant fine or, say, jail time, many tech giants can and do get away with managing their data security badly. They fail to update security keys, encrypt users’ credit card numbers or enforce multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p id="1de7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Weak laws let companies get away with weak security. For instance, 23andMe didn’t require users to use two-factor authentication or warn users about the dangers of enabling “DNA Relatives.” If they have to pay a small fine — small to them — that’s the cost of doing business.</p>
<p id="2813" data-selectable-paragraph="">In 2019, the year that the Cambridge Analytica scandal caught up with Facebook, the company paid&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/494520-federal-judge-approves-facebook-ftc-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">$5 billion to the FTC</a>&nbsp;for illegally sharing the data of 87 million people.</p>
<h2 id="e428">How much would Cambridge Analytica have cost Facebook if it had to face California’s new privacy laws?</h2>
<p id="f334" data-selectable-paragraph="">Although it was the worst privacy violation in Facebook’s storied history of privacy violations, the company still got to keep 80% of its&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2019-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">massive profits</a>&nbsp;that year. Financially, the scandal was just a speed bump for Facebook.</p>
<p id="54bf" data-selectable-paragraph="">How does this happen? Unlike Europe, the US lacks a strong, comprehensive national privacy law. Many Big Tech companies, including Facebook, say they support one, but through relentless lobbying they seem to benefit by dragging out the process of actually passing it. Not just big companies but also government agencies are building huge databases of citizens’ data.</p>
<p id="eacf" data-selectable-paragraph="">According to a recent WIRED article: “A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/odni-commercially-available-information-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">government report</a> declassified by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in June, 2023 revealed that US intelligence agencies were avoiding judicial review by buying a ‘large amount’ of ‘sensitive and intimate information’ about Americans, including data that can be used to track people’s locations over extended periods of time.”</p>
<p id="36a3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Nothing to worry about there, right?</p>
<p id="a1ca" data-selectable-paragraph="">Dozens of privacy bills have been introduced into Congress, but partisan gridlock, an army of tech company lobbyists, the complexity of the issue and lack of public awareness have combined to prevent a major privacy bill from making it into law.</p>
<p id="69c8" data-selectable-paragraph="">Last year, Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft combined spent over <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries/summary?cycle=2022&amp;filter=s&amp;id=B13" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">$60 million</a>&nbsp;to lobby the federal government. Meanwhile, the Davids to these Goliaths — small nonprofits that focus on online privacy — are legally forced to limit lobbying to a tiny fraction of their work.</p>
<p id="84b1" data-selectable-paragraph="">The FTC, which is charged with regulating companies against unfair or deceptive business practices, currently has its hands full prosecuting major anti-trust cases. It is underfunded and understaffed, and it’s mandated to cover every big company from Walmart to Tiktok. The US might benefit from a separate federal agency that specializes in dealing with privacy concerns. So far, none exists.</p>
<p id="cf48" data-selectable-paragraph="">So what is the answer?</p>
<p id="0c31" data-selectable-paragraph="">Countries that have managed internet privacy better than we do point the way. Russia and China run major state hacking operations. Countries that live in their shadow, like Estonia and Taiwan, have built independent, grassroots citizen tech groups that successfully fend off widespread hacking and disinformation that might undermine their democracies. People in these countries recognize the stakes: It’s considered patriotic to protect online privacy.</p>
<p id="0f13" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the US, we also need nonpartisan groups that can learn to protect online privacy and push back against the lack of federal and state protection. Think: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ffa.org/about-us/what-is-ffa/" rel="noopener">Future Farmers of America</a>, except all ages, learning and teaching online privacy in their communities. (Conflict disclosure: I’m an enthusiastic former member of FFA.)</p>

<p id="ed47" data-selectable-paragraph="">Other successful community models are community-oriented “CryptoParties” like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cryptoharlem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">CryptoHarlem</a>, and arguably the most inclusive, powerful citizen data protection movement ever, Taiwan’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0v" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">g0v</a>.</p>
<p id="c48e" data-selectable-paragraph="">The 0 stands for humility. This friendly, creative, and innovative grassroots hacker movement responds to the needs of Taiwan’s regular people and creates the right tools at the right time to fend off disinformation and hacking from its nearby neighbor. (Also, their meetings involve delicious meals, always a winner in community organizing. Taiwanese food is legendary. But I digress.)</p>
<p id="690b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Next, we must awkwardly embrace the dreaded patchwork of state laws.</p>
<p id="2524" data-selectable-paragraph="">In response to a public outcry for better data protection, California passed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">The California Consumer Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;in 2018 (CCPA). Californians now have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold about them, the right to delete it, and the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information.</p>
<p id="05a8" data-selectable-paragraph="">The&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">California Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;of 2020 created a new California Privacy Protection Agency that manages the enforcement of California’s privacy laws and advises both the public and the legislature on privacy issues (because this stuff gets complicated).</p>
<p id="c70a" data-selectable-paragraph="">The law also prohibits the collection and sale of biometric data including fingerprints, face scans, and voice recognition data without explicit user consent. A small percentage of corporate fine money can be used to fund nonprofit organizations engaged in online privacy projects (see what they did there?).</p>
<p id="7adc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Nice, right? These California laws make great model legislation that could theoretically be passed, separately, in every state in the union.</p>
<p id="3e76" data-selectable-paragraph="">If companies break these California laws, they incur giant fines. At $2,500 per affected user, the Cambridge Analytica scandal would have cost Facebook $217 billion, not $5 billion.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>That’s a meaningful fine — 40 times the money — that might change their behavior. No wonder they’re lobbying hard against privacy legislation.</p>
<p id="1903" data-selectable-paragraph="">Other states have also passed more piecemeal privacy legislation that is still valuable. Illinois has a new&nbsp;<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/illinois/2021/chapter-5/act-5-ilcs-855/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Protecting Household Privacy Act</a> (the “Video Doorbell Act”). It mandates that law enforcement agencies are prohibited from obtaining household electronic data or directing private third parties to acquire household electronic data without a warrant. The law, which took effect in January 2022, covers security cameras, virtual assistants, video doorbells and smart appliances that connect to the internet.</p>
<p id="1896" data-selectable-paragraph="">Who opposes some of these laws? Check out TechNet — the long, lobbying arm of companies like Amazon and Facebook. See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technet.org/our-story/members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">TechNet’s members</a>: Apple, Facebook, etc. — and there’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technet.org/public-policy/50-state-advocacy-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">a handy map</a>&nbsp;on their website below the animated American flag that shows who is lobbying in your neck of the woods.</p>
<p id="6430" data-selectable-paragraph="">What’s the downside of a multitude of state laws? Big companies (and most comprehensive laws only apply to big companies) have to comply with laws that may conflict with each other. For them, this is expensive, inefficient and time consuming.</p>
<p id="cb24" data-selectable-paragraph="">However, by aggressively pursuing the near-term passage of state laws, ordinary people will be much better protected from the ongoing abuse of their personal information for profit and power. And the federal lobbying by TechNet and others is forcing states to try to fend for themselves on behalf of their citizens.</p>
<h2 id="9bfe">People &gt; companies</h2>
<p id="ee53" data-selectable-paragraph="">A coordinated national effort to pass strong state privacy laws is a useful step for protecting vulnerable American citizens (and most of us are pretty vulnerable at the moment) until Congress enacts a federal privacy law, which could take years.</p>
<p id="c9bb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Will every state adopt California’s laws? That’s unlikely. Will some states enact wacky or dumb privacy laws? We’re living through a wacky, dumb era, so yes, but there’s nothing to prevent a state from passing another, stronger law, especially with the models that are available to them. And right now, people in most US states effectively have have few meaningful protections. A good law in Nebraska at least protects the people of Nebraska.</p>
<p id="b519" data-selectable-paragraph="">Software developers are also building tools to help. The new, free app&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/media-room/press-releases/2023/10/consumer-reports-introduces-free-permission-slip-by-cr-app-to-empower-consumers-to-take-back-control-of-their-personal-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Permission Slip</a>, made by Consumer Reports, monitors state laws and allows users to get the most out of privacy protections we do have, like automating the removal of personal data from individual companies. Tools like this one can help while the federal government gets its act together. Perhaps in the future, Permission Slip will include a feature that automatically lets us contact legislators to push for stronger privacy laws.</p>
<p id="44c6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Are these ideas as good as comprehensive privacy legislation? Nope. But are we getting that any time soon? Nope.</p>
<h2 id="5f88">Haz I been haxxed?</h2>
<p id="a612" data-selectable-paragraph="">Worried about the big companies and how complicated and inefficient this is for them? All the lawyers they’ll need and all the laws they’ll have to follow?</p>
<p id="1465" data-selectable-paragraph="">While I play the world’s tiniest violin, please visit <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">HaveIBeenPwned</a>. This will jog your memory about just a few of the companies that accidentally leaked your data, and may clarify your thinking about their lax security (it doesn’t list them all: Looking at you,&nbsp;<em>Equifax</em>). When those big companies have to face 52 different privacy laws, it may clarify their thinking, too. And if they ever do get behind powerful federal privacy legislation, that will be a breakthrough for Americans’ most basic rights and US democracy. So I’ll be cheering them on.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is the third chief executive of the software giant to admit the company has made some serious mobile mistakes. Satya Nadella took over from former CEO Steve Ballmer in 2014 and, just over a year later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910999/microsoft-job-cuts-2015-nokia-write-off">wrote off $7.6 billion</a> related to Microsoft’s acquisition of the Nokia phone business.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-interview-ai-activision-blizzard-axel-springer-2023-10?r=US&amp;IR=T">interview with <em>Business Insider</em></a>, Nadella admitted that Microsoft’s “exit” from the mobile phone business could have been handled better. Asked about a strategic mistake or wrong decision that he might regret, Nadella responds:</p><div><blockquote><p>The decision I think a lot of people talk about – and one of the most difficult decisions I made when I became CEO — was our exit of what I’ll call the mobile phone as defined then. In retrospect, I think there could have been ways we could have made it work by perhaps reinventing the category of computing between PCs, tablets, and phones.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p>Microsoft finally confirmed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446280/microsoft-finally-admits-windows-phone-is-dead">Windows Phone was dead</a> a few years after the Nokia phone business write-off, but it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/28/10864034/windows-phone-is-dead">was clear six months after that decision</a> that Windows Phone was over. Microsoft has since launched its Android-powered Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2 handsets, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23548511/microsoft-surface-duo-foldable-screen-rumor">without a successor in sight</a> and a lack of software updates, it’s not clear what the future holds for the Surface Duo.</p><p>Nadella is now the third Microsoft CEO to admit to the company’s mobile mistakes. Microsoft co-founder and former CEO <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715202/microsoft-bill-gates-android-biggest-mistake-interview">Bill Gates said his “greatest mistake ever”</a> was Microsoft losing to Android. Google acquired Android in 2005 for $50 million, and former CEO Eric Schmidt admitted in 2012 that Google’s initial focus was beating Microsoft’s early Windows Mobile efforts.</p><p>Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was also slow to respond to Android and the iPhone threat, focusing the company’s efforts on Windows Mobile while <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Deywi0h_Y5_U&amp;xcust=___vg__p_18479243__t_w__r_https://www.google.com/__d_D">famously laughing at the iPhone</a>, calling it the “most expensive phone in the world and it doesn’t appeal to business customers because it doesn’t have a keyboard.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4750086/ballmer-almost-no-mobile-share-microsoft-opportunity">Ballmer admitted in 2013</a> that he regretted not focusing on the phone much earlier. “I regret there was a period in the early 2000s when we were so focused on what we had to do around Windows [Vista] that we weren’t able to redeploy talent to the new device called the phone,” explained Ballmer. “That is [the] thing I regret the most.”</p><p>Microsoft has been focused on apps for Android and iOS over the past decade, though. The company is constantly updating its Phone Link app to link Android and even iPhone handsets to Windows, and Microsoft has a close relationship with Samsung to ensure its mobile Office apps are preinstalled on Samsung’s Android handsets.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><strong><span color="087294"><em>Researchers achieve landmark in quantum squeezing </em></span></strong></p>

<hr>
<p>In 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, made history when it made the first direct detection of gravitational waves, or ripples in space and time, produced by a pair of colliding black holes. Since then, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded LIGO and its sister detector in Europe, Virgo, have detected gravitational waves from dozens of mergers between black holes as well as from collisions between a related class of stellar remnants called neutron stars. At the heart of LIGO's success is its ability to measure the stretching and squeezing of the fabric of spacetime on scales 10 thousand trillion times smaller than a human hair.</p>

<p>As incomprehensibly small as these measurements are, LIGO's precision has continued to be limited by the laws of quantum physics. At very tiny, subatomic scales, empty space is filled with a faint crackling of quantum noise, which interferes with LIGO's measurements and restricts how sensitive the observatory can be. Now, writing in the journal <em>Physical Review X</em>, LIGO researchers report a significant advance in a quantum technology called "squeezing" that allows them to skirt around this limit and measure undulations in spacetime across the entire range of gravitational frequencies detected by LIGO.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j2oH9bq-FAE?si=hlGfRs0nISVGWssr" title="YouTube video player" width="400"></iframe></p>

<p>This new "frequency-dependent squeezing" technology, in operation at LIGO since it <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20230524">turned back on in May of this year</a>, means that the detectors can now probe a larger volume of the Universe and are expected to detect about 60 percent more mergers than before. This greatly boosts LIGO's ability to study the exotic events that shake space and time.</p>

<p>"We can't control nature, but we can control our detectors," says Lisa Barsotti, a senior research scientist at MIT who oversaw the development of the new LIGO technology, a project that originally involved research experiments at MIT led by Professor of Physics Matt Evans (PhD '02) and Professor of Astrophysics Nergis Mavalvala. The effort now includes dozens of scientists and engineers based at MIT, Caltech, and the twin LIGO observatories in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana.</p>

<p>"A project of this scale requires multiple people, from facilities to engineering and optics—basically the full extent of the LIGO Lab with important contributions from the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. It was a grand effort made even more challenging by the pandemic," Barsotti says.</p>

<p>"Now that we have surpassed this quantum limit, we can do a lot more astronomy," explains Lee McCuller, assistant professor of physics at Caltech and one of the leaders of the new study. "LIGO uses lasers and large mirrors to make its observations, but we are working at a level of sensitivity that means the device is affected by the quantum realm."</p>

<p>The results also have ramifications for future quantum technologies such as quantum computers and other microelectronics as well as for fundamental physics experiments. "We can take what we have learned from LIGO and apply it to problems that require measuring subatomic-scale distances with incredible accuracy," McCuller says.</p>

<p>“When NSF first invested in building the twin LIGO detectors in the late 1990s, we were enthusiastic about the potential to observe gravitational waves,” says NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “Not only did these detectors make possible groundbreaking discoveries, they also unleashed the design and development of novel technologies.&nbsp;This is truly exemplar of the DNA of NSF—curiosity-driven explorations coupled with use-inspired innovations. Through decades of continuing investments and expansion of international partnerships, LIGO is further poised to advance rich discoveries and technological progress."</p>

<p>The laws of quantum physics dictate that particles, including photons, will randomly pop in and out of empty space, creating a background hiss of quantum noise that brings a level of uncertainty to LIGO's laser-based measurements. Quantum squeezing, which has roots in the late 1970s, is a method for hushing quantum noise or, more specifically, for pushing the noise from one place to another with the goal of making more precise measurements.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="220" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q5lnamXhnfI?si=LWX6P3ZU39u_zgcU" title="YouTube video player" width="391"></iframe></p>

<p>The term squeezing refers to the fact that light can be manipulated like a balloon animal. To make a dog or giraffe, one might pinch one section of a long balloon into a small precisely located joint. But then the other side of the balloon will swell out to a larger, less precise size. Light can similarly be squeezed to be more precise in one trait, such as its frequency, but the result is that it becomes more uncertain in another trait, such as its power. This limitation is based on a fundamental law of quantum mechanics called the <a href="https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/uncertainty-principle">uncertainty principle</a>, which states that you cannot know both the position and momentum of objects (or the frequency and power of light) at the same time.</p>

<p>Since 2019, LIGO's twin detectors have been squeezing light in such a way as to improve their sensitivity to the upper frequency range of gravitational waves they detect. But, in the same way that squeezing one side of a balloon results in the expansion of the other side, squeezing light has a price. By making LIGO's measurements more precise at the high frequencies, the measurements became less precise at the lower frequencies.</p>

<p>"At some point, if you do more squeezing, you aren't going to gain much. We needed to prepare for what was to come next in our ability to detect gravitational waves," Barsotti explains.</p>

<p>Now, LIGO's new frequency-dependent optical cavities—long tubes about the length of three football fields—allow the team to squeeze light in different ways depending on the frequency of gravitational waves of interest, thereby reducing noise across the whole LIGO frequency range.</p>

<div><p><a alt="Squeezing Picture4_MJDoherty" href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/media_files/binaries/763/original/Picture4_MJDoherty.jpeg?1697147715" target="_blank" title="Squeezing Picture4_MJDoherty"><img alt="Squeezing Picture4_MJDoherty" src="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/media_files/binaries/763/large/Picture4_MJDoherty.jpeg?1697147715" title="Squeezing Picture4_MJDoherty"></a></p><p><strong>Vacuum tube hosting LIGO's 300-meter filter cavity used to implement frequency-dependent squeezing.

</div>

<p>"Before, we had to choose where we wanted LIGO to be more precise," says LIGO team member Rana Adhikari, a professor of physics at Caltech. "Now we can eat our cake and have it too. We've known for a while how to write down the equations to make this work, but it was not clear that we could actually make it work until now. It's like science fiction."</p>



<p><strong>Uncertainty in the Quantum Realm </strong></p>

<p>Each LIGO facility is made up of two 4-kilometer-long arms connected to form an "L" shape. Laser beams travel down each arm, hit giant suspended mirrors, and then travel back to where they started. As gravitational waves sweep by Earth, they cause LIGO's arms to stretch and squeeze, <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/video/ligo20160211v6">pushing the laser beams out of sync</a>. This causes the light in the two beams to interfere with each other in a specific way, revealing the presence of gravitational waves.</p>

<p>However, the quantum noise that lurks inside the vacuum tubes that encase LIGO's laser beams can alter the timing of the photons in the beams by minutely small amounts. McCuller likens this uncertainty in the laser light to a can of BBs. "Imagine dumping out a can full of BBs. They all hit the ground and click and clack independently. The BBs are randomly hitting the ground, and that creates a noise. The light photons are like the BBs and hit LIGO's mirrors at irregular times," he said in a <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/at-the-edge-of-physics">Caltech interview</a>.</p>

<p>The squeezing technologies that have been in place since 2019 make "the photons arrive more regularly, as if the photons are holding hands rather than traveling independently," McCuller said. The idea is to make the frequency, or timing, of the light more certain and the amplitude, or power, less certain as a way to tamp down the BB-like effects of the photons. This is accomplished with the help of specialized crystals that essentially turn one photon into a pair of two <a href="https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/entanglement">entangled</a>, or connected, photons with lower energy. The crystals don't directly squeeze light in LIGO's laser beams; rather, they squeeze stray light in the vacuum of the LIGO tubes, and this light interacts with the laser beams to indirectly squeeze the laser light.</p>

<p>"The quantum nature of the light creates the problem, but quantum physics also gives us the solution," Barsotti says.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>An Idea That Began Decades Ago</strong></p>

<p>The concept for squeezing itself dates back to the late 1970s, beginning with theoretical studies by the late Russian physicist Vladimir Braginsky; Caltech's&nbsp;Kip Thorne, Richard P. Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics, Emeritus; and Carlton Caves, a former Caltech research fellow now at the University of New Mexico. The researchers had been thinking about the limits of quantum-based measurements and communications, and this work inspired one of the first experimental demonstrations of squeezing in 1986 by&nbsp;H. Jeff Kimble, Caltech's William L. Valentine Professor of Physics, Emeritus. Kimble compared squeezed light to a cucumber; the certainty of the light measurements are pushed into only one direction, or feature, turning "quantum cabbages into quantum cucumbers," he wrote in an <a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3746/1/Kimble.pdf">article in Caltech's </a><a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3746/1/Kimble.pdf"><em>Engineering &amp; Science</em></a><a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3746/1/Kimble.pdf"> magazine in 1993</a>.</p>

<p>In 2002, researchers began thinking about how to squeeze light in the LIGO detectors, and, in 2008, the first experimental demonstration of the technique was achieved at the 40-meter test facility at Caltech. In 2010, MIT researchers developed a preliminary design for a LIGO squeezer, which they tested at LIGO's Hanford site.&nbsp;Parallel work done at the GEO600 detector in Germany also convinced researchers that squeezing would work. Nine years later, in 2019, after many trials and careful teamwork, <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/ligo-reach-quantum-noise-wave-1205">LIGO began squeezing light for the first time</a>.</p>

<p>"We went through a lot of troubleshooting," says Sheila Dwyer, who has been working on the project since 2008, first as a graduate student at MIT and then as a scientist at the LIGO Hanford Observatory beginning in 2013. "Squeezing was first thought of in the late 1970s, but it took decades to get it right."</p>



<p><strong>Too Much of a Good Thing</strong></p>

<p>However, as noted earlier, there is a tradeoff that comes with squeezing. By moving the quantum noise out of the timing, or frequency, of the laser light, the researchers put the noise into the amplitude, or power, of the laser light. The more powerful laser beams then push LIGO's heavy mirrors around causing a rumbling of unwanted noise corresponding to lower frequencies of gravitational waves. These rumbles mask the detectors' ability to sense low-frequency gravitational waves.</p>

<p>"Even though we are using squeezing to put order into our system, reducing the chaos, it doesn't mean we are winning everywhere," says Dhruva Ganapathy, a graduate student at MIT and one of four co-lead authors of the new study. "We are still bound by the laws of physics." The other three lead authors of the study are MIT graduate student Wenxuan Jia, LIGO Livingston postdoctoral scholar Masayuki Nakano, and MIT postdoctoral scholar Victoria Xu.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this troublesome rumbling becomes even more of a problem when the LIGO team turns up the power on its lasers. "Both squeezing and the act of turning up the power improve our quantum-sensing precision to the point where we are impacted by quantum uncertainty," McCuller says. "Both cause more pushing of photons, which leads to the rumbling of the mirrors. Laser power simply adds more photons, while squeezing makes them more clumpy and thus rumbly."</p>

</div>

<p><strong>A Win-Win</strong></p>

<p>The solution is to squeeze light in one way for high frequencies of gravitational waves and another way for low frequencies. It's like going back and forth between squeezing a balloon from the top and bottom and from the sides.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by LIGO's new frequency-dependent squeezing cavity, which controls the relative phases of the light waves in such a way that the researchers can selectively move the quantum noise into different features of light (phase or amplitude) depending on the frequency range of gravitational waves.</p>

<p>"It is true that we are doing this really cool quantum thing, but the real reason for this is that it's the simplest way to improve LIGO's sensitivity," Ganapathy says. "Otherwise, we would have to turn up the laser, which has its own problems, or we would have to greatly increase the sizes of the mirrors, which would be expensive."</p>

<p>LIGO's partner observatory, Virgo, will likely also use frequency-dependent squeezing technology within the current run, which will continue until roughly the end of 2024. Next-generation larger gravitational-wave detectors, such as the planned ground-based <a href="https://cosmicexplorer.org/">Cosmic Explorer</a>, will also reap the benefits of squeezed light.</p>

<p>With its new frequency-dependent squeezing cavity, LIGO can now detect even more black hole and neutron star collisions. Ganapathy says he's most excited about catching more neutron star smashups. "With more detections, we can watch the neutron stars rip each other apart and learn more about what's inside."</p>

<p>"We are finally taking advantage of our gravitational universe," Barsotti says. "In the future, we can improve our sensitivity even more. I would like to see how far we can push it."</p>

<p>The <em>Physical Review X</em> study is titled "Broadband quantum enhancement of the LIGO detectors with frequency-dependent squeezing." Many additional researchers contributed to the development of the squeezing and frequency-dependent squeezing work, including Mike Zucker of MIT and GariLynn Billingsley&nbsp;of Caltech, the leads of the "Advanced LIGO Plus" upgrades that includes the frequency-dependent squeezing cavity; Daniel Sigg of LIGO Hanford Observatory; Adam Mullavey&nbsp;of LIGO Livingston Laboratory; and David McClelland's group from the Australian National University.</p>

<p>The LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Collaboration operates a network of gravitational-wave detectors in the United States, Italy, and Japan. LIGO Laboratory is operated by Caltech and MIT, and is funded by the NSF with contributions to the Advanced LIGO detectors from Germany (Max Planck Society), the U.K. (Science and Technology Facilities Council), and Australia (Australian Research Council). Virgo is managed by the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO) and is funded by the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in France, the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) in Italy, and the National Institute for Subatomic Physics (Nikhef) in the Netherlands. KAGRA is hosted by the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR) at the University of Tokyo and co-hosted by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) and the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">A controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM)-scanning proposal that’s under discussion by lawmakers in Europe is both the wrong response to tackling a sensitive and multifaceted societal problem and a direct threat to democratic values in a free and open society, a seminar organized by the European Data Protection Supervisor heard yesterday.</p>
<p>More than 20 speakers at the three hour event voiced opposition to a European Union legislative proposal that would require messaging services to scan the contents of users’ communications for known and unknown CSAM, and to try to detect grooming taking place in real-time — putting the comms of all users of apps subject to detection orders under an automatic and non-targeted surveillance dragnet.</p>
<p>Critics argue the approach runs counter to the fundamental freedoms that are pivotal to democratic societies. The European Commission has pushed back aggressively against this sort of criticism to date — arguing the proposal is a proportionate and targeted response to a growing problem. It was even<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/law-enforcement/news/eu-commissions-microtargeting-to-promote-law-on-child-abuse-under-scrutiny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spotted recently using microtargeted ads to promote the plan</a>, apparently turning to<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2023-003037_EN.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> covert targeting to attack critics</a> by suggesting they do not support child protection (despite the existence of another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/">live EU legislative proposal that seeks to restrict the use of political microtargeting</a>… so, er, oops!).</p>
<p>The contentious debate is still live as it’s now up to EU co-legislators, in the European Parliament and Member States, via the Council, to hash out (no pun intended!) a way forward — which means there’s still time for regional lawmakers to pull back.</p>
<p>And the need for the bloc to pull back from this brink was absolutely the message from yesterday’s event.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) himself, Wojciech Wiewiórowski, suggested the EU could be at a point of no return if lawmakers go ahead and pass a law that mandates the systemic, mass surveillance of private messaging. In his opening remarks, he suggested the Commission’s proposal could bring consequences that go “well beyond what concerns with the protection of children”.</p>
<p>“It is often being used in the debate that this proposal is only about protecting children. I would like this to be the case — but it’s not,” he went on, arguing that the Commission’s proposal questions the “foundations” of what privacy means in a democratic society; and pointing out that privacy, once undermined, leads to “the radical shift from which there might be no return”, as he put it.</p>
<p>Without amendments, the proposal would “fundamentally change the Internet and the digital communication as we know it”, Wiewiórowski also warned at the event’s close — invoking his personal childhood experience of living under surveillance and restrictions on freedom of expression imposed by the Communist regime in Poland. And, most certainly, it’s an awkward comparison for the EU’s executive to be asked to contemplate coming from the mouth of one of its own expert advisors.</p>
<p>The EDPS, an EU institution which advises the Commission on data protection and privacy, is not a newly converted critic of the Commission proposal either. Indeed, the Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board put out a <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/edpbedps-joint-opinion/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-042022-proposal_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint opinion</a> a full year ago that warned the legislative plan raises “serious data protection and privacy concerns” — including for encryption. But that joint expression of concern from inside the EU has — so far — failed to persuade Johansson or the Commission to rethink their full-throated backing for mass surveillance of citizens’ private communications.</p>
<p>Seminar attendees heard that Johansson had been invited to attend but the event but had declined to do so. Nor did anyone else from the Commission agree to attend. (We’ve reached out to the Commission and Johansson’s office about her decision not to participate and will update our report if we get a response).</p>
<h2>Mounting concerns</h2>
<p>The Commission presented its draft CSAM legislation back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/eu-csam-detection-plan/">May 2022</a>. Since then opposition has been building over human rights impacts as the implications of the proposal have become clearer. While concerns — and even suspicions — about the driving forces behind the proposal have mounted, not helped by a perceived lack of engagement from the Commission with civil society organizations and others expressing genuinely held misgivings. The emotive debate has also, at times, lent itself to unhelpful polarization.</p>
<p>Even from the start there were clear questions about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/09/eu-scam-scanning-unlawful-advice/">legality</a> of the proposal. EU law requires any interferences with fundamental rights like privacy and freedom of expression to be necessary and proportionate. While the imposition of a general content monitoring obligation on online platforms is prohibited — so how does that square with a law that could put the messages of hundreds of millions of Europeans under watch by design?</p>
<p>Giving a perspective on the legality at yesterday’s seminar, Frederik Borgesius, professor at iHub, Radboud University, in the Netherlands, said in his view the Commission’s proposal is not a proportionate way of interfering with fundamental rights. He referred back to case law on data retention for terrorism — as the most relevant comparison — which has seen the bloc’s top court repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/cjeu-bulk-data-rulings-germany-france/">strike down general and indiscriminate storage</a> of Europeans’ metadata. (Not that that’s stopped Member States from keeping on breaking the law, though… )</p>
<p>“Actually, the court might not even get to a proportionality test because the data retention cases were about metadata. And this is about analysing the <em>content</em> of communications,” he went on. “The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights has an element that says if the essence of a fundamental right is violated then the measure is illegal by definition — there’s not even a need for a proportionality test.”</p>
<p>Borgesius also pointed out there’s case law on this essence point too. “When is the essence violated? Well, the court has said — in a different case — if authorities can access the contents of communications on such a large scale then the discussion is over,” he explained. “No room for proportionality test — the essence of the right to privacy would be violated, and therefore such a measure would be illegal.”</p>
<p>Legality is just one element the seminar considered. Multiple critics of the Commission’s proposal speaking at the event also argued it’s even ill-fitted in its main claimed purpose — of addressing the complex societal problem of child sexual abuse — and actually risks causing unintended consequences, including for children.</p>
<p>The seminar heard repeated concerns from panellists that minors could end up being harmed because of the regulation’s single-minded focus on scanning private comms, with speakers emphasizing the importance of evidence-based policymaking in such a sensitive area, rather than a blinding rushing down the road of technosolutionism.</p>
<p>One issue several speakers raised is that a large proportion of the sexualized content involving minors that’s being shared online is actually being done so by (and between) consenting minors (i.e. sexting). The Commission proposal could therefore lead to children being investigated and even criminalizing for exploring their own sexual identities, they suggested — since understanding what is and isn’t CSAM is not something that can necessarily be done by simply reviewing the imagery itself.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal hinges on the idea of forcing messaging platforms which are suspected of hosting CSAM to scan for illegal content (and grooming activity) and pass flagged content to a European Center to carry out initial checks — but also potentially send reported content on to law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Certainly in the case of new CSAM (i.e. suspected CSAM content that has not been previously seen, investigated and confirmed as illegal child sexual abuse material), context is essential to any assessment of what is being depicted. This is not something an AI scanning tool, or even a trained human looped in to review flagged imagery, can inherently know just by looking at a piece of content, the seminar heard.</p>
<p>So a law that automates CSAM scanning and reporting without there being a foolproof way to distinguish between actual CSAM, innocent sexting between kids, or even just a parent sending a family holiday snap to a relative via a private messaging channel they believe to be a safe way to share personal stories, looks the opposite of an intelligent response to child sexual abuse.</p>
<p>“A big part of the material that we see is not a result of sexual abuse,” Arda Gerkens, chair of the board of The Netherlands’ Authority for the Prevention of Online Terrorist Content and Child Sexual Abuse Material, told the seminar. “The material’s indeed being spread by the Internet — but it’s a growing number which is a result of sexual activity of young people themselves.”</p>
<p>The risk of “leaked images and sextortion” are “even more reason why we should keep the Internet safe and secure”, she also suggested — pointing out children can be put in an exceptionally vulnerable position if their accounts are hacked and their private comms fall into the hands of someone who wants to manipulate and abuse them.</p>
<p>“The scanning of private communication will certainly flag problematic situations — I definitely know that that’s already happening — but it’s not the solution to combat this sexual child abuse,” she went on, speaking up in favor of a narrower practice of scanning for <em>known</em> CSAM on image hosting websites to stop the further spread of material — “but not to prosecute”.</p>
<p>The legislation proposed by the Commission doesn’t properly address image hosting websites as potential repositories of CSAM, she suggested, because it’s too focused on “private communication and subsequently prosecution”. She therefore predicted the EU’s approach will be “counterproductive” when it comes to detecting perpetrators and ending domestic sexual violence.</p>
<p>“The sheer amount of images will overflow the systems we have and put even more pressure on the fragile law enforcement systems,” she suggested, adding: “It would be much better to invest in those systems and strengthen collaborations between the EU countries.”</p>
<p>Another speaker, Susan Landau, bridge professor in cyber security and Policy at Tufts University, also argued the Commission’s proposal misunderstands a multifaceted and highly sensitive issue — failing to respond to different (and distinct) types of child sexual abuse and exploitation that can occur over the Internet.</p>
<p>An approach that’s centered on investigation and prosecution, as the Commission’s is, would hit a wall in many cases, she also predicted — pointing out, for example, that an overwhelming majority of Internet-enabled sex trafficking cases involve victims being abused by people close to them, who they do not want to report.</p>
<p>“What you need there, as well as with real time abuse, is spaces that make children safe. Community spaces. Online safety education. Education about online security and safety by design,” she suggested.</p>
<p>“The point is that the law requires scanning to handle the child sexual abuse and exploitation issue misunderstands the issue,” Landau added. “There are multiple ways… to prevent and investigate the crime [of child sexual abuse] that are not affected by end-to-end encryption (E2EE) . Meanwhile, end-to-end encryption is a technology that secures both children and adults.”</p>
<p>Also speaking during the event was Alexander Hanff, a privacy expert and advocate — who is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/05/school-sexual-abuse-justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">himself a survivor of child sexual abuse</a>. He too asserted that a lot of sexualized imagery of children that’s shared online is being done privately between consenting minors. But the impact the Commission’s proposal would have on minors who sext is not something the EU’s executive appears to have considered.</p>
<p>“If we now introduce a law which requires the scanning of all digital communications, and by that we’re talking billions, tens of billions of communications every single day across the EU, those images would then be sent to multiple individuals along the chain of investigation —&nbsp; including Europol and various law enforcement bodies, etc — creating victims,” he warned. “Because one of the things that we see in relation to CSAM, and speaking as a survivor myself, is the impact on the dignity of the individuals for whom it relates.</p>
<p>“The very fact that people are viewing these images — which is exactly the intent of the Commission to try and overcome — is a form of abuse itself. So if we now take innocent pictures, which have been shared among consenting individuals, and expose them to potentially hundreds of other individuals down the investigation chain then we are indeed actually creating more victims as a result of this.”</p>
<p>Another attendee — WhatsApp’s public policy director, Helen Charles — chipped into the discussion to offer an industry view, saying that while the Meta-owned messaging platform supports EU lawmakers in their aim of tackling child sexual abuse, it shares concerns that the Commission’s approach is not well targeted at this multifaceted problem; and that it risks major unintended consequences for web users of all ages.</p>
<p>“We think that any outcome that requires scanning of content in end-to-end encrypted messaging would undermine fundamental rights, as several colleagues have set out,” she told the seminar. “Instead, the draft regulation should set the right conditions for services like WhatsApp and other end-to-end encrypted services to mitigate the misuse of our services in a way that’s reasonable and proportionate but that also considers both the different nature of harm…&nbsp;but also includes things like prevention and other upstream measures that could help tackle these kinds of harms.”</p>
<p>Charles went on to advocate for EU lawmakers to give platforms more leeway to use “traffic data” (i.e. metadata; not comms content) for the prevention of child sexual abuse under the EU’s existing ePrivacy Directive — noting that the current (temporary) ePrivacy derogation for platforms, which lets them scan non-E2EE messages for CSAM, only covers detection, reporting and takedown, not prevention.</p>
<p>“Having access to some data can be helpful in a targeted proportionate way to address those risks,” she argued. “Where it is legal Meta does deploy techniques, including the use of traffic data, to identify potentially problematic behaviour. This is not just about detection, though. This is also about prevention… [T]raffic data can be an important signal when used with other signals to help services proactively disrupt violating message groups and accounts who may be seeking to abuse our services.</p>
<p>“So we would encourage institutions, when they’re thinking about the way forward here, to both ensure end-to-end encryption is protected and that services can tackle CSAM without accessing message content but also look at ways that EPG traffic data can be processed in a proportionate and targeted manner, including for prevention. We think, in this way, the regulation will move closer to achieving its objectives.”</p>
<p>The seminar also heard concerns about the limitations of the current state of the art in AI-based CSAM detection. A big issue here is AI tools used to detect known CSAM are proprietary — with no independent verification of claims made for their accuracy, said Jaap-Henk Hoepman, visiting professor in computer science at Karlstad University. “The problem is that the [CSAM detection] techniques being discussed — either PhotoDNA [developed by Microsoft] or NeuralHash [made by Apple] — are proprietary and therefore not publicly available and known and study-able algorithms — which means that we simply have to rely on the figures provided by the companies on how effective these technologies are.”</p>
<p>He also pointed to work by academics and other researchers who have reverse engineered PhotoDNA that he said revealed some elementary flaws — such as evidence it’s particularly easy to evade detection against a known CSAM fingerprint by simply rotating or mirroring the image.</p>
<p>“Clearly this has implications for the proportionality of the [Commission] proposal, because a serious breach of privacy is being proposed for an not-so-effective measure,” he added, going on to warn about risks from “targeted false positives” — where attackers seek to manipulate an image so that an algorithm detects it as CSAM when, to the human eye, it looks innocuous — either to frame an innocent person or trick app users into forwarding a doctored image (and, if enough people share it, he warned it could flood detection systems and even cause a DDoS-like event).</p>
<p>“This technology is not free from error — and we’re talking many billions of communications [being scanned] every day. So even if we have a 0.1% error rate that accounts for many millions of false positives or false negatives on a daily basis. Which is not something that we can subscribe to in a democracy,” Hanff also warned, chiming in with a technosocial perspective on flawed AI tools.</p>
<p>Claudia Peersman, a senior research associate in the Cyber Security Research Group of the University of Bristol, had a pertinent assessment to offer related to work she’d been involved with at the Rephrain Centre. The expert academic group recently independently assessed five proof-of-concept projects, developed in the U.K. with government backing, to scan E2EE content for CSAM without — per the Home Office’s headline claim — compromising people’s privacy.</p>

<p>The problem is, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/20/braverman-warns-meta-over-e2e-encryption/">none of the projects lived up to that billing</a>. “None of these tools were able to meet [our assessment] criteria. I think this is the most important part of our conclusion. Which does not mean that we do not support the development of AI supported tools for online child protection in general. We just believe that the tools are not ready to be deployed on such a large scale on private messages within end-to-end encrypted environments,” she told the seminar.</p>
<p>Delegates also heard a warning that client-side scanning — the technology experts suggest the EU law will force onto E2EE platforms such as WhatsApp if/when they’re served with a CSAM detection order — is far too new and immature to be rushed into mainstream application.</p>
<p>“As computer science researchers we’ve just begun to look at this technology,” said Matthew Green, a cryptographer p<span>rofessor at The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. “</span>I want to stress how completely new the idea of client side scanning is — the very first computer science research papers on the topic appeared in 2021 and we’re not even two years later, and we’re already discussing laws that mandate it.”</p>
<p>“The problem of building systems where [content scanning] algorithms are confidential and can’t be exploited is something we’re just beginning to research. And so far, many of our technical results are negative — negative in the sense that we keep finding ways to break these systems,” he also told the seminar. “Break them means that we will ultimately violate the confidentiality of many users. We will cause false positives. We will cause bad data to be injected into the system.</p>
<p>“And, in some cases, there’s this possibility that abuse victims may be re traumatised if the systems are built poorly… I’m just a computer scientist. I’m not a legislator or a lawyer. My request to this community is please, please give us time. To actually do the research, to figure out whether and how to do this safely before we start to deploy these systems and mandate them by law.”</p>
<h2>Children’s rights being ignored?</h2>
<p>A number of speakers also had passionate critiques that the views (and rights) of children themselves are being ignored by lawmakers — with several accusing the Commission of failing to consult kids about a proposal with severe implications for children’s rights, as well as for the privacy and fundamental rights of everyone who uses digital comms tools.</p>
<p>“We should involve the children,” said Gerkens. “We are speaking here about them. We are judging about what they do online. We have a moral opinion about it. But we’re not talking to them. They are the ones we are speaking about. We haven’t involved them in this legislation. I think we should.”</p>
<p>Sabine Witting, assistant professor at Leiden University, also warned over a raft of “negative” impacts on kids’ rights — saying the EU proposal will affect children’s right to privacy, personal data protection, freedom of expression and access to information.</p>
<p>“In this context, I really would like to highlight that — from a children’s rights perspective — privacy and protection are not contradicting each other. Actually, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and its General Comment number 25, made it very clear that privacy is actually vital for children’s safety. So privacy is not a hindrance of children’s safety as it’s often projected. It’s actually an important precondition to safety,” she said.</p>
<p>Witting also had a strong message about the harms that could accrue for adolescents whose private texts to each other get sucked up and caught in a CSAM-scanning dragnet. “The investigation alone can already be very, very harmful for affected adolescents, especially in cases where we have adolescents from marginalised communities. For example, LGBTQ+ children,” she warned. “Because this kind of investigation might lead to false disclosure, further marginalisation and in a worst case scenario, also political persecution or the like, so children and adolescents being targets of a criminal investigation is already harmful in and of themselves.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately the proposal will not be able to prevent that from happening. So this whole process of scanning private communications among adolescents of the most intimate nature, the further review by private sector, by government, the potential involvement of law enforcement, all of that is really a significant violation of children’s right to privacy.”</p>
<p>Witting said she’d raised this issue with the Commission — but had no response. “I think because there is just no simple answer,” she added. “Because it lies in the nature of the subject matter that these kinds of cases will not be able to be filtered out along the process.”</p>
<p>The idea of the EU passing a law that sanctions warrantless searches of everyone’s “digital worlds” was skewered more generally by Iverna McGowan, director of the European office of the Center for Democracy and Technology.</p>
<p>“What essentially the detection orders amount to are warrantless searches of our digital worlds,” she argued. “We would of course never expect or accept that law enforcement would enter our homes, or private setting, with no warrants and no reasonable suspicion to search everything belonging to us. And so we cannot of course, allow that to happen on the online space either because it would be a death knell to the rule of law and criminal law as we know it in the digital context.”</p>
<p>Going on to offer some thoughts on how to salvage something from the Commission proposal — i.e. to undo the existential threat is poses to European values and democracy — would, she suggested, require a fundamental rewriting of the detection order provisions.&nbsp;Including to ensure provisions are formulated with “sufficient precision” to not apply to people whose conduct is not suspected of being criminal.</p>
<p>She also argued for an independent judicial authority being invoked to sign off searches and verify the purposes and basis upon which individuals or groups of people are suspected. Plus proportionality tests built in — to determine whether the law allows for a truly independent assessment.</p>
<p>“If you consider that all of these different elements would have to be in line in order for detection order to be lawful then I think we’re in a very challenging situation at the moment with the text that’s on the table before us,” she cautioned.</p>
<p>Mission creep was another concern raised by several speakers — with panellists pointing to<a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/29/europol-sought-unlimited-data-access-in-online-child-sexual-abuse-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> documents obtained by journalists</a> that suggest Europol wants unfiltered access to data obtained under the CSAM-scanning proposal.</p>
<p>“[We] know that the objective of Europol is to become a data hub and to also enlarge and strengthen its missions,” said MEP Saskia Bricmont. “Is there a risk of function creep? I think there is obviously, not only because of what has happened before in the evolution of the legislation around Europol but also because it seems that Europol has been pushing to obtain, in this legislation, what it aims for — namely, collect data, extend access to data and filter data — and which is also reflected in the Commission’s proposal.”</p>
<p>She noted this requires all reports “not manifestly unfounded” to be sent simultaneously to Europol and national law enforcement agencies. “So far the European Parliament’s position is not going in that direction… But, nevertheless, the initial proposal of the Commission is going in that direction and… <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/29/europol-sought-unlimited-data-access-in-online-child-sexual-abuse-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Europol has been also pushing for extended detection to other crime areas</a> beyond CSAM.”</p>
<h2>No dialogue</h2>
<p>The event was being held two days before Ylva Johansson, the bloc’s commissioner for Home Affairs — who has been the driving force behind the CSAM-scanning proposal — is due to attend a hearing with the European Parliament’s civil rights committee.</p>
<p>Critics have accused Johansson personally, and the Commission generally, of a lack of transparency and accountability around the controversial proposal. So the meeting will be closely watched and, most likely, rather a tense affair (to put it mildly).</p>
<p>One key criticism — also aired during the seminar — is that EU lawmakers are using the highly sensitive and emotive issue of child abuse to push a blanket surveillance plan on the region that would drastically impact the fundamental rights of hundreds of millions of Europeans.</p>
<p>“What I find really problematic is the instrumentalization of such a sensitive topic, emotional question also related to the fight — and legitimate fight and prior fights — against child sexual abuse,” said Bricmont. “And this is also what we as MEPs as European parliament have to dig into, and we will have the exchanges with the commissioner in our LIBE Committee. Because we want to know more about this and other revelations of <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BalkanInsight’s [investigative reporting]</a> when it comes to potential conflicts of interests.”</p>
<p>“Let us regret the absence of the Commission because I think we need dialogue,” she added. “I think we need to share knowledge and information in this file and that the fact that there’s a closed door [increases] suspicion also. If we want to believe that the intentions are positive and to fight against child sexual abuse then it means that every party, every person needs to be also open to the counter arguments and bring founded arguments to explain why they want to go into that direction.</p>
<p>“So the question is, is the Commission misled? Misinformed? What is it? And this is also true for the Council side — because we know [there is there] probably also a lack of understanding of what is discussed today, and the risks related to the end of end-to-end encryption.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month Johansson responded to critics by penning a <a href="https://commissioners.ec.europa.eu/news/setting-record-straight-2023-10-15_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that denounced what she suggested had included personal attacks on her and attacked those who have been raising doubts, including over opaque lobbying around the file — after <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journalists questioned</a> the level of access given to lobbyists for commercial entities involved in selling so-called safety tech who stand to benefit from a law that makes use of such tools mandatary.</p>
<p>She went so far as to suggest that civil society opposition to the CSAM-scanning proposal may be acting as a sock puppet for Big Tech interests.</p>
<p>“The biggest digital rights NGO in Europe gets funding from the biggest tech company in the world. EDRI, the European Digital Rights NGO, publishes on its website that it receives funding from Apple,” she wrote. “Apple was accused of moving encryption keys to China, which critics say could endanger customer data. Yet no-one asks if these are strange bedfellows, no-one assumes Apple is drafting EDRI’s speaking points.”</p>
<p>Ella Jakubowska, senior policy advisor at EDRi, did not engage directly with the commissioner’s attack on her employer during her own contribution to the seminar. Instead she dedicated her two-to-three minutes of speaking time to calling out the Commission for asking Europeans to make a false choice between privacy and safety.</p>
<p>“This disingenuous narrative has been reiterated in surveys which have crassly asked people if they agree that the ability to detect child abuse is more important than the right to online privacy,” she said. “This is a misrepresentation of both privacy and safety — as if we can all altruistically give up some of our privacy in order to keep children safe online. It doesn’t work in that way. And this sort of attitude really failed to grasp the deep social roots of the crime that we are talking about. To the contrary, I think it’s clear that privacy and safety are mutually reinforcing.”</p>
<p>Jakubowska also accused the EU’s executive of seeking to manipulate public support for its proposal by deploying leading survey questions. (Johansson’s blog post pointed to a new Eurobarometer<a href="https://ecpat.org/breaking-eu-citizens-support-child-safety-online/"> poll</a> which she claimed showed massive public support for laws that regulate online service providers to fight child sexual abuse, including 81% supporting platforms having obligations to detect, report and remove child sexual abuse.)</p>
<p>She went on to highlight concerns that the proposal poses risks to professional secrecy (such as lawyer client privilege), warning: “This of course, on the surface should be of concern to all of us in a democratic society. But even more so when we’re thinking about this crime of child sexual abuse, where securing convictions of perpetrators is so deeply important. The idea that this law could stand in the way of already fragile access to justice for survivors should not be taken lightly. But this element was not even considered in the Commission’s proposal.”</p>
<p>She also highlighted the risk of negative impacts on children’s political participation — which she said is an angle that’s been under-examined by lawmakers, despite children’s rights law requiring their voices to be listened to in legislation that will impact young people.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard very little from children and young people themselves. In fact, in a representative survey that was undertaken earlier this year, it was found that 80% of young people aged between 13 and 17 from across 13 EU Member States would not feel comfortably being politically active or exploring their sexuality if authorities were able to monitor their digital communication. And that was specifically asked if it was being done for the purpose of scanning for child sexual abuse. So it’s really clear when we asked young people if this is the sort of measure that they want to keep them safe that this is not the answer,” she suggested.</p>
<p>The final panellist to speak during the event was MEP Patrick Breyer who has been a stalwart voice raised in opposition of the CSAM-scanning proposal — aka, “Chatcontrol” as he’s pithily dubbed it — ever since the controversial plan popped up on the EU’s horizon.</p>
<p>During the seminar he described the proposal as “unprecedented in the free world”, suggesting it has led to unhelpfully polarized arguments both for and against. The more fruitful approach for policymakers would, he argued, be to work for consensus <span>— to “try to bring the two sides together”, by keeping bits of the proposal everyone can get behind and then — “consensually” — adding “new, effective approaches” to push for something that “can protect children much better”.</span></p>
<p>Discussing how the proposal might be amended to reduce negative impacts and bolster protections for kids, Breyer<span> said a new approach is needed — one that doesn’t just remove the controversial detection orders but focused on prevention by </span><span>“strictly limiting the scanning of communications to persons presumably involved in child sexual exploitation”. So targeted investigations, not Chatcontrol. </span><span>“That’s the only way to avoid involvement in court and achieving nothing at all for our children,” he argued.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Per Breyer, MEPs who support reforming the proposal are working hard to achieve such changes in the Parliament. But — so far — he said the Council is “r<span>efusing any measure of targeting”. </span></p>
<p><span>“We also need to avoid un-targeted voluntary detection by industry, both concerning content and metadata, because it suffers the same problems for proportionality as the mandated detected,” he went on. “And the same goes for not turning our personal devices into scanners, in order to back door encryption. So we need to explicitly exclude client-side scanning… </span><span>What the Council is looking at — some vague commitments to how important encryption is — does not do the job.”</span></p>
<p><span>On detection, as an alternative to unacceptable mass surveillance he spoke up in favor of proactive crawling of publicly accessible material — which he noted is already being done the U.K. and Canada — as a way to “clean the web”. Th</span><span>e proposed new EU Centre could be tasked with doing that, he suggested, along with focusing on crime prevention, victim support and best practices for law enforcement.</span></p>
<p>In wider remarks, he also urged lawmakers to resist calls to impose mandatory age verification on platforms as another ill-thought through child safety measure — suggesting the focus should instead be placed on making services safe by design.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t profiles be restricted to being private unless the user explicitly wants to make them publicly visible? Should anybody be able to reach out to new users and to send them all sorts of photos without the user even being asked? And shouldn’t the users have the right to decide whether they want to see nude photos? It’s possible to tell on the device without giving any information to the provider. Such confirmation could also go a long way to warning teenagers and children of what could be the consequences — and maybe offering them to reach out for support.”</p>
<p>But non-technical solutions are ultimately “key” to preventing child sexual abuse, he suggested, emphasizing: “<span>We can’t focus just on technical approaches only. </span></p>
<p><span>The stakes if EU lawmakers fail to reach a sensible revision of the proposal in trilogue negotiations on this file are grave indeed, he also warned — with the possibility that a CSAM-scanning law could mean “</span><span>the end of truly confidential private messaging and secure encryption” — and also “pave the way to introducing unprecedented authoritarian methods to democracies”. </span></p>
<p>It is the thin end of the wedge, in Breyer’s view. “<span>If they start scanning our communications without cause what prevents them from scanning our devices, or even from scanning our homes? There is technology of shot detection; everything can be done with AI. And I think if that precedent is set — that it is justified to intrude in personal and private spaces just because they could be some hint of a crime — then this very much destroys the essence of the right to privacy,” he suggested.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“But if we prevail with our views, I think we can set a global example for protecting children online in line with our values. And that’s what I’m fighting for. Not just for our generation but also for our children, because I want them to grow up in a free world where we trust each other and not in a surveillance state of mutual fear.”</span></p>
