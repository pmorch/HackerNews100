                        </div><p><em>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with a former Amazon human-resources worker who was put into the company's performance-management program known as Pivot. This person spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their career. Business Insider has verified their identity and employment at the company. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p>I worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Amazon</a> in HR for several years. Not only did I administer Pivots, but it was eventually brought to my attention that I was going to be going through one.</p><p>They made a mistake by doing that with me. There wasn't a lot of information to justify a poor performance.</p><p>The Pivot goal was a straight, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-focus-coaching-plans-unregretted-attrition-2021-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>across-the-board 6% number</u></a>. And as an HR person, that is a hefty figure.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>And it was driven hard by the HR VPs to show the metrics — daily, weekly — to make sure we knew who was in the pipeline. Not to improve, but who was in the pipeline to get out. There wasn't a lot of interest in improving people.</p><p>You might be cutting some prime choice with the fat. And they were OK with that. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-annual-reviews-rating-2021-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>They wanted that number</u></a>. The managers who had to implement it and tell their people they were on Pivot — I would say a majority of them hated it. Because, one, they didn't have the skills to be able to manage performance that soon out of the gate. A lot of our managers were brand new.</p><p>The first thing you had to do was work with a Pivot consultant. So, that was somebody in HR besides the manager's business partner. And you'd talk about if it was the right time or if it was the wrong time to Pivot someone.</p><p>I would say 80% of my time ended up being focused one way or another on Pivot. Either the Pivot appeal or the Pivot work that workers' managers had to do. And look, I'm not going to say you're going to ever find this somewhere, locked down in words. But the idea is, if you're putting somebody in Pivot, you make that so damn hard that they don't get out.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>Almost always, unless there was some really unique set of situations where it came out during the appeal, the success rate of that was virtually none.</p><p>When I wasn't working on Pivots, working in HR was great. We were supposed to be doing coaching and focusing on strengths and moving people through the organization in a positive way.</p><p>Later, when Pivot came back, we had to stack rank all of our employees. The way we broke it down, we called it top tier, which was, you know, maybe 15-20% by the time it worked out. And then you had the middle. And then you have the bottom tier. The bottom tier was about 20-25%, maybe even up to 30%. The guidelines that they expressed publicly may be different because we always worked to make sure we had more than that because some went bad — or went off the rails, and we couldn't exit them for whatever reason.</p><p>We were way over how many people were actually underperforming or detrimental to the business. Maybe around 1% or 1.5% to 2% were actually not performing well.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><h2><strong>I have PTSD</strong></h2><p>I was disgusted at what I was seeing with the Pivot process. This process alone has given me post-traumatic stress disorder. It impacted me so much as a person that I had to get out of there.</p><p>When it was justified, it was easier to push someone out. If it's deserved, there's no problem. But when it wasn't deserved, you had people crying and begging, and they couldn't understand.</p><p>You had visa-sponsored employees who, once we Pivoted them and moved them out, no longer were authorized to work in the United States. So, they had to make immediate plans to get out of the country. And it's a long process to get sponsored by another group.</p><p>In the years I was there, I never, ever, ever had any performance issue given to me — not even anything close to being serious. I had no worries because I asked for feedback all the time. I'm like, "What can I do? How can I do better?" I didn't ever want to be blindsided by Pivot myself. And what a lot of people did —&nbsp;if they got the indication that they were going down that track —&nbsp;was they would transfer jobs right away. Some people were successful. A lot of people weren't.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>Normally, with a performance-improvement program, as an HR person, you're following progressive discipline. Are you seeing notes that this person is having trouble? Are you seeing coaching conversations that are taking place? So for it to actually just — boom —&nbsp;be there is really problematic.</p><h2><strong>It was my turn</strong></h2><p>During my performance evaluation, when it was clear I was on a PIP, my manager shared criticisms that I'd never heard before. I said, "I've never had any of these comments come to me ever." Essentially, it was a lot of made-up stuff. I mean, you could put some truth to it. I'd been late on a few assignments. But everybody's got some element of things they can improve on in their work. My manager just chose to bring those out.</p><p>Amazon broke down people into three categories. You were either top-tier, middle of the pack, or at least effective.</p><p>Normally, they won't tell you what they rated you, and I'm like, "Come on. I know this stuff just as much as you do. I know the wording. You didn't put me in the medium category. Would you just admit that you put me in the least-effective category?" And I got my manager to admit that.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>I wasn't put on Pivot. My manager wanted to work with me a little bit to see if I was going to commit to the job. So they sat me down and said I could go on Pivot and leave right away, or they would work with me. Well, obviously not having any job opportunities, I said, "Look, I'm in it. Let's try to get better and go from there." So my manager took away all my direct reports, and shoved me into a small box, and said you could do this and try to work yourself out of it.</p><p>Right after that, I started putting in the full push to get another job. And so I started interviewing. I actually had a headhunter that reached out to me. Originally, I told her no, but then some of this stuff happened. And I'm like, "OK, let's revisit it." I got to the point where they offered me a job, and I was going to quit. But I had a huge stock investment coming up. So there was no way I was going to rock the boat in any way, shape, or form just trying to get to this date.</p><p>If you walked away during the Pivot or anytime before you had your investment before it was there for you, you would lose it all. And I'm not talking a little bit of money. I'm talking: I had a couple hundred thousand dollars coming to me.</p><p>I played along, and I'm good at playing along when I have to be. So then the money is in my account. That next day, I called my manager and I told them I was resigning. They blew a gasket —&nbsp;absolutely blew a gasket because I had told them that I was in it for the long run. I said, "Look, you gave me no choice. You put this threat against me. I'm not just gonna sit there and wait for it to be dependent on you. You get to make the call whether I make it or not." My manager was super mad and asked me when I was leaving. I said two weeks. They were incredulous that I wasn't giving them more respect.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>The biggest thing —&nbsp;and I'm gonna say this goes for many, many people that were put on Pivot —&nbsp;is there were no warning signs. There was no trail of communication saying, "You are underperforming." I mean, even if it's something as simple as, "Hey, can you do better on this next time?" I know, certainly, I got zero negative feedback. I got the feedback that I was rocking it. And then all of a sudden, to be in this place, it's like, "Huh."</p><p>I still wonder about what happened to all the people that went through that process. How did it impact their life? I think it leads to a lot of mental-health issues.</p><blockquote><section><em>Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, told BI via email:</em></section><section><em>"Like most companies, we have a performance management process that helps our managers identify who on their teams are performing well and who may need more support. For the small number of employees who are underperforming, we use performance management programs to help them improve, and many employees do just that. Sometimes the programs result in employees leaving the company. Business Insider declined to share the information needed to verify this individual's account, but it contains a number of inaccuracies about our performance management process.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/11/30/xcurl/">https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/11/30/xcurl/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38471004">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is often said that <em>Imitation is the Sincerest Form of Flattery</em>.</p>



<p>Also, remember <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/06/19/google-to-reimplement-curl-in-libcrurl/" data-type="post" data-id="12576">libcrurl</a>? That was the name of the thing Google once planned to do:  reimplement the libcurl API on top of their Chrome networking library. Flattery or not, it never went anywhere.</p>



<p>The other day I received an email asking me about details regarding something called <strong>xCurl</strong>. Not having a clue what that was, a quick search soon had me enlightened.</p>



<p>xCurl is, using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/_content/gc/networking/overviews/web-requests/intro-xcurl">their own words</a>, <em>a Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) compliant implementation of the libCurl API</em>.</p>



<h2>A Frankencurl</h2>



<p>The article I link to above describes how xCurl differs from libcurl: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>xCurl differs from libCurl in that xCurl is implemented on top of WinHttp and automatically follows all the extra Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) requirements and best practices. While libCurl itself doesn’t meet the security requirements for the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) console platform, use xCurl to maintain your same libCurl HTTP implementation across all platforms while changing only one header include and library linkage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I don’t know anything about WinHttp, but since that is an HTTP API I can only presume that making libcurl use that instead of plain old sockets has to mean a pretty large surgery and code change. I also have no idea what the mentioned “security requirements” might be. I’m not very familiar with Windows internals nor with their game development setups.</p>



<p>The article then goes on to describe with some detail exactly which libcurl options that work, and which don’t and what libcurl build options that were used when xCurl was built. No DoH, no proxy support, no cookies etc.</p>



<p>The provided functionality is certainly a very stripped down and limited version of the libcurl API. A fun detail is that the quite bluntly just link to the <a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/">libcurl API documentation</a> to describe how xCurl works. It is easy and convenient of course, and it will certainly make xCurl “forced” to stick to the libcurl behavior</p>



<p>With large invasive changes of this kind we can certainly hope that the team making it has invested time and spent serious effort on additional testing, both before release and ongoing.</p>



<h2>Source code?</h2>



<p>I have not been able to figure out how to download xCurl in any form, and since I can’t find the source code I cannot really get a grip of exactly how much and how invasive Microsoft has patched this. They have not been in touch or communicated about this work of theirs to anyone in the curl project.</p>



<p>Therefore, I also cannot say which libcurl version this is based on – as there is no telling of that on the page describing xCurl.</p>



<p>The email that triggered me to crawl down this rabbit hole included a copyright file that seems to originate from an xCurl package, and that includes the curl license. The curl license file has the specific detail that it shows the copyright year range at the top and this file said </p>



<pre>Copyright (c) 1996 - 2020, Daniel Stenberg, daniel@haxx.se, and many contributors, see the THANKS file.</pre>



<p>It <em>might</em> indicate that they use a libcurl from a few years back. Only <em>might</em>, because it is quite common among users of libcurl to “forget” (sometimes I’m sure on purpose) to update this copyright range even when they otherwise upgrade the source code. This makes the year range a rather weak evidence of the actual age of the libcurl code this is based on.</p>



<h2>Updates</h2>



<p>curl (including libcurl) ships a new version <em>at least</em> once every eight weeks. We merge bugfixes at a rate of around three bugfixes <em>per day</em>. Keeping a heavily modified libcurl version in sync with the latest curl releases is hard work.</p>



<p>Of course, since they deliberately limit the scope of the functionality of their clone, lots of upstream changes in curl will not affect xCurl users.</p>



<h2>License</h2>



<p>curl is licensed under… <a href="https://curl.se/docs/copyright.html">the curl license</a>! It is an MIT license that I was unclever enough to slightly modify many years ago. The changes are enough for organizations such as SPDX to consider it a separate one: <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/curl.html">curl</a>. I normally still say that curl is MIT licensed because the changes are minuscule and do not change the spirit of the license.</p>



<p>The curl license of course allows Microsoft or anyone else do to this kind of stunt and they don’t even have to provide the source code for their changes or the final product and they don’t have to ask or tell anyone:</p>



<p><em>Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.</em></p>



<p>I once picked this license for curl exactly because it allows this. Sure it might sometimes then make people do things in secret that they never contribute back, and we miss out on possible improvements because of that, but I think the more important property is that no company feels scared or restricted as to when and where they can use this code. A license designed for maximum adoption.</p>



<p>I have always had the belief that it is our relentless update scheme and never-ending flood of bugfixes that is what will keep users wanting to use the real thing and avoid maintaining long-running external patches. There will of course always be exceptions to that.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Adobe’s $20 billion buy of web-first design collaboration start-up Figma will harm software developers if it goes ahead as proposed, according to a provisional ruling on the merger by Britain’s competition regulator.</p>
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority launched a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/13/adobe_figma_cma_investigation/">deeper investigation of the tie-up in July</a> when it classified Figma as an “emerging threat to Adobe”.</p>
<p>Now in the latest twist, the regulator says it found the merger would eliminate one of two major players in three software sub-markets: product design; image editing; and illustration.</p>

    

<p>Figma’s tools are used by well-known businesses that are key to the success of the digital economy, the CMA reckons, including Airbnb, Patagonia and Vodafone. Approving the acquisition “would remove the constraint Adobe exerts on Figma through its product design software, AdobeXD.”</p>

        


        

<p>The CMA adds in its <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/adobe-figma-deal-could-harm-uk-digital-design-sector?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&amp;utm_source=a9bd367c-1ec0-4a7f-94d8-0d328af5b1ac&amp;utm_content=immediately">report</a>: “The inquiry group also provisionally concluded that Adobe abandoned development of new product design software which could have competed even more closely with Figma and, given the timing of the decision, did this as a consequence of the merger.</p>
<p>“This supports the CMA’s concern that this proposed deal would likely reduce innovation and the development of competitive new products.”</p>

        

<p>Some software developers are worried that Adobe would up the price of Figma’s subsciption post merger, something Figma denied would happen.</p>
<p>Figma offers a browser-based app that manages file organization by listing projects and related files in a dedicated format. It requires no installation, no patching and no updates. The company has an estimated four million users.</p>

</ul>
<p>As for image editing and illustration software, the “threat posed” by Figma has fueled product development of Adobe’s Photoshop and Illustrator applications, including web versions, and this dynamic would be altered by the merger.</p>
<p>“This competition would be lost as a result of the transaction, harming designers and creative agencies who might have used these new tools or relied on future updates,” the CMA’s report adds.</p>
<p>The nature of the ruling is provisions., and the CMA will now consult of them and consider potential remedies “which could include blocking the deal outright”.</p>

        

<p>This is not the type of talk that Adobe execs will want to hear. The company’s top brass has talked endlessly about the benefits of a merger, and had planned to conclude the deal by the end of last month until the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/20/ec_rules_adobes_20bn_buy/">European Commission notified Adobe</a> that it too had multiple concerns that must be addressed.</p>
<p>The EC has a new February deadline to conclude its own probe. And of course the Dept of Justice’s anti-trust team is also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/18/adobe_figma_antitrust/">taking a keen interest</a> in the $20 billion sale, which would be the most expensive for a private company in enterprise software history.</p>
<p>Alex Haffner, competition partner at UK law firm Fladgate, told us the EC and CMA are highlighting "broadly the same concerns".</p>
<p>"The challenge will now be for the merging parties to persuade the competition regulators that they have got the analysis wrong in their provisional assessments or, more likely, to come up with a package of remedies which can satisfy their stated concerns."</p>
<p>A spokespeson at Adobe sent us a statement: "We are disappointed in the CMA’s findings and disagree with the CMA’s perspective on this transaction. Adobe and Figma will deliver significant value to customers. We are reviewing the provisional findings and will reengage with the CMA on the facts and merits of the case." ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am returning to OpenAI as CEO. Mira will return to her role as CTO. The new initial board will consist of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D’Angelo.</p><p>I have never been more excited about the future. I am extremely grateful for everyone’s hard work in an unclear and unprecedented situation, and I believe our resilience and spirit set us apart in the industry. I feel so, so good about our probability of success for achieving our mission.</p><p>Before getting to what comes next, I’d like to share some thanks.</p><p>I love and respect Ilya, I think he's a guiding light of the field and a gem of a human being. I harbor zero ill will towards him. While Ilya will no longer serve on the board, we hope to continue our working relationship and are discussing how he can continue his work at OpenAI.</p><p>I am grateful to Adam, Tasha, and Helen for working with us to come to this solution that best serves the mission. I’m excited to continue to work with Adam and am sincerely thankful to Helen and Tasha for investing a huge amount of effort in this process.</p><p>Thank you also to Emmett who had a key and constructive role in helping us reach this outcome. Emmett’s dedication to AI safety and balancing stakeholders’ interests was clear.</p><p>Mira did an amazing job throughout all of this, serving the mission, the team, and the company selflessly throughout. She is an incredible leader and OpenAI would not be OpenAI without her. Thank you.</p><p>Greg and I are partners in running this company. We have never quite figured out how to communicate that on the org chart, but we will. In the meantime, I just wanted to make it clear. Thank you for everything you have done since the very beginning, and for how you handled things from the moment this started and over the last week.</p><p>The leadership team–Mira, Brad, Jason, Che, Hannah, Diane, Anna, Bob, Srinivas, Matt, Lilian, Miles, Jan, Wojciech, John, Jonathan, Pat, and many more–is clearly ready to run the company without me. They say one way to evaluate a CEO is how you pick and train your potential successors; on that metric I am doing far better than I realized. It’s clear to me that the company is in great hands, and I hope this is abundantly clear to everyone. Thank you all.</p><p>Jakub, Szymon, and Aleksander are exceptional talents and I’m so happy they have rejoined to move us and our research forward. Thank you.</p><p>To all of you, our team: I am sure books are going to be written about this time period, and I hope the first thing they say is how amazing the entire team has been. Now that we’re through all of this, we didn’t lose a single employee. You stood firm for each other, this company, and our mission. One of the most important things for the team that builds AGI safely is the ability to handle stressful and uncertain situations, and maintain good judgment throughout. Top marks. Thank you all.</p><p>Satya, Kevin, Amy, and Brad have been incredible partners throughout this, with exactly the right priorities all the way through. They’ve had our backs and were ready to welcome all of us if we couldn’t achieve our primary goal. We clearly made the right choice to partner with Microsoft and I’m excited that our new board will include them as a non-voting observer. Thank you.</p><p>To our partners and users, thank you for sticking with us. We really felt the outpouring of support and love, and it helped all of us get through this. The fact that we did not lose a single customer will drive us to work even harder for you, and we are all excited to get back to work.</p><p>Will Hurd, Brian Chesky, Bret Taylor and Larry Summers put their lives on hold and did an incredible amount to support the mission. I don’t know how they did it so well, but they really did. Thank you.</p><p>Ollie also put his life on hold this entire time to just do everything he could to help out, in addition to providing his usual unconditional love and support. Thank you and I love you.</p><p><strong>So what’s next?</strong></p><p>We have three immediate priorities.</p><p>Advancing our research plan and further investing in our full-stack safety efforts, which have always been critical to our work. Our research roadmap is clear; this was a wonderfully focusing time. I share the excitement you all feel; we will turn this crisis into an opportunity! I’ll work with Mira on this.</p><p>Continuing to improve and deploy our products and serve our customers. It’s important that people get to experience the benefits and promise of AI, and have the opportunity to shape it. We continue to believe that great products are the best way to do this. I’ll work with Brad, Jason and Anna to ensure our unwavering commitment to users, customers, partners and governments around the world is clear.</p><p>Bret, Larry, and Adam will be working very hard on the extremely important task of building out a board of diverse perspectives, improving our governance structure and overseeing an independent review of recent events. I look forward to working closely with them on these crucial steps so everyone can be confident in the stability of OpenAI.&nbsp;</p><p>I am so looking forward to finishing the job of building beneficial AGI with you all—best team in the world, best mission in the world.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                </p>

            


        <div>
            <p>Nowadays many cloud service providers design their own silicon, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) started to do this ahead of its rivals and by now its Annapurna Labs develops processors that can well compete with those from AMD and Intel. This week AWS introduced its Graviton4, a 96-core ARM-based system-on-chip (SoC) that promises to challenge renowned CPU designers and offer unprecedented performance to AWS clients.</p>

<p>"By focusing our chip designs on real workloads that matter to customers, we are able to deliver the most advanced cloud infrastructure to them," said David Brown, vice president of Compute and Networking at AWS. "Graviton4 marks the fourth generation we have delivered in just five years, and is the most powerful and energy efficient chip we have ever built for a broad range of workloads."</p>

<p>The AWS Graviton4 processor packs 96 cores that offer on average 30% higher compute performance compared to Graviton3 and is 40% faster in database applications as well as 45% faster in Java applications, according to Amazon. Given that Amazon did not reveal many details about its Graviton4, it is hard to attribute performance increases to any particular characteristics of the CPU.</p>

<p>Yet, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/11/28/aws-adopts-arm-v2-cores-for-expansive-graviton4-server-cpu/"><em>NextPlatform</em> believes that the processor uses Arm Neoverse V2 cores</a>, which are more capable than V1 cores used in previous-generation AWS processors when it comes to instruction per clock (IPC). Furthermore, the new CPU is expected to be fabricated using one of TSMC's N4 process technologies (4nm-class), which offers a higher clock-speed potential than TSMC's N5 nodes.</p>

<p>"AWS Graviton4 instances are the fastest EC2 instances we have ever tested, and they are delivering outstanding performance across our most competitive and latency sensitive workloads," said Roman Visintine, lead cloud engineer at Epic. "We look forward to using Graviton4 to improve player experience and expand what is possible within Fortnite.”</p>

<p>In addition, the new processor features a revamped memory subsystem with a 536.7 GB/s peak bandwidth, which is 75% higher compared to the previous-generation AWS CPU. Higher memory bandwidth improves performance of CPUs in memory intensive applications, such as databases.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, such a major memory bandwidth improvement indicates that the new processor employs a memory subsystem with a higher number of channels compared to Graviton3, though AWS has not formally confirmed this.</p>

<p>Graviton4 will be featured in memory-optimized Amazon EC2 R8g instances, which is particularly useful to boost performance in high-end databases and analytics. Furthermore, these R8g instances provide up to three times more vCPUs and memory than Graviton 3-based R7g instances, enabling higher throughput for data processing, better scalability, faster results, and reduced costs. To ensure security of AWS EC2 instances, Amazon equipped all high-speed physical hardware interfaces of Graviton4 CPUs.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Amazon offers up to 64 vCPU cores with its R7g instances (i.e., one full Graviton3 CPU). Therefore, to offer 192 vCPU cores, Amazon will need to either install two 96-core CPUs into one server (which marks one of the world's first Armv9-based 2-way server design), enable three-way SMT on a 96-core CPU, or implement a very low-latency high-bandwidth interconnection between servers running 96-core cPUs.</p>

<p>Graviton4 R8g is currently in preview, these instances will be available widely in the coming months.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">llamafile</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/blob/main/llamafile/llamafile.png"><img src="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/raw/main/llamafile/llamafile.png" alt="llamafile-250"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>llamafile lets you distribute and run LLMs with a single file (<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/11/introducing-llamafile/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>)</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Our goal is to make the "build once anywhere, run anywhere" dream come
true for AI developers. We're doing that by combining <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan Libc</a> into one
framework that lets you build apps for LLMs as a single-file artifact
that runs locally on most PCs and servers.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, your llamafiles can run on multiple CPU microarchitectures. We
added runtime dispatching to llama.cpp that lets new Intel systems use
modern CPU features without trading away support for older computers.</p>
<p dir="auto">Secondly, your llamafiles can run on multiple CPU architectures. We do
that by concatenating AMD64 and ARM64 builds with a shell script that
launches the appropriate one. Our file format is compatible with WIN32
and most UNIX shells. It's also able to be easily converted (by either
you or your users) to the platform-native format, whenever required.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thirdly, your llamafiles can run on six OSes (macOS, Windows, Linux,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD). You'll only need to build your code once,
using a Linux-style toolchain. The GCC-based compiler we provide is
itself an Actually Portable Executable, so you can build your software
for all six OSes from the comfort of whichever one you prefer most for
development.</p>
<p dir="auto">Lastly, the weights for your LLM can be embedded within your llamafile.
We added support for PKZIP to the GGML library. This lets uncompressed
weights be mapped directly into memory, similar to a self-extracting
archive. It enables quantized weights distributed online to be prefixed
with a compatible version of the llama.cpp software, thereby ensuring
its originally observed behaviors can be reproduced indefinitely.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Binary Instructions</h2>
<p dir="auto">We provide example binaries that embed several different models. You can
download these from Hugging Face via the links below. "Command-line
binaries" run from the command line, just as if you were invoking
llama.cpp's "main" function manually. "Server binaries" launch a local
web server (at 127.0.0.1:8080) that provides a web-based chatbot.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Gotchas</h3>
<p dir="auto">On macOS with Apple Silicon you need to have Xcode installed for
llamafile to be able to bootstrap itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, you may need to rename <code>llamafile</code> to <code>llamafile.exe</code> in
order for it to run. Windows also has a maximum file size limit of 4GB
for executables. The LLaVA server executable above is just 30MB shy of
that limit, so it'll work on Windows, but with larger models like
WizardCoder 13B, you need to store the weights in a separate file.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you use zsh and have trouble running llamafile, try saying <code>sh -c ./llamafile</code>. This is due to a bug that was fixed in zsh 5.9+. The same
is the case for Python <code>subprocess</code>, old versions of Fish, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Linux <code>binfmt_misc</code> has been known to cause problems. You can fix
that by installing the actually portable executable interpreter.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo wget -O /usr/bin/ape https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/ape-$(uname -m).elf
sudo sh -c &quot;echo ':APE:M::MZqFpD::/usr/bin/ape:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register&quot;

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">GPU Support</h3>
<p dir="auto">On Apple Silicon, everything should just work if Xcode is installed.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Linux, Nvidia cuBLAS GPU support will be compiled on the fly if (1)
you have the <code>cc</code> compiler installed, (2) you pass the <code>--n-gpu-layers 35</code> flag (or whatever value is appropriate) to enable GPU, and (3) the
CUDA developer toolkit is installed on your machine and the <code>nvcc</code>
compiler is on your path.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, that usually means you need to open up the MSVC x64 native
command prompt and run llamafile there, for the first invocation, so it
can build a DLL with native GPU support. After that, <code>$CUDA_PATH/bin</code>
still usually needs to be on the <code>$PATH</code> so the GGML DLL can find its
other CUDA dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the event that GPU support couldn't be compiled and dynamically
linked on the fly for any reason, llamafile will fall back to CPU
inference.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Source Instructions</h2>
<p dir="auto">Here's how to build llamafile from source. First, you need the cosmocc
toolchain, which is a fat portable binary version of GCC. Here's how you
can download the latest release and add it to your path.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mkdir -p cosmocc

<p dir="auto">If you want to be able to just say:</p>

the paths you already know are in there), then you can add a special
<code>.args</code> to the zip archive, which specifies the default arguments. In
this case, we're going to try our luck with the normal <code>zip</code> command,
which requires we temporarily rename the file. First, let's create the
arguments file:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cat <<EOF >.args
-m
llava-v1.5-7b-Q8_0.gguf
--mmproj

--host
0.0.0.0
...
EOF
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">As we can see above, there's one argument per line. The <code>...</code> argument
optionally specifies where any additional CLI arguments passed by the
user are to be inserted. Next, we'll add the argument file to the
executable:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mv o//llama.cpp/server/server server.com

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Technical Details</h2>
<p dir="auto">Here is a succinct overview of the tricks we used to create the fattest
executable format ever. The long story short is llamafile is a shell
script that launches itself and runs inference on embedded weights in
milliseconds without needing to be copied or installed. What makes that
possible is mmap(). Both the llama.cpp executable and the weights are
concatenated onto the shell script. A tiny loader program is then
extracted by the shell script, which maps the executable into memory.
The llama.cpp executable then opens the shell script again as a file,
and calls mmap() again to pull the weights into memory and make them
directly accessible to both the CPU and GPU.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ZIP Weights Embedding</h3>
<p dir="auto">The trick to embedding weights inside llama.cpp executables is to ensure
the local file is aligned on a page size boundary. That way, assuming
the zip file is uncompressed, once it's mmap()'d into memory we can pass
pointers directly to GPUs like Apple Metal, which require that data be
page size aligned. Since no existing ZIP archiving tool has an alignment
flag, we had to write about <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/blob/main/llamafile/zipalign.c">400 lines of code</a> to
insert the ZIP files ourselves. However, once there, every existing ZIP
program should be able to read them, provided they support ZIP64. This
makes the weights much more easily accessible than they otherwise would
have been, had we invented our own file format for concatenated files.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Microarchitectural Portability</h3>
<p dir="auto">On Intel and AMD microprocessors, llama.cpp spends most of its time in
the matmul quants, which are usually written thrice for SSSE3, AVX, and
AVX2. llamafile pulls each of these functions out into a separate file
that can be <code>#include</code>ed multiple times, with varying
<code>__attribute__((__target__("arch")))</code> function attributes. Then, a
wrapper function is added which uses Cosmopolitan's <code>X86_HAVE(FOO)</code>
feature to runtime dispatch to the appropriate implementation.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture Portability</h3>
<p dir="auto">llamafile solves architecture portability by building llama.cpp twice:
once for AMD64 and again for ARM64. It then wraps them with a shell
script which has an MZ prefix. On Windows, it'll run as a native binary.
On Linux, it'll extract a small 8kb executable called <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/master/ape/loader.c">APE
Loader</a>
to <code>${TMPDIR:-${HOME:-.}}/.ape</code> that'll map the binary portions of the
shell script into memory. It's possible to avoid this process by running
the
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/master/tool/build/assimilate.c"><code>assimilate</code></a>
program that comes included with the <code>cosmocc</code> compiler. What the
<code>assimilate</code> program does is turn the shell script executable into
the host platform's native executable format. This guarantees a fallback
path exists for traditonal release processes when it's needed.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">GPU Support</h3>
<p dir="auto">Cosmopolitan Libc uses static linking, since that's the only way to get
the same executable to run on six OSes. This presents a challenge for
llama.cpp, because it's not possible to statically link GPU support. The
way we solve that is by checking if a compiler is installed on the host
system. For Apple, that would be Xcode, and for other platforms, that
would be <code>nvcc</code>. llama.cpp has a single file implementation of each GPU
module, named <code>ggml-metal.m</code> (Objective C) and <code>ggml-cuda.cu</code> (Nvidia
C). llamafile embeds those source files within the zip archive and asks
the platform compiler to build them at runtime, targeting the native GPU
microarchitecture. If it works, then it's linked with platform C library
dlopen() implementation. See <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/blob/main/llamafile/cuda.c">llamafile/cuda.c</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/blob/main/llamafile/metal.c">llamafile/metal.c</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to use the platform-specific dlopen() function, we need to ask
the platform-specific compiler to build a small executable that exposes
these interfaces. On ELF platforms, Cosmopolitan Libc maps this helper
executable into memory along with the platform's ELF interpreter. The
platform C library then takes care of linking all the GPU libraries, and
then runs the helper program which longjmp()'s back into Cosmopolitan.
The executable program is now in a weird hybrid state where two separate
C libraries exist which have different ABIs. For example, thread local
storage works differently on each operating system, and programs will
crash if the TLS register doesn't point to the appropriate memory. The
way Cosmopolitan Libc solves that is by JITing a trampoline around each
dlsym() import, which blocks signals using <code>sigprocmask()</code> and changes
the TLS register using <code>arch_prctl()</code>. Under normal circumstances,
aspecting each function call with four additional system calls would be
prohibitively expensive, but for llama.cpp that cost is infinitesimal
compared to the amount of compute used for LLM inference. Our technique
has no noticeable slowdown. The major tradeoff is that, right now, you
can't pass callback pointers to the dlopen()'d module. Only one such
function needed to be removed from the llama.cpp codebase, which was an
API intended for customizing logging. In the future, Cosmoplitan will
just trampoline signal handlers and code morph the TLS instructions to
avoid these tradeoffs entirely. See
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/master/libc/dlopen/dlopen.c">cosmopolitan/dlopen.c</a>
for further details.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Licensing</h2>
<p dir="auto">While the llamafile project is Apache 2.0-licensed, our changes
to llama.cpp are licensed under MIT (just like the llama.cpp project
itself) so as to remain compatible and upstreamable in the future,
should that be desired.</p>
<p dir="auto">The llamafile logo on this page was generated with the assistance of DALL·E 3.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Known Issues</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The 64-bit version of Windows has a 4GB file size limit. While
llamafile will work fine on 64-bit Windows with the weights as a
separate file, you'll get an error if you load them into the
executable itself and try to run it.</li>

    <div id="how-we-score-reliability">
                    <p>Every year CR asks its members about problems they’ve had with their vehicles in the previous 12 months. This year we gathered data on over 330,000 vehicles, from the 2000 to 2023 model years, with a few early-introduced 2024 model years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We study 20 trouble areas, from nuisances—such as squeaky brakes and broken interior trim—to major bummers, such as potentially expensive out-of-warranty engine, transmission, EV battery, and EV charging problems. We use that information to give reliability ratings for every major mainstream model.</p>
<p>We weigh the severity of each type of problem to create a predicted reliability score for each vehicle, from 1 to 100. We use that information to give reliability ratings for every major mainstream vehicle. (The reliability rating is then combined with data collected from our track testing, as well as our owner satisfaction survey results and safety data, to calculate each test vehicle’s Overall Score.)</p>
<p>This year we have addressed the rapidly growing number of electrified offerings that automakers are producing: hybrids, plug-in hybrids (PHEV), and electric vehicles (EV). As a result, we added three new trouble areas: electric motor, EV/hybrid battery, and EV charging:</p>
<p>• <strong>Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)</strong> vehicles have 17 potential trouble areas.<br>• <strong>EVs</strong> can have up to 12 trouble areas. Traditional ICE problems are not included, such as those with the engine and transmission.<br>• <strong>Hybrids</strong> have 19 potential trouble areas: 17 from ICE vehicles, as well as electric motor and EV battery.<br>• <strong>Plug-in electric vehicles (PHEVs)</strong> can experience all 20 trouble areas: 17 from ICE vehicles, as well as electric motor, EV battery, and EV charging.</p>

    <div id="how-the-regions-compare-for-reliability">
                    <p>Asian automakers are still leading reliability by a wide margin with an overall reliability average score of 63 for the region, on a scale of 1 to 100. Seven of the 10 most reliable brands are from Asian automakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>European automakers are in second place at 46, with three brands filling out the rest of the top 10 most reliable brands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Domestic brands trail both with an average score of 39. Each domestic automaker had at least one model that had an average or better reliability ranking, and Buick’s entire lineup scored average or better.</p>
<p>Both the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ford/edge/">Ford Edge</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ford/maverick/">Maverick</a> scored above-average this year, while the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/buick/encore-gx">Buick Encore GX</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/cadillac/xt5">Cadillac XT5</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/chevrolet/equinox">Chevrolet Equinox</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/gmc/terrain">GMC Terrain</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lincoln/corsair">Lincoln Corsair</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/tesla/model-3">Tesla Model 3</a> had high scores.</p>
<p>Cars, including sedans, hatchbacks, and wagons, remain the most reliable vehicle type, with an average reliability rating of 57 (on a scale of 0 to 100), followed by SUVs (50) and minivans (45). “Sedans have fallen out of favor with consumers, but as a class they are very reliable,” says Jake Fisher, senior director of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/cars-driving/how-consumer-reports-tests-cars-auto-test-center-a3516544374/">auto testing at Consumer Reports</a>. “They often have less of the latest technology and features that can cause problems before the bugs are worked out.” Pickup trucks come in last, with an average reliability rating of 41.</p>
                </div>
    <div id="hybrids-soar-and-e-vs-still-struggle">
                    <p>There are interesting insights with the reliability of electrified models this year. Overall, hybrids have 26 percent fewer problems than cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). Some standouts include the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lexus/ux">Lexus UX</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lexus/nx-hybrid">NX Hybrid</a> and the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/camry-hybrid">Toyota Camry Hybrid</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/highlander-hybrid">Highlander Hybrid</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/rav4-hybrid">RAV4 Hybrid</a>.</p>
<p>Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are more of a mixed bag. As a category, they have 146 percent more problems than ICE vehicles. Several PHEVs are even less reliable than their conventional counterparts, such as the below-average <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/audi/q5">Audi Q5</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/chrysler/pacifica-hybrid">Chrysler Pacifica</a>. The latter has the lowest score in our survey, at 14.</p>
<p>Still, there are PHEVs that buck that trend, including standouts such as the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/rav4-prime">Toyota RAV4 Prime</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/kia/sportage-hybrid">Kia Sportage</a>, which score well above average. The <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/bmw/x5">BMW X5</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hyundai/tucson-hybrid">Hyundai Tucson</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ford/escape-hybrid">Ford Escape</a> PHEVs earn average reliability scores.</p>
                </div>
    
    <div>
                <p>Electric cars and electric SUVs don’t fare much better, with average reliability scores of 44 and 43, respectively. At the bottom of our vehicle-type rankings are electric pickup trucks, with an average score of 30.</p>
<p>As more EVs hit the marketplace and automakers build each model in greater numbers, we are seeing that some of them have problems with the EV drive system motors, EV charging systems, and EV batteries (which are different from the low-power 12-volt batteries that power accessories). Owners of the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ford/f-150-lightning">Ford F-150 Lightning</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ford/mustang-mach-e">Mustang Mach-E</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/genesis/gv60">Genesis GV60</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hyundai/ioniq-5">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/kia/niro-electric">Kia Niro EV</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/kia/ev6">EV6</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/subaru/solterra">Subaru Solterra</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/bz4x">Toyota bZ4X</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/volkswagen/id4">Volkswagen ID.4</a> all reported some of these issues.</p>
<p>Among the top five brands, Lexus has just one model, the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lexus/nx/">NX</a>, that scored average predicted reliability. All of its other models scored above-average or better reliability this year, led by the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lexus/ux/">UX</a> hybrid SUV.</p>
<p>A majority of Toyota models have above- or well-above-average reliability. The brand is topped by the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/4runner">4Runner</a> SUV, which is among the most reliable models in the survey. But the brand’s full-sized pickup truck, the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/tundra/">Tundra</a>, remains among the less reliable vehicles in the survey.</p>
<p>Acura’s RDX and TLX both have above-average reliability, while the brand’s two recently redesigned models, the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/acura/mdx/">MDX</a> SUV and Integra sedan, come in at average.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer Reports’ brand-level rankings are based on the average predicted reliability score for vehicles in the brand’s model lineup.</p>
<p>Here we present the rankings of brands based on their average reliability scores. We identify the most and least reliable model scores within each brand and list whether the brand’s rank went up or down based on their relative position from our last survey. This means we consider only those brands in both surveys that had sufficient data for two or more models.</p>

We identified that the file size of one particular report downloaded by the threat actor was larger than the file generated during our initial investigation. After additional analysis, we concluded that the report contained a list of all customer support system users. The discrepancy in our initial analysis stems from the threat actor running an unfiltered view of the report. Our November review identified that if the filters were removed from the templated report, the downloaded file was considerably larger - and more closely matched the size of the file download logged in our security telemetry.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>We also identified additional reports and support cases that the threat actor accessed, which contain contact information of all Okta certified users and some Okta Customer Identity Cloud (CIC) customer contacts, and other information.

<h3>April 14, 2020  • &nbsp;😺🗺</h3>

<p>I love Pokémon. My fascination with the series began with the original games released in the US, Pokémon Red and Blue (I had the Blue version).</p>

<p>In the past few years, people have been disassembling Pokémon games. You can check these out for Pokémon <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokered">Red and Blue</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal">Crystal</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald">Emerald</a>, and others. It's really cool to be able to compile and build a game that was such a huge part of my youth.</p>

<p>I thought it would be fun to play with this source code, viewing these games through a new lens. A few months ago, I discovered <a href="https://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>, a software package for rendering graphs written in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)">Dot language</a>. Dot is a very simple language, and it's easy to filter data into its format. Graphviz includes some command line tools that can render dot files to nice human-readable output. Let's see how we can use Graphviz to visualize Pokémon Red and Blue.</p>

<p>Inside of <code>pokered</code>, there's a <code>data</code> directory with a <code>mapHeaders</code> subdirectory inside. <code>mapHeaders</code> includes metadata about every overworld map in the game. This includes the connections between maps. For example, here is the metadata for Route 10:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat Route10.asm 
Route10_h:
    db OVERWORLD ; tileset
    db ROUTE_10_HEIGHT, ROUTE_10_WIDTH ; dimensions (y, x)
    dw Route10_Blocks ; blocks
    dw Route10_TextPointers ; texts
    dw Route10_Script ; scripts
    db SOUTH | WEST ; connections
    SOUTH_MAP_CONNECTION ROUTE_10, LAVENDER_TOWN, 0, 0, LavenderTown_Blocks
    WEST_MAP_CONNECTION ROUTE_10, ROUTE_9, 0, 0, Route9_Blocks
    dw Route10_Object ; objects
</code></pre>

<p>So south of Route 10 is Lavender Town, and west is Route 9. We can use this connection data and some simple uses of <code>grep</code> and <code>awk</code> to generate Dot code representing these connections. The following commands are all run from <code>/data/mapHeaders</code> in the <code>pokered</code> repository. First, we use <code>grep</code> to see the connections:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -R "MAP_CONNECTION" ./
.//PewterCity.asm:  SOUTH_MAP_CONNECTION PEWTER_CITY, ROUTE_2, 5, 0, Route2_Blocks
.//PewterCity.asm:  EAST_MAP_CONNECTION PEWTER_CITY, ROUTE_3, 4, 0, Route3_Blocks
...
</code></pre>

<p>Next, let's pipe that to <code>awk</code> to print the endpoints of that connection:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -R "MAP_CONNECTION" ./ | awk -F" " '{ print $3 $4; }'
PEWTER_CITY,ROUTE_2,
PEWTER_CITY,ROUTE_3,
...
</code></pre>

<p>We can use a second <code>awk</code> invocation to print these as Dot edges:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -R "MAP_CONNECTION" ./ | awk -F" " '{ print $3 $4; }' | awk -F"," '{ print $1" -- "$2 }'
PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_2
PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_3
...
</code></pre>

<p>Undirected Dot edges are represented with the two nodes and a <code>--</code> between them.</p>

<p>We can represent a strict (one connection between nodes) graph (non-directed, as these are bidirectional connections) by wrapping all these connections in a <code>strict graph {}</code>:</p>

<pre><code>strict graph {
    PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_2
    PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_3
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>We can add two other options (<code>overlap=false</code> to avoid edge overlap and <code>splines=true</code> to use splines for edges) to get a better looking graph. Here's my <code>pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes.dot</code> generated from the above steps:</p>

<pre><code>strict graph {
    overlap=false;
    splines=true;
    PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_2
    PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_3

    CINNABAR_ISLAND -- ROUTE_20
    ROUTE_1 -- VIRIDIAN_CITY
    ROUTE_1 -- PALLET_TOWN
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can use a simple invocation of <code>neato</code> to produce a PDF file with:</p>

<pre><code>neato -Tpdf pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes.dot &gt; pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes.pdf
</code></pre>

<p>Check it out:</p>

<p><img src="http://peterhajas.com/media/pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes_preview.jpeg" alt="A graph visualizing all towns and routes in Pokémon Red and Blue">
(<a href="http://peterhajas.com/media/pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes.pdf">PDF file here</a>)</p>

<p>OK, so towns and routes are cool. Can we augment this file to include buildings, tunnels, and rooms? There are <code>warp</code> and <code>warp_to</code> markers in the files in <code>/data/mapObjects</code>. For example, let's look at <code>SaffronCity.asm</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat data/mapObjects/SaffronCity.asm
SaffronCity_Object:
    db $f ; border block

    db 8 ; warps
    warp 7, 5, 0, COPYCATS_HOUSE_1F
    warp 26, 3, 0, FIGHTING_DOJO
    warp 34, 3, 0, SAFFRON_GYM
    warp 13, 11, 0, SAFFRON_PIDGEY_HOUSE
    warp 25, 11, 0, SAFFRON_MART
    warp 18, 21, 0, SILPH_CO_1F
    warp 9, 29, 0, SAFFRON_POKECENTER
    warp 29, 29, 0, MR_PSYCHICS_HOUSE

    ...

    ; warp-to
    warp_to 7, 5, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; COPYCATS_HOUSE_1F
    warp_to 26, 3, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; FIGHTING_DOJO
    warp_to 34, 3, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; SAFFRON_GYM
    warp_to 13, 11, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; SAFFRON_PIDGEY_HOUSE
    warp_to 25, 11, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; SAFFRON_MART
    warp_to 18, 21, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; SILPH_CO_1F
    warp_to 9, 29, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; SAFFRON_POKECENTER
    warp_to 29, 29, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; MR_PSYCHICS_HOUSE

    ...
</code></pre>

<p>(These <code>_WIDTH</code> suffixes seem to indicate the coordinates are inside of the width of the map. We'll clean them up later.)</p>

<p>So, if we parse out the <code>warp_to</code> statements, we should be able to get a more complete view of the game's locations and how they connect. Let's start with a simple <code>grep</code> to find all the <code>warp_to</code> statements (run from <code>/data/mapObjects</code>):</p>

<pre><code>grep -R "warp_to " ./
.//RocketHideoutB4F.asm:    warp_to 19, 10, ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B3F
.//RocketHideoutB4F.asm:    warp_to 24, 15, ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
.//RocketHideoutB4F.asm:    warp_to 25, 15, ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
...
</code></pre>

<p>Next, pipe to <code>awk</code> to find the endpoints of the warp:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -R "warp_to " ./ | awk -F"," '{ print $3; }'
ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B3F
ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_4F
CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_2F
CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_ELEVATOR
BRUNOS_ROOM_WIDTH ; LORELEIS_ROOM
BRUNOS_ROOM_WIDTH ; LORELEIS_ROOM
BRUNOS_ROOM_WIDTH ; AGATHAS_ROOM
BRUNOS_ROOM_WIDTH ; AGATHAS_ROOM
BIKE_SHOP_WIDTH
...
</code></pre>

<p>This is close, but includes some warps that appear to point to themselves (like <code>BIKE_SHOP_WIDTH</code> above). No problem - we can only print lines with <code>;</code> in them using <code>grep</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -R "warp_to " ./ | awk -F"," '{ print $3; }' | grep ";"
ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B3F
ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_4F
CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_2F
CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_ELEVATOR
...
</code></pre>

<p>OK, almost done. Next, let's strip out the <code>_WIDTH</code> text and put in edge connections:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -R "warp_to " ./ | awk -F"," '{ print $3; }' | grep ";" | sed -e "s/_WIDTH//" | sed -e "s/;/--/"
 ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F -- ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B3F
 ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F -- ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
 ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F -- ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
 CELADON_MART_3F -- CELADON_MART_4F
 CELADON_MART_3F -- CELADON_MART_2F
 CELADON_MART_3F -- CELADON_MART_ELEVATOR
...
</code></pre>

<p>(note the leading space here - not a big deal for the Graphviz tools)</p>

<p>Now, we'll put this all into a <code>pokemon_rb_all.dot</code> file (along with the connections from <code>pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes.dot</code>) to make a graph of all of the locations in Pokémon Red and Blue. For this invocation, I also used <code>neato</code>:</p>

<pre><code>neato -Tpdf pokemon_rb_all.dot &gt; pokemon_rb_all.pdf
</code></pre>

<p>This graph is so cool! Check it out:</p>

<p><img src="http://peterhajas.com/media/pokemon_rb_all_preview.jpeg" alt="A graph visualizing all locations in Pokémon Red and Blue">
(<a href="http://peterhajas.com/media/pokemon_rb_all.pdf">PDF file here</a>, <a href="http://peterhajas.com/media/pokemon_rb_all.dot">dot file here</a>)</p>

<p>There are so many sections of this graph with interesting details, like Victory Road leading into the Indigo Plateau and Elite Four:</p>

<p><img src="http://peterhajas.com/media/pokemon_rb_all_e4.jpeg" alt="A cropped version of the &quot;all locations&quot; graph showing just Victory Road, the Indigo Plateau, and the Elite Four sections of the graph"></p>

<p>Or the maze-like Silph Company building:</p>

<p><img src="http://peterhajas.com/media/pokemon_rb_all_silph.jpeg" alt="A cropped version of the &quot;all locations&quot; graph showing just the Silph Company building floors"></p>

<p>I think it's really cool how easy it is to use simple tools to see these games from a new angle. I hope to look at other aspects of these games sometime in the future.</p>

<p>I've submitted a paper to one of the well-reputable journals and received two reviews asking for a revision. One of the reviews is on-topic and helpful. The other, however, I suspect was generated by an Al <em>based on the abstract only</em>. I don't want to debate the decision (the second reviewer is fair), but I wonder if I should mention my suspicions to the journal editor.</p>
<p>Should I? I doubt I can prove Al's use. All I have is a strong suspicion. Plus, I don't want to hurt my article. Yet, using Al for generating (not merely styling) reviews seems like such a bad practice that maybe it's worth letting the editor know.</p>
<p>My suspicions are based on several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the style is a bit off. The review consists only of very long questions like: "In terms of the paper's stated goal of contributing to the literature, how well does it provide [contribution mentioned in abstract] for [use-case mentioned in abstract]?". There are no suggestions, no feedback, and no statements. It's only broad questions suspiciously rephrasing each line of the abstract (and heavily re-using entire phrases from it).</li>
<li>Second, the list of suggested articles is strange and includes existing papers (only names) from irrelevant fields.</li>
<li>Third, out of curiosity, I've run the text via several online "detect AL" tools, and all of them conclude it's Al. It's not valid proof, just a fun point.</li>

<p>I think you should contact the editor with basically the same content as your post here: explain why you think the review could be AI generated, including the limitations of each point of evidence. I think most editors see their job as letting reviewers guide their decision rather than reviewing the reviews, so I would start from the assumption that the editor would not have considered checking the reviews for suspicion of gen AI.</p>
<p>Explain why you think this is concerning, which I think at minimum would include the integrity of the peer review process (you and your colleagues are expecting papers to be reviewed by humans, not AI) and the protection of your intellectual property (having an AI review your paper involves inserting your work into a 3rd party tool which may incorporate it into the training data and is a definite breach of the confidentiality that reviewers are sworn to). I would check the journal's website to see if they have an explicit statement about use of AI in peer review; if so, you can refer to that as well.</p>
<p>Finally, make clear that you're not protesting the decision for a revision and plan to work on revising and resubmitting your paper. I'd include a note thanking the editor and the reviewers for their time.</p>
<p>From there, let the editor decide what should be done next; it's their call, your only duty here is to raise their awareness. It's possible they'll want to bring in another reviewer. It's also possible they'll decide it's okay. At that point you'll have to decide whether you're satisfied with their effort and whether that affects your opinion of the journal as an appropriate place to submit your work.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> in response to discussions here.</p>
<p>I think my answer is wrong. @BriahKrause and @Buffy and @leonos are right. The OP should contact the editor immediately.</p>
<p>Leaving this post up so the back and forth is visible.</p>
<hr>
<p>Interesting puzzle.</p>
<p>Since the (possibly AI prepared) review is generally positive, treat it as if it were legitimate. Since the reviewer asks for no changes you need not argue about whether they are appropriate. If any of the suggested references are in fact relevant, include them.</p>
<p>After the paper is accepted you could contact the editor to voice your suspicions, with whatever supporting evidence you have.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> after reading @BrianKrause 's answer.</p>
<p>Clearly you will revise your manuscript in response to the good suggestions from the unquestionably legitimate review. If you think the work would benefit from a second good review then you should tell the editor now about your suspicions.</p>

<p>I don't think that's a relevant criteria.
Whether the review is useful is a more important criteria.</p>
<p>You could focus on the lack of constructive feedback or how the comments seemed to closely align with your abstract without offering substantial insights or suggestions for improvement.</p>

  <p data-block-key="ulgua">In the past, scientists searched for novel crystal structures by tweaking known crystals or experimenting with new combinations of elements - an expensive, trial-and-error process that could take months to deliver even limited results. Over the last decade, computational approaches led by <a href="https://materialsproject.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Materials Project</a> and other groups have helped discover 28,000 new materials. But up until now, new AI-guided approaches hit a fundamental limit in their ability to accurately predict materials that could be experimentally viable. GNoME’s discovery of 2.2 million materials would be equivalent to about 800 years’ worth of knowledge and demonstrates an unprecedented scale and level of accuracy in predictions.</p><p data-block-key="c4h6v">For example, 52,000 new layered compounds similar to graphene that have the potential to revolutionize electronics with the development of superconductors. Previously, about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28191965/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1,000 such materials had been identified</a>. We also found 528 potential lithium ion conductors, 25 times more than a <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/ee/c6ee02697d" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous study</a>, which could be used to improve the performance of rechargeable batteries.</p><p data-block-key="bh153">We are releasing the predicted structures for 380,000 materials that have the highest chance of successfully being made in the lab and being used in viable applications. For a material to be considered stable, it must not decompose into similar compositions with lower energy. For example, carbon in a graphene-like structure is stable compared to carbon in diamonds. Mathematically, these materials lie on the convex hull. This project discovered 2.2 million new crystals that are stable by current scientific standards and lie below the convex hull of previous discoveries. Of these, 380,000 are considered the most stable, and lie on the “final” convex hull – the new standard we have set for materials stability.<br></p><h2 data-block-key="a60kf">GNoME: Harnessing graph networks for materials exploration</h2>

We used GNoME to generate novel candidate crystals, and also to predict their stability. To assess our model’s predictive power during progressive training cycles, we repeatedly checked its performance using established computational techniques known as Density Functional Theory (DFT), used in physics, chemistry and materials science to understand structures of atoms, which is important to assess the stability of crystals.</p><p data-block-key="1v2m6">We used a training process called ‘active learning’ that dramatically boosted GNoME’s performance.

<p dir="auto">jaq (pronounced like <em>Jacques</em><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-jacques-ae9996a28418554354c9e349ca982c3b" id="user-content-fnref-jacques-ae9996a28418554354c9e349ca982c3b" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>) is a clone of the JSON data processing tool <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/" rel="nofollow">jq</a>.
jaq aims to support a large subset of jq's syntax and operations.</p>
<p dir="auto">jaq focuses on three goals:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Correctness</strong>:
jaq aims to provide a more correct and predictable implementation of jq,
while preserving compatibility with jq in most cases.</p>
<details><summary>Examples of surprising jq behaviour</summary>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>nan &gt; nan</code> is false, while <code>nan &lt; nan</code> is true.</li>
<li><code>[[]] | implode</code> crashes jq, and this was not fixed at the time of writing despite
<a href="https://github.com/jqlang/jq/issues/1160" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/jqlang/jq/issues/1160/hovercard">being known since five years</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/v1.6/" rel="nofollow">jq manual</a> claims that <code>limit(n; exp)</code> "extracts up to <code>n</code> outputs from <code>exp</code>".
This holds for values of <code>n &gt; 1</code>, e.g. <code>jq -n '[limit(2; 1, 2, 3)]'</code> yields
<code>[1, 2]</code>, but when <code>n == 0</code>, <code>jq -n '[limit(0; 1, 2, 3)]'</code> yields <code>[1]</code> instead of <code>[]</code>.
And perhaps even worse, when <code>n &lt; 0</code>, then <code>limit</code> yields <em>all</em> outputs from <code>exp</code>,
which is not documented.</li>
</ul>
</details>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Performance</strong>:
I created jaq originally because I was bothered by
<a href="https://github.com/jqlang/jq/issues/1411" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/jqlang/jq/issues/1411/hovercard">jq's long start-up time</a>,
which amounts to about 50ms on my machine.
This can particularly show when processing a large number of small files.
jaq starts up about 30 times faster than jq 1.6 and
<a href="#performance">outperforms jq also on many other benchmarks</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Simplicity</strong>:
jaq aims to have a simple and small implementation, in order to
reduce the potential for bugs and to
facilitate contributions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I drew inspiration from another Rust program, namely <a href="https://github.com/yamafaktory/jql">jql</a>.
However, unlike jql, jaq aims to closely imitate jq's syntax and semantics.
This should allow users proficient in jq to easily use jaq.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">From Source</h2>
<p dir="auto">To compile jaq, you need a Rust toolchain.
See <a href="https://rustup.rs/" rel="nofollow">https://rustup.rs/</a> for instructions.
(Note that Rust compilers shipped with Linux distributions
may be too outdated to compile jaq.)</p>
<p dir="auto">Any of the following commands install jaq:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cargo install --locked jaq
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/01mf02/jaq # latest development version"><pre><code>$ cargo install --locked jaq
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/01mf02/jaq # latest development version
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">On my system, both commands place the executable at <code>~/.cargo/bin/jaq</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have cloned this repository, you can also build jaq by executing one of the commands in the cloned repository:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cargo build --release # places binary into target/release/jaq
$ cargo install --locked --path jaq # installs binary"><pre><code>$ cargo build --release # places binary into target/release/jaq
$ cargo install --locked --path jaq # installs binary
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">jaq should work on any system supported by Rust.
If it does not, please file an issue.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Binaries</h2>
<p dir="auto">You may also install jaq using <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jaq" rel="nofollow">homebrew</a> on macOS or Linux:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ brew install jaq
$ brew install --HEAD jaq # latest development version"><pre><code>$ brew install jaq
$ brew install --HEAD jaq # latest development version
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2>
<p dir="auto">The following examples should give an impression of what jaq can currently do.
You should obtain the same outputs by replacing jaq with jq.
If not, your filing an issue would be appreciated. :)
The syntax is documented in the <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/v1.6/" rel="nofollow">jq manual</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Access a field:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ echo '{&quot;a&quot;: 1, &quot;b&quot;: 2}' | jaq '.a'
1"><pre><code>$ echo '{"a": 1, "b": 2}' | jaq '.a'
1
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Add values:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ echo '{&quot;a&quot;: 1, &quot;b&quot;: 2}' | jaq 'add'
3"><pre><code>$ echo '{"a": 1, "b": 2}' | jaq 'add'
3
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Construct an array from an object in two ways and show that they are equal:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ echo '{&quot;a&quot;: 1, &quot;b&quot;: 2}' | jaq '[.a, .b] == [.[]]'
true"><pre><code>$ echo '{"a": 1, "b": 2}' | jaq '[.a, .b] == [.[]]'
true
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Apply a filter to all elements of an array and filter the results:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ echo '[0, 1, 2, 3]' | jaq 'map(.*2) | [.[] | select(. < 5)]'
[0, 2, 4]"><pre><code>$ echo '[0, 1, 2, 3]' | jaq 'map(.*2) | [.[] | select(. &lt; 5)]'
[0, 2, 4]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Read (slurp) input values into an array and get the average of its elements:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ echo '1 2 3 4' | jaq -s 'add / length'
2.5"><pre><code>$ echo '1 2 3 4' | jaq -s 'add / length'
2.5
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Repeatedly apply a filter to itself and output the intermediate results:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ echo '0' | jaq '[recurse(.+1; . < 3)]'
[0, 1, 2]"><pre><code>$ echo '0' | jaq '[recurse(.+1; . &lt; 3)]'
[0, 1, 2]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Lazily fold over inputs and output intermediate results:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ seq 1000 | jaq -n 'foreach inputs as $x (0; . + $x)'
1 3 6 10 15 [...]"><pre><code>$ seq 1000 | jaq -n 'foreach inputs as $x (0; . + $x)'
1 3 6 10 15 [...]
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h2>
<p dir="auto">The following evaluation consists of several benchmarks that
allow comparing the performance of jaq, jq, and <a href="https://github.com/itchyny/gojq">gojq</a>.
The <code>empty</code> benchmark runs <code>n</code> times the filter <code>empty</code> with null input,
serving to measure the startup time.
The <code>bf-fib</code> benchmark runs a Brainfuck interpreter written in jq,
interpreting a Brainfuck script that produces <code>n</code> Fibonacci numbers.
The other benchmarks evaluate various filters with <code>n</code> as input;
see <a href="https://github.com/01mf02/jaq/blob/main/bench.sh"><code>bench.sh</code></a> for details.</p>
<p dir="auto">I generated the benchmark data with
<code>bench.sh target/release/jaq jq-1.7 gojq-0.12.13 jq-1.6 | tee bench.json</code>
on a Linux system with an AMD Ryzen 5 5500U.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-binaries-ae9996a28418554354c9e349ca982c3b" id="user-content-fnref-binaries-ae9996a28418554354c9e349ca982c3b" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>
I then processed the results with a "one-liner" (stretching the term and the line a bit):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="jq -rs '.[] | &quot;|`\(.name)`|\(.n)|&quot; + ([.time[] | min | (.*1000|round)? // &quot;N/A&quot;] | min as $total_min | map(if . == $total_min then &quot;**\(.)**&quot; else &quot;\(.)&quot; end) | join(&quot;|&quot;))' bench.json"><pre><code>jq -rs '.[] | "|`\(.name)`|\(.n)|" + ([.time[] | min | (.*1000|round)? // "N/A"] | min as $total_min | map(if . == $total_min then "**\(.)**" else "\(.)" end) | join("|"))' bench.json
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">(Of course, you can also use jaq here instead of jq.)
Finally, I concatenated the table header with the output and piped it through <code>pandoc -t gfm</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The results show that
jaq-1.2 is fastest on 16 benchmarks, whereas
jq-1.7 is fastest on 2 benchmarks and
gojq-0.12.13 is fastest on 1 benchmark.
gojq is much faster on <code>tree-flatten</code> because it implements the filter <code>flatten</code> natively instead of by definition.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Advanced features</h2>
<p dir="auto">jaq currently does <em>not</em> aim to support several features of jq, such as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Modules</li>
<li>SQL-style operators</li>
<li>Streaming</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Differences between jq and jaq</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Numbers</h2>
<p dir="auto">jq uses 64-bit floating-point numbers (floats) for any number.
By contrast, jaq interprets
numbers such as 0   or -42 as machine-sized integers and
numbers such as 0.0 or 3e8 as 64-bit floats.
Many operations in jaq, such as array indexing,
check whether the passed numbers are indeed integer.
The motivation behind this is to avoid
rounding errors that may silently lead to wrong results.
For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ jq  -n '[0, 1, 2] | .[1.0000000000000001]'
1
$ jaq -n '[0, 1, 2] | .[1.0000000000000001]'
Error: cannot use 1.0 as integer
$ jaq -n '[0, 1, 2] | .[1]'
1"><pre><code>$ jq  -n '[0, 1, 2] | .[1.0000000000000001]'
1
$ jaq -n '[0, 1, 2] | .[1.0000000000000001]'
Error: cannot use 1.0 as integer
$ jaq -n '[0, 1, 2] | .[1]'
1
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The rules of jaq are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The sum, difference, product, and remainder of two integers is integer.</li>
<li>Any other operation between two numbers yields a float.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Examples:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ jaq -n '1 + 2'
3
$ jaq -n '10 / 2'
5.0
$ jaq -n '1.0 + 2'
3.0"><pre><code>$ jaq -n '1 + 2'
3
$ jaq -n '10 / 2'
5.0
$ jaq -n '1.0 + 2'
3.0
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can convert an integer to a floating-point number e.g.
by adding 0.0, by multiplying with 1.0, or by dividing with 1.
You can convert a floating-point number to an integer by
<code>round</code>, <code>floor</code>, or <code>ceil</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ jaq -n '1.2 | [floor, round, ceil]'
[1, 1, 2]"><pre><code>$ jaq -n '1.2 | [floor, round, ceil]'
[1, 1, 2]
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">NaN and infinity</h3>
<p dir="auto">In jq, division by 0 has some surprising properties; for example,
<code>0 / 0</code> yields <code>nan</code>, whereas
<code>0 as $n | $n / 0</code> yields an error.
In jaq, <code>n / 0</code> yields <code>nan</code> if <code>n == 0</code>, <code>infinite</code> if <code>n &gt; 0</code>, and <code>-infinite</code> if <code>n &lt; 0</code>.
jaq's behaviour is closer to the IEEE standard for floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754).</p>
<p dir="auto">jaq implements a total ordering on floating-point numbers to allow sorting values.
Therefore, it unfortunately has to enforce that <code>nan == nan</code>.
(jq gets around this by enforcing <code>nan &lt; nan</code>, which breaks basic laws about total orders.)</p>
<p dir="auto">Like jq, jaq prints <code>nan</code> and <code>infinite</code> as <code>null</code> in JSON,
because JSON does not support encoding these values as numbers.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Preservation of fractional numbers</h3>
<p dir="auto">jaq preserves fractional numbers coming from JSON data perfectly
(as long as they are not used in some arithmetic operation),
whereas jq 1.6 may silently convert to 64-bit floating-point numbers:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ echo '1e500' | jq '.'
1.7976931348623157e+308
$ echo '1e500' | jaq '.'
1e500"><pre><code>$ echo '1e500' | jq '.'
1.7976931348623157e+308
$ echo '1e500' | jaq '.'
1e500
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Therefore, unlike jq 1.6, jaq satisfies the following paragraph in the <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/v1.6/" rel="nofollow">jq manual</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">An important point about the identity filter is that
it guarantees to preserve the literal decimal representation of values.
This is particularly important when dealing with numbers which can't be
losslessly converted to an IEEE754 double precision representation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Please note that newer versions of jq, e.g. 1.7,
seem to preserve the literal decimal representation as well.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Assignments</h2>
<p dir="auto">Like jq, jaq allows for assignments of the form <code>p |= f</code>.
However, jaq interprets these assignments differently.
Fortunately, in most cases, the result is the same.</p>
<p dir="auto">In jq, an assignment <code>p |= f</code> first constructs paths to all values that match <code>p</code>.
<em>Only then</em>, it applies the filter <code>f</code> to these values.</p>
<p dir="auto">In jaq, an assignment <code>p |= f</code> applies <code>f</code> <em>immediately</em> to any value matching <code>p</code>.
Unlike in jq, assignment does not explicitly construct paths.</p>
<p dir="auto">jaq's implementation of assignment likely yields higher performance,
because it does not construct paths.
Furthermore, this also prevents several bugs in jq "by design".
For example, given the filter <code>[0, 1, 2, 3] | .[] |= empty</code>,
jq  yields <code>[1, 3]</code>, whereas
jaq yields <code>[]</code>.
What happens here?</p>
<p dir="auto">jq first constructs the paths corresponding to <code>.[]</code>, which are <code>.0, .1, .2, .3</code>.
Then, it removes the element at each of these paths.
However, each of these removals <em>changes</em> the value that the remaining paths refer to.
That is, after removing <code>.0</code> (value 0), <code>.1</code> does not refer to value 1, but value 2!
That is also why value 1 (and in consequence also value 3) is not removed.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is more weirdness ahead in jq;
for example, <code>0 | 0 |= .+1</code> yields <code>1</code> in jq,
although <code>0</code> is not a valid path expression.
However, <code>1 | 0 |= .+1</code> yields an error.
In jaq, any such assignment yields an error.</p>
<p dir="auto">jaq attempts to use multiple outputs of the right-hand side, whereas
jq uses only the first.
For example, <code>0 | (., .) |= (., .+1)</code> yields <code>0 1 1 2</code> in jaq,
whereas it yields only <code>0</code> in jq.
However, <code>{a: 1} | .a |= (2, 3)</code> yields <code>{"a": 2}</code> in both jaq and jq,
because an object can only associate a single value with any given key,
so we cannot use multiple outputs in a meaningful way here.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because jaq does not construct paths,
it does not allow some filters on the left-hand side of assignments,
for example <code>first</code>, <code>last</code>, <code>limit</code>:
For example, <code>[1, 2, 3] | first(.[]) |= .-1</code>
yields <code>[0, 2, 3]</code> in jq, but is invalid in jaq.
Similarly, <code>[1, 2, 3] | limit(2; .[]) |= .-1</code>
yields <code>[0, 1, 3]</code> in jq, but is invalid in jaq.
(Inconsequentially, jq also does not allow for <code>last</code>.)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Definitions</h2>
<p dir="auto">Like jq, jaq allows for the definition of filters, such as:</p>

<p dir="auto">Arguments can also be passed <em>by value</em>, such as:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="def cartesian($f; $g): [$f, $g];"><pre><code>def cartesian($f; $g): [$f, $g];
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Filter definitions can be nested and recursive, i.e. refer to themselves.
That is, a filter such as <code>recurse</code> can be defined in jaq:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="def recurse(f): def r: ., (f | r); r;"><pre><code>def recurse(f): def r: ., (f | r); r;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Since jaq 1.2, jaq optimises tail calls, like jq.
Since jaq 1.1, recursive filters can also have non-variable arguments, like in jq.
For example:</p>

<p dir="auto">Recursive filters with non-variable arguments can yield surprising effects;
for example, a call <code>f(0)</code> builds up calls of the shape <code>f(1+(..(1+0)...))</code>,
which leads to exponential execution times.</p>
<p dir="auto">Recursive filters with non-variable arguments can
very frequently be alternatively implemented by either:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A nested filter: for example, instead of
<code>def walk(f): (.[]? |= walk(f)) | f;</code>, you can use
<code>def walk(f): def rec: (.[]? |= rec) | f; rec;</code>.</li>
<li>A filter with variable arguments: for example, instead of
<code>def f(a): a, f(1+a);</code>, you can equally well write
<code>def f($a): $a, f(1+$a);</code>.</li>
<li>A filter with <code>recurse</code>: for example, you may write
<code>def f(a): a | recurse(1+.);</code>.
If you expect your filter to recurse deeply,
it is advised to implement it using <code>recurse</code>,
because jaq has an optimised implementation of <code>recurse</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All of these options are supported by jaq.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Arguments</h2>
<p dir="auto">Like jq, jaq allows to define arguments via the command line,
in particular by the options <code>--arg</code>, <code>--rawfile</code>, <code>--slurpfile</code>.
This binds variables to values, and
for every variable <code>$x</code> bound to <code>v</code> this way,
<code>$ARGS.named</code> contains an entry with key <code>x</code> and value <code>v</code>.
For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ jaq -n --arg x 1 --arg y 2 '$x, $y, $ARGS.named'
&quot;1&quot;
&quot;2&quot;
{
  &quot;x&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,
  &quot;y&quot;: &quot;2&quot;
}"><pre><code>$ jaq -n --arg x 1 --arg y 2 '$x, $y, $ARGS.named'
"1"
"2"
{
  "x": "1",
  "y": "2"
}
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Folding</h2>
<p dir="auto">jq and jaq provide filters
<code>reduce xs as $x (init; f)</code> and
<code>foreach xs as $x (init; f)</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In jaq, the output of these filters is defined very simply:
Assuming that <code>xs</code> evaluates to <code>x0</code>, <code>x1</code>, ..., <code>xn</code>,
<code>reduce xs as $x (init; f)</code> evaluates to</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="init
| x0 as $x | f
| ...
| xn as $x | f"><pre><code>init
| x0 as $x | f
| ...
| xn as $x | f
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">and <code>foreach xs as $x (init; f)</code> evaluates to</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="init
| x0 as $x | f | (.,
| ...
| xn as $x | f | (.,
empty)...)"><pre lang="text"><code>init
| x0 as $x | f | (.,
| ...
| xn as $x | f | (.,
empty)...)
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, jaq provides the filter <code>for xs as $x (init; f)</code> that evaluates to</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="init
| ., (x0 as $x | f
| ...
| ., (xn as $x | f
)...)"><pre lang="text"><code>init
| ., (x0 as $x | f
| ...
| ., (xn as $x | f
)...)
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The difference between <code>foreach</code> and <code>for</code> is that
<code>for</code> yields the output of <code>init</code>, whereas <code>foreach</code> omits it.
For example,
<code>foreach (1, 2, 3) as $x (0; .+$x)</code> yields <code>1, 3, 6</code>, whereas
<code>for (1, 2, 3) as $x (0; .+$x)</code> yields <code>0, 1, 3, 6</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The interpretation of <code>reduce</code>/<code>foreach</code> in jaq has the following advantages over jq:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It deals very naturally with filters that yield multiple outputs.
In contrast, jq discriminates outputs of <code>f</code>,
because it recurses only on the last of them,
although it outputs all of them.
<details><summary>Example</summary>
`foreach (5, 10) as $x (1; .+$x, -.)` yields
`6, -1, 9, 1` in jq, whereas it yields
`6, 16, -6, -1, 9, 1` in jaq.
We can see that both jq and jaq yield the values `6` and `-1`
resulting from the first iteration (where `$x` is 5), namely
`1 | 5 as $x | (.+$x, -.)`.
However, jq performs the second iteration (where `$x` is 10)
*only on the last value* returned from the first iteration, namely `-1`,
yielding the values `9` and `1` resulting from
`-1 | 10 as $x | (.+$x, -.)`.
jaq yields these values too, but it also performs the second iteration
on all other values returned from the first iteration, namely `6`,
yielding the values `16` and `-6` that result from
` 6 | 10 as $x | (.+$x, -.)`.
</details>
</li>
<li>It makes the implementation of <code>reduce</code> and <code>foreach</code>
special cases of the same code, reducing the potential for bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Compared to <code>foreach ...</code>, the filter <code>for ...</code>
(where <code>...</code> refers to <code>xs as $x (init; f)</code>)
has a stronger relationship with <code>reduce</code>.
In particular,
the values yielded by <code>reduce ...</code> are a subset of
the values yielded by <code>for ...</code>.
This does not hold if you replace <code>for</code> by <code>foreach</code>.</p>
<details>
As an example, if we set `...` to `empty as $x (0; .+$x)`, then
`foreach ...` yields no value, whereas
`for ...` and `reduce ...` yield `0`.
</details>
<p dir="auto">Furthermore, jq provides the filter
<code>foreach xs as $x (init; f; proj)</code> (<code>foreach/3</code>) and interprets
<code>foreach xs as $x (init; f)</code> (<code>foreach/2</code>) as
<code>foreach xs as $x (init; f; .)</code>, whereas
jaq does <em>not</em> provide <code>foreach/3</code> because
it requires completely separate logic from <code>foreach/2</code> and <code>reduce</code>
in both the parser and the interpreter.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Error handling</h2>
<p dir="auto">In jq, the <code>try f catch g</code> expression breaks out of the <code>f</code> stream as
soon as an error occurs, ceding control to <code>g</code> after that. This is
mentioned in its manual as a possible mechanism for breaking out of
loops
(<a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/#breaking-out-of-control-structures" rel="nofollow">here</a>). jaq
however doesn't interrupt the <code>f</code> stream, but instead sends <em>each</em>
error value emitted to the <code>g</code> filter; the result is a stream of
values emitted from <code>f</code> with values emitted from <code>g</code> interspersed
where errors occurred.</p>
<p dir="auto">Consider the following example: this expression is <code>true</code> in jq,
because the first <code>error(2)</code> interrupts the stream:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[try (1, error(2), 3, error(4)) catch .] == [1, 2]"><pre>[<span>try</span> (<span>1</span>, <span>error</span>(<span>2</span>), <span>3</span>, <span>error</span>(<span>4</span>)) <span>catch</span> <span>.</span>] <span>==</span> [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In jaq however, this holds:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[try (1, error(2), 3, error(4)) catch .] == [1, 2, 3, 4]"><pre>[<span>try</span> (<span>1</span>, <span>error</span>(<span>2</span>), <span>3</span>, <span>error</span>(<span>4</span>)) <span>catch</span> <span>.</span>] <span>==</span> [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>]</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Slurping: When files are slurped in (via the <code>-s</code> / <code>--slurp</code> option),
jq combines the inputs of all files into one single array, whereas
jaq yields an array for every file.
The behaviour of jq can be approximated in jaq;
for example, to achieve the output of
<code>jq -s . a b</code>, you may use
<code>jaq -s . &lt;(cat a b)</code>.</li>
<li>Cartesian products:
In jq, <code>[(1,2) * (3,4)]</code> yields <code>[3, 6, 4, 8]</code>, whereas
<code>[{a: (1,2), b: (3,4)} | .a * .b]</code> yields <code>[3, 4, 6, 8]</code>.
jaq yields <code>[3, 4, 6, 8]</code> in both cases.</li>
<li>List updating:
In jq, <code>[0, 1] | .[3] = 3</code> yields <code>[0, 1, null, 3]</code>; that is,
jq fills up the list with <code>null</code>s if we update beyond its size.
In contrast, jaq fails with an out-of-bounds error in such a case.</li>
<li>Input reading:
When there is no more input value left,
in jq, <code>input</code> yields an error, whereas in jaq, it yields no output value.</li>
<li>Joining:
When given an array <code>[x0, x1, ..., xn]</code>,
in jq, <code>join(x)</code> converts all elements of the input array to strings and intersperses them with <code>x</code>, whereas
in jaq, <code>join(x)</code> simply calculates <code>x0 + x + x1 + x + ... + xn</code>.
When all elements of the input array and <code>x</code> are strings, jq and jaq yield the same output.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-deno-cron">Using Deno Cron</h2><p><a href="https://docs.deno.com/kv/manual/cron" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Deno.cron()</code></a> (available behind the
<code>--unstable</code> flag as of <a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.38" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.38</a>), is a function that takes three
parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code> , the name of your scheduled job</li>
<li><code>schedule</code> , which uses
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=task-unix-cron-format" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Unix cron format</a>
and where the time is in the UTC timezone</li>
<li><code>handler</code>, a function that is executed on the schedule provided</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike cron on UNIX/Linux, <strong>Deno Cron executions do not overlap</strong>. This means
that if you schedule something to run every 10 minutes, but the task takes 30
minutes to complete, Deno Cron automatically skips the next scheduled run until
the task is complete. Overlapping cron jobs can lead to unintended issues and
requires extra tedious logic to avoid, but Deno Cron side steps that completely.</p>
<p>We’re also working to
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/21340" rel="noopener noreferrer">support a JavaScript friendly API for specifying the cron schedule</a>.</p>
<h2 id="deno-cron-on-deno-deploy">Deno Cron on Deno Deploy</h2><p>On <a href="https://deno.com/deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno Deploy</a>, our multi-tenant distributed serverless JavaScript
platform, <code>Deno.cron()</code> is automatically detected and managed so you don’t need
to worry about anything.</p>
<p><strong>You can run cron jobs without a web server</strong> or even consistent incoming
requests to keep your isolate alive. That’s because whenever your project is
deployed, Deno Deploy automatically detects your cron jobs and evaluates them.
When its time for your <code>handler</code> to run, Deno Deploy automatically spins up an
isolate on-demand to run them.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ve also added a <strong>new <code>Cron</code> tab in the Deno Deploy dashboard,</strong> which shows
all active cron jobs in your project:</p>

</figure>

<p>To modify or stop an existing cron, change your code and create a new
deployment. For example, if you remove a &nbsp;<code>Deno.cron</code>&nbsp;from your code&nbsp;and deploy
it, those jobs will no longer be scheduled to run.</p>
<p>Your Deno Cron handlers can perform all sorts of actions, such as updating state
in Deno KV, pinging a website, sending an email, initiating a database backup,
calling an API at regular intervals, and more.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-on-deno-deploy">How does it work on Deno Deploy?</h3><p>How exactly does Deno Deploy know there’s a <code>cron</code> in your code, even when
there’s no web server handling requests?</p>
<p>When a new production deployment of your project is created, an ephemeral V8
isolate is used to evaluate your project’s top-level scope and to discover any
<code>Deno.cron</code> definitions. A global cron scheduler is then updated with your
project’s latest cron definitions, which includes updates to your existing
crons, new crons, and deleted crons.</p>
<p>The global cron scheduler is a reliable service that’s responsible for
scheduling and dispatching cron jobs based on the specified schedule. During
dispatch, an on-demand v8 isolate is spun up to execute the job using the same
production deployment.</p>

<p>Using Deno Cron on Deno Deploy makes it simple to create cron jobs and host them
in the cloud without any configuration in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Don't let your resume be a roadblock from getting your next job. Use Resume Matcher!</strong></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does it work?</h2>
</div>
<p dir="auto">The Resume Matcher takes your resume and job descriptions as input, parses them using Python, and mimics the functionalities of an ATS, providing you with insights and suggestions to make your resume ATS-friendly.</p>
<p dir="auto">The process is as follows:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Parsing</strong>: The system uses Python to parse both your resume and the provided job description, just like an ATS would.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Keyword Extraction</strong>: The tool uses advanced machine learning algorithms to extract the most relevant keywords from the job description. These keywords represent the skills, qualifications, and experiences the employer seeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Key Terms Extraction</strong>: Beyond keyword extraction, the tool uses textacy to identify the main key terms or themes in the job description. This step helps in understanding the broader context of what the resume is about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Vector Similarity Using Qdrant</strong>: The tool uses <a href="https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant">Qdrant</a>, a highly efficient vector similarity search tool, to measure how closely your resume matches the job description. The more similar they are, the higher the likelihood that your resume will pass the ATS screening.</p>

<p><br>Just as the wheels touched down on Virgin Atlantic’s historic flight from London to New York yesterday, powered by a low-carbon fuel engine made by Rolls-Royce, the company has announced a new shift. Rolls-Royce CEO Tufan Erginbilgiç <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2023/28-11-2023-capital-markets-day.aspx">says</a> it’s time to sell off its electric jet engine unit and focus on other strategies – namely sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF.</p>



<p>Rolls-Royce, a flagship company in Britain, makes jet engines and systems on planes such as the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787. It was, like many companies, hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic when air travel was grounded, and Rolls-Royce cut 9,000 jobs as a result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/28/rolls-royce-tufan-erginbilgic/">“axeman”</a> Erginbilgiç took the helm, bringing an aggressive rethink to the company to save it while slashing divisions such as R2 Factory, an in-house artificial intelligence software unit, and a direct air carbon capture project. Last month, Rolls-Royce said it would cut 2,500 management and administration jobs.</p>



<div><p>The next head to roll is its electrical business, which develops propulsion systems for flying taxis and other aircraft. <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2023/28-11-2023-capital-markets-day.aspx">In an announcement yesterday</a>, Erginbilgiç said the company needed to make “choices on resource allocation” and that the electric business would offer “better value to a third party.”</p><p>It is all part of a sweeping effort to raise profits and to shift gears to reach its sustainability goals. Rolls-Royce has raised its target to bring in operating profits of between £2.5 billion and £2.8 billion a year, compared with £837 million in 2022. “Rolls-Royce is at a pivotal point in its history,” Erginbilgiç said on Tuesday. “We are creating a high-performing, competitive, resilient, and growing Rolls-Royce that will have the financial strength to control and shape its own destiny.”</p><p>The company intends to move away from developing electric engines for air taxis and smaller aircraft to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/28/rolls-royce-sell-electric-flight-division-jet-engines-tufan-erginbilgic">“double down” on its jet-fuel-burning engines</a> for passenger planes to keep the business in good position, reports <em>The Guardian</em>. Hopes of decarbonizing its products will be dependent on sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF. </p></div>



<div><p>While the company is also working on hydrogen technology with EasyJet, <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2023/28-11-2023-capital-markets-day.aspx">Erginbilgiç says</a> he believes that hydrogen is a long way off from being a viable solution for long-haul flights and that sustainable aviation fuels will be the way forward for aviation to achieve net-zero climate goals. Airbus, however, is working toward having hydrogen-powered planes in service by 2035.</p><p>Rolls-Royce said it will invest the money it gains from selling the electric unit and other businesses into its next-gen UltraFan engine, an enormous aviation engine technology demonstrator designed to burn less fuel. </p><p>The company says it is working to become <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2023/13-11-2023-poweroftrent-rr-successfully-completes-100-sustainable-aviation-fuel-test-programme.aspx">the first jet engine manufacturer</a> to confirm that all of its in-production engines for long-haul aircraft and business jets&nbsp;are compatible with 100% SAF. Rolls-Royce aims to become net zero by 2050. </p></div>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">errtrace is an <strong>experimental</strong> package to trace an error's return path —
the return trace — through a Go program.</p>
<p dir="auto">Where a stack trace tracks the code path that led to an error,
a return trace tracks the code path that the error took to get to the user.
Often these are the same path, but in Go they can diverge,
since errors are values that can be transported across goroutines
(e.g. with channels).
When that happens, a return trace can be more useful than a stack trace.</p>
<p dir="auto">This library is inspired by
<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/#Error-Return-Traces" rel="nofollow">Zig's error return traces</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Lightweight</strong><br>
errtrace brings no other runtime dependencies with it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#manual-instrumentation">Simple</a></strong><br>
The library API is simple, straightforward, and idiomatic.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#automatic-instrumentation">Easy</a></strong><br>
The errtrace CLI will automatically instrument your code.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#performance">Fast</a></strong><br>
On popular 64-bit systems,
errtrace is much faster than capturing a stack trace.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Try it out</h3>
<p dir="auto">Try out errtrace with your own code:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Install the CLI.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go install braces.dev/errtrace/cmd/errtrace@latest"><pre>go install braces.dev/errtrace/cmd/errtrace@latest</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Switch to your Git repository and instrument your code.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git ls-files -- '*.go' | xargs errtrace -w"><pre>git ls-files -- <span><span>'</span>*.go<span>'</span></span> <span>|</span> xargs errtrace -w</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Let <code>go mod tidy</code> install the errtrace Go module for you.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Run your tests to ensure everything still works.
You may see failures
if you're comparing errors with <code>==</code> on critical paths
or if you're type-casting errors directly.
See <a href="#error-wrapping">Error wrapping</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why is this useful?</h3>
<p dir="auto">In Go, <a href="https://go.dev/blog/errors-are-values" rel="nofollow">errors are values</a>.
This means that an error can be passed around like any other value.
You can store it in a struct, pass it through a channel, etc.
This level of flexibility is great,
but it can also make it difficult to track down the source of an error.
A stack trace stored in an error — recorded at the error site —
becomes less useful as the error moves through the program.
When it's eventually surfaced to the user,
we've lost a lot of context about its origin.</p>
<p dir="auto">With errtrace,
we instead record the path the program took from the error site
to get to the user — the <strong>return trace</strong>.
Not only can this be more useful than a stack trace,
it tends to be much faster and more lightweight as well.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Install errtrace with Go modules:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go get braces.dev/errtrace@latest"><pre>go get braces.dev/errtrace@latest</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you want to use the CLI, use <code>go install</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go install braces.dev/errtrace/cmd/errtrace@latest"><pre>go install braces.dev/errtrace/cmd/errtrace@latest</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">errtrace offers the following modes of usage:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="#manual-instrumentation">Manual instrumentation</a></li>

<p dir="auto">Under manual instrumentation,
you're expected to import errtrace,

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// ...
if err != nil {
    return errtrace.Wrap(err)
}"><pre><span>// ...</span>

</details>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Automatic instrumentation</h3>
<p dir="auto">If manual instrumentation is too much work (we agree),
we've included a tool that will automatically instrument
all your code with errtrace.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, <a href="#installation">install the tool</a>.
Then, run it on your code:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="errtrace -w path/to/file.go path/to/another/file.go"><pre>errtrace -w path/to/file.go path/to/another/file.go</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To run it on all Go files in your project,
if you use Git, run the following command on a Unix-like system:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git ls-files -- '*.go' | xargs errtrace -w"><pre>git ls-files -- <span><span>'</span>*.go<span>'</span></span> <span>|</span> xargs errtrace -w</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">errtrace can be set be setup as a custom formatter in your editor,
similar to gofmt or goimports.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Opting-out during automatic instrumentation</h4>
<p dir="auto">If you're relying on automatic instrumentation
and want to ignore specific lines from being instrumented,
you can add a comment in one of the following forms
on relevant lines:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="//errtrace:skip
//errtrace:skip explanation"><pre><span>//errtrace:skip</span>
<span>//errtrace:skip explanation</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This can be especially useful if the returned error
has to match another error exactly because the caller still uses <code>==</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, if you're implementing <code>io.Reader</code>,
you need to return <code>io.EOF</code> when you reach the end of the input.
Wrapping it will cause functions like <code>io.ReadAll</code> to misbehave.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type myReader struct{/* ... */}

func (*myReader) Read(bs []byte) (int, error) {
  // ...
  return 0, io.EOF //errtrace:skip (io.Reader requires io.EOF)
}"><pre><span>type</span> <span>myReader</span> <span>struct</span>{<span>/* ... */</span>}

<span>func</span> (<span>*</span><span>myReader</span>) <span>Read</span>(<span>bs</span> []<span>byte</span>) (<span>int</span>, <span>error</span>) {

<p dir="auto">Stack traces have a large initial cost,
while errtrace scales with each frame that an error is returned through.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caveats</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Error wrapping</h3>
<p dir="auto">errtrace operates by wrapping your errors to add caller information.
As a result of this,
error comparisons and type-casting may not work as expected.
You can no longer use <code>==</code> to compare errors, or type-cast them directly.
You must use the standard library's
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/errors#Is" rel="nofollow">errors.Is</a> and
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/errors#As" rel="nofollow">errors.As</a> functions.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, if you have a function <code>readFile</code>
that wraps an <code>io.EOF</code> error with errtrace:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Matching errors</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="err := readFile() // returns errtrace.Wrap(io.EOF)

// This will not work.
fmt.Println(err == io.EOF)          // false

// Use errors.Is instead.
fmt.Println(errors.Is(err, io.EOF)) // true"><pre><span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>readFile</span>() <span>// returns errtrace.Wrap(io.EOF)</span>

<span>// This will not work.</span>
<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>err</span> <span>==</span> <span>io</span>.<span>EOF</span>)          <span>// false</span>

<span>// Use errors.Is instead.</span>
<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>errors</span>.<span>Is</span>(<span>err</span>, <span>io</span>.<span>EOF</span>)) <span>// true</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Similarly, if you have a function <code>runCmd</code>
that wraps an <code>exec.ExitError</code> error with errtrace:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Type-casting errors</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="err := runCmd() // returns errtrace.Wrap(&amp;exec.ExitError{...})

// This will not work.
exitErr, ok := err.(*exec.ExitError) // ok = false

// Use errors.As instead.
var exitErr *exec.ExitError
ok := errors.As(err, &amp;exitErr)       // ok = true"><pre><span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>runCmd</span>() <span>// returns errtrace.Wrap(&amp;exec.ExitError{...})</span>

<span>// This will not work.</span>
<span>exitErr</span>, <span>ok</span> <span>:=</span> <span>err</span>.(<span>*</span>exec.<span>ExitError</span>) <span>// ok = false</span>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Linting</h4>
<p dir="auto">You can use <a href="https://github.com/polyfloyd/go-errorlint">go-errorlint</a>
to find places in your code
where you're comparing errors with <code>==</code> instead of using <code>errors.Is</code>
or type-casting them directly instead of using <code>errors.As</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Safety</h3>
<p dir="auto">To achieve the performance above on <a href="#supported-systems">supported systems</a>,
errtrace makes use of unsafe operations using Go assembly
to read the caller information directly from the stack.
This is part of the reason why we have the disclaimer on top.</p>
<p dir="auto">errtrace includes an opt-in safe mode
that drops these unsafe operations in exchange for poorer performance.
To opt into safe mode,
use the <code>safe</code> build tag when compiling code that uses errtrace.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported systems</h4>
<p dir="auto">errtrace's unsafe operations are currently implemented
for <code>GOARCH=amd64</code> and <code>GOARCH=arm64</code> only.
Other systems are supported but they will use safe mode, which is slower.</p>
<p dir="auto">Contributions to support unsafe mode for other architectures are welcome.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>
