StandBy also displays full-screen Live Activities, Siri results, incoming calls, and larger notifications. With the Always-On display, StandBy stays on to show useful information, and with Night Mode, StandBy adapts to low light, so clocks, photos, and widgets take on a beautiful red tone.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>AirDrop makes it easier than ever to share with friends, family, and colleagues. NameDrop, a new AirDrop feature, lets users exchange contact information, including their Contact Poster, simply by bringing their iPhone devices together. With the same gesture, users can also share content or start SharePlay to listen to music, watch a movie, or play a game while in close proximity. And later this year, AirDrop will add the ability to continue transfers over the internet when a user steps out of AirDrop range.

                 <div>Autocorrect receives a comprehensive update with a new transformer language model, a state-of-the-art on-device machine learning language model for word prediction —&nbsp;improving the experience and accuracy for users every time they type. Sentence-level autocorrections can fix more types of grammatical mistakes, and the refreshed design better supports typing by temporarily underlining corrected words and allowing users to revert back with just a tap. Inline predictive text helps quickly finish sentences, while Dictation’s new speech recognition model brings improved accuracy.&nbsp;

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Journal is a new iPhone app that helps users reflect on everyday moments and special events in their lives. To help inspire a user’s journal entry, personalized suggestions can be intelligently curated from a user’s recent activity, such as photos, people, places, workouts, and more, and scheduled notifications can help build a journaling habit. With the ability to lock the app, the use of on-device processing, and end-to-end encryption, Journal is built to protect a user’s privacy and ensure no one — including Apple — can access a user’s entries. With the new Journaling Suggestions API, developers will be able to add journaling suggestions to their apps. The Journal app and Journaling Suggestions API will be available in a software update later this year.

<li>Profiles in <strong>Safari</strong> keep browsing — such as history, cookies, extensions, Tab Groups, and Favorites — separate for topics like work and personal. Private Browsing now locks when not in use and adds greater protection, both from trackers as a user browses, and from people who might have access to a user’s device.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li>For easier and more secure <strong>password and passkeys </strong>sharing, users can share passwords with a group of trusted contacts. Since sharing is through iCloud Keychain, it is end-to-end encrypted.</li>

                 <div><ul>
<li>The <strong>Health</strong> app offers new mental health features. Users can log their daily moods and momentary emotions; see what might be contributing to their state of mind; and easily access depression and anxiety assessments often used in clinics, plus resources available in their region. Additionally, increasing the distance the device is viewed from can help children lower their risk of myopia and gives adult users the opportunity to reduce digital eyestrain. Screen Distance in <strong>Screen Time</strong> uses the TrueDepth camera to encourage users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches from their face for an extended period of time.</li>

<li><strong>Apple Music</strong> adds SharePlay support in the car, making it possible for all passengers to easily control the music right from their own devices, even if they don’t have an Apple Music subscription. Crossfade smoothly transitions between songs, and later this year, users will be able to collaborate on playlists in Apple Music, making listening to music with friends easier than ever before.</li>

<li><strong>Privacy</strong> updates include Communication Safety expanding beyond Messages to help keep kids safe when sending and receiving content via AirDrop, Contact Posters, a FaceTime message, and when using the Photos picker to choose content to send. It also expands to cover video content in addition to still images. A new feature, Sensitive Content Warning, helps adult users avoid seeing unwanted nude images and videos. As with Communication Safety, all image and video processing for Sensitive Content Warning occurs on-device, so Apple does not get access to the content.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><span></span><a id="executive-summary-0"></a><strong>Executive summary</strong>&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><p>Microsoft’s AI research team, while publishing a bucket of open-source training data on GitHub, accidentally exposed 38 terabytes of additional private data — including a disk backup of two employees’ workstations.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The backup includes secrets, private keys, passwords, and over 30,000 internal Microsoft Teams messages.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The researchers shared their files using an Azure feature called SAS tokens, which allows you to share data from Azure Storage accounts.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The access level can be limited to specific files only; however, in this case, the link was configured to share the entire storage account — including another 38TB of private files.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This case is an example of the new risks organizations face when starting to leverage the power of AI more broadly, as more of their engineers now work with massive amounts of training data. As data scientists and engineers race to bring new AI solutions to production, the massive amounts of data they handle require additional security checks and safeguards.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><span></span><a id="introduction-and-microsoft-findings-2"></a><strong>Introduction and Microsoft findings</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>As part of the Wiz Research Team’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbHALyrxj0Y">ongoing work</a> on accidental exposure of cloud-hosted data, the team scanned the internet for misconfigured storage containers. In this process, we found a GitHub repository under the Microsoft organization named <code>robust-models-transfer</code>. The repository belongs to Microsoft’s AI research division, and its purpose is to provide open-source code and AI models for image recognition. Readers of the repository were instructed to download the models from an Azure Storage URL:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The exposed storage URL, taken from Microsoft’s GitHub repository</p><p>However, this URL allowed access to more than just open-source models. It was configured to grant permissions on the entire storage account, exposing additional private data by mistake.&nbsp;</p><p>Our scan shows that this account contained 38TB of additional data — including Microsoft employees’ personal computer backups. The backups contained sensitive personal data, including passwords to Microsoft services, secret keys, and over 30,000 internal Microsoft Teams messages from 359 Microsoft employees.&nbsp;</p><p>Exposed containers under the 'robustnessws4285631339' storage account </p><p>A small sample of sensitive files found on the computer backups</p><p>Redacted Teams conversation between two Microsoft employees</p><p>In addition to the overly permissive access scope, the token was also misconfigured to allow “full control” permissions instead of read-only. Meaning, not only could an attacker view all the files in the storage account, but they could delete and overwrite existing files as well.&nbsp;</p><p>This is particularly interesting considering the repository’s original purpose: providing AI models for use in training code. The repository instructs users to download a model data file from the SAS link and feed it into a script. The file’s format is <code>ckpt</code>, a format produced by the TensorFlow library. It’s formatted using Python’s <code>pickle</code> formatter, which is <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-pickle">prone to arbitrary code execution</a> by design. Meaning, an attacker could have injected malicious code into all the AI models in this storage account, and every user who trusts Microsoft’s GitHub repository would’ve been infected by it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, it’s important to note this storage account wasn’t directly exposed to the public; in fact, it was a private storage account. The Microsoft developers used an Azure mechanism called “SAS tokens”, which allows you to create a shareable link granting access to an Azure Storage account’s data — while upon inspection, the storage account would still seem completely private.&nbsp;</p><h2><span></span><a id="introduction-to-sas-tokens-16"></a><strong>Introduction to SAS tokens</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>In Azure, a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token is a signed URL that grants access to Azure Storage data. The access level can be customized by the user; the permissions range between read-only and full control, while the scope can be either a single file, a container, or an entire storage account. The expiry time is also completely customizable, allowing the user to create never-expiring access tokens. This granularity provides great agility for users, but it also creates the risk of granting too much access; in the most permissive case (as we’ve seen in Microsoft’s token above), the token can allow full control permissions, on the entire account, forever – essentially providing the same access level as the account key itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are 3 types of SAS tokens: Account SAS, Service SAS, and User Delegation SAS. In this blog we will focus on the most popular type – Account SAS tokens, which were also used in Microsoft’s repository.&nbsp;</p><p>Generating an Account SAS is a simple process. As can be seen in the screen below, the user configures the token’s scope, permissions, and expiry date, and generates the token. Behind the scenes, the browser downloads the account key from Azure, and signs the generated token with the key. This entire process is done on the client side; it’s not an Azure event, and the resulting token is not an Azure object.&nbsp;</p><p>Creating a high privilege non-expiring SAS token</p><p>Because of this, when a user creates a highly-permissive non-expiring token, there is no way for an administrator to know this token exists and where it circulates. Revoking a token is no easy task either — it requires rotating the account key that signed the token, rendering all other tokens signed by same key ineffective as well. These unique pitfalls make this service an easy target for attackers looking for exposed data.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the risk of accidental exposure, the service’s pitfalls make it an effective tool for attackers seeking to maintain persistency on compromised storage accounts. A recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/09/07/cloud-storage-security-whats-new-in-the-threat-matrix/#:~:text=Create%20SAS%20Token">Microsoft report</a> indicates that attackers are taking advantage of the service’s lack of monitoring capabilities in order to issue privileged SAS tokens as a backdoor. Since the issuance of the token is not documented anywhere, there is no way to know that it was issued and act against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><span></span><a id="sas-security-risks-24"></a><strong>SAS security risks</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>SAS tokens pose a security risk, as they allow sharing information with external unidentified identities. The risk can be examined from several angles: permissions, hygiene, management and monitoring.&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="permissions-27"></a><strong>Permissions</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>A SAS token can grant a very high access level to a storage account, whether through excessive permissions (like read, list, write or delete), or through wide access scopes that allow users to access adjacent storage containers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="hygiene-29"></a><strong>Hygiene</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>SAS tokens have an expiry problem — our scans and monitoring show organizations often use tokens with a very long (sometimes infinite) lifetime, as there is no upper limit on a token's expiry. This was the case with Microsoft’s token, which was valid until 2051.&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="management-and-monitoring-31"></a><strong>Management and monitoring</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Account SAS tokens are extremely hard to manage and revoke. There isn't any official way to keep track of these tokens within Azure, nor to monitor their issuance, which makes it difficult to know how many tokens have been issued and are in active use. The reason even issuance cannot be tracked is that SAS tokens are created on the client side, therefore it is not an an Azure tracked activity, and the generated token is not an Azure object. Because of this, even what appears to be a private storage account may potentially be widely exposed.&nbsp;</p><p>As for revocation, there isn't a way to revoke a singular Account SAS; the only solution is revoking the entire account key, which invalidates all the other tokens issued with the same key as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Monitoring the usage of SAS tokens is another challenge, as it requires enabling logging on each storage account separately. It can also be costly, as the pricing depends on the request volume of each storage account. &nbsp;</p><h2><span></span><a id="sas-security-recommendations-35"></a><strong>SAS security recommendations</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>SAS security can be&nbsp;significantly improved with the following recommendations.</p><h3><span></span><a id="management-37"></a><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Due to the lack of security and governance over Account SAS tokens, they should be considered as sensitive as the account key itself. Therefore, it is highly recommended to avoid using Account SAS for external sharing. Token creation mistakes can easily go unnoticed and expose sensitive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For external sharing, consider using a Service SAS with a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/define-stored-access-policy">Stored Access Policy</a>. This feature connects the SAS token to a server-side policy, providing the ability to manage policies and revoke them in a centralized manner.&nbsp;</p><p>If you need to share content in a time-limited manner, consider using a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/create-user-delegation-sas">User Delegation SAS</a>, since their expiry time is capped at 7 days. This feature connects the SAS token to Azure Active Directory’s identity management, providing control and visibility over the identity of the token’s creator and its users.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, we recommend creating dedicated storage accounts for external sharing, to ensure that the potential impact of an over-privileged token is limited to external data only.&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid SAS tokens completely, organizations will have to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/shared-key-authorization-prevent">disable SAS access</a> for each of their storage accounts separately. We recommend using a CSPM to track and enforce this as a policy.&nbsp;</p><p>Another solution to disable SAS token creation is by blocking access to the “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storagerp/storage-accounts/list-keys">list storage account keys</a>” operation in Azure (since new SAS tokens cannot be created without the key), then rotating the current account keys, to invalidate pre-existing SAS tokens. This approach would still allow creation of User Delegation SAS, since it relies on the user’s key instead of the account key.&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="monitorin-g-44"></a><strong>Monitorin</strong><strong><u>g</u></strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>To track active SAS token usage, you need to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/manage-storage-analytics-logs">enable Storage Analytics logs</a> for each of your storage accounts. The resulting logs will contain details of SAS token access, including the signing key and the permissions assigned. However, it should be noted that only actively used tokens will appear in the logs, and that enabling logging comes with extra charges — which might be costly for accounts with extensive activity.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-storage-monitoring-scenarios">Azure Metrics</a> can be used to monitor SAS tokens usage in storage accounts. By default, Azure records and aggregates storage account events up to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics#retention-of-metrics">93 days</a>. Utilizing Azure Metrics, users can look up SAS-authenticated requests, highlighting storage accounts with SAS tokens usage.&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="secret-scanning-47"></a><strong>Secret scanning</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>In addition, we recommend using secret scanning tools to detect leaked or over-privileged SAS tokens in artifacts and publicly exposed assets, such as mobile apps, websites, and GitHub repositories — as can be seen in the Microsoft case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For more information on cloud secret scanning, please check out our recent talk from the fwd:cloudsec 2023 conference, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbHALyrxj0Y">"Scanning the internet for external cloud exposures"</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3><span></span><a id="for-wiz-customers-50"></a><strong>For Wiz customers</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Wiz customers can leverage the Wiz secret scanning capabilities to identify SAS tokens in internal and external assets and explore their permissions. In addition, customers can use the Wiz CSPM to track storage accounts with SAS support.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Detect SAS tokens:</strong> use this <a href="https://app.wiz.io/graph#~(query~(type~(~'SECRET_DATA)~select~true~where~(presignedURL_type~(EQUALS~(~'PresignedURLTypeAzureSASToken)))~relationships~(~(type~(~(type~'PERMITS))~optional~true~with~(type~(~'STORAGE_ACCOUNT)~select~true))~(type~(~(type~'INSTANCE_OF~reverse~true))~with~(type~(~'SECRET_INSTANCE)~select~true~relationships~(~(type~(~(type~'CONTAINS~reverse~true))~with~(type~(~'CLOUD_RESOURCE)~select~true)))))))~view~'table~columns~(~(~'0~49)~(~'1~17)~(~'2~17)~(~'3~17)))">query</a> to surface all SAS tokens in all your monitored cloud environments.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Detect high-privilege SAS tokens:</strong> use the following <a href="https://app.wiz.io/graph#~(control~'wc-id-927~view~'table)">control</a> to detect highly-privileged SAS tokens located on publicly exposed workloads.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>CSPM rule for blocking SAS tokens:</strong> use the following <a href="https://app.wiz.io/graph#~(query~(type~(~'STORAGE_ACCOUNT)~select~true~relationships~(~(type~(~(type~'ALERTED_ON~reverse~true))~with~(type~(~'CONFIGURATION_FINDING)~select~true~where~(configurationRuleShortName~(EQUALS~(~'StorageAccount-026)))))~(type~(~(type~'CONTAINS~reverse~true))~optional~true~with~(type~(~'SUBSCRIPTION)~select~true)))))">Cloud Configuration Rule</a> to track storage accounts allowing SAS token usage.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><span></span><a id="security-risks-in-the-ai-pipeline-53"></a><strong>Security risks in the AI pipeline</strong></h2><p>As companies embrace AI more widely, it is important for security teams to understand the inherent security risks at each stage of the AI development process.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident detailed in this blog is an example of two of these risks.&nbsp;</p><p>The first is <strong>oversharing of data</strong>.<strong> </strong>Researchers collect and share massive amounts of external and internal data to construct the required training information for their AI models. This poses inherent security risks tied to high-scale data sharing. It is crucial for security teams to define clear guidelines for external sharing of AI datasets. As we’ve seen in this case, separating the public AI data set to a dedicated storage account could’ve limited the exposure.&nbsp;</p><p>The second is the risk of <strong>supply chain attacks</strong>. Due to improper permissions, the public token granted write access to the storage account containing the AI models. As noted above, injecting malicious code into the model files could’ve led to a supply chain attack on other researchers who use the repository’s models. Security teams should review and sanitize AI models from external sources, since they can be used as a remote code execution vector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><span></span><a id="takeaways-59"></a><strong>Takeaways&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>The simple step of sharing an AI dataset led to a major data leak, containing over 38TB of private data. The root cause was the usage of Account SAS tokens as the sharing mechanism. Due to a lack of monitoring and governance, SAS tokens pose a security risk, and their usage should be as limited as possible. These tokens are very hard to track, as Microsoft does not provide a centralized way to manage them within the Azure portal. In addition, these tokens can be configured to last effectively forever, with no upper limit on their expiry time. Therefore, using Account SAS tokens for external sharing is unsafe and should be avoided.&nbsp;</p><p>In the wider scope, similar incidents can be prevented by granting security teams more visibility into the processes of AI research and development teams. As we see wider adoption of AI models within companies, it’s important to raise awareness of relevant security risks at every step of the AI development process, and make sure the security team works closely with the data science and research teams to ensure proper guardrails are defined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft's account of this issue is available on the <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/09/microsoft-mitigated-exposure-of-internal-information-in-a-storage-account-due-to-overly-permissive-sas-token/">Microsoft Security Response Center blog</a>.</p><h2><span></span><a id="timeline-63"></a><strong>Timeline</strong>&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Jul. 20, 2020</strong> – SAS token first <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/robust-models-transfer/blob/e61568d613c025adfd07f61f2639f3ae78852143/README.md?plain=1#L36">committed</a> to GitHub; expiry set to Oct. 5, 2021&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Oct. 6, 2021</strong> – SAS token expiry <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/robust-models-transfer/commit/a9e0e80bcd49bd8651c0b3198c7dc89179b2c0ac">updated</a> to Oct. 6, 2051&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jun. 22, 2023</strong> – Wiz Research finds and reports issue to MSRC&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jun. 24, 2023</strong> – SAS token invalidated by Microsoft&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jul. 7, 2023</strong> – SAS token <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/robust-models-transfer/commit/c26ebfff3d01bd2a52a6c14febb8b7ea0234431d">replaced</a> on GitHub&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Aug. 16, 2023</strong> – Microsoft completes internal investigation of potential impact&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Sep. 18, 2023</strong> – Public disclosure&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><span></span><a id="stay-in-touch-65"></a><strong>Stay in touch!</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Hi there!

    <p>Satellite observations of one of the world’s biggest ecological experiments on the island of Borneo have revealed that replanting logged forests with diverse mixtures of seedlings can significantly accelerate their recovery. The results have been published today in the journal&nbsp;<em>Science Advances</em>.</p><p>The experiment was set up by the University of Oxford’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-andrew-hector" target="_blank">Professor Andy Hector</a>&nbsp;and colleagues over twenty years ago as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.searrp.org/" target="_blank">SE Asia Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP)</a>. This assessed the recovery of 125 different plots in an area of logged tropical forest that were sown with different combinations of tree species. The results revealed that plots replanted with a mixture of 16 native tree species showed faster recovery of canopy area and total tree biomass, compared to plots replanted with 4 or just 1 species. However, even plots that had been replanted with 1 tree species were recovering more quickly than those left to restore naturally.</p><p>Lead Scientist of the study,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-andrew-hector" target="_blank">Professor Andy Hector</a>&nbsp;(Department of Biology, University of Oxford) said: ‘Our new study demonstrates that replanting logged tropical forests with diverse mixtures of native tree species achieves multiple wins, accelerating the restoration of tree cover, biodiversity, and important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration.’</p><h2>Greater diversity gives greater resilience</h2><p>According to the researchers, a likely reason behind the result is that different tree species occupy different positions, or ‘niches’, within an ecosystem. This includes both the physical and environmental conditions that the species is adapted to, and how it interacts with other organisms. As a result, diverse mixtures complement each other to increase overall functioning and stability of the ecosystem. For instance, some tropical tree species are more tolerant of drought because they produce a greater amount of protective chemicals, giving the forest resilience to periodic times of low rainfall.</p><p>Professor Hector added: ‘Having diversity in a tropical forest can be likened to an insurance effect, similar to having a financial strategy of diverse investment portfolios.’</p><p>In turn, a diverse mix of trees can support a much wider range of animal life. For instance, hornbills specifically require large mature trees with holes where the females can nest.</p><h2>One of the world’s biggest ecological experiments</h2><p>Tropical forests cover just 6% of the planet’s land surface&nbsp;<a href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/forests_practice/importance_forests/tropical_rainforest/" target="_blank">but are home to around 80% of the world’s documented species (WWF),&nbsp;</a>and act as major carbon sinks. However, these critical habitats are disappearing at an alarming rate, chiefly due to logging for timber and conversion to palm oil plantations. Between 2004 and 2017,&nbsp;<a href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/forests_practice/importance_forests/tropical_rainforest/" target="_blank">43 million hectares of tropical forest were lost</a>&nbsp;- an area roughly the size of Morocco (WWF).</p><p>Restoring logged tropical forests is a crucial component of efforts to tackle both the nature and climate crises. Up to now, however, it has been unclear whether this is best achieved through allowing forests to restore themselves naturally (using dormant seeds in the soil) or through active replanting.</p><div><h2>Want more breaking news?</h2><div><p>Subscribe to <i>Technology Networks</i>’ daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day.</p><p><a href="https://go.technologynetworks.com/subscribe-to-breaking-science-news" target="_blank"><span>Subscribe for FREE</span></a></p></div></div><p>To investigate this, the researchers collaborated with local partners to set up the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment on 500 hectares of logged forest in the Malaysian state of Sabah on the island of Borneo. This was divided into 125 experimental plots that were either left to recover naturally or planted with mixtures of either 1, 4, or 16 tree species that are frequently targeted for logging. The 16 species included several endangered species and the worlds’ tallest species of tropical tree (<em>Shorea faguetiana</em>) which can reach over 100 m in height. The first trees were planted in 2002, with nearly 100,000 planted in total over the following years.</p><p>The recovery of the plots was assessed by applying statistical models to aerial images captured by satellites. Within a few years, it became apparent that those with 1 species did worse than those planted with a mixture of 4 species, and those enriched with 16 species did best of all.</p><p>Lead author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/ryan-veryard" target="_blank">Ryan Veryard</a>&nbsp;(who analysed the data as part of his PhD at the University of Oxford), said: ‘Importantly, our results show that logged forest can recover so long as it is not converted to agricultural uses like oil palm plantation. They also emphasise the need to conserve biodiversity within undisturbed forests, so that we can restore it in areas that have already been logged.’</p><p>The Sabah Biodiversity Experiment team are now starting a new three-year project funded by the UK Natural Environmental Research Council to take a census of all the surviving trees in the experiment. This will be combined with a wider range of remote sensing methods (including lidar sensors carried by a helicopter and smaller sensors carried by drones) to give a more comprehensive analysis of forest health.</p><p><b>Reference:&nbsp;</b><span>Veryard R, Wu J, O’Brien MJ, et al.

                  <p><span role="presentation">T</span>he United States’ military is on the hunt for an F-35 fighter jet that has gone missing following an incident that forced the pilot to eject from the advanced stealth aircraft over South Carolina.</p>                  <p>Emergency response teams are trying to find what’s left of the F-35B Lightning II jet, which suffered what the military called a “mishap” on Sunday afternoon, according to social media&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamCharleston/?locale=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posts</a>&nbsp;by Joint Base Charleston, an air base in South Carolina. The unidentified pilot ejected safely and was taken to a local hospital in a stable condition.</p>                                    <p>Joint Base Charleston called on the public to cooperate with military and civilian authorities as the search for the F-35 jet continues. The air base said it was working with Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort to search for the plane north of North Charleston around Lake Moultrie and Lake Marion, based on its last-known location.</p>                  <h3>More From TIME</h3>                    
                  <p>Lockheed Martin Corp is the manufacturer behind the F-35, a single-seat fighter craft used by militaries around the world. The aircraft was a vertical take-off version used by in the US Marine Corps, and the jet is popular for its stealth qualities that make it difficult to detect by radar.&nbsp;</p>                                    <p>The F-35 program, the most expensive US weapons program ever, is projected to cost $400 billion in development and acquisition, plus an additional $1.2 trillion to operate and maintain the fleet over more than 60 years. Each jet can cost more than $160 million, depending on the variant.</p>                  <p>It’s not the first time an F-35 has been in trouble. An F-35B version crashed in 2018 in Beaufort County, South Carolina, because of a manufacturing defect in a fuel tube, according to the Government Accounting Office’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-336sp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>. The following year, a Japanese F-35A stealth fighter plunged into the ocean during an exercise over the Pacific Ocean, which Japan blamed on pilot disorientation, rather than technical issues.</p>                                    <p>The missing aircraft in the US swiftly drew online mockery, from postings with&nbsp;<em>Missing-Jet</em>&nbsp;fliers on lamp posts and notices on milk cartons, to mashed up&nbsp;<em>Dude, Where’s My F-35</em>&nbsp;movie posters.</p>                  <p>“Now that I got that out of the way. How in the hell do you lose an F-35?” South Carolina Republican Representative Nancy Mace said on social media. “How is there not a tracking device and we’re asking the public to what, find a jet and turn it in?”</p>                  <div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><a href="https://www.getlago.com/blog"><p>Blog</p></a><p>The 4 biggest problems with homemade billing systems</p></div><div><p>This article was written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentpochet/" target="_blank">Vincent Pochet</a>, Senior Backend Developer at Lago.</p><p>——</p><p>In 2017, I joined Qonto, a B2B neobank in the making (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/" target="_blank">now worth more than $5B</a>), and got involved in the design of the billing system.</p><p>As the company was scaling from cradle to unicorn, we faced many billing challenges: monthly and yearly plans, “pay-as-you-go” components (percentage on FX transfers, fixed fee on ATM withdrawals, user seats, printed cards, etc.), creation of invoices at scale, taxes, accounting… It was a never-ending nightmare.</p><p>Now, when someone asks for advice about their billing system, my answer is clear: <strong>DO NOT build it yourself</strong>.</p><p>It may look like an interesting project at the beginning, but you’ll soon regret it. And believe me, it only gets worse. As an engineer, if you’re told it’s a “two-month project”, run as far as you can before it’s too late and you become the “billing guy”!</p><p>‍</p><h3>#1 Pricing changes all the time and billing needs to follow</h3><p>After creating the first billing engine of Qonto, we were pretty happy with what we had built. We could ingest <strong>millions of events every week</strong>, our calculations were correct, we could generate sequential invoices, we were able to apply marketing coupons and we managed to debit our internal ledger. Everything was going well!</p><p>But then…</p><p>‍</p><h4>The marketing team came up with a new yearly plan</h4><p>Billing was performed on a monthly basis. At the end of each month, we had to query the database to compute fees and display them as billing items on the invoices. Customers were able to switch from a “monthly_solo” plan to a “monthly_premium” plan (and vice versa), and the upgrade/downgrade logic was working well (although it had been difficult to implement).</p><p>When the marketing team devised a new yearly plan to secure revenue for the next 12 months, I started to freak out: <strong>the entire billing logic was based on monthly boundaries</strong>. It took us two months to modify this logic. The hardest part was that the subscription fee had to be billed in advance, at the beginning of the annual period, but the overage related to usage-based features still had to be billed on a monthly basis.</p><p>‍</p><h4>The finance team asked to switch from anniversary to calendar dates</h4><p>At the time, customers were billed based on the anniversary date of their contract. For instance, if a customer had signed up for a monthly plan on March 16th, they were billed on the 16th of each month.</p><p>One day, the finance team requested a meeting with the engineering team and the CFO said:</p><p>‍</p><blockquote><em>“It would be easier for everyone if we switched from anniversary dates to calendar dates for subscriptions. Right now it’s a mess from an accounting perspective, so let’s bill everyone at the beginning of the calendar period.”</em></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>In other words, they wanted to switch from this…</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/6357e464c526ce28312ccbe4_632c2492bb03b806277bb038_anniversary-billing.png" alt="Anniversary billing periods"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>To this...</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/6357e464c526ce59c22ccbe5_632c24bc129a6f15e47f56a7_calendar-billing.png" alt="Calendar billing periods"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>100,000 customers were affected</strong> by this migration. The accounting mess turned into an engineering nightmare, resulting in a three-month project.</p><p>Implementing billing logics takes time and things get incredibly complicated over time. Other typical organic changes include (but are not limited to):</p><p>• New features to be added to the pricing;<br>• New country launch, with a different pricing;<br>• New business line, when you start selling a white-label version of your product for instance;<br>• Changes in tax legislation; and<br>• Custom plans for “Enterprise” customers.</p><p>‍</p><h3>#2 Your billing system needs to scale with your user base</h3><p>A home-made billing system is not scalable if you don’t maintain it. At Qonto, our billing database contained millions of rows. This database was linked to our internal ledger, which was used to deduct fees from our customers’ accounts. Processing high volumes of events is hard, and when something breaks, you need to check whether past events need to be computed again (but you can’t afford to ingest the same event twice).</p><p>Generating invoices is also an important task. It’s not hard to create PDF files with line items on it. We used a library called <a href="https://gotenberg.dev/" target="_blank">Gotenberg</a> to display backend aggregations on a beautiful HTML template. However, it’s hard to process fees and generate millions of invoices at the same time. Your backend queries and aggregates millions of rows asynchronously, and the calculation must be correct for each customer.</p><p>The more complex the pricing, the more complicated the calculations. And the more customers you have, the more IT resources you need.</p><p>‍</p><h3>#3 Grandfathering causes headaches</h3><p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.getlago.com/blog/pricing-billing-open-source-interview-with-algolias-co-founder" target="_blank">we interviewed Nicolas Dessaigne</a>, founder of Algolia and Group Partner at YC. He told us about their terrible experience with pricing and billing. After a series of “minor” changes to their price plans, they decided a few months ago to adopt a full usage-based pricing model and had to rebuild the entire billing logic.</p><p>As most customers had signed long-term contracts based on existing plans, they had to exclude them from the migration. This is called “<strong>grandfathering</strong>”. In this situation, engineers must not only implement new billing rules, but they also need to maintain the old logic for grandfathered plans.</p><p>In 2013, the pricing of Algolia was like this...</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/6357e464c526ce1d8e2ccbe8_632c24e7491cef6fe07397bc_algolia-2013.png" alt="The pricing of Algolia in 2013"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Then in 2015 it was like this...</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/6357e464c526ce34662ccbe6_632c2505090891f38d817c95_algolia-2015.png" alt="The pricing of Algolia in 2015"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>And here is the 2022&nbsp;update!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/63569f390f3a7ad4c76d2bd6/6357e464c526ce64ad2ccbe7_632c25151344fba10f40b3eb_algolia-2022.png" alt="The pricing of Algolia in 2022"></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>#4 You must be prepared to staff an entire team</h3><p>Billing is never considered an expertise. It’s perceived as a background task and not as a prestigious project that engineers will fight for (they may even leave if they’re forced to work on it for a long time).</p><p>However, sooner or later, billing will be a full-time job for at least one engineer. Because of pricing changes, scalability challenges and grandfathered plans, complexity increases and so does the workload. Billing is built around your company’s product, it’s a living organism, not a feature.</p><p>At Qonto, the billing project was supposed to be completed by a single backend engineer in only two months. One year later, two backend engineers were still working on it full time.</p><p>Then <strong>the team of two backend engineers grew into a team of 20 people</strong>, including product managers, backend engineers and frontend engineers as well. Hiring, onboarding and retaining people to take care of our billing system was a constant challenge. They would have preferred to work on our core product, and our management team also wanted to downsize the team.</p><p>We considered implementing an off-the-shelf billing solution but there was nothing flexible enough and <strong>the switching costs were too high</strong>. Algolia also tried to migrate to Zuora before backing out and rebuilding their billing system for the fourth time. This is a decision you have to make in the early days, otherwise, at some point, your billing will be too complex and won’t fit any software product.</p><p>I left Qonto in March 2021 and I still get phone calls from engineers currently working there and struggling with billing. They learned these four lessons the hard way. They now know what it costs to build a homemade billing system.</p></div></div>]]></description>

					that reduce fragmentation to a minimum; but doing this generically 
					for an arbitrary enum with maximum memory efficiency is close to 
					impossible in Rust. The only options we have are proc-macros, which 
					compose poorly (no <span>#[derive]</span> on third-party code or type aliases) 
					and are not type aware (unless using workarounds based on 
					<span>generic_const_expr</span>, which infect the call graph with verbose trait 
					bounds and don't work with generic type parameters). Zig on the 
					other hand let's us perform the wildest data structure transformations 
					in a generic and concise way. 
					</p>

					<p>
					Before I go into the implementation details, I'd like to explain why 
					reducing the aforementioned memory fragmentation is useful in practice. 
					</p>

					<p>Background</p>
					<p>
					To me, one of the biggest motivators for efficient enum arrays 
					has been compilers. One problem that keeps coming up when designing 
					an AST is figuring out how to reduce its memory footprint. Big ASTs 
					can incur a hefty performance penalty during compilation, because 
					memory bandwidth and latency are a frequent bottleneck in compiler 
					frontends. Chandler Carruth's 
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI198eFghJk">video on the Carbon compiler</a> has been 
					making the rounds on language forums. In it he describes how a 
					parsed clang AST regularly consumes 50x more memory than the 
					original source code!
					</p>

					<p>
					Alright, so what does this have to do with enums? Well, the 
					most common way of representing syntax tree nodes is via some kind 
					of recursive (or recursive-like) data structure. Let's define a node 
					for expressions in Rust, using newtype indices for indirection:
					</p>
					<div>
<pre>enum Expr {
    Unit,
    Number,
    Binary(Operation, ExprId, ExprId),
    Ident(Symbol),
    Eval(ExprId, ExprSlice),
    BlockExpression(ExprId, StatementSlice)
}
</pre></div>

					<div>
					<p><b>Note:</b> We can write an AST node in OCaml for comparison:
</p><div>
<pre>type expr = 
  | Unit
  | Number
  | Binary of op * expr * expr
  | Ident of symbol
  | Eval of expr * stmt list

</pre></div><p>
					A big difference compared to Rust is that we can express truly 
					recursive data types without any form of explicit indirection. 
					That's because the runtime system and garbage collector take care 
					of the memory bookkeeping for us.
					</p></div><p>

					The problem we have now is that we want to improve the <i>packing efficiency</i>
					of those enums. A simple <span>Vec(Expr)</span> will consume <span>sizeof(Enum)</span> 
					amount of memory for every element, which corresponds to the size of 
					the largest variant + tag + padding. Luckily, there are some ways 
					of dealing with this.

					</p><p>Reducing Fragmentation</p><p>
					Let's take a simple example of a 3-variant enum with member sizes 
					8, 16 and 32 bits. Storing those in a regular <span>Vec</span> will look like this:

					</p><figure>
						<p><b>Figure 2:</b> 
						Here every element reserves a large amount of space to accommodate the 32-bit variant and to satisfy its alignment. 
						</p>
						<p><img alt="A visualization of an array of enum values, with varying fragmentation levels per element" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout1.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>

					<p>
					The most common way to improve packing efficiency is by just keeping the enum variants as small as possible using tagged indices (*). 
					</p><p>
					(*): For examples in Rust, take a look at the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nightly-rustc/rustc_data_structures/tagged_ptr/index.html#">tagged_index crate</a> used in the compiler 
					or check out this recent <a href="https://mcyoung.xyz/2023/08/09/yarns/">blog post on small-string optimization</a>. 
					You'll find these optimizations all the time in high-performance code 
					like language runtimes, garbage collectors, compilers, game engines or OS kernels.
					</p>
					

					<p>
					Unfortunately, that doesn't completely solve the fragmentation issue. The other way is to tackle the container type directly! We could use a struct-of-arrays approach to store discriminant and value in two separate allocations. In fact, that's what the self-hosted Zig compiler actually does.
					</p>

					<figure>
						<p><b>Figure 3:</b> 
						The tags and union values are stored in two separate allocations, so we're not paying for padding anymore. However, the union collection still has variant fragmentation. 
						</p>
						<p><img alt="A struct-of-arrays transformation of an enum array" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout2.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>

					<p>
					Because of Zig's staged compilation, we can have container types that 
					perform this SoA transformation generically for any type. In Rust, 
					we're constrained to proc-macros like <span>soa_derive</span> 
					which has several downsides (e.g. we can't place <span>#[derive]</span> 
					on third-party types without changing their source).
					</p>

					<p>Reducing Variant Fragmentation</p><p>
					This SoA transformation reduces a lot of wasted padding introduced by 
					the enum tag, but still isn't optimal. To really get rid of fragmentation 
					in the values, we can create one vector <i>per variant</i>. 

					</p><figure>
						<p><b>Figure 4:</b> 
						Compared to the SoA layout from before, we have a partial order instead of a total order. So upon insertion, we get back a tagged index that holds both the enum tag and the index in the particular variant array. 
						</p>
						<p><img alt="Visualization of a simple AoVA layout" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout6.webp">
						</p>
					</figure><p>

					I don't think there's a name for this collection, so I call it <i>array of variant arrays</i> (or AoVA). This can be implemented in Rust and Zig, using proc-macros and comptime respectively.

					</p><p>Size Equivalence Classes</p>
					<p>
					We could stop here, but let's consider enums that have <i>lots</i> of variants that can be grouped into a small number of clusters with the same type size:
					</p><div>
<div>
<pre>enum Foo {
    A(u8, u8),
    B(u16),
    C(u16),
    D([u8; 2]),
    E(u32),
    F(u16, u16),
    G(u32),
    H(u32),
    I([u8; 4]),
    J(u32, u32),
    K(u32, (u16, u16)),
    L(u64),
    M(u64),
    N(u32, u16, u16),
    O([u8; 8])
}
</pre></div>
					<figure>
						<p><img alt="Naive AoVA layout causes us to create 15 different vectors - one per enum variant" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout15.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>
					</div>

					<p>
					As you can see, the one-vec-per-variant approach would add 15 vectors. 
					It's likely that the number of (re)allocations and system calls would
					increase substantially, and require a lot of memory to amortize
					compared to the naive <span>Vec<foo></foo></span>. 
					The vectors may also be arbitrarily spread in memory, 
					leading to a higher chance of cache conflicts. The AoVA collection itself
					also consumes a lot of memory, bloating any structure it's embedded in. 
					</p>

					<p>
					Now, if we group every variant by size, we get three clusters: 2, 4, and 8 bytes. Such clusters can be allocated together into the same vector - thereby reducing the number of total vectors we have in our container by 80%. So we could realistically store variants of <span>Foo</span> in three clusters:
					</p>
					<div>
<div>
<pre>struct FooVec {
    c_2: Vec&lt;[u8; 2]&gt;, // A - D
    c_4: Vec&lt;[u8; 4]&gt;, // E - I
    c_8: Vec&lt;[u8; 8]&gt;, // J - O
}
</pre></div>
					<figure>
						<p><img alt="The dense AoVA version reduces our vector count to 3" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout5.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>
					</div>

					<p>
					You could say this is a <i>dense</i> version of our AoVA pattern. 
					However, once we colocate different variants in the <i>same allocation</i>,
					we lose the ability to iterate through the vector in a type-safe way. 
					The only way to access elements in such a container is via the tagged 
					pointer that was created upon insertion. If your access pattern does 
					not require blind iteration (which can be the case for flattened, 
					index-based tree structures), this might be a worthwhile trade-off.  
					</p>
					
					<p>
					I've implemented a <a href="https://github.com/dist1ll/osmium">prototype of this data structure in Zig</a>. 
					The most important pieces are the compiler built-ins that allow reflection on
					field types, byte and bit sizes, as well as inspecting the discriminant.
					</p>

					<figure>
					<p><b>Snippet:</b> At its core, it performs straightforward compile-time 
					reflection to compute the clusters and field-to-cluster mappings. We do
					pseudo-dynamic allocation using a stack-allocated vector. 
					The cluster information is used to construct the AoVA data structure.  
					Exact <a href="https://github.com/dist1ll/osmium/blob/127145584fb22b48c05b5dbb14c670001318a81c/src/osmium.zig#L54-L71">source of the snippet is here</a>.
					</p>
<div>
<pre>// determine kind of type (i.e. struct, union, etc.)
switch (@typeInfo(inner)) {
    .Union =&gt; |u| {
        // store mapping from union field -&gt; cluster index
        var field_map = [_]u8{0} ** u.fields.len;

        // iterate over union fields
        for (u.fields, 0..) |field, idx| {
            // compute size
            const space = @max(field.alignment, @sizeOf(field.type));

            // insert into hashtable 
            if (!svec.contains_slow(space)) {
                svec.push(space) catch @compileError(ERR_01);
            }

            field_map[idx] = svec.len - 1;
        }

        // return clusters
        return .{ .field_map = field_map, .sizes = svec };
    },
    else =&gt; @compileError("only unions allowed"),
}
</pre></div>
					</figure>

					<p>
					If you do want type-safe iteration, you could pay the cost of padding, and add the tag back in:
					</p>

					<figure>
						<p><b>Figure 5:</b> 
						We've essentially partitioned the enum on the <i>data-level</i>, 
						leaving the interpretation at the type-level untouched
						</p>
						<p><img alt="Dense AoVA layout with additional tag and padding" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout3.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>

					<p>
					If the padding is too much, you can do an SoA transformation on each of the variant arrays.
					</p>

					<figure>
						<p><b>Figure 6:</b> Here we have a similar partitioning, but without
						the padding. The downside is that we're doubling the vector count.
						</p>
						<p><img alt="Dense AoVA layout, with tag and per-cluster SoA transformation" src="https://alic.dev/static/dense-enums/layout4.webp">
						</p>
					</figure>

					<p>
					So as you can see, there's quite a few trade-offs we can make in this space - 
					and they all depend on the concrete memory layout of our enum. 
					</p>

					<p>
					While creating such data structures is pretty straightforward in Zig, 
					creating any of these examples in Rust using proc macros is basically 
					impossible - the reason being that proc macros don't have access to 
					type information like size or alignment. While you could have a proc 
					macro generate a <span>const fn</span> that computes the clusters for a particular 
					enum, this function cannot be used to specify the length of an array 
					for a <i>generic</i> type.
					</p>

					<p>
					Another limit to Rust's generics is that the implementation of a 
					generic container cannot be conditioned on whether the given type is 
					an enum or a struct. 
					In Zig, we can effectively do something like this:
					</p>

					<figure>
<div>
<pre>// this is pseudocode
struct EfficientContainer<t> {
    if(T.isEnum()) {
        x: EfficientStructArray<t>,
    } else {
        x: EfficientEnumArray<t>,
    }
}
</t></t></t></pre></div>
					</figure>
					<p>
					We can also specialize the flavor of our AoVA implementation based on the enum. Maybe the benefits of colocating different variants only starts to make sense if we reduce the number of vectors by more than 90%. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					So ultimately we gain a lot of fine-grained control over data structure selection. And if we have good heuristics, we can let the type-aware staging mechanism select the best implementation for us. To me, this represents a huge step in composability for high-performance systems software. 
					</p>

					<p>Bonus: Determining Index Bitwidth at Compile Time</p>
					<p>
					There's another pretty crazy feature that Zig's staged compilation 
					model gets you: if you know the maximum capacity of your data structure 
					at compile time, you can pass that information to the type-constructing function
					and let it determine the bitwidth of the returned tagged index.
					</p>

					<p>
					When this tagged index is included in a subsequent data structure, let's say another enum, this information carries over naturally, and the bits that we didn't need can be used for the discriminant!
					</p>

					<p>
					So what Zig gives you is <i>composable</i> memory efficiency. By being 
					specific about the number of bits you need, different parts of the code 
					can take advantage of that. And with implicit widening integer coercion, 
					dealing with APIs of different bitwidths stays ergonomic. In a way, 
					this reminds me a lot of refinement typing and ranged integers, so this 
					ties in a lot with my <a href="https://alic.dev/blog/custom-bitwidth">post on custom bitwidth integers</a>. 
					</p>
					
					<p>Conclusion</p><p>
					Writing extremely efficient generic data structures in Rust is not 
					always easy - in some cases they incur lots of accidental complexity, 
					in some others they're essentially impossible to implement. I think 
					one of the biggest takeaways for me with regards to staged compilation 
					was the ability to be composable on a memory layout level. If you're 
					developing a systems programming language that embraces efficiency and 
					zero-cost abstractions, you should absolutely take another look at 
					staged programming and in particular Zig's comptime.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2018/10/19/japanese-hometown-tax/">https://www.kalzumeus.com/2018/10/19/japanese-hometown-tax/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37555004">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This is outside of my normal software-focused beat, but I met some folks who were very interested in public policy recently. I found, to my surprise, that I probably understand one innovative Japanese tax policy better than very well-informed people who geek out about tax policy [<a href="#footnote-0">0</a>].</p>

<p>This post hopefully fixes that bug. (Hat tip to <a href="http://www.gwern.net/">gwern</a> for suggesting I write it up.)</p>

<h2 id="two-countries-in-one-border">Two countries in one border</h2>

<p>The Japanese employment market has a curious feature: there are regions of Japan with extremely high economic productivity (such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya, but for the purpose of this issue think “Tokyo” and you won’t be wrong) and regions with low economic productivity (substantially everywhere else). This counsels that a young person born and educated in e.g. Gifu move to Tokyo after graduation to earn a living.</p>

<p>Many, many do. While Japan’s overall population is declining, Tokyo’s increases by about 100,000 people per year.</p>

<p>The regions in Japan are not thrilled about this state of affairs for many reasons. Tokyo isn’t just the seat of Japanese commerce; it also houses the government, media, cultural institutions, etc etc. There is a real sense that your children moving to Tokyo causes them to lose connection with their culture and that the rewards from the national enterprise aren’t being allocated fairly. Tokyo, for its perspective, views the regions with the noblesse oblige that you would expect a cosmopolitan center of culture and learning to have with respect to their benighted country bumpkin cousins.</p>

<p>(If this sounds like it echoes the political economy of, say, two large English-speaking nations recently, well, folks greatly overestimate how different Western nations are from each other.)</p>

<h2 id="a-misalignment-in-incentives-for-human-capital-development">A misalignment in incentives for human capital development</h2>

<p>Educating children is incredibly expensive. The regions are quite annoyed that they pay to educate their children but that Tokyo reaps all the benefits. This state of affairs has continued for decades.</p>

<p>But Japan has a policy response for it, and it is sort of beautiful. Called ふるさと納税 (<em>Furusato Nouzei</em> or, roughly, the Hometown Tax System), it works something like this:</p>

<p>A substantial portion of Japan’s income-based taxes are residence taxes, which are paid to the city and prefecture (think state) that one resides in, based on one’s income in the previous year. The rate is a flat 10% of taxed income; due to quirks of calculating this which almost certainly aren’t relevant to you, you can estimate this as 8% of what white collar employees think their salary is.</p>

<p>Furusato Nouzei allows you to donate up to 40% of next year’s residence tax to one or many cities/prefectures of your choice, in return for a 1:1 credit on your tax next year. This is entirely opt-in. Anyone can participate, regardless of where they live.</p>

<p>In principle, the idea is to donate to one’s hometown. Importantly, one actually has unfettered discretion as to which city/prefecture one donates to. This has some very important implications discussed later.</p>

<p>Relevantly to your understanding of the incentives here: most Japanese people do not file taxes every year. Income-based taxes are calculated and remitted by employers directly on the behalf of their employees. Participating in the system requires friction which is somewhat above e.g. changing your direct deposit information but far below e.g. filing a tax return.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-the-idea-here">What was the idea here?</h2>

<p>Tokyo and the regions could have resolved their differences through the democratic process, in which the regions outvote Tokyo and could have altered Japan’s national tax and economic policies to their advantage. Tokyo obviously doesn’t want this, and instead agreed to an opt-in system which allays some of the regions’ concerns.</p>

<p>To the extent that taxpayers donate to their hometowns, Tokyo no longer freerides on the substantial public expenditures required to raise and educate internal migrants.</p>

<p>Putting potentially 40% of Tokyo’s residence tax in play is <em>not a small carrot</em>. Individual residence tax is roughly 45% of the city’s revenue. That works out to roughly <a href="http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/FINANCIAL/financial02.htm">$30 billion a year.</a></p>

<p>Now if you were a negotiator for Tokyo back in ~2006 when this was being debated, you might have thought “Hmm, while this <em>sounds</em> like it is putting $12 billion a year into play, it’s not actually nearly that bad for us. People have to take affirmative steps to transfer the money to their city of choice, and they have to float the money for most of a year, because of the donate-then-credit mechanism. Uptake on that won’t be that high. Maybe we’ll lose a few tens of millions of dollars; no biggie. Silly country bumpkins; can’t even math.”</p>

<p>But after the system was created, city governments started getting really creative. And what happened next is by parts beautiful and crazy.</p>

<h2 id="incentives-rule-everything-around-me">Incentives rule everything around me</h2>

<p>There exists a culture in Japan of reciprocating gifts. While it varies based on where you live, in the areas I’ve lived, the general rule of thumb is 30%: if you give someone $300 cash on the occasion of their wedding, as is customary for gainfully employed people with respect to someone outside their immediate family, they’re socially obligated to find a way to give you $90 of value back. (The mechanisms for doing this could merit their own post; the word is 返礼品. A dictionary translates this as “quid pro quo”, but the sentiment does not match the common English usage of that phrase. This is simply a ritual; to not participate in it would be non-normative.)</p>

<p>While not formally defined in the legislation for the Furusato Nouzei system, someone at a city government figured that it was just not appropriate to let someone just give ~3% of their salary to the city without receiving a token of appreciation in return. So they sent something back; a can of locally-produced plums, say, to remind you of the tastes of your childhood.</p>

<p>And this was a beautiful idea! It directly improved the ability of the system to cement relationships between internal migrants and their hometowns, one of the declared goals of the system. It motivated people to fill out paperwork and float the city a bit of money for part of a year, because who doesn’t like free plums. (You might sensibly object that they aren’t free given the time value of money, but prevailing interest rates in Japan are indistinguishable from zero.) And it let cities specialize in marketing this initiative.</p>

<p>And specialize they did.</p>

<p>A number of cities in Japan, including my adoptive home town of Ogaki, have made this offer: for a no-cost-to-you donation of $100 or more, the city will send someone out to any grave in the city limits. That person will clean the grave, make an appropriate offering, and send you a photo. This is a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>Most of the gifts are more prosaic. Locally produced food is very popular. If you miss the taste of home, they’ve got you covered.</p>

<p>Cities partnered with local firms to handle the e-commerce aspect, and eventually with platforms to bundle many different items into a single donation; think of it as a shopping cart you could fill with donated money.</p>

<p>And then someone asked a fateful question.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-your-hometown-anyway">Where is your hometown, anyway?</h2>

<p>The Furusato Nouzei system does not define what a “hometown” is. This is mostly by design; Japan historically has a <em>very</em> long-lasting official record of birthplaces which follows one throughout life called the Family Register, and (for reasons outside the scope of this post) it is a major societal issue. Additionally, there was some sentiment that one could have a it-feels-like-home connection to a city that wasn’t necessarily one’s birthplace.</p>

<p>Maybe you were born in Tokyo but lived 30 years in a small town in Aichi, like my wife. Maybe you were born abroad but lived 10 years in Ogaki, like me. Maybe you just loved the onsen in Gero and wanted to subsidize them. The government wasn’t willing to adjudicate one’s “true” hometown; 帰る場所 is where the heart is.</p>

<p>And then some bureaucrat realized that this created a market: you, as a city government, can bid for taxpayers to select you as a hometown.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-that-work">How does that work?</h2>

<p>Well, remember the sites which are acting as brokers for donations? They all have search engines, so that you can search by e.g. who has wagyu available if that is your thing.</p>

<p>Your thing could, plausibly, be travel to your hometown. So your hometown could, plausibly, buy you tickets back to home. But this would be gratuitously operationally intensive.</p>

<p>You have to call city hall. They have to arrange transport. Why do this when Japan is a country with perfectly functioning travel agencies? It would be far better for everyone for your hometown to just send you a gift card to a travel agency.</p>

<p>See where this is going yet? A gift card for e.g. Japan’s largest travel agency is a highly liquid cash equivalent. In addition to using it for any good or service from that travel agency, you could liquidate it for about 97 cents on the dollar in any gift certificate exchange in the country. (These are extraordinarily common in Japan.)</p>

<p>A few rounds of vigorous capitalism later, many rural towns without large expatriate (inpatriate?) populations and without much to differentiate them in terms of local food had bid the consideration for a donation up, up, up. Eventually the central government stepped in and said that the maximum they’d allow is you rewarding a taxpayer with 50% of the donation in consideration.</p>

<p>So, if you “donate” ~3% of your gross salary to one of these cities (which is 1:1 matched by e.g. Tokyo; you’re donating someone else’s money), they will give you ~1.5% of it back in all-but-cash.</p>

<p>In 2008, about 33,000 people participated in the Furusato Nouzei system, principally out of genuine charitable concern. In 2016, it was about 2.2 million. They donated on the order of $2.5 billion. The primary accelerant was the bidding war. A contributor was the popularization of Internet sites to broker the donations, which substantially reduce the friction required to participate.</p>

<p>Running a site is a very good business to be in; it’s like running an e-commerce business with the special wrinkle that your customers are entirely price insensitive. There are a variety of smaller concerns, but the large Japanese Internet giants (Rakuten, Yahoo, etc) all use their massive built-in distribution and relationships to get an edge here. (The business model is simple: take the money from taxpayers, deduct a cut, spend some on gifts authorized by the city, and remit the remainder to the city periodically. You then periodically give the city an Excel file full of taxpayers. The city periodically sends their donors the requisite paperwork to get the tax credit the next year.)</p>

<p>I’d estimate that intermediaries probably soak up somewhere between 5% and 10% of the total donated. This is quite inefficient to accomplish a government-to-government reallocation of resources, but by the standards of Japanese public works projects it is practically free.</p>

<p>(Jokes aside: my estimate is informed by the fact that the margins are rich enough such that the intermediaries will <em>happily</em> support you making a donation on credit cards. The actual numbers are probably in a public disclosure somewhere but I don’t have enough time to go looking.)</p>

<h2 id="is-this-sustainable">Is this sustainable?</h2>

<p>Probably? There has been some talk of rolling back the bidding war via administrative fiat, but the cities are quite opposed to this. It’s a great game theory problem: unless a supermajority of cities collectively agrees to limit gifts to a token number, it’s strongly in a city’s interest to duck the central government’s questionnaires and not express any objection to the status quo. (Also remember that the natural anchor for reciprocation is set quite high across much of Japan; the government might succeed in capping reciprocation at 30% but that might be a hard floor for the ceiling.)</p>

<p>The penetration rate of this system will likely continue quickly increasing. It’s socially viral: a tax optimization that virtually anyone can take advantage of, has the explicit backing of the government, and feels wholesome. If you’re one of the relatively few taxpayers in Japan who has an accountant, expect them to tell you about this in detail and strongly recommend you max our your contribution every year.</p>

<p>Widespread gaming or no, the system pretty much works according to the internal aims. Cities get a list of their internal diaspora, and do make considerably more effort to stay in touch with them than they did previously. (This includes lovely holiday cards and sometimes even I-can’t-believe-they’re-not-alumni-magazines.) You really do get plums from childhood in your mail from your hometown (if you don’t optimize for cash equivalents). Cities with declining local tax bases really do get enough money to do material projects with. Tokyo takes a hit to revenue but can afford it.</p>

<p>And there, that’s Japan’s most novel redistribution program in a nutshell.</p>

<p>If you live in Japan and want to take advantage of this, hit up your local Google; many sites are happy to make it happen for you. (I don’t endorse any in particular, but any of the top brands or organic search results will work substantially as advertised.)</p>

[0]: I had been of the impression up until today that it was literally not on the English-speaking Internet, but this seems to have changed in the last few years. That said, nobody seems to have written about the policy angle in English yet, so here we are.</p>

When you do, you can pick things like color theme and how URLs are displayed. On the right hand side of the page there is a preview of what your Kagi searches will look like.</p><p>In my example, the demo Kagi search is Magic The Gathering. I play <i>a lot</i> of Magic The Gathering. I spend most of my time online searching for things related to MtG or brewing decks, second only to things related to software development.</p><p>I imagine it's coincidence. MtG is a pretty nerdy hobby and Kagi seems like a pretty nerdy product. However, it made me uncomfortable enough to ask:</p><p>Is that what it shows for everyone? Or is there some tracking going on already that is being demoed? It's almost certainly the former given the positioning of Kagi in the search market, but I'd like to be sure.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/hacks/lotus-nsa-key.html">http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/hacks/lotus-nsa-key.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37554504">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<em>This page has also been translated into Russian <a href="http://www.designcontest.com/show/nsa-key-be">here</a><br>
and into Polish <a href="http://www.autoteiledirekt.de/science/backdoor-klucz-nsa-z-lotus-notes">here</a>
</em>



<p>Before the US crypto export regulations were finally disolved the
export version of Lotus Notes used to include a key escrow / backdoor
feature called differential cryptography.  The idea was that they got
permission to export 64 bit crypto if 24 of those bits were encrypted
for the NSA's public key.  The NSA would then only have the small
matter of brute-forcing the remaining 40 bits to get the plaintext,
and everyone else would get a not-that-great 64 bit key space (which
probably already back then NSA would have had the compute power to
brute force also, only at higher cost).</p>

<p>Anyway as clearly inside the application somewhere would be an NSA
public key that the NSA had the private key for, I tried reverse
engineering it to get the public key.</p>

<p>In doing this I discovered that the NSA public key had an
organizational name of "MiniTruth", and a common name of
"Big Brother".  Specifically what I saw in my debugger late
one night, which was spooky for a short moment was:</p>

<block>
<b><tt>O=MiniTruth CN=Big Brother</tt></b>
</block>

<p>Literary note: for those who have not read Orwell's prescient
"1984" the Ministry of Truth was the agency who's job was
propaganda and suppression of truths that did not suit the malignant
fictional future government in the book, and "Big Brother"
was the evil shadowy leader of this government.  The whole book is <a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/1984">online here</a>.</p>

<h2>The NSA's Public Key</h2>

<p>I put this together some years after the reverse-engineering stint,
so there could be errors, but this is from my notes, the raw public
key modulus from the debugger:</p>

<block><b><tt><pre>  8D9D6213D3EF03A7 A5CEAE99B8E9FF06
  12E58ECAAB2939FE 72B41833B8B947A0

  4BC41FE3123AF70C 31688BCD5895BB00
</pre></tt></b></block>

<p>I figured it was in little endian format by trial and error; other
formats were easy to factor.  So the big endian hex representation is:

<block><b><tt></tt></b></block></p><b><tt><xmp>
  e = 3
  n = \

</xmp></tt></b>

<p>where the modulus is 760 bits, and the public key formatted as a
PGP key is (of course I made this user id up -- you can edit it to
whatever you choose it's of course not self-signed):</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Unix shells are generally not viable access control mechanisms any more</h2>

	<p><small>September 17, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>Once upon a time, if you had a collection of Unix systems, you could
reasonably do a certain amount of access control to your overall
environment by forcing logins to have specific administrative shells.
As a bonus, these administrative shells could print helpful messages
about why the particular login wasn't being allowed to use your system.
This is a quite attractive bundle of features, but unfortunately this
no longer works in a (modern) Unix environment with logins (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/OurDifferentSysadminEnvironment">such as
we have</a>). There are two core problems.</p>

<p>First, you almost certainly operate a variety of services that
normally only use Unix logins as a source of (password) authentication
and perhaps a UID to operate as, and ignore the login's shell. This
is the common pattern of Samba, IMAP servers, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/ApacheBasicAuthWhy">Apache HTTP Basic
Authentication</a>, and so on. In some cases
you may be able to teach these services to look at the login's shell
and do special things, but some of them are sealed black boxes and
even the ones that can be changed require you to go out of your
way. If you forget one, it fails open (allowing access to people
with an administrative shell that should lock them out).</p>

<p>(One of these services is SSH itself, since you can generally
initiate SSH sessions and ask for port forwarding or other features
that don't cause SSH to run the login shell.)</p>

<p>Second, you may operate general authentication services, such as
LDAP or a Single Sign On system, and if you do these authentication
services are generally blind to what they're being used for and
thus to whether or not a login with a special shell should be allowed
to pass this particular authentication. The only real solution is
to have multiple versions of these authentication systems with
different logins in them, and point systems at different ones based
on exactly who should be allowed to use them.</p>

<p>A similar issue happens with Apache HTTP Basic Authentication in
common configurations, where you have a single authentication realm
with a single Apache htpasswd file that covers an assortment of
different services. If you need certain logins ('locked' logins or
the like) to be excluded from some of these services but not others,
either you need multiple htpasswd files (at least) or you need to
teach each such service to do additional checks.</p>

<p>(In general you're going to have to try to carefully review who
should be able to use which of your services when, and the resulting
matrix is often surprisingly complicated and tangled. Life gets more
complicated if you're using administrative shells for reasons other
than just locking people out with a message, for example to try to
force an initial password change.)</p>

<p>Today, the only two measures of login access control that really
work in a general environment are either scrambling the login's
password (and disable any SSH authorized keys) or excluding the
login entirely from your various authentication data sources (your
LDAP servers, your Apache htpasswd files, and so on). It's a pity
that changing people's shells is no longer enough (it was both easy
and convenient), but that's how the environment has evolved.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Suppose the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</a> file format,
and specifically the "ODP" OpenDocument Presentation format, were
built around SQLite.  Benefits would include:
</p><ul>
<li>Smaller documents
</li><li>Faster File/Save times
</li><li>Faster startup times
</li><li>Less memory used
</li><li>Document versioning
</li><li>A better user experience
</li></ul>

<p>
Note that this is only a thought experiment.
We are not suggesting that OpenDocument be changed.
Nor is this article a criticism of the current OpenDocument
design.  The point of this essay is to suggest ways to improve
future file format designs.

</p><h2>About OpenDocument And OpenDocument Presentation</h2>

<p>
The OpenDocument file format is used for office applications:
word processors, spreadsheets, and presentations.  It was originally
designed for the OpenOffice suite but has since been incorporated into
other desktop application suites.  The OpenOffice application has been
forked and renamed a few times.  This author's primary use for OpenDocument is 
building slide presentations with either 
<a href="https://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php">NeoOffice</a> on Mac, or
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> on Linux and Windows.

</p><p>
An OpenDocument Presentation or "ODP" file is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29">ZIP archive</a> containing
XML files describing presentation slides and separate image files for the
various images that are included as part of the presentation.
(OpenDocument word processor and spreadsheet files are similarly
structured but are not considered by this article.) The reader can
easily see the content of an ODP file by using the "zip -l" command.
For example, the following is the "zip -l" output from a 49-slide presentation
about SQLite from the 2014
<a href="http://southeastlinuxfest.org/">SouthEast LinuxFest</a>
conference:

<p>
The ODP ZIP archive contains four different XML files:
content.xml, styles.xml, meta.xml, and settings.xml.  Those four files
define the slide layout, text content, and styling.  This particular
presentation contains 62 images, ranging from full-screen pictures to
tiny icons, each stored as a separate file in the Pictures
folder.  The "mimetype" file contains a single line of text that says:

</p><blockquote><pre>application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The purpose of the other files and folders is presently 
unknown to the author but is probably not difficult to figure out.

</p><h2>Limitations Of The OpenDocument Presentation Format</h2>

<p>
The use of a ZIP archive to encapsulate XML files plus resources is an
elegant approach to an application file format.
It is clearly superior to a custom binary file format.
But using an SQLite database as the
container, instead of ZIP, would be more elegant still.

</p><p>A ZIP archive is basically a key/value database, optimized for
the case of write-once/read-many and for a relatively small number
of distinct keys (a few hundred to a few thousand) each with a large BLOB
as its value.  A ZIP archive can be viewed as a "pile-of-files"
database.  This works, but it has some shortcomings relative to an
SQLite database, as follows:

</p><ol>
<li><p><b>Incremental update is hard.</b>
</p><p>
It is difficult to update individual entries in a ZIP archive.
It is especially difficult to update individual entries in a ZIP
archive in a way that does not destroy
the entire document if the computer loses power and/or crashes
in the middle of the update.  It is not impossible to do this, but
it is sufficiently difficult that nobody actually does it.  Instead, whenever
the user selects "File/Save", the entire ZIP archive is rewritten.  
Hence, "File/Save" takes longer than it ought, especially on
older hardware.  Newer machines are faster, but it is still bothersome
that changing a single character in a 50 megabyte presentation causes one
to burn through 50 megabytes of the finite write life on the SSD.

</p></li><li><p><b>Startup is slow.</b>
</p><p>
In keeping with the pile-of-files theme, OpenDocument stores all slide 
content in a single big XML file named "content.xml".  
LibreOffice reads and parses this entire file just to display
the first slide.
LibreOffice also seems to
read all images into memory as well, which makes sense seeing as when
the user does "File/Save" it is going to have to write them all back out
again, even though none of them changed.  The net effect is that
start-up is slow.  Double-clicking an OpenDocument file brings up a
progress bar rather than the first slide.
This results in a bad user experience.
The situation grows ever more annoying as
the document size increases.

</p></li><li><p><b>More memory is required.</b>
</p><p>
Because ZIP archives are optimized for storing big chunks of content, they
encourage a style of programming where the entire document is read into
memory at startup, all editing occurs in memory, then the entire document
is written to disk during "File/Save".  OpenOffice and its descendants
embrace that pattern.

</p><p>
One might argue that it is ok, in this era of multi-gigabyte desktops, to
read the entire document into memory.
But it is not ok.
For one, the amount of memory used far exceeds the (compressed) file size
on disk.  So a 50MB presentation might take 200MB or more RAM.  
That still is not a problem if one only edits a single document at a time.  
But when working on a talk, this author will typically have 10 or 15 different 
presentations up all at the same
time (to facilitate copy/paste of slides from past presentation) and so
gigabytes of memory are required.
Add in an open web browser or two and a few other 
desktop apps, and suddenly the disk is whirling and the machine is swapping.
And even having just a single document is a problem when working
on an inexpensive Chromebook retrofitted with Ubuntu.
Using less memory is always better.
</p>

</li><li><p><b>Crash recovery is difficult.</b>
</p><p>
The descendants of OpenOffice tend to segfault more often than commercial
competitors.  Perhaps for this reason, the OpenOffice forks make
periodic backups of their in-memory documents so that users do not lose
all pending edits when the inevitable application crash does occur.
This causes frustrating pauses in the application for the few seconds
while each backup is being made.
After restarting from a crash, the user is presented with a dialog box
that walks them through the recovery process.  Managing the crash
recovery this way involves lots of extra application logic and is
generally an annoyance to the user.

</p></li><li><p><b>Content is inaccessible.</b>
</p><p>
One cannot easily view, change, or extract the content of an 
OpenDocument presentation using generic tools.
The only reasonable way to view or edit an OpenDocument document is to open
it up using an application that is specifically designed to read or write
OpenDocument (read: LibreOffice or one of its cousins).  The situation
could be worse.  One can extract and view individual images (say) from
a presentation using just the "zip" archiver tool.  But it is not reasonable
try to extract the text from a slide.  Remember that all content is stored
in a single "context.xml" file.  That file is XML, so it is a text file.
But it is not a text file that can be managed with an ordinary text
editor.  For the example presentation above, the content.xml file
consist of exactly two lines. The first line of the file is just:

</p><blockquote><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The second line of the file contains 211792 characters of
impenetrable XML.  Yes, 211792 characters all on one line.
This file is a good stress-test for a text editor.
Thankfully, the file is not some obscure
binary format, but in terms of accessibility, it might as well be
written in Klingon.
</p></li></ol>

<h2>First Improvement:  Replace ZIP with SQLite</h2>

<p>
Let us suppose that instead of using a ZIP archive to store its files,
OpenDocument used a very simple SQLite database with the following
single-table schema:

</p><blockquote><pre>CREATE TABLE OpenDocTree(
  filename TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Name of file
  filesize BIGINT,            -- Size of file after decompression
  content BLOB                -- Compressed file content
);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
For this first experiment, nothing else about the file format is changed.
The OpenDocument is still a pile-of-files, only now each file is a row
in an SQLite database rather than an entry in a ZIP archive.
This simple change does not use the power of a relational
database.  Even so, this simple change shows some improvements.

<a name="smaller"></a>

</p><p>
Surprisingly, using SQLite in place of ZIP makes the presentation
file smaller.  Really.  One would think that a relational database file
would be larger than a ZIP archive, but at least in the case of NeoOffice
that is not so.  The following is an actual screen-scrape showing
the sizes of the same NeoOffice presentation, both in its original 
ZIP archive format as generated by NeoOffice (self2014.odp), and 
as repacked as an SQLite database using the 
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/sqlar/doc/trunk/README.md">SQLAR</a> utility:

</p><blockquote><pre>-rw-r--r--  1 drh  staff  10514994 Jun  8 14:32 self2014.odp
-rw-r--r--  1 drh  staff  10464256 Jun  8 14:37 self2014.sqlar
-rw-r--r--  1 drh  staff  10416644 Jun  8 14:40 zip.odp
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The SQLite database file ("self2014.sqlar") is about a
half percent smaller than the equivalent ODP file!  How can this be?
Apparently the ZIP archive generator logic in NeoOffice
is not as efficient as it could be, because when the same pile-of-files
is recompressed using the command-line "zip" utility, one gets a file
("zip.odp") that is smaller still, by another half percent, as seen
in the third line above.  So, a well-written ZIP archive
can be slightly smaller than the equivalent SQLite database, as one would
expect.  But the difference is slight.  The key take-away is that an
SQLite database is size-competitive with a ZIP archive.

</p><p>
The other advantage to using SQLite in place of
ZIP is that the document can now be updated incrementally, without risk
of corrupting the document if a power loss or other crash occurs in the
middle of the update.  (Remember that writes to 
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html">SQLite databases are atomic</a>.)   True, all the
content is still kept in a single big XML file ("content.xml") which must
be completely rewritten if so much as a single character changes.  But
with SQLite, only that one file needs to change.  The other 77 files in the
repository can remain unaltered.  They do not all have to be rewritten,
which in turn makes "File/Save" run much faster and saves wear on SSDs.

</p><h2>Second Improvement:  Split content into smaller pieces</h2>

<p>
A pile-of-files encourages content to be stored in a few large chunks.
In the case of ODP, there are just four XML files that define the layout
off all slides in a presentation.  An SQLite database allows storing
information in a few large chunks, but SQLite is also adept and efficient
at storing information in numerous smaller pieces.

</p><p>
So then, instead of storing all content for all slides in a single
oversized XML file ("content.xml"), suppose there was a separate table
for storing the content of each slide separately.  The table schema
might look something like this:

</p><blockquote><pre>CREATE TABLE slide(
  pageNumber INTEGER,   -- The slide page number
  slideContent TEXT     -- Slide content as XML or JSON
);
CREATE INDEX slide_pgnum ON slide(pageNumber); -- Optional
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The content of each slide could still be stored as compressed XML.
But now each page is stored separately.  So when opening a new document,
the application could simply run:

</p><blockquote><pre>SELECT slideContent FROM slide WHERE pageNumber=1;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This query will quickly and efficiently return the content of the first
slide, which could then be speedily parsed and displayed to the user.
Only one page needs to be read and parsed in order render the first screen,
which means that the first screen appears much faster and
there is no longer a need for an annoying progress bar.

</p><p>If the application wanted
to keep all content in memory, it could continue reading and parsing the
other pages using a background thread after drawing the first page.  Or,
since reading from SQLite is so efficient, the application might 
instead choose to reduce its memory footprint and only keep a single
slide in memory at a time.  Or maybe it keeps the current slide and the
next slide in memory, to facility rapid transitions to the next slide.

</p><p>
Notice that dividing up the content into smaller pieces using an SQLite
table gives flexibility to the implementation.  The application can choose
to read all content into memory at startup.  Or it can read just a
few pages into memory and keep the rest on disk.  Or it can read just
single page into memory at a time.  And different versions of the application
can make different choices without having to make any changes to the
file format.  Such options are not available when all content is in
a single big XML file in a ZIP archive.

</p><p>
Splitting content into smaller pieces also helps File/Save operations
to go faster.  Instead of having to write back the content of all pages
when doing a File/Save, the application only has to write back those
pages that have actually changed.

</p><p>
One minor downside of splitting content into smaller pieces is that
compression does not work as well on shorter texts and so the size of
the document might increase.  But as the bulk of the document space 
is used to store images, a small reduction in the compression efficiency 
of the text content will hardly be noticeable, and is a small price 
to pay for an improved user experience.

</p><h2>Third Improvement:  Versioning</h2>

<p>
Once one is comfortable with the concept of storing each slide separately,
it is a small step to support versioning of the presentation.  Consider
the following schema:

</p><blockquote><pre>CREATE TABLE slide(
  slideId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  derivedFrom INTEGER REFERENCES slide,
  content TEXT     -- XML or JSON or whatever
);
CREATE TABLE version(
  versionId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  priorVersion INTEGER REFERENCES version,
  checkinTime DATETIME,   -- When this version was saved
  comment TEXT,           -- Description of this version
  manifest TEXT           -- List of integer slideIds
);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In this schema, instead of each slide having a page number that determines
its order within the presentation, each slide has a unique
integer identifier that is unrelated to where it occurs in sequence.
The order of slides in the presentation is determined by a list of
slideIds, stored as a text string in the MANIFEST column of the VERSION
table.
Since multiple entries are allowed in the VERSION table, that means that
multiple presentations can be stored in the same document.

</p><p>
On startup, the application first decides which version it
wants to display.  Since the versionId will naturally increase in time
and one would normally want to see the latest version, an appropriate
query might be:

</p><blockquote><pre>SELECT manifest, versionId FROM version ORDER BY versionId DESC LIMIT 1;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Or perhaps the application would rather use the
most recent checkinTime:

</p><blockquote><pre>SELECT manifest, versionId, max(checkinTime) FROM version;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Using a single query such as the above, the application obtains a list
of the slideIds for all slides in the presentation.  The application then
queries for the content of the first slide, and parses and displays that
content, as before.

</p><p>(Aside:  Yes, that second query above that uses "max(checkinTime)"
really does work and really does return a well-defined answer in SQLite.
Such a query either returns an undefined answer or generates an error
in many other SQL database engines, but in SQLite it does what you would 
expect: it returns the manifest and versionId of the entry that has the
maximum checkinTime.)

</p><p>When the user does a "File/Save", instead of overwriting the modified
slides, the application can now make new entries in the SLIDE table for
just those slides that have been added or altered.  Then it creates a
new entry in the VERSION table containing the revised manifest.

</p><p>The VERSION table shown above has columns to record a check-in comment
(presumably supplied by the user) and the time and date at which the File/Save
action occurred.  It also records the parent version to record the history
of changes.  Perhaps the manifest could be stored as a delta from the
parent version, though typically the manifest will be small enough that
storing a delta might be more trouble than it is worth.  The SLIDE table
also contains a derivedFrom column which could be used for delta encoding
if it is determined that saving the slide content as a delta from its
previous version is a worthwhile optimization.

</p><p>So with this simple change, the ODP file now stores not just the most
recent edit to the presentation, but a history of all historic edits.  The
user would normally want to see just the most recent edition of the
presentation, but if desired, the user can now go backwards in time to 
see historical versions of the same presentation.

</p><p>Or, multiple presentations could be stored within the same document.

</p><p>With such a schema, the application would no longer need to make
periodic backups of the unsaved changes to a separate file to avoid lost
work in the event of a crash.  Instead, a special "pending" version could
be allocated and unsaved changes could be written into the pending version.
Because only changes would need to be written, not the entire document,
saving the pending changes would only involve writing a few kilobytes of
content, not multiple megabytes, and would take milliseconds instead of
seconds, and so it could be done frequently and silently in the background.
Then when a crash occurs and the user reboots, all (or almost all)
of their work is retained.  If the user decides to discard unsaved changes, 
they simply go back to the previous version.

</p><p>
There are details to fill in here.
Perhaps a screen can be provided that displays a history changes
(perhaps with a graph) allowing the user to select which version they
want to view or edit.  Perhaps some facility can be provided to merge
forks that might occur in the version history.  And perhaps the
application should provide a means to purge old and unwanted versions.
The key point is that using an SQLite database to store the content,
rather than a ZIP archive, makes all of these features much, much easier
to implement, which increases the possibility that they will eventually
get implemented.

</p><h2>And So Forth...</h2>

<p>
In the previous sections, we have seen how moving from a key/value
store implemented as a ZIP archive to a simple SQLite database
with just three tables can add significant capabilities to an application
file format.
We could continue to enhance the schema with new tables, with indexes
added for performance, with triggers and views for programming convenience,
and constraints to enforce consistency of content even in the face of
programming errors.  Further enhancement ideas include:
</p><ul>
<li> Store an <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/undoredo.html">automated undo/redo stack</a> in a database table so that
     Undo could go back into prior edit sessions.
</li><li> Add <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#fts4">full text search</a> capabilities to the slide deck, or across
     multiple slide decks.
</li><li> Decompose the "settings.xml" file into an SQL table that
     is more easily viewed and edited by separate applications.
</li><li> Break out the "Presentor Notes" from each slide into a separate
     table, for easier access from third-party applications and/or scripts.
</li><li> Enhance the presentation concept beyond the simple linear sequence of
     slides to allow for side-tracks and excursions to be taken depending on
     how the audience is responding.
</li></ul>

<p>
An SQLite database has a lot of capability, which
this essay has only begun to touch upon.  But hopefully this quick glimpse
has convinced some readers that using an SQL database as an application
file format is worth a second look.

</p><p>
Some readers might resist using SQLite as an application
file format due to prior exposure to enterprise SQL databases and
the caveats and limitations of those other systems.  
For example, many enterprise database
engines advise against storing large strings or BLOBs in the database
and instead suggest that large strings and BLOBs be stored as separate
files and the filename stored in the database.  But SQLite 
is not like that.  Any column of an SQLite database can hold
a string or BLOB up to about a gigabyte in size.  And for strings and
BLOBs of 100 kilobytes or less, 
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html">I/O performance is better</a> than using separate
files.

</p><p>
Some readers might be reluctant to consider SQLite as an application
file format because they have been inculcated with the idea that all
SQL database schemas must be factored into third normal form and store
only small primitive data types such as strings and integers.  Certainly
relational theory is important and designers should strive to understand
it.  But, as demonstrated above, it is often quite acceptable to store
complex information as XML or JSON in text fields of a database.
Do what works, not what your database professor said you ought to do.

</p><h2>Review Of The Benefits Of Using SQLite</h2>

<p>
In summary,
the claim of this essay is that using SQLite as a container for an application
file format like OpenDocument
and storing lots of smaller objects in that container
works out much better than using a ZIP archive holding a few larger objects.
To wit:

</p><ol>
<li><p>
An SQLite database file is approximately the same size, and in some cases
smaller, than a ZIP archive holding the same information.

</p></li><li><p>
The <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html">atomic update capabilities</a>
of SQLite allow small incremental changes
to be safely written into the document.  This reduces total disk I/O
and improves File/Save performance, enhancing the user experience.

</p></li><li><p>
Startup time is reduced by allowing the application to read in only the
content shown for the initial screen.  This largely eliminates the
need to show a progress bar when opening a new document.  The document
just pops up immediately, further enhancing the user experience.

</p></li><li><p>
The memory footprint of the application can be dramatically reduced by
only loading content that is relevant to the current display and keeping
the bulk of the content on disk.  The fast query capability of SQLite
make this a viable alternative to keeping all content in memory at all times.
And when applications use less memory, it makes the entire computer more
responsive, further enhancing the user experience.

</p></li><li><p>
The schema of an SQL database is able to represent information more directly
and succinctly than a key/value database such as a ZIP archive.  This makes
the document content more accessible to third-party applications and scripts
and facilitates advanced features such as built-in document versioning, and
incremental saving of work in progress for recovery after a crash.
</p></li></ol>

<p>
These are just a few of the benefits of using SQLite as an application file
format — the benefits that seem most likely to improve the user
experience for applications like OpenOffice.  Other applications might
benefit from SQLite in different ways. See the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/appfileformat.html">Application File Format</a>
document for additional ideas.

</p><p>
Finally, let us reiterate that this essay is a thought experiment.
The OpenDocument format is well-established and already well-designed.
Nobody really believes that OpenDocument should be changed to use SQLite
as its container instead of ZIP.  Nor is this article a criticism of
OpenDocument for not choosing SQLite as its container since OpenDocument
predates SQLite.  Rather, the point of this article is to use OpenDocument
as a concrete example of how SQLite can be used to build better 
application file formats for future projects.

        <p>September 13, 2023 at  2:40 PM by Dr. Drang</p>
        <p>During <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">yesterday’s keynote</a>, I learned some things about the switch from stainless steel to titanium in the iPhone 15 Pro that I’d been guessing about before. I also did some quick and dirty calculations that might explain why <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2065050/iphone-15-pro-apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-hands-on.html">Jason Snell thought</a> the 15 Pro seemed distinctly lighter than the 14 Pro, even though the weight reduction is only 9–10%.</p>

<p>The titanium alloy used in the phone was revealed by Isabel Yang about 57 minutes into the presentation. She called it Grade 5 titanium, which is an <a href="https://www.astm.org/b0265-20a.html">ASTM designation</a>. It’s also known as Ti-6Al-4V, because its major alloying elements are aluminum at 6% and vanadium at 4%. <a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/2023/09/titanium-iphone/">Allison Sheridan talked about its properties</a> earlier this month, and I’ve been assuming that it would be the alloy Apple would choose ever since I heard they were switching to titanium for the band.</p>

<p>I guessed it would be Ti-6Al-4V because it’s the garden-variety alloy for titanium. A great material, but not exotic in any way. Apart from many aerospace applications, it’s also used in medical implants, so you know that skin contact won’t be a problem.</p>

<p>Shortly after the introduction of the alloy, Yang talked about how the titanium band is attached to the rest of the phone’s structure, which is aluminum. According to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-unveils-iphone-15-pro-and-iphone-15-pro-max/">Apple’s newsroom</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, the titanium bands encase a new substructure made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with incredible strength through solid-state diffusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the titanium and aluminum are welded together. Not the kind of welding you’re used to, to be sure, but still welding—solid-state welding with no melting of either material. The thermo part of the “thermo-mechanical process” is heating up the materials, and the mechanical part is smushing them together. In essence, this is the oldest form of welding, the kind the village smithy did under the spreading chestnut tree with a forge and a hammer.</p>

<p>I’m sure the process control needed to do solid-state welding with such thin parts is well beyond what other companies can achieve, and I can understand why Apple didn’t want to describe it using a term that conjures up images of sweaty guys in tilt-down helmets making sparks in a dusty manufacturing plant. But it’s still welding.</p>

<p>Finally, we come to Jason Snell’s surprise at how light the 15 Pro seemed when he played with it in the hands-on area. He mentioned this not only in his <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2065050/iphone-15-pro-apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-hands-on.html">Macworld article</a>, but also in <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/476">the post-keynote episode of <em>Upgrade</em></a>. You wouldn’t expect a change from 206 g for the 14 Pro to 187 g for the 15 Pro would be that noticeable, but Greg Joswiak mentioned it in the keynote and Jason confirmed it. How can that be?</p>

<p>One answer is that people are just more sensitive than we give them credit for being. A 9–10% drop in weight may seem like a small amount to our brains but a large amount to our hands. But because it allowed me to do some simple calculations, I decided to look into another possibility.</p>

<p>Your ability to manipulate a phone is based primarily on its mass, but also on its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia">moment of inertia</a>. And since the reduction in mass when switching from stainless steel to titanium is occurring almost entirely at the perimeter of the phone, the moment of inertia should be reduced more than if the mass were reduced uniformly.</p>

<p>Let’s assume the two phones are the same size<sup id="fnref:smaller"><a href="#fn:smaller" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, 147.5 mm high by 71.5 mm wide (the 7.85 mm thickness can be ignored). We’ll set the origin at the geometric center of the phone and the x, y, and z axes will be associated with what would normally be called pitch, roll, and yaw. We’ll be doing enough approximating that there’s no point in trying to account for the phone’s rounded corners.</p>

<p><img width="60%" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2023/20230913-iPhone%20cuboid%20with%20axes.png" alt="iPhone cuboid with axes" title="iPhone cuboid with axes"></p>

<p>If the 187 g mass of the 15 Pro were distributed uniformly, its moment of inertia about the x-axis would be</p><p>

\[I_{xx}^{(15)} = \frac{1}{12}(187 \;\mathrm{g})(147.5 \;\mathrm{mm})^2 = 339,035\; \mathrm{gm \cdot mm^2}\]

</p><p>If we assume the 14 Pro’s additional 19 g of mass is distributed uniformly around the perimeter, we can say that the long sides have</p><p>

\[\frac{147.5 \;\mathrm{mm}}{2(147.5 \;\mathrm{mm} + 71.5 \;\mathrm{mm})} (19 \;\mathrm{g}) = 6.4  \;\mathrm{g}\]

</p><p>of extra mass and the short sides have</p><p>

\[\frac{71.5 \;\mathrm{mm}}{2(147.5 \;\mathrm{mm} + 71.5 \;\mathrm{mm})} (19 \;\mathrm{g}) = 3.1 \;\mathrm{g}\]

</p><p>of extra mass. The moment of inertia of the these four lines of additional mass about the x-axis is</p><p>

\[I_{xx}^{(lines)} = 2 \left[ \frac{1}{12}(6.4 \;\mathrm{g})(147.5 \;\mathrm{mm})^2 + (3.1 \;\mathrm{g})\left(\frac{147.5 \;\mathrm{mm}}{2}\right)^2 \right]\]

\[I_{xx}^{(lines)} = 56,929 \;\mathrm{g \cdot mm^2}\]

</p><p>You’ll note the use of the parallel axis theorem in the second term inside the brackets. I’m not calculating the moments of inertia of the top and bottom lines about their own axes because that’s too small to worry about.</p>

<p>Therefore, the moment of inertia of the 14 Pro is</p><p>

\[I_{xx}^{(14)} = I_{xx}^{(15)} + I_{xx}^{(lines)} = 395,964 \;\mathrm{g \cdot mm^2}\]

</p><p>and the reduction in the moment of inertia about the x-axis is</p><p>

\[\frac{I_{xx}^{(14)} - I_{xx}^{(15)}}{I_{xx}^{(14)}} = \frac{56,929}{395,964} = 0.144\]

</p><p>or 14–15%. This reduction, which is more than the mass reduction, would make the iPhone 15 Pro easier to turn, and that may add to the impression that it’s significantly lighter than the 14 Pro.</p>

<p>These calculations were fun, but the initial assumption, that the 15 Pro’s mass is uniformly distributed, is unquestionably wrong. How wrong depends on how non-uniform the mass distribution is, and if I knew that I wouldn’t have had to make the assumption in the first place. My guess is that the assumption is good enough for this kind of back-of-the-envelope calculation.</p>

<p>But even if the numbers are further off than I think, the concept is correct. Reducing the mass at the perimeter, which the change from stainless steel to titanium has done, has definitely reduced the moment of inertia more than a uniform reduction in mass would have. And that will make the 15 Pro easier to manipulate and will contribute—at least somewhat—to the impression of lightness.</p>

<p>You can, of course, do the same sort of calculation for the moments of inertia about the roll and yaw axes. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<section>
<p>FoundationDB is a very impressive database. Its <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/files/fdb-paper.pdf">paper</a> won the best industry paper award in SIGMOD'21. In this post, I will explain, in detail, how FDB works and discuss a few very interesting design choices they made. It's a dense paper packed with neat ideas. Many details (sometimes even proof of correctness) are not included in the paper. I added proof wherever necessary.</p>
<h2 id="whatisfoundationdb">What is FoundationDB?</h2>
<p>It's a <em>non-sharded</em>, <em>strict serializable</em>, fault tolerant, <em>key-value</em> store that supports point writes, reads and range reads. Notice that it provides a key-value API (not SQL). It's also not sharded, meaning the entire key space is essentially on one logical shard. That's it. Once you have a strict serializable key-value store, you can layer a SQL engine and secondary indexes on top. A strict serializable (can be relaxed if needed obviously) key-value store is the foundation (a smaller reusable component), upon which you can build distributed databases almost<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> however you want. This is a <em>great</em> design choice.</p>
<h2 id="boldclaims">Bold Claims</h2>
<p>The paper makes a few jaw-dropping claims in the intro.</p>
<ul>
<li>FDB is strict serializable and lock-free. How is this possible?
<ul>
<li>me: Don't you have to take locks to guarantee order?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For a global FDB deployment, it can avoid x-region write latency.
<ul>
<li>me: Hmm... OK. It's possible if you make some assumptions about failure domains.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FDB can tolerate <em>f</em> failures with only <em>f+1</em> replicas.
<ul>
<li>me: You gotta be kidding me!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will come back to all these jaw-dropping claims. If these claims don't excite you, this post and the paper are probably not for you.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-05-at-11.01.20-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-07-05-at-11.01.20-AM" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>FDB takes the idea of microservice to the extreme (they call it decoupling). Almost every single functionality is handled by a distinct service (stateful or stateless). Embrace yourself for many names for different roles.</p>
<h4 id="controlplane">Control Plane</h4>
<p>The most important Control Plane service in the diagram is the <em>Coordinator</em>. It basically stores small metadata about the entire FDB deployment/configuration (e.g. the current epoch, which gets bumped every time a reconfiguration/recovery takes place). <em>ClusterController</em> monitors the health of all servers (presumably via heartbeats, as it's not mentioned in the paper).</p>
<h4 id="dataplane">Data Plane</h4>
<p>FDB breaks the Data Plane into three parts, Transaction System, Log System and Storage System. Log System and Storage System are mostly what you would expect – a distributed log and a disaggregated, sharded storage. The Transaction System is the most interesting one, among which the <em>Sequencer</em> is the most critical service.</p>
<h2 id="transactionmanagement">Transaction Management</h2>
<ol>
<li>A client is always connected to a Proxy, which communicates with FDB internal services.</li>
<li>The Proxy will get a read-version in the form of HLC (hybrid logical clock) from the <em>Sequencer</em>. Notice that there's only one (not logical) physical <em>Sequencer</em> in the system, which serves as a single point of serialization (ordering). The <em>Sequencer</em> conceptually has the following API, which keeps producing monotonically increasing HLCs(or LSNs).<br>
<img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-17-at-11.58.41-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-07-17-at-11.58.41-PM" loading="lazy"> The singularity of the <em>Sequencer</em> is critical, as it provides <em>the</em> ordering of all relevant events of an entire FDB deployment. HLC and LSN are interchangeable for the rest of this post.</li>
<li>The client then issues reads to <em>Storage</em> with the specific read-version, acquired from the <em>Sequencer</em>. Storage System will return data at the specific point-in-time indicated by the read-version (an HLC) – MVCC.</li>
<li>The client then asks <em>Sequencer</em> again for a commit-version.</li>
<li>Next, it sends the write-set <em>and</em> the read-set to the <em>Resolver</em>. <em>Resolvers</em> are range-sharded and they keep a short history of recent writes. Here, it detects if there are any conflicts (i.e. if the data read earlier in the transaction has changed or not, between <code>[read-version, commit-version]</code>).</li>
<li>If no conflict is detected, commit the writes to the Log System with commit-version. Once enough ACKs have been received from the logs, the <em>Proxy</em> returns success to the client.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's basically Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC), very straightforward. In this example, it actually doesn't even need MVCC. Because if there are conflicts, i.e. what the client read has changed, the transaction will be either aborted or retried anyway. MVCC support in FDB is there to support snapshot reads, and read-only transactions.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Bhaskar Muppana, one of the authors of the paper, pointed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6823635315471863808?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6823635315471863808%2C6826392929918160896%29">one mistake</a> I had in the following paragraph. It has been corrected. Thanks, Bhaskar.</em></p>
<p><s>The reason why <em>Proxy</em> is needed is that it allows reading uncommitted writes within a transaction, which is a very common semantic provided by almost all relational databases. It's achieved by buffering uncommitted writes locally on the Proxy servers, and merging these writes with storage data for reads on the same keys.</s> Client (notice not <em>Proxy</em>) caches uncommitted writes to support read-uncommitted-writes in the same transaction. This type of read-repair is only feasible for a simple k/v data model. Anything slightly more complicated, e.g. a graph data model, would introduce a significant amount of complexity. Caching is done on the client, so read queries can bypass the entire transaction system. Reads can be served either locally from client cache or from storage nodes.</p>
<p><em>Proxy</em> sits between clients and the transaction system. Its responsibility is to serve as a semi-stateful "client". E.g. it remembers the <em>KCV</em> to aid recovery; it performs batching (of requests from multiple clients) for reducing <em>Sequencer</em> qps.</p>
<p><em>Resolvers</em> are range-sharded, hence they can perform conflict checks in parallel. That means <em>Proxy</em> needs to wait to hear back from all <em>Resolvers</em> involved in each transaction. How does a <em>Resolver</em> get recently <em>committed</em> keys and their versions? It doesn't actually. Otherwise, it would require a distributed transaction between the <em>Log</em> and the <em>Resolver</em>. The workaround is that <em>Resolvers</em> keep a set of recent <strong>write-attempts</strong> and their versions. It's possible that a key appears to be recently written in a <em>Resolver</em> while in fact its transaction is rolled back, leading to false positives. FDB claims the false positives are manageable because:</p>
<ol>
<li>most workloads fall onto one <em>Resolve</em> (hence it would know if it needs to record the commit-attempt or not)</li>
<li>the MVCC window is 5 seconds. Waiting it out is not the end of the world, for conflicts are only around a single key – partial unavailability.</li>
</ol>
<p>How about racing commits? E.g. A Resolver can first admit a transaction with read-version <code>Vr</code> and commit-version <code>Vc</code>. Later, another transaction with commit-version <code>Vr &lt; Vc2 &lt; Vc</code> can hit the Resolver. In this case, the log servers will make sure to accept Vc2 first before accepting Vc, preserving linearizability. All messages in all log servers are sorted in LSN (See 2.4.2, "Similarly, StorageServers pull log data from LogServers in increasing LSNs as well.").</p>
<p><em>Resolver</em> doesn't need locks to detect conflicts. That's why FDB claims itself to be "lock-free". I found this mention of "lock-free" misleading. In order to realize strict serializability, locks must be used <em>somewhere</em> in the system to implement this total ordering. The <em>Sequencer</em> might have locks inside (not mentioned in the paper). Or even if there's only a single IO thread in the <em>Sequencer</em>, the kernel must use locks to maintain a queue of network packets. Even atomic memory operations are essentially implemented by locks in hardware. Without locks, ordering <em>can't</em> be achieved.</p>
<p>I know you are probably thinking about what if <em>Sequencer</em> or <em>Resolver</em> goes down. We will get there.</p>
<h2 id="loggingprotocol">Logging Protocol</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-16-at-11.57.52-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-07-16-at-11.57.52-AM" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>FDB's logging protocol, at first glance, seems pretty straightforward. It has a group of logs, and a separate group of storage servers with distinct replication factors and topologies – another example of physical decoupling in FDB. If you dive a little deeper, you will notice that things are much more interesting.</p>
<p>There are multiple <em>LogServers</em>. Remember, FDB provides an abstraction of one logical shard (non-sharded) database. Commonly, people use logs for sequencing (e.g. Raft), in which case, each log is mapped to a logical shard. So how does FDB provide a single shard abstraction with multiple logs? The answer is <strong>FDB decouples <em>sequencing</em> from <em>logging</em></strong>. There is only one <em>Sequencer</em> in the system, which maps to the single shard abstraction (ordering). It enables FDB to have multiple logs, as they do <em>not</em> perform the job of ordering, which logs in other systems usually do. This design is just brilliant. Whoever performs the job of sequencing must be singular. You will get higher throughput and lower latency by having a dedicated role just doing sequencing, and <em>nothing</em> else. In contrast, systems like Raft couple sequencing and logging, which inherently pay a performance cost. In FDB, the <em>Sequencer</em> is physically a singleton – there's a single process. We will talk about failure recovery very soon. Here's what the logging protocol looks like,</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Proxy</em> broadcasts a message to <strong>all</strong> <em>LogServers</em>. Each message will have a common header including <code>LSN</code>, <code>prevLSN</code> and <code>KCV</code>. <code>KCV</code> is the last known committed version from the <em>Proxy</em>. It should always be less than the <code>LSN</code> (<code>KCV &lt; LSN</code>), as the transaction associated with <code>LSN</code> is still in progress (hence not committed). <code>KCV</code> captures an incomplete local view of the world, which will be used later for the recovery process.</li>
<li>Not all broadcast messages include data. E.g. key <code>A</code> is stored on storage shard <code>S</code>. <em>Coordinator</em> maintains an affinity map (each storage server has one preferred LogServer). In this case, data will only be included in the message sent to shard <code>S</code>'s preferred LogServer (and potentially additional LogServers to satisfy replication requirements). All other messages to other LogServers will only include the common header.</li>
<li>Once the data is in the log, it will apply to the storage node. It's not super interesting, although there are some performance improvements mentioned in the paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few interesting details above. <em>Proxy</em> broadcasts a message to "all" logs. Why all logs instead of only the replicas for the key? Because all messages are applied in order on each log. There can be no gaps. Also, as you will see later, that it's critical for the recovery process. Another related question is why sending messages without data to other logs? This is a performance optimization, as only logs associated with the underlying storage nodes need to have data stored.</p>
<p>Because FDB decouples sequencing from logging, now committing to the logs becomes a distributed transaction problem – e.g. what if log-1 has some data stored, while log-2 doesn't, for an aborted transaction. Does FDB need to perform 2pc? No, actually.</p>
<p>FDB here basically adopts the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEw8fzoPLxAhX6KFkFHU1eB14QFjAAegQIBRAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcs.yale.edu%2Fhomes%2Fthomson%2Fpublications%2Fcalvin-sigmod12.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0XE8ck-WBihvUiGgAnzr2H">Calvin</a> approach. It's the same idea that Prof. Abadi <a href="https://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2019/01/its-time-to-move-on-from-two-phase.html">posted</a>. The keyword is <em>deterministic</em>. We don't need 2pc here, because <em>Proxy</em> writing to multiple logs is performed <em>blindly</em> (a.k.a unconditionally). Sure, errors can happen. If they are transient e.g. timeout, <em>Proxy</em> can always try again – it will never be blocked by another log commit. This is, by the way, why FDB can afford letting <em>Proxies</em> broadcast each message to <em>all</em> logs.</p>
<p>In this case, the only failure scenario that can actually block log commit and require rollback, is when <em>LogServers</em> actually fail (e.g. crash). We will talk about the recovery process soon.</p>
<p>Notice that in the diagram above, there are 5 logs and 10 storage nodes (and one <em>Sequencer</em> not in the diagram). <code>#StorageNode &gt; #Logs &gt; #Sequencer</code> is not a coincidence. A single <em>Sequencer</em> can support multiple logs, as a <em>Sequencer</em> is much more lightweight (not having to write to disk). A single log again can support multiple storage nodes, as logs are relatively cheaper than storage (you can prune logs, sequential writes are cheaper, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="recoveryprocess">Recovery Process</h2>
<p>Finally, the real fun begins. What happens if the <em>Sequencer</em> fails? <em>Resolvers</em> fail? <em>LogServers</em> fail?</p>
<ol>
<li>Failures are detected by the <em>ClusterController</em> (via heartbeats according to the <a href="https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/blob/master/design/recovery-internals.md">source</a>), who explicitly triggers the recovery process.</li>
<li>The <em>Sequencer</em> locks and reads the previous states from <em>Coordinators</em>. It can be a new <em>Sequencer</em> instance, running the recovery process, if the previous <em>Sequencer</em> is in a faulty state. That's why we need to lock the <em>Coordinator</em> here, to avoid multiple <em>Sequencers</em> making topology changes at the same time. The paper doesn't talk about what happens if the recovery Sequencer itself crashes, leaving the Coordinators locked forever. This is a classic consensus problem. Given the Coordinators are already running Paxos, this is not a hard problem to solve. E.g. You can think of each recovery itself being a Paxos Proposal. If a recovery Sequencer died halfway, another Sequencer can always come and discover the previous chosen value if any, or propose a new epoch – starting a new recovery process.</li>
<li>Previous states include information about all old <em>LogServers</em>. The <em>Sequencer</em> then stops old logs from accepting new transactions. The <em>Sequencer</em> knowing it's running a recovery process, obviously won't accept new transactions. But if there's another old <em>Sequencer</em> instance running, it can still accept new transactions. Hence we need to stop the old logs to avoid potential dataloss. Another reason for contacting the old <em>LogServers</em> is to discover the end of the redo log (the last committed LSN).</li>
<li>The <em>Sequencer</em> recruits a new set of <em>Proxies</em>, <em>Resolvers</em>, and <em>LogServers</em>.</li>
<li>Write the new system states to the <em>Coordinators</em>, and release the lock.</li>
<li>Finally, the new <em>Sequencer</em> starts accepting new transactions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike other fault tolerance algorithms, e.g. Paxos, <strong>FDB's recovery process has <em>downtime</em></strong> – from the shutdown of old <em>LogServers</em> to when the new <em>Sequencer</em> starts accepting new transactions. One can argue that this is not really <em>fault tolerant</em>. I personally think it's totally fine to have partial downtime to heal a system (given a short one, which is the case for FDB), e.g. unavailability for a single shard. It's not like systems such as Paxos or Raft have 100% availability even when the simple majority of hosts are always up and running. However FDB has only <em>one</em> logical shard. Its recovery process causes downtime for the entire deployment and the entire key space.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-19-at-11.33.17-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-07-19-at-11.33.17-AM" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>P50 downtime for FDB's recovery process is 3.08s. That means no one can write to FDB at all during this window. The paper argues clients can still read from storage nodes unaffected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the recovery, read-write transactions were temporarily blocked and were retried after timeout. However, client reads were not impacted, because they are served by StorageServers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement seems not completely accurate. Snapshot reads are unaffected. But if <em>Sequencer</em> is down, no read-only transactions can be processed either. FDB is read-heavy. It's very reasonable to assume that most of the production read workloads are snapshot reads (instead of read-only transactions). Claiming minimum client visible impact is reasonable.</p>
<p>If a system allows downtime, it can tolerate a lot of replicas going down without affecting it's availability. E.g. With the simplest leader-follower setup, a single leader can have any number of followers (let's say 10). In this case, with a total replication factor of 11, in theory, we can tolerate up to 10 failures without a single second of downtime.</p>
<p><em>Proxies</em> are easy to recover, as they are mostly stateless (just keeping track of a <code>KCV</code> locally). <em>Resolvers</em> are stateful, but it's safe to discard all <em>Resolvers</em> data from the previous epoch. Because it's impossible to have conflicts spanning across two epochs, as you can't have read-write transactions that span two epochs (as a completely new set of Proxies are recruited). That leaves us with the logs and the <em>Sequencer</em>, which are harder to recover. We just need to know the last committed LSN from the old logs to start a new <em>Sequencer</em> instance. Let's take a closer look at the recovery process of the <em>LogServers</em>.</p>
<h4 id="logrecovery">Log Recovery</h4>
<p><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-20-at-3.15.38-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-07-20-at-3.15.38-PM" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>For a LogServer deployment with <em>m</em> hosts and replication factor <em>k</em>, here's how the algorithm looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each log maintains <code>DV</code> (Durable Version, the maximum persisted LSN) and <code>KCV</code> (Known last committed version, the latest committed version known from the <em>Proxy</em>). Both <em>DV</em> and <em>KCV</em> are piggy-backed on each message from Proxy to the logs.</li>
<li>The <em>Sequencer</em> attempts to stop <em>all</em> old logs.</li>
<li>After hearing back from <em>m-k+1</em> logs, the <em>Sequencer</em> knows the previous epoch has committed transactions <strong>at least</strong> up to <code>max(KCVs)</code>. We call <code>max(KCVs)</code> here <code>PEV</code> (Previous Epoch's end Version). The new <em>Sequencer</em> will start its epoch from <code>PEV+1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems pretty straightforward. However, the paper mentions another variable <code>RV</code> (Recovery Version) to be <code>min(DVs)</code>, and it talks about copying data between <code>[PEV+1, RV]</code> from the old logs to new logs and discarding logs after <em>RV</em>. This is for,</p>
<ol>
<li>providing failure atomicity when log commit fails partially (in which case, we need to perform rollback)</li>
<li>preserving (healing replication factor) for data that are committed at LSN &gt; PEV</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="proofofcorrectness">Proof of Correctness</h4>
<p><em>The paper didn't include any proof for the correctness of the recovery process. I will explain and prove its correctness here.</em></p>
<p>Notice that any log message arrived at the logs have already passed the conflict detection, hence safe to be durably stored. Especially given the fact that data stored might have already been read by another client, we can and should err on the side of preserving more of the old logs except when it's not safe to do so. We know for sure that all transactions before <em>PEV</em> are committed. We just need to find the <em>tail</em> of the redo log, where</p>
<ol>
<li>partial failures might be happening, for which we must rollback, and</li>
<li>no clients have ever seen the data yet (because it's the tail)</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's take a closer look at this diagram.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-20-at-11.16.41-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2021-07-20-at-11.16.41-PM" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>For it to be correct (that we can safely discard data after <em>RV</em> and preserve data before <em>RV</em>), the following conditions need to be met:</p>
<ol>
<li>DV<sub>m</sub>'s cross-range-shard transaction cannot be partially committed (no rollback required).</li>
<li>No clients can read any data written after DV<sub>m</sub>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's try proof by contradiction on #1 and #2.</p>
<p>What if DM<sub>m</sub>'s transaction were partially committed (specifically, rollback is required)? Notice that "partial" here specifically means cross-range-shard transaction, e.g. a transaction that sets both key A and key B, key A is stored with data in its logs, but key B is not. In this case, we have to rollback A. Logs can tolerate <em>k-1</em> failures (<em>k</em> being the data replication factor). If at least one surviving B replica has the data for transaction DM<sub>m</sub>, no rollback is required because we have all the data for T<sub>m</sub>, for which we will finish the commit process (heal the replication factor). Otherwise, let's say <em>k-1</em> B replicas that got DM<sub>m</sub> data crashed, there must be at least one B replica up and running that has not received the DM<sub>m</sub> message. On that log, its <em>DV</em> must be smaller than DM<sub>m</sub>. Contradiction.</p>
<p>Now let's move on to #2. Notice that <code>DV &gt;= KCV</code> is true locally for each log, because <code>LSN &gt; KCV</code> is true on each <em>Proxy</em>. Log local <em>DV</em> can sometimes be the same as <em>KCV</em> because reads from the <em>Proxies</em> don't set <em>DV</em> but can bring log local <em>KCV</em> up to date. Even better, <code>max(KCVs) &lt;= min(DVs)</code> should hold always, thanks to the fact that each log commit requires broadcasting the message to <em>all</em> logs. This answers our question earlier why Proxies need to broadcast each log message to <em>all</em> logs. Now it's obvious why #2 holds, because FDB can only serve reads based on <em>KCV</em> (and not <em>DV</em>). So for any <em>DV &gt; DV<sub>m</sub></em>, those transactions must not be committed.</p>
<p>With #1 and #2 combined, we can be confident that we can safely treat <em>RV</em> as the tail of the redo log. The presence of a <em>KCV</em> on a log, implies that the associated transaction is fully replicated (having <em>k</em> copies). It's not covered in the paper, but conceptually we can think of these messages having been durably flushed to storage nodes (safe to discard from the logs). For messages between <code>[PEV+1, RV]</code>, they <em>might</em> be committed transactions. It's safe to err on the side of treating them as committed, as all writes to the logs have already passed conflict detection. These cases would be indistinguishable from reply timeouts. But due to the lack of information, we don't know for sure if messages in the <code>[PEV+1, RV]</code> window have been durably stored in storage nodes or not. The easiest way to handle it is to start the new epoch at <em>PEV+1</em> and replay messages from <code>[PEV+1, RV]</code> from the old logs.</p>
<h2 id="replicationsummary">Replication Summary</h2>
<p>Given the extreme decoupling, each component has its own replication strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Coordinator</em> runs on Paxos, which can tolerate <em>f</em> failures with a cluster size of <em>2f+1</em>.</li>
<li><em>LogServers</em> can tolerate <em>f</em> failures for replication factor <em>f+1</em>, which is orthogonal to the number of servers. Storage nodes share a similar strategy. E.g. there can be a total of 5 logs, with a replication factor of 3, which can tolerate 2 failures.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think FDB is a great system, probably the best k/v store. However, I do think those bold claims at the beginning of the paper are, frankly, misleading.</p>
<ul>
<li>"FDB provides strict serializability while being lock-free". Well, to be more precise, it's meant to say the conflict detection is lock-free. <em>Sequencer</em> is not lock-free for example.</li>
<li>"For global FDB deployment, it can avoid x-region write latency." Well, it's based on semi-sync in a local region in a different failure domain. It requires assumptions about failure domains.</li>
<li>"FDB can tolerate <em>f</em> failures with only <em>f+1</em> replicas." Well, this only applies to logs and storage nodes. If simply majority of the <em>Coordinator</em> fail, FDB is totally hosed for example.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>FDB is probably the best k/v store for regional deployment out there. It's rock solid thanks to its simulation framework. The FDB team, in my opinion, made all the best design choices, which is just remarkable. The paper is dense. A lot of important details are only briefly mentioned or even omitted, which is probably due to the paper length limit. Congratulations to the FoundationDB team.</p>

  <h2 id="_Introduction">1. Introduction <a href="#_Introduction">§</a></h2>
<p>If you reach this page, you may be interested into this new category of Linux distributions labeled "immutable".
</p>
<p>In this category, one can find by age (oldest → youngest) NixOS, Guix, Endless OS, Fedora Silverblue, OpenSUSE MicroOS, Vanilla OS and many new to come.
</p>
<p>I will give examples of immutability implementation, then detail my thoughts about immutability, and why I think this naming can be misleading.  I spent a few months running all of those distributions on my main computers (NAS, Gaming, laptop, workstation) to be able to write this text.
</p>
<h2 id="_What's_immutability?">2. What's immutability? <a href="#_What's_immutability?">§</a></h2>
<p>The word immutability itself refers to an object that can't change.
</p>
<p>However, when it comes to an immutable operating system, the definition immediately become vague.  What would be an operating system that can't change?  What would you be supposed to do with it?
</p>
<p>We could say that a Linux LIVE-CD is immutable, because every time you boot it, you get the exact same programs running, and you can't change anything as the disk media is read only.  But while the LIVE-CD is running, you can make changes to it, you can create files and directories, install packages, it's not stuck in an immutable state.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this example was nice but the immutability approach by those Linux distribution is totally different, so we need to think a bit further.
</p>
<p>There are three common principles in these systems:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>system upgrades aren't done on the live system</li>
  <li>packages changes are applied on the next boot</li>
  <li>you can roll back a change</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the implementation, a system may offer more features.  But this list is what a Linux distribution should have to be labelled "immutable" at the moment.
</p>
<h2 id="_Immutable_systems_comparison">3. Immutable systems comparison <a href="#_Immutable_systems_comparison">§</a></h2>
<p>Now we found what are the minimum requirements to be called immutable, let's go through each implementation, by their order of appearance.
</p>
<h2 id="_NixOS_/_Guix">3.1. NixOS / Guix <a href="#_NixOS_/_Guix">§</a></h2>
<p>In this section, I'm mixing NixOS and Guix as they both rely on the same implementation.  NixOS is based on Nix (first appearance in 2003), which has been forked into early 2010s into the Guix package manager to be 100% libre, which gave birth to an eponym operating system also 100% free.
</p>
<p><a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS official project website</a></p>
<p><a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix official project website</a></p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanlorimer.dev/posts/nix-thesis.html">Jonathan Lorimer's blog post explaining Eelco Dolstra's thesis about Nix</a></p>
<p>These two systems are really different than a traditional Unix like system we are used to, and immutability is a main principle.  To make it quick, they are based on their package manager (being Nix or Guix) that contains every package or built file into a special read-only directory (where only the package manager can write) where each package has its own unique entry, and the operating system itself is a byproduct of the package manager.
</p>
<p>What does that imply?  If the operating system is built, this is because it's made of source code, you literally describe what you want your system to be in a declarative way.  You have to list users, their shells, installed packages, running services and their configurations, partitions to mount with which options etc... Fortunately, it's made a lot easier by the use of modules which provide sane defaults, so if you create a user, you don't have to specify its UID, GID, shell, home etc...
</p>
<p>So, as the system is built and stored in the special read-only directory, all your system is derived from that (using symbolic links), so all the files handled by the package manager are read-only.  A concrete example is that /etc/fstab or /bin/sh ARE read-only, if you want to make a change in those, you have to do it through the package manager.
</p>
<p>I'm not going into details, because this store based package manager is really different than everything else but:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>you can switch between two configurations on the fly as it's just a symlink dance to go from a configuration to another</li>
  <li>you can select your configuration at boot time, so you can roll back to a previous version if something is wrong</li>
  <li>you can't make change to a package file or system file as they are read only</li>
  <li>the mount points except the special store directory are all mutable, so you can write changes in /home or /etc or /var etc... You can remove the system symlinks by a modified version, but you can't modify the symlink source itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the immutability as seen through the Nix lens.
</p>
<p>I've spent a few years running NixOS systems, this is really a blast for me, and the best "immutable" implementation around, but unfortunately it's too different, so its adoption rate is very low, despite all the benefits.
</p>
<p><a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/my-issues-when-pushing-nixos-to-companies/28629/1">NixOS forum: My issues when pushing NixOS to companies</a></p>
<h2 id="_Endless_OS">3.2. Endless OS <a href="#_Endless_OS">§</a></h2>
<p>While this one is not the oldest immutable OS around, it's the first one to be released for the average user, while NixOS and Guix are older but for a niche user category.  The company behind Endless OS is trying to offer a solid and reliable system, free and open source, that can works without Internet, to be used in countries with a low Internet / powergrid coverage.  They even provide a version with "offline internet included" containing Wikipedia dumps, class lessons and many things to make a computer useful while offline (I love their work).
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.endlessos.org/">Endless OS official project website</a></p>
<p>Endless OS is based on Debian, but uses the OSTree tool to make it immutable.  OSTree allows you to manage a core system image, and add layers on top of it, think of packages as layers.  But it can also prepare a new system image for the next boot.
</p>
<p>With OSTree, you can apply package changes in a new version of the system that will be available at next boot, and revert to a previous version at boot time.
</p>
<p>The partitions are mounted writable, except for <code>/usr</code>, the land of packages handled by OSTree, which is mounted read-only.  There are no rollbacks possible for <code>/etc</code>.
</p>
<p>Programs meant to be for the user (not the packages to be used by the system like grub, X display or drivers) are installed from Flatpak (which also uses OSTree, but unrelated to the system), this avoids the need to reboot each time you install a new package.
</p>
<p>My experience with Endless OS is mixed, it is an excellent and solid operating system, it's working well, never failed, but I'm just not the target audience.  They provide a modified GNOME desktop that looks like a smartphone menu, because this is what most non-tech users are comfortable with (but I hate it).  And installing DevOps tools isn't practical but not impossible, so I keep Endless OS for my multimedia netbook and I really enjoy it.
</p>
<h2 id="_Fedora_Silverblue">3.3. Fedora Silverblue <a href="#_Fedora_Silverblue">§</a></h2>
<p>This linux distribution is the long descendant of Project Atomic, an old initiative to make Fedora / CentOS/ RHEL immutable.  It's now part of the Fedora releases along with Fedora Workstation.
</p>
<p><a href="https://projectatomic.io/">Project Atomic website</a></p>
<p><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/">Fedora Silverblue project website</a></p>
<p>Fedora Silverblue is also using OSTree, but with a twist.  It's using rpm-OSTree, a tool built on top of OSTree to let your RPM packages apply the changes through OSTree.
</p>
<p>The system consists of a single core image for the release, let's say fedora-38, and for each package installed, a new layer is added on top of the core.  At anytime, you can list all the layers to know what packages have been installed on top of the core, if you remove a package, the whole stack is generated again (which is terribly SLOW) without the package, there is absolutely no leftover after a package removal.
</p>
<p>On boot, you can choose an older version of the system, in case something broke after an upgrade.  If you install a package, you need to reboot to have it available as the change isn't applied on the current booted system, however rpm-OSTree received a nice upgrade, you can temporarily merge the changes of the next boot into the live system (using a tmpfs overlay) to use the changes.
</p>
<p>The mountpount management is a bit different, everything is read-only except <code>/etc/</code>, <code>/root</code> and <code>/var</code>, but your home directory is by default in <code>/var/home</code> which sometimes breaks expectations.  There are no rollbacks possible for <code>/etc</code>.
</p>
<p>As installing a new package is slow due to rpm-OSTree and requires a reboot to be fully usable (the live change back port store the extra changes in memory), they recommend to use Flatpak for programs, or <code>toolbox</code>, some kind of wrapper that create a rootless fedora container where you can install packages and use it in your terminal.  toolbox is meant to provide development libraries or tool you wouldn't have in Flatpak, but that you wouldn't want to install in your base Fedora system.
</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/">toolbox website</a></p>
<p>My experience with Fedora Silverblue has been quite good, it's stable, the updates are smooth even if they are slow.  <code>toolbox</code> was working fine despite I don't find this practical.
</p>
<h2 id="_OpenSUSE_MicroOS">3.4. OpenSUSE MicroOS <a href="#_OpenSUSE_MicroOS">§</a></h2>
<p>This spin of OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (rolling-release OpenSUSE) features immutability, but with its own implementation.  The idea of MicroOS is really simple, the whole system except a few directories like <code>/home</code> or <code>/var</code> lives on a btrfs snapshot, if you want to make a change to the system, the current snapshot is forked into a new snapshot, and the changes are applied there, ready for the next boot.
</p>
<p><a href="https://microos.opensuse.org/">OpenSUSE MicroOS official project website</a></p>
<p>What's interesting here is that <code>/etc</code> IS part of the snapshots, and can be roll backed, which wasn't possible in the OSTree based systems.  It's also possible to make changes to any file of the file system (in a new snapshot, not the live one) using a shell, which can be very practical for injecting files to solve a driver issue.  The downside it's not guaranteed that your system is "pure" if you start making changes, because they won't be tracked, the snapshots are just numbered, and you don't know what changes were made in each of them.
</p>
<p>Changes must be done through the command <code>transactional-update</code> which do all the snapshot work for you, and you could either manipulate package by adding/removing a package, or just start a shell in the new snapshot to make all the changes you want.  I said <code>/etc</code> is part of the snapshots, it's true, but it's never read-only, so you could make a change live in <code>/etc</code>, then create a new snapshot, the change would be immediately inherited.  This can create troubles if you roll back to a previous state after an upgrade if you also made changes to <code>/etc</code> just before.
</p>
<p>The default approach of MicroOS is disturbing at first, a reboot is planned every day after a system update, this is because it's a rolling-release system and there are updates every day, and you won't benefit from them until you reboot.  While you can disable this automatic reboot, it makes sense to use the newest packages anyway, so it's something to consider if you plan to use MicroOS.
</p>
<p>There is currently no way to apply the changes into the live system (like Silverblue is offering), it's still experimental, but I'm confident this will be doable soon.  As such, it's recommended to use <code>distrobox</code> to use rootless containers of various distributions to install your favorite tools for your users, instead of using the base system packages.  I don't really like this because this adds maintenance, and I often had issues of distrobox refusing to start a container after a reboot, I had to destroy and recreate it entirely to solve.
</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox">distrobox GitHub project page</a></p>
<p>My experience with OpenSUSE MicroOS has been wonderful, it's in dual-boot with OpenBSD on my main laptop, it's my Linux Gaming OS, and it's also my NAS operating system, so I don't have to care about updates.  I like that the snapshots system doesn't restrict me, while OSTree systems just doesn't allow you to make changes without installing a package.
</p>
<h2 id="_Vanilla_OS">3.5. Vanilla OS <a href="#_Vanilla_OS">§</a></h2>
<p>Finally, the really new (but mature enough to be usable) system in the immutable family is Vanilla OS based on Ubuntu (but soon on Debian), using ABroot for immutability.  With Vanilla OS, we have another implementation that really differs from what we saw above.
</p>
<p><a href="https://vanillaos.org/">Vanilla OS project website</a></p>
<p>ABroot named is well thought, the idea is to have a root partition A, another root partition B, and a partition for persistent data like <code>/home</code> or <code>/var</code>.
</p>
<p>Here is the boot dance done by ABroot:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>first boot is done on A, it's mounted in read-only</li>
  <li>changes to the system like new packages or file changes in <code>/etc</code> are done on B (and can be applied live using a tmpfs overlay)</li>
  <li>upon reboot, if previous boot was A, you boot on B, then if the boot is successful, ABroot scan for all the changes between A and B, and apply all the changes from B to A</li>
  <li>when you are using your system, until you make a change, A and B are always identical</li>
</ul>

<p>This implementation has downsides, you can only roll back a change until you boot on the new version, then the changes are also applied on the previous boot, and you can't roll back.  This implementation mostly protects you from a failing upgrade, or if you made changes and tried them live, but you prefer to rollback.
</p>
<p>Vanilla OS features the package manager apx, written by distrobox author.  That's for sure an interesting piece of software, allowing your non-root user to install packages from many distributions (arch linux, fedora, ubuntu, nix, etc...) and integrates them into the system as if they were installed locally.  I suppose it's some kind of layer on top of distrobox.
</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/apx">apx package manager GitHub project page</a></p>
<p>My experience wasn't very good, I didn't find ABroot to be really useful, and the version 22.10 I tried was using an old Ubuntu LTS release which didn't make my gaming computer really happy.  The overall state of Vanilla OS, ABroot and apx is that they are young, I think it can become a great distribution, but it still has some rough edges.
</p>
<h2 id="_Alpine_Linux_(with_LBU)">3.6. Alpine Linux (with LBU) <a href="#_Alpine_Linux_(with_LBU)">§</a></h2>
<p>I've been told that it was possible to achieve immutability on Alpine Linux using the "lbu" command.
</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_local_backup">Alpine Linux wiki: Local backup</a></p>
<p>I don't want to go much into details, but here is the short version: you can use Alpine Linux installer as a base system to boot from, and create tarballs of "saved configurations" that are automatically applied upon boot (it's just tarred directories and some automation to install packages).  At every boot, everything is untarred again, and packages are installed again (you should use an apk cache directory), everything in live memory, fully writable.
</p>
<p>What does this achieve?  You always start from a clean state, changes are applied on top of it at every boot, you can roll back the changes and start fresh again.  Immutability as we defined above here isn't achieved because changes are applied on the base system, but it's quite close to fulfill (my own) requirements.
</p>
<p>I've been using it a few days only, not as my main system, and it requires a very good understanding of what you are doing because the system is fully in memory, and you need to take care about what you want to save/restore, which can create big archives.
</p>
<p>On top of that, it's poorly documented.
</p>
<h2 id="_Pros,_Cons_and_Facts">4. Pros, Cons and Facts <a href="#_Pros,_Cons_and_Facts">§</a></h2>
<p>Now I gave some details about all the major immutable systems (Linux based) around, I think it's time to list the real pros and cons I found from my experimentation.
</p>
<h2 id="_Pros">4.1. Pros <a href="#_Pros">§</a></h2>
<ul>

  <li>you can roll back changes if something went wrong.</li>
  <li>transactional-updates allows you to keep the system running correctly during packages changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_Cons">4.2. Cons <a href="#_Cons">§</a></h2>
<ul>

  <li>configuration management tool (ansible, salt, puppet etc..) integrate VERY badly, they received updates to know how to apply package changes, but you will mostly hit walls if you want to manage those like regular systems.</li>
  <li>having to reboot after a change is annoying (except for NixOS and Guix which don't require rebooting for each change).</li>
  <li>OSTree based systems aren't flexible, my netbook requires some extra files in alsa directories to get sound (fortunately Endless OS have them!), you just can't add the files without making a package deploying them.</li>
  <li>blind rollbacks, it's hard to figure what was done in each version of the system, so when you roll back it's hard to figure what you are doing exactly.</li>
  <li>it can be hard to install programs like Nix/Guix which require a directory at the root of the file system, or install non-packaged software system-wide (this is often bad practice, but sometimes a necessary evil).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_Facts">4.3. Facts <a href="#_Facts">§</a></h2>
<ul>

  <li>immutability is a lie, many parts of the systems are mutable, although I don't know how to describe this family with a different word (transactional something?).</li>
  <li>immutable doesn't imply stateless.</li>
  <li>NixOS / Guix are doing it right in my opinion, you can track your whole system through a reliable package manager, and you can use a version control system on the sources, it has the right philosophy from the ground up.</li>
  <li>immutability is often associated with security benefits, I don't understand why.  If someone obtains root access on your system, they can still manipulate the live system and have fun with the <code>/boot</code> partition, nothing prevent them to install a backdoor for the next boot.</li>
  <li>immutability requires discipline and maintenance, because you have to care about the versioning, you have extra programs like apx / distrobox / devbox that must be updated in parallel of the system (while this is all integrated into NixOS/Guix).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_Conclusion">5. Conclusion <a href="#_Conclusion">§</a></h2>
<p>Immutable operating systems are making the news in our small community of open source systems, but behind this word lies many implementations with different use cases.  The word immutable certainly creates expectations from users, but it's really nothing more than transactional updates for your operating system, and I'm happy we can have this feature now.
</p>
<p>But transactional updates aren't new, I think it started a while ago with Solaris and ZFS allowing you to select a system snapshot at boot time, then I'm quite sure FreeBSD implemented this a decade ago, and it turns out that on any linux distribution with regular btrfs snapshots you could select a snapshot at boot time.
</p>
<p><a href="https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2023-01-04-boot-on-btrfs-snapshot.html">Previous blog post about booting on a BTRFS snapshot without any special setup</a></p>
<p>In the end, what's REALLY new is the ability to apply a transactional change on a non-live environment, integrates this into the bootloader, and give the user the tooling to handle this easily.
</p>
<h2 id="_Going_further">6. Going further <a href="#_Going_further">§</a></h2>
<p>I recommend reading the blog post "“Immutable” → reprovisionable, anti-hysteresis" by Colin Walters.
</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.verbum.org/2020/08/22/immutable-%E2%86%92-reprovisionable-anti-hysteresis/">“Immutable” → reprovisionable, anti-hysteresis</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gardening is often pitched as a relaxing, therapeutic activity—and it is relaxing and therapeutic! But it’s also a sign of how advanced society has become that we can regard growing food as a charming hobby instead of an absolute necessity. On the one hand, that’s a clear sign of mankind’s mastery over the world. On the other, it’s left us remarkably dependent on a system of farming and delivery logistics that has been shown to be distressingly fragile.<br></p><p>Anyone who has ever successfully grown a tomato plant in their backyard has wondered if they could go “off-grid,” grow their own food, and be done with their local supermarket. The answer is yes, but that’s the wrong question. The question isn’t whether it’s possible—the question is <em>how</em>. It’s all about the logistics: How much space do you need to grow enough crops to feed you and your family? Math will help you figure this one out.</p><h2 id="h18254"><a id=""></a>Calculate the necessary square footage</h2><p>If you’ve only ever gardened for fun, or to supplement your store-bought groceries with some tasty home-grown treats, you might not be aware of just how much space is required to feed someone. You may have noticed that family farms are kind of<em> large</em>, and there’s a very good reason for that (though some of that space was traditionally given over to livestock and draft animals).<em> </em>Estimates vary. Different crops require different amounts of space, for example, and some gardening gurus <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thespruce.com/how-many-vegetables-per-person-in-garden-1403355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-many-vegetables-per-person-in-garden-1403355" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimate you’d need at least <em>4,000</em> square feet <em>per person</em></a></span>, with more space allotted for stuff like lanes between crops.</p><p>Most of us don’t have 4,000 square feet to dedicate to gardening, but you probably don’t need quite that much as long as you’re efficient. A good rule of thumb is that you need about 200 square feet per person for a self-sustaining garden. So if you’re a family of four, figure you’ll need about 800 square feet, or a space about 20x40 or 10x80.</p><p>That’s ... still a lot of space, especially if you’re in an urban setting. The key is planning your garden out, because different crops take up different amounts of space, and if you’re going to live off of those crops you have to include a wide variety of plants for nutritional completeness. Your garden will need to include these:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Proteins.</strong> If you’re going to survive on a garden, you won’t be eating meat. While nuts are an excellent source of protein, nut trees take up a lot of space, so make sure you plant beans. Growing lima beans on poles will require about six square feet of garden per person. Snap beans will take about 10 square feet and soybeans will eat up about 30 square feet. </li><li><strong>Carbohydrates.</strong> You’ll need some starch in your diet. The good news is that you have a lot of options. Beans will pull double duty here, in fact.

But they can still detect sound" controlslist="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure></div><p data-component="paragraph"><span data-caps="initial">I</span><small>n 1986</small>, <small>when</small> he was a mere prince, King Charles, Britain’s eco-minded monarch, told a television interviewer that it was important to talk to one’s plants. He was widely mocked. But that piece of princely wisdom seems to have been ahead of its time, for there is now plenty of evidence that plants can detect sound, react to it, and even, perhaps, produce it.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Scientists have been experimenting with playing sounds to plants since at least the 1960s, during which time they have been exposed to everything from Beethoven to Michael Jackson. Over the years, evidence that this sort of thing can have an effect has been growing. One paper, published in 2018, claimed that an Asian shrub known as the telegraph plant grew substantially larger leaves when exposed to 56 days of Buddhist chants—but not if it was exposed to Western pop music, or silence. <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/plants-are-adversely-affected-by-the-racket-of-urban-traffic/21807602">Another</a>, published last year, found that marigolds and sage plants exposed to the noise of traffic from a busy motorway  suffered stunted growth, and produced a range of stress compounds.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Other research, much of it done in China, reports that certain frequencies, played in acoustically controlled environments like greenhouses, can affect seed germination and even boost crop yields. And plants can make noises, too, albeit not deliberately. Earlier this year a group of researchers at Tel Aviv University published an article in <i>Cell Press</i>, reporting that several species of plants emitted different noises in response to different stresses—although not at the sorts of frequencies that humans can hear.</p><p data-component="paragraph">If all that sounds strange, perhaps it should not. After all, sound carries useful information about an organism’s environment. From an evolutionary point of view, there is no reason to expect that information to be exploited only by animals.</p><h2>I’m picking up bad vibrations</h2><p data-component="paragraph">Plants have been evolving alongside the insects that pollinate them and eat them for hundreds of millions of years. With that in mind, Heidi Appel, a botanist now at the University of Houston, and Reginald Cocroft, an entomologist at the University of Missouri, wondered if plants might be sensitive to the sounds made by the animals with which they most often interact. The researchers recorded the vibrations made by certain species of caterpillar as they chewed on leaves. These vibrations are not powerful enough to produce sound waves in the air. But they are able to travel across leaves and branches, and even to neighbouring plants if their foliage touches.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The researchers then exposed Thale cress—the plant biologist’s version of the laboratory mouse—to the recorded vibrations while no caterpillars were actually present. Later, they put real caterpillars on the plants to see if exposure had led them to prepare for an insect attack. The results were striking. Leaves that had been exposed had significantly higher levels of defensive chemicals like glucosinolates and anthocyanins, making them much harder for the caterpillars to eat. Leaves on control plants that had not been exposed to vibrations showed no such response. Other sorts of vibration—caused by the wind, for instance, or other insects that do not eat leaves—had no effect.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Dr Appel and Dr Cocroft published their findings in 2014. They have since been replicated many times in both cress and the tobacco plant, another common lab organism, and with a variety of caterpillars. While the vibrations created by different insects chewing on different leaves vary, the plants in question are consistently able to recognise them as a threat and defend themselves accordingly.</p><p data-component="paragraph">In 2019 the researchers took a closer look at what exactly was going on, biochemically speaking, with the plants exposed to the chewing sounds. Many of the chemicals released to cope with insect attacks turned out to be the same as those that are produced to better endure cold weather. Drs Appel and Cocroft propose that both situations activate similar signalling pathways associated with stress.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The research may have practical consequences, too. “Drones armed with speakers and the right audio files could warn crops to act when pests are detected but not yet widespread,” says Dr Cocroft. Unlike chemical pesticides, sound waves leave no toxic residue. With the help of weather forecasts, the system could even be used to prepare crops for cold snaps.</p><p data-component="paragraph">If it makes evolutionary sense that some plants are able to eavesdrop on insects, then it would make just as much sense if others were able to “hear” a noisy resource that all plants rely upon: water. In 2017 Monica Gagliano, an ecologist  at the University of Western Australia, published evidence suggesting that they can.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Dr Gagliano knew from previous work that plants’ roots are sensitive to even minute amounts of water in soil, and will aggressively follow moisture gradients. But seeds seemed to be able to send roots to nearby water even when the soil in the immediate vicinity was dry. Dr Gagliano hypothesised that the roots might be detecting groundwater by sound, and tested her theory on pea plants.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The plants were grown in pots with forked bases, which could be filled with either dry or damp soil. As expected, roots proved very sensitive to the presence of moisture, and readily grew towards it. Then Dr Gagliano added a twist. Some forks were surrounded by plastic pipes full of water, creating watery noises but remaining inaccessible to the roots. When the alternative was a tube full of dry soil, those noises proved just as enticing to the growing roots as water itself.

Intriguingly, the plants seemed able to tell that they were being duped. Even when the alternative was parched soil, almost all chose to grow away from the speaker. They could only be persuaded to grow towards a speaker when forced to choose between two, in which case they chose the one playing watery noises. Dr Gagliano suspects—but cannot yet prove—that the small magnets found in the speakers are responsible for such discerning behaviour. A few older papers have suggested that plants can detect magnetic fields.
</p><p data-component="paragraph">Still, the findings suggest that, in the absence of soil moisture, pea plants can detect the sound of water in pipes and follow it to its source. That too could prove to be valuable information. Plant roots are a big cause of damage to sewer systems all over the world. In Germany, the annual cost of root removal and associated pipe repair is around €28m ($30m). The assumption had been that it was leaks that attracted the roots. Dr Gagliano’s results suggest that even watertight pipes might still come under attack. The solution, she says, might be to invest in pipes that are silent as water runs through them.</p><h2>A cry for help</h2><p data-component="paragraph">And while plants are able to detect sounds, some also produce them, albeit unintentionally. This was demonstrated in April by the team at Tel Aviv University. Lilach Hadany, the team’s leader, knew that plants could sometimes be made to vibrate. This can happen when they do not have enough water. That causes air bubbles to form in the xylem, a specialised tissue that transports water from a plant’s roots to its leaves. When those bubbles collapse, they transmit small shock waves into the surrounding tissues. Previous work had shown that those vibrations could be measured with devices stuck to the plants themselves. Dr Hadany wondered whether they might be audible from farther away.</p><p data-component="paragraph">So the researchers put tomato and tobacco plants inside a microphone-lined box. Half had been watered, while half had been left parched. The researchers repeated the experiment with another set of plants, half of which had their stems cut, and half of which were left undamaged. 
</p><p data-component="paragraph">The microphones picked up very little sound from healthy plants. But those lacking water, or which had been cut, made a fair bit of noise, albeit at frequencies too high for humans to hear. Different stresses produced different kinds of sound. When the recordings were fed to a machine-learning algorithm, it was able to tell the sounds emitted from thirsty plants from those from the damaged ones.</p><p data-component="paragraph">When the experiment was repeated in a noisy greenhouse, Dr Hadany found that microphones could still detect the sounds from 10cm away. Experiments on cacti, corn, grapevines and wheat produced similar results, as did tomato plants suffering from an infection of mosaic virus, a common pathogen that can damage yields.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Farmers monitor the health of their crops by eye. (Mosaic virus, for instance, is so named because of the mottled pattern produced on the leaves of suffering plants.) That can be hard to do properly over an entire field. But if plants are broadcasting auditory indicators of distress, then wiring a field with microphones might help farmers keep an ear out for trouble.</p><p data-component="paragraph">That plants live in a world full of sound is no longer in doubt. But plenty of questions remain. One is the effect of human civilisation. It is well known that the din of city life makes bird calls harder to hear, forcing the animals to sing more loudly. Since trickling water, hungry caterpillars and suffering plants are all very quiet, it seems worth investigating whether plants face similar problems. Researchers might even apply to King Charles for funding. <span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>Curious about the world?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body"><p>Three years ago, I wrote a blog titled “<a href="https://toonk.io/aws-and-their-billions-in-ipv4-addresses/index.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">AWS and their Billions in IPv4 addresses</a> “in which I estimated AWS owned about $2.5 billion worth of IPv4 addresses. AWS has continued to grow incredibly, and so has its IPv4 usage. In fact, it’s grown so much that it will soon start to charge customers for IPv4 addresses! Enough reason to check in again, three years later, to see what AWS’ IPv4 estate looks like today.</p><h2 id="a-quick-2020-recap">A quick 2020 recap</h2><p>Let’s first quickly summarize what we learned when <a href="https://toonk.io/aws-and-their-billions-in-ipv4-addresses/index.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">looking at AWS’s IPv4 usage in 2020</a>. First, in 2020, we observed that the total number of IPv4 addresses we could attribute to AWS was just over 100 Million (100,750,168). That’s the equivalent of just over six /8 blocks.</p><p>Second, for fun, we tried to put a number on it; back then, I used $25 per IP, bringing the estimated value of their IPv4 estate to Just over $2.5 billion.</p><p>Third, AWS publishes their actively used <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">IPv4 addresses in a JSON</a> file. The JSON file contained references to roughly 53 Million IPv4 addresses. That meant they still had ~47 Million IPv4 addresses, or 47%, available for future allocations. That’s pretty healthy!</p><h2 id="the-2023-numbers">The 2023 numbers</h2><p>Okay, let’s look at the current data. Now, three years later, what does the IPv4 estate for AWS look like? I used the same scripts and methods as three years ago and found the following.</p><p>First, we observe that AWS currently owns 127,972,688 IPv4 addresses. Ie. almost 128 million IPv4 addresses. That’s an increase of 27 million IPv4 addresses. In other words, AWS added the equivalent of 1.6 /8’s or 415 /16’s in three years!</p><p>Second, what’s it worth? This is always tricky and just for fun. Let’s first assume the same $25 per IPv4 address we used in 2020.</p><p><em><em>127,972,688 ipv4 addresses x $25 per IP = $3,199,317,200.</em></em></p><blockquote><em><em><strong><strong>So, with the increase of IPv4 addresses, the value went up to ~$3.2 Billion. That’s a $700 million increase since 2020.</strong></strong></em></em></blockquote><p>However, if we consider the increase in IPv4 prices over the last few years, this number will be higher. Below is the total value of 127M IPv4 addresses at different market prices.</p><p>Total number of IPv4 addresses: 127,972,688<br>value at $20 per IP: $2,559,453,760<br>value at $25 per IP: $3,199,317,200<br>value at $30 per IP: $3,839,180,640<br><strong><strong>value at $35 per IP: $4,479,044,080</strong></strong><br>value at $40 per IP: $5,118,907,520<br>value at $50 per IP: $6,398,634,400</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*AgTw_knXi3Bz9CZTJ-bU_A.png" alt=""><figcaption>IPv4 prices over time — Source: ipv4.global</figcaption></figure><p>Based on<a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow"> this data from ipv4.global</a>, the average price for an IPv4 address is currently ~$35 dollars. With that estimate, we can determine <strong><strong>the value of AWS’s IPv4 estate today to about 4.5 Billion dollars. An increase of 2 Billion compared to three years ago!</strong></strong></p><p>Thirdly, let’s compare the difference between the IPv4 data we found and what’s published in the JSON file AWS makes available. In the JSON today, we count about 73 million IPv4 addresses (72,817,397); three years ago, that was 53 Million. So, an increase of 20 million in IPv4 addresses allocated to AWS services.</p><p>Finally, when we compare the ratio between what Amazon owns and what is allocated to AWS according to the JSON data, we observe that about 57% (72817397 / 127972688) of the IPv4 addresses have been (publicly) allocated to AWS service. They may still have 43% available for future use. That’s almost the same as three years ago when it was 47%.<br><em><em>(Note: this is an outsider’s perspective; we should likely assume not everything is used for AWS).</em></em></p><h2 id="where-did-the-growth-come-from">Where did the growth come from</h2><p>A quick comparison between the results from three years ago and now shows the following significant new additions to AWS’ IPv4 estate,</p><ul><li>Two new /11 allocations: 13.32.0.0/11 and 13.192.0.0/11. This whole 13/8 block was formerly owned by Xerox.<br>(<em><em>Note: it appears AWS owned 13.32.0.0/12 already in 2020)</em></em>.</li><li>Two new /12 allocations: 13.224.0.0/12 (see above as well). It appears they continued purchasing from that 13/8 block.</li><li>I’m also seeing more consolidation in the 16.0.0.0/8 block. AWS used to have quite a few /16 allocations from that block, which are now consolidated into three /12 allocations: 16.16.0.0/12 16.48.0.0/12, and 16.112.0.0/12</li><li>Finally, the 63.176.0.0/12 allocation is new.</li></ul><h2 id="aws-is-starting-to-charge-for-ipv4-addresses">AWS is starting to charge for IPv4 addresses</h2><p>In August of this year, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">AWS announced</a> they will start charging their customers for IPv4 addresses as of 2024.</p><p><em><em>Effective February 1, 2024 there will be a charge of $0.005 per IP per hour for all public IPv4 addresses, whether attached to a service or not (there is already a charge for public IPv4 addresses you allocate in your account but don’t attach to an EC2 instance).</em></em></p><p>That’s a total of $43.80 per year per IPv4 address; that’s a pretty hefty number! The reason for this is outlined in the same AWS blog:</p><p><em><em>As you may know, IPv4 addresses are an increasingly scarce resource and the cost to acquire a single public IPv4 address has risen more than 300% over the past 5 years. This change reflects our own costs and is also intended to encourage you to be a bit more frugal with your use of public IPv4 addresses</em></em></p><p>The 300% cost increase to acquire an IPv4 address is interesting and is somewhat reflected in our valuation calculation above (though we used a more conservative number).</p><p>So, how much money will AWS make from this new IPv4 charge? The significant variable here is how many IP addresses are used at any given time by AWS customers. Let’s explore a few scenarios, starting with a very conservative estimate, say 10% of what is published in their IPv4 JSON is in use for a year. That’s 7.3 Million IPv4 addresses x $43.80, almost $320 Million a year. At 25% usage, that’s nearly $800 Million a year. And at 31% usage, that’s a billion dollars!</p><blockquote><em><em>Notice that I’m using a fairly conservative number here, so it’s not unlikely for <strong><strong>AWS to make between $500 Million to a Billion dollars a year with this new charge!</strong></strong></em></em></blockquote><h2 id="the-data">The data</h2><p>You can find the data I used for this analysis on the link below. There, you’ll also find all the IPv4 prefixes and a brief summary. <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/d8bded9d1137b26b3c615ab614222afd" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/d8bded9d1137b26b3c615ab614222afd</a><br>Similar data from 2020 can be <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">found here</a>.<br><em><em>PS. Let me know if someone knows the LACNIC or AFRINIC AWS resources, as those are not included in this data set.</em></em></p><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2><p>In this article, we saw how, over the last three years, AWS grew its IPv4 estate with an additional 27 million IP addresses to now owning 128 Million IPv4 addresses. <strong><strong>At a value of $35 per IPv4 address, the total value of AWS’ IPv4 estate is ~4.5 Billion dollars. An increase of $2 billion </strong></strong>compared to what we looked at three years ago!</p><p>Regarding IPv4 capacity planning, it seems like the unallocated IPv4 address pool (defined as not being in the AWS JSON) has remained stable, and quite a bit of IPv4 addresses are available for future use.</p><p>All this buying of IPv4 addresses is expensive, and in response to the increase in IPv4 prices, AWS will soon start to charge its customers for IPv4 usage. <strong><strong>Based on my estimates, It’s not unlikely that AWS will generate between $500 million and $1 billion in additional revenue with this new charge. Long live IPv4!</strong></strong></p><p>Cheers<br>Andree</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’re already signed up, great! If you’d like to sign up and receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>Happy belated Thanksgiving. I didn’t say this last week, but I truly am grateful for you reading this newsletter and sending me your thoughts and ideas. It’s been a wonderful ride so far, and hopefully we’ll keep at it for a long time.</p><p>Today I’m writing about how the giant government contracting firm Booz Allen and 13 government agencies have been renting back to the public access to our own lands by forcing us to pay junk fees to use national parks. It involves a tour through late 19th century political economy thinking, with the first appearance of the great anti-monopolist Henry George, whose focus was land. Plus, a weird attempted monopoly of ID management software, controlled by software private equity giant Thoma Bravo.</p><p><em>“I Seen My Opportunities and I Took ’Em.” - George Washington Plunkitt of Tammany Hall</em></p><p><span>Two of the classic works of late 19th century American political literature, representing precisely opposite views of how commerce in an industrialized democracy ought to work, are Henry George’s </span><em>Progress and Poverty</em><span>, and the speeches of George Washington Plunkitt of Tammany Hall.</span></p><p>George was one of the great political economists of his day, and he ran and lost for mayor of New York City on an anti-monopoly and land reform ticket. George was interested in why we experienced tremendous inequality in the midst of great wealth, and traced it to the exploitation of land. </p><p><span>George was an international superstar, influencing both Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, as well as environmentalists and the modern libertarian movement. (There’s an iconic statue of the greatest mayor in Cleveland history, Tom Johnson, with Johnson </span><a href="https://www.sculpturecenter.org/oosi/items/show/356" rel="">holding</a><span> a copy of </span><em>Progress and Poverty.) </em><span>The modern academic profession of economics arose in part as a reaction to the popular success of George’s work. The game </span><em>Monopoly</em><span> comes directly from George, and in many ways, the national parks, as well as everything from spectrum allocation to offshore oil drilling, must wrestle with Georgeist thinking. </span></p><p><span>But by land, he meant far more than just the plots upon which we live. “The term land,” George wrote, “necessarily includes, not merely the surface of the earth as distinguished from the water and the air, but the whole material universe outside of man himself, for it is only by having access to land, from which his very body is drawn, that man can come in contact with or use nature.” Unlike Marx, who saw the exploitation of capital over labor, George thought that the root of social disorder was a result of the power of the </span><em>landowner</em><span> over both capital and labor. </span></p><p>By land, he meant all value drawn purely from nature or from collective human existence. He would, for instance, consider ‘network effects’ a form of land, and likely seek regulation or national control of search engines. George had his first run-in with monopoly in San Francisco, where a telegraph monopolist destroyed his newspaper by denying him wire service. But his key work, in 1879, was written before the rise of the giant trusts, just as railroads, which were really land kingdoms, were becoming dominant.</p><p>A much more cynical set of works are the speeches of Plunkitt. Plunkitt was a political boss in New York City, a proud machine politician in office at the same time in the same political arena as George. Both men were interested in modern industry and wealth, and in both cases, the key fulcrum around which power flowed was not capital, but land. But while George sought a better world, Plunkitt just wanted to get rich, and saw in the purchase of land one of the key ways to do that.</p><p>Plunkitt’s key moral guidepost was the practical wielding of political power to enrich oneself. He posited something called “Honest Graft,” which he distinguished from crime in a formulation that every important corporate lobbyist, knowingly or not, has since used. To Plunkitt, stealing would be taking something that doesn’t belong to you. But if you happened to know that the city would need a piece of land, and you got there first, well, that was simply smart. As Plunkitt put it:</p><blockquote><p>"I could get nothin' at a bargain but a big piece of swamp, but I took it fast enough and held on to it. What turned out was just what I counted on. They couldn't make the park complete without Plunkitt's swamp, and they had to pay a good price for it. Anything dishonest in that?"</p></blockquote><p><span>George was part of the land reform anti-monopoly school of Anglo-American thought, from </span><a href="https://jacobin.com/2020/02/frederick-douglass-accumulation-wealth-land-reformer" rel="">Frederick Douglass</a><span> to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/grahamcclark1/status/1596534617024368640" rel="">Thaddeus Stevens</a><span>. Plunkitt was a machine politician, and proud of it. The battle between these two elements of America, the desire to conserve the public weal versus the desire to cynically plunder it, is still fierce today. It will probably never end. </span></p><p>And that brings me to the political conflict over our national parks, and the strange situation whereby a large government contractor, Booz Allen, somehow found itself in a position to rent us back our own land.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png" width="874" height="555" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:555,&quot;width&quot;:874,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1128379,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fa162a6-0cd2-4515-a3b9-cfe21fb3bc8b_874x555.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Red Rock Canyon in Nevada.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Every day, visitors to Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in Northern Arizona hike into an area named Coyote Buttes North to see one of the “most visually striking geologic sandstone formations in the world,” which is known as The Wave. On an ancient layer of sandstone, millions of years of water and wind erosion crafted 3,000-foot cliffs, weird red canyons that look like you are on the planet Mars, and giant formations that look like crashing waves made of rock. There are old carvings known as ‘petroglyphs’ on cliff walls, and even “dinosaur tracks embedded in the sediment.”</p><p><span>The Wave is unlike anywhere else on Earth. It is also part of a U.S. national park, and thus technically, it’s open to anyone. Yet, to preserve its natural beauty, the Bureau of Land Management lets just 64 people daily visit the area. Snagging one of these slots is an accomplishment, a ticket into The Wave is </span><a href="https://canyonsandchefs.com/blog/how-to-win-the-wave-lottery/" rel="">known</a><span> as “The Hardest Permit to Get in the USA” by Outside and Backpacker Magazines. </span></p><p>To apply requires going to Recreation.gov, the site set up to manage national parks, public cultural landmarks, and public lands, and paying $9 for a “Lottery Application Fee.” If you win, you get a permit, and pay a recreation fee of $7. The success rate for the lottery is between 4-10%, and some people spend upwards of $500 before securing an actual permit.</p><p>But while the recreation fee of $7 goes to maintaining the park - which is what Henry George would appreciate - the money for the “Lottery Application Fee” is pure Plunkitt. That money goes to the giant D.C. consulting firm, Booz Allen and Company. In fact, since 2017, more and more of America’s public lands - over 4,200 facilities and 113,000 individual sites across the country at last count - have been added to the Recreation.gov database and website run by Booz Allen, which in turn captures various fees that Americans pay to visit their national heritage.</p><p><span>You can do a lot at Recreation.gov. You can sign up for a pass to cut down a Christmas tree on the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests, get permits to fly-fishing,&nbsp;rifle hunting or target practice at thousands of sites, or even secure a tour at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. There are dozens of </span><a href="https://www.recreation.gov/lottery/available" rel="">lotteries</a><span> to enter for different parks and lands that are hard to access. And all of them come with service fees attached, fees that go </span><a href="https://www.outdoorproject.com/articles/no-recgov-doesnt-fund-public-lands" rel="">directly</a><span> to Booz Allen, which built Recreation.gov. The deeper you go, the more interesting the gatekeeping. As one angry writer found out after waiting on hold and being transferred multiple times, the answer is that Booz Allen “actually sets the Recreation.gov fees for themselves.”</span></p><p><span>Lately, hundreds of sites have begun requiring the use of the site. A typical example is Red Rock Canyon, which added "timed entry permit" in the past two years. Such parks, before adding these new processes, usually do a "trial" period followed by a public comment period, and then the fees are approved by a Resource Advisory Council, </span><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5442009.pdf" rel="">objects of derision</a><span> composed of people appointed by the government bureaus. As one person involved in the process told me, these councils are sort of ridiculous. “Agencies fill it with people beholden to them,” he said. “so the council playing committee rubber stamps whatever they send their way, often even if it makes no sense.”</span></p><p>The&nbsp;entry permit almost always become permanent. This includes heavily visited lands like Acadia National Park (4 million annual&nbsp;visitors), Arches National Park (1.5 million), Glacier National Park (3 million), Rocky Mountain National Park (4.4 million), and Yosemite (3.3 million). There’s nothing wrong with charging a fee for the use of a national park, as long as that fee is necessary for the upkeep and is used to maintain the public resource. </p><p><span>That was in fact the point of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/108th-congress/house-report/790" rel="">law passed</a><span> in 2004 - the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act - to give permanent authority to government agencies to charge fees for the use of public lands. But what Booz Allen is doing is different. The incentives are creating the same dynamics for public lands that we see with junk fees across the economy. Just as airlines are charging for carry-on bags and hotels are forcing people to pay ‘resort fees,’ some national parks are now </span><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/national-park-reservations/" rel="">requiring</a><span> reservations with fees attached. And as scalpers automatically grabbed Taylor Swift tickets from Ticketmaster using high-speed automated programs, there are now </span><a href="https://www.rvtravel.com/battling-bots-995b/" rel="">bots</a><span> booking campsites.</span></p><p>None of this is criminal, though the fee structure may not be lawful, but it is very George Washington Plunkitt. “I Seen My Opportunities,” he said, “and I Took ’Em.”</p><p>The entry point for Booz Allen can be traced back to the Obama administration, and a giant failed IT project. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, pledging that by 2014, the government would have a website up in which uninsured Americans could buy health insurance with various subsidies. In perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments of the Obama administration, Healthcare.gov failed to launch the day the new health law came into force, and millions couldn’t sign up to take advantage of it.</p><p><span>It’s hard to overstate the shame of that moment. The government had spent $400 million over four years - more time than it took the U.S. to enter and win World War II - and yet, the dozens of contractors </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/16/meet-cgi-federal-the-company-behind-the-botched-launch-of-healthcare-gov/" rel="">couldn’t</a><span> set up a website to take sign-ups. The whole thing was an embarrassing disaster, a festival of incompetence and greed. (Despite the failure, the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/16/meet-cgi-federal-the-company-behind-the-botched-launch-of-healthcare-gov/" rel="">main IT contractor</a><span>’s CEO became a billionaire. Honest graft indeed.)</span></p><p>President Obama hired Google’s Mike Dickerson to come in and fix the Healthcare.gov website, which Dickerson and his team did. This wasn’t some miracle, it’s not like websites were new technology. The government itself created the internet and most of the underpinnings of digital technology, and it had many functional and important systems. But the Google name at that point was magic, and so the U.S. Digital Service, designed to help the government use technology, was born. After Dickerson, the new head was Google’s Matt Cutts, and then health care monopolist Optum’s Mina Hsiang. The U.S. Digital Service, far from being particularly competent, is a branding exercise. It is full of people from Amazon and Google, and tends to push the government to outsource its technology to third party contractors.</p><p><span>Following the U.S. Digital Service’s </span><a href="https://www.doi.gov/ocl/recreationgov" rel="">playbook</a><span> is what led the government to bid out and allow the creation of Recreation.gov, with its weird and corrupt fee structure. In 2017, Booz Allen </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/seeking-happy-campers-government-offers-revamped-travel-portal-11570742343" rel="">got</a><span> a 10-year $182 million contract to consolidate all booking for public lands and waters, with 13 separate agencies participating, from the Bureau of Land Management to the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration to the National Park Service to the Smithsonian Institution to the Tennessee Valley Authority to the US Forest Service.</span></p><p><span>The funding structure of the site is exactly what George Washington Plunkitt would design. Though there’s a ten year contract with significant financial outlays, Booz Allen says the project </span><a href="https://www.boozallen.com/s/insight/thought-leadership/reinventing-the-recreation-gov-customer-experience.html" rel="">was built</a><span> “at no cost to the federal government.”</span><strong> </strong><span>In the contractor’s words, “the unique contractual agreement is a transaction-based fee model that lets the government and Booz Allen share in risk, reward, results, and impact.” In other words, Booz Allen gets to keep the fees charged to users who want access to national parks. Part of the deal was that Booz Allen </span><a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/technology-main/2017/02/amid-bid-battle-recreation-gov-high-hopes-connecting-vacationers-federal-data/" rel="">would get</a><span> the right to negotiate fees to third party sites that want access to data on Federal lands.</span></p><p><span>It’s a bit hard to tell how much Booz Allen was paid to set up the site. Documents suggest the firm received a lot of money to do so, but it’s also possible that total amount was the anticipated financial return. I wrote to Recreation.gov team leader Julie McPherson at Booz Allen to find out what they were paid to build the site, and I haven’t heard back. Regardless, there’s a lot of money involved. For instance, as one </span><a href="https://www.outdoorproject.com/articles/no-recgov-doesnt-fund-public-lands" rel="">camper</a><span> noted, in just one lottery to hike Mount Whitney, more than 16,000 people applied, and only a third got in. Yet everyone paid the $6 registration fee, which means the gross income for that single location is over $100,000. There’s nothing criminal about this scheme, but it is a form of Honest Graft, or of handing a Ticketmaster-like firm control of our national parks.</span></p><p>In 2020, an avid hiker named Thomas Kotab sued the Bureau of Land Management over the $2 “processing fee it charges to access the mandatory online reservation system to visit the Red Rock Canyon Conservation Area.” He claimed, among other things, that the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act mandated that this fee was unlawful, because it had not gone through the notice-and-comment period required by the act. Kotab, an electrical engineer by training, is one of those ass-kickers in America, who just goes after a grift because, well, it’s just wrong.</p><p>A few years later, a judge named Jennifer A. Dorsey, appointed by Obama in 2013, agreed with him. She looked at the statute and found that Congress authorized the charging of recreation fees for the purpose of taking care and using Federal lands, not administrative fees that compensated third parties. As such, Booz Allen’s ability to set its own prices was inconsistent with the law mandating the public’s right to comment on what we are charged for using our own land.</p><p>The BLM sought to appeal, but then dropped it in July. Rather than a bitter procedural argument about classifying fees, the government and Booz Allen have decided they’ll just go through the annoying process of having the public comment on Booz Allen’s compensation, and then ignore us using their phony advisory council process. Here, for instance, is the Mojave-Southern Great Basin Resource Advisory Council Meeting in August simply proposing to substitute new standard amenity fees “equal to the associated Recreation.gov reservation service fee.”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Canyon’s timed entry system from 2020-2022, but they’ll probably ignore that and steal the money. That verges into actual graft from the ‘honest’ type, but I suspect Plunkitt did that as well from time to time.</p><p><span>And yet, it’s not over. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act authorization </span><a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF10151.pdf" rel="">runs out</a><span> in October of 2023, which means that Congress has to renew it. Hopefully, an interested member of Congress who loves Federal lands could actually tighten the definitions here, and find a way to stop Booz Allen and these 13 government agencies from engaging in this minor theft via junk fees. It wouldn’t be hard, and it would be fun to force a bunch of government agencies to actually do their job and either take over the site themselves or pay Booz Allen a fee for its service. (Another path would be Joe Biden, through his anti-junk fee initiative, simply </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2022/10/26/the-presidents-initiative-on-junk-fees-and-related-pricing-practices/" rel="">asserting</a><span> through the White House Competition Council to the 13 different agencies that they end Booz Allen’s practice of charging these kinds of fees.)</span></p><p>It’s easy enough to see scams everywhere, and here is certainly one of them. But let’s not lose sight of the broader point. Henry George, at least in this fight, has won. Yes, Booz Allen gets to steal some pennies, but we have a remarkable system of public lands and waters that are broadly available for all of us to use on a relatively equal basis. And we can still see the power of George-ism in the advocacy of hikers and in the intense view that members of Congress had when they passed the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act in 2004, which strictly regulated fees that Americans would have to pay to access our Federal lands. Indeed, the anger and revulsion I felt at the fees Booz Allen puts forward comes from George, even if I didn’t necessarily trace it there at first.</p><p>We are in a moment of institutional corruption, but these moments are transitory as institutions change. George Washington Plunkitt, and his political descendants at Booz Allen, might have gotten rich, but Henry George imparted instincts to Americans that are far more permanent.</p><p><span>Last week, I published a piece on Thoma Bravo, the private equity </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/monopolies-and-cybersecurity-disasters" rel="">bridge trolls</a><span> of enterprise software, and how they are trying to roll up the corporate software that large firms use to manage the identity and logins of customers and workers across their many apps and devices. The PE firm, which was responsible for the SolarWinds catastrophic hack in 2020, recently bought both Ping Identity and ForgeRock, which are two of the three firms that sell this product to very large security conscious multi-nationals. </span></p><p><span>This is a worrisome roll-up, because you don’t want to have important software in the hands of a private equity firm that has a dedicated track record of cyber-security screw-ups. And yes, Thoma Bravo is that bad. One researcher had previously </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/global-cyber-solarwinds/hackers-used-solarwinds-dominance-against-it-in-sprawling-spy-campaign-idUSKBN28Q07P" rel="">alerted</a><span> the company that “anyone could access SolarWinds’ update server by using the password “solarwinds123.’” Ouch.</span></p><p><span>You can read the </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/monopolies-and-cybersecurity-disasters" rel="">full article here</a><span>. </span></p><p><a href="https://www.baronpa.com/podcast/welcome-to-the-jungle/" rel="">Welcome to the Jungle</a><span>, </span><em>Baron Public Affairs. </em><span>On this podcast from a D.C.-intelligence firm, the hosts note that Amazon has hired roughly 3,000 former government officials to staff its various divisions.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  We explore the novel application of Large Language Models to code
optimization. We present a 7B-parameter transformer model trained from scratch
to optimize LLVM assembly for code size. The model takes as input unoptimized
assembly and outputs a list of compiler options to best optimize the program.
Crucially, during training, we ask the model to predict the instruction counts
before and after optimization, and the optimized code itself. These auxiliary
learning tasks significantly improve the optimization performance of the model
and improve the model's depth of understanding.
<br>We evaluate on a large suite of test programs. Our approach achieves a 3.0%
improvement in reducing instruction counts over the compiler, outperforming two
state-of-the-art baselines that require thousands of compilations. Furthermore,
the model shows surprisingly strong code reasoning abilities, generating
compilable code 91% of the time and perfectly emulating the output of the
compiler 70% of the time.

<h2><span id="Meetings">Meetings</span></h2>
<p>Meetings take place <b>every other Wednesday right after work</b> in most cities. If it collides with an official holiday in your country, simply skip that one and resume two weeks later as usual.
</p><p>See <b><a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">https://events.indieweb.org</a></b> for specific dates/locations/URLs of upcoming meetings, or this handy summary of upcoming/past dates:
</p>



<h3><span id="Regular_Meetings">Regular Meetings</span></h3>
<p><b>Just show up.</b> These Homebrew Website Club chapters are well established and meet regularly at least once a month (often fortnightly AKA bi-weekly). If it has been more than a month since a city has met, move them down to popups until a regular pattern is re-established.
</p><p>Alphabetical by city/region, see each city for regularity.

<p>These cities have held popup Hombrew Website Club meet-ups at least a couple of times recently, and are working hard to get established!
</p><p>After three consecutive months of successful regular meetings, popups get bumped to Regular meetings! Or if they do not happen for three months, bump them back down to Getting Started.

<p><b>Speak up and help make another meetup happen in your city!</b> These cities have organizers (can always use more), have (re)started with at least one meeting (hopefully with a photo posted), and would love to hear from you to help make more happen. If it's been more than six months since a meet-up or organizers have all moved to other cities, move a city to "Up-and-coming or needs restarting" in the next section.

<h3><span id="Beforehand">Beforehand</span></h3>
<ol><li>Post an <a href="https://indieweb.org/event" title="event">event</a> on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">https://events.indieweb.org/</a>
<ul><li>You can reference or even clone a  <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/tag/hwc/archive">recent virtual HWC event</a> as a starting point</li>
<li>If this is the first time you are hosting your meetup, you will need to write your own description for the event. Feel free to use existing pages on the events page as inspiration and to understand the format event pages typically use.</li>
<li>Include a link to a unique <a href="https://indieweb.org/etherpad" title="etherpad">etherpad</a> for the event using YYYY-MM-DD format and a short description, e.g. <a href="https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2023-01-18-hwc-pacific">https://etherpad.indieweb.org/2023-01-18-hwc-pacific</a></li>
<li>Use one of the <a href="#Logos_and_Graphics">HWC Logos and Graphics</a> for the event image. The retro image has been a popular one the last several years.</li></ul></li>
<li>Invite everyone who attended previous Homebrew Website Club meetups in the event's timezone, those you've invited before, and any friends you know who may be interested in having their own website, upgrading their blog, etc.
<ul><li>Use <a href="https://indieweb.org/invitation" title="invitation">invitation</a> posts</li>
<li>Directly message people 1:1</li></ul></li>
<li><i>(Optional)</i> Announce your meetup on social media and/or your personal website to get the word out about the event.</li></ol>

<ul><li>If you are using the IndieWeb Zoom account, familiarize yourself with <a href="https://indieweb.org/Zoom#Tips_for_Hosts" title="Zoom">Zoom - Tips for Hosts</a>
<ul><li>Access to the IndieWeb Zoom account can be requested in the #indieweb-chat channel</li>
<li>Screen sharing should be set to "Only Host". The host can share their screen to show people's sites during introductions. You may also be able to designate a co-host to handle screen sharing.</li>
<li>Start the Zoom meeting 10 minutes before the scheduled start time. The event listing on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">https://events.indieweb.org</a> will automatically update to include a "Live Now" link that attendees can click to join.</li></ul></li>
<li>If you are using a different video service, you will need to update the event listing on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">https://events.indieweb.org</a> with the link to join.</li>
<li>Post a message in the #indieweb channel that the meeting is starting</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Running_the_event">Running the event</span></h3>
<ul><li>Welcome
<ul><li>Direct attendees to <a href="https://indieweb.org/discuss">https://indieweb.org/discuss</a> for chat options; encourage notes and questions in the main channel instead of in Zoom chat</li>
<li>Point out the <a href="https://indieweb.org/code_of_conduct" title="code of conduct">code of conduct</a> at <a href="https://indieweb.org/coc">https://indieweb.org/coc</a></li>
<li>Direct attendees to the event's <a href="https://indieweb.org/Etherpad" title="Etherpad">Etherpad</a> for notes</li></ul></li>
<li>Introductions
<ul><li>Introduce yourself and your site following <a href="https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#HWC_Broadcast" title="Homebrew Website Club">HWC Broadcast</a>, then offer each attendee to introduce themselves. Note: attendee videos don't appear in the same order on everyone's screen, so a host should select the order to avoid confusion.</li></ul></li>
<li>Group photo: Explain you're taking a group photo (screenshot) that will appear in the event page, <a href="https://indieweb.org/this-week-in-the-indieweb" title="this-week-in-the-indieweb">This Week in the IndieWeb newsletter</a>, and the @indiewebcamp <a href="https://indieweb.org/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> post. Allow people to turn off their video if they prefer to not be in the photo.
<ul><li>In Zoom, choose the option "Hide Non-video Participants" before taking the screenshot.</li></ul></li>
<li>Main meetup: This is where the format can vary. Some approaches so far:
<ul><li>Ask what topics people are interested in discussing, noting them in chat. Then attendees can vote on their preferred priority in chat. Set a timebox for each topic then proceed through each topic.</li>
<li>Looser, general discussion without timeboxes</li>
<li>A quiet writing period followed by discussion</li></ul></li>
<li>Group photo: if more people joined since the first photo, consider taking another photo</li>
<li>If you are meeting regularly, announce when the next event will be</li></ul>
<h3><span id="After_the_event">After the event</span></h3>
<ul><li>Upload the photo to the event permalink on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">https://events.indieweb.org</a>
<ul><li>Set the <a href="https://indieweb.org/alt" title="alt">alt</a> text to something describing the photo, including attendee's names as displayed in the screenshot. Example: "Zoom grid of attendees. Top left to bottom right: name1, name2, name3, and name4"</li></ul></li>
<li>Archive the etherpad notes on the wiki, see <a href="https://indieweb.org/Cali" title="Cali">Cali</a> for bot commands you can use in chat to do this</li>
<li>Once you have verified the wiki archive of the notes, edit the event description and change the link to the Etherpad to link to the wiki archive of the notes instead.</li>
<li>Update the <a href="https://indieweb.org/Template:Homebrew_Website_Club" title="Template:Homebrew Website Club">Homebrew Website Club template</a> that display a list of meetups by year
<ul><li>Add a link to the events site date archive, e.g. <code>[https://events.indieweb.org/2022/09/14 09-14]</code></li>
<li>Add an emoji link to the wiki page that was created when archiving the etherpad, e.g. <code>[[events/2022-09-14-hwc-pacific|🌎]]</code>
<ul><li>Refer to <a href="https://indieweb.org/cities" title="cities">cities</a> for emojis we've used for your city/region</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Combine notes from the broadcast portion of the meetup into a post
<ul><li>(Optionally) Syndicate the post to <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieNews" title="IndieNews">IndieNews</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Sign out of the organiser's Zoom account (if used)</li>
<li>If you are meeting regularly, set up the next event on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">https://events.indieweb.org</a>

<h3><span id="Setup">Setup</span></h3>
<ul><li>17:00 arrive at the venue and:
<ul><li>make sure there is suitable seating for those that have RSVPd</li>
<li>make or bring a sign that clearly indicates the presence of an IndieWebCamp Homebrew Website Club meeting. If you come up with a nice sign design, please upload it to the wiki!</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>17:20 put the sign out (or put up the IndieWebCamp logo on monitors in the space if any)
<ul><li>save seats for at least a few of the folks who RSVPd</li>
<li>consider setting aside a separate room or space for "Conversation Corner" for those that can't help but want to carry on a conversation during Quiet Writing Hour!</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>17:25 test your projector setup to make sure people can show demos of their sites during the "Broadcast" half-hour from 18:30-19:30.</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Quiet_Writing_Hour">Quiet Writing Hour</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>17:30-18:30 optional Quiet Writing Hour</b>: some locations have started hosting a quiet writing hour from 17:30-18:30 immediately before the meetup itself.</li></ul>
<h3><span id="HWC_Broadcast">HWC Broadcast</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>18:30-19:00: Broadcast</b> - take turns with the microphone 1-2 minutes on:</li>
<li>if this is your first time, introduce yourself, name, URL, what you'd like to do next with your personal site.</li>
<li>something <b>new you created on or for your site</b> since the last time you attended</li>
<li><b>questions</b> about anything you're stuck on <b>about your personal site</b></li>
<li><b>notable</b> indieweb / ownyourdata related <b>press</b> / events</li></ul>
<h3><span id="HWC_Group_Photo">HWC Group Photo</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>~19:00: Group photo</b> - organizers should call time on the "broadcast" phase and then organize and take a group photo to upload to the wiki and embed in the "Photos" section on the page for the specific event. This also helps break-up existing sitting patterns and gives people a chance to move around.</li></ul>
<p>Please be sure to:
</p>
<ul><li>Give folks a heads-up before you take a photo, especially in virtual meetups, to give folks an opportunity to opt-out</li>
<li>Make sure there are 2+ people who want to be in the photo, otherwise it looks like a meetup by one person with only one person which isn't really a meetup.</li></ul>
<p>You may omit a photo if there is only one person who wants to be in the photo.
</p>
<h3><span id="HWC_Peer_to_Peer">HWC Peer to Peer</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>~19:00-19:30: Peer-to-peer</b> - encourage everyone to find others they heard in the previous half hour that were interested in similar topics. Help newcomers with <a href="https://indieweb.org/getting_started" title="getting started">getting started</a> with their personal sites, and hopefully even logging into the wiki and adding themselves to the RSVP section for the meeting!</li></ul>
<h3><span id="HWC_Group_Photo_2">HWC Group Photo 2</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>~19:30: Group photo</b> - If you forgot to take a group photo, or anyone new showed up, use the end of the peer-to-peer session as an opportunity to take another group photo.</li></ul>
<h3><span id="HWC_Clean-up_and_close">HWC Clean-up and close</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>~19:45-20:00: Clean-up and meeting closure</b> - get everyone to help clean-up and leave the meeting space cleaner than they found it (BarCamp style). Encourage folks to continue discussions at a nearby pub or cafe and get food/drink too!</li></ul>
<h3><span id="HWC_Immediately_after">HWC Immediately after</span></h3>
<ul><li>Combine notes from the broadcast portion of the meetup into a post.
<ul><li>(Optionally) Syndicate the post to <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieNews" title="IndieNews">IndieNews</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Add to the event page on the wiki:
<ul><li>At least one group photo from your meeting.</li>
<li>Any other wrap-up posts with notes from the meeting.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h2><span id="Planning_Questions">Planning Questions</span></h2>
<p>In rough order of when a co-organizer might encounter these:
</p>
<h3><span id="Finding_a_venue">Finding a venue</span></h3>
<p>How do I find a venue?
</p>
<ul><li>Check out cafes that have an environment where people are sparse and the cafe is ok with hanging out with laptops for an hour or two.</li></ul>
<p>What kind of food venue is works well?
</p>
<ul><li>Cafe style is best, where you order at the counter separately, and can come and go independently.</li>
<li>Wifi is a nice to have (or get someone to bring a mifi hotspot and share)</li>
<li>Power outlets are also a nice to have</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Adding_to_the_wiki">Adding to the wiki</span></h3>
<p>How should a co-organizer add a HWC-event to the wiki?
</p><p>We are now using <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">https://events.indieweb.org/</a> for HWC-events!
</p><p>The easiest is to clone an existing event, e.g.:
</p>
<ul><li>Find the most recent HWC in your city in <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/archive">https://events.indieweb.org/archive</a></li>
<li>Click the drop-down next to "Edit" on the right and choose "Clone Event"</li>
<li>Edit the event details to fix the date, confirm the time &amp; venue, update the description</li>
<li>Save!</li></ul>
<p>If there isn't a previous HWC event in your city, feel free to clone from another HWC event, e.g.:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://events.indieweb.org/2020/03/homebrew-website-club-san-francisco-KTBJlSw7JJKm">https://events.indieweb.org/2020/03/homebrew-website-club-san-francisco-KTBJlSw7JJKm</a></li></ul>
<h3><span id="Promoting_an_HWC_event">Promoting an HWC event</span></h3>
<p>How do I promote an HWC event? 
</p>
<ul><li>Invite participants from previous HWC events in the same city.</li>
<li>Invite participants from <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps" title="IndieWebCamps">IndieWebCamps</a> from that city</li></ul>
<p>There are several <a href="#Logos_and_Graphics">logos and graphics</a> you can use in your promotions.
</p>
<h3><span id="Promoting_Regular_HWC_Meetups">Promoting Regular HWC Meetups</span></h3>
<p>Some organizers have found it useful to create a separate web and social media presence for their group. This allows potential attendees to stay up-to-date on upcoming events without needing to follow the organizers' feeds, and (potentially) allows multiple organizers to manage announcements and marketing. 
</p>

<h3><span id="What_to_bring">What to bring</span></h3>
<p>What should I bring to the meetup?
</p>
<ul><li>A sign saying Homebrew Website Club might be helpful</li></ul>
<h3><span id="How_to_wrap_up">How to wrap up</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>Make sure to take a photo</b> and upload it to the event on events.indieweb.org!
<ul><li>There's a convenient "Add Photo" option in the drop-down menu next to "Edit" in the top right of the event page.</li></ul></li>
<li>Let folks know you have to wrap up, and either
<ul><li>If the venue is public like a cafe, encourage them to stay as long as they like</li>
<li>If you’re the venue host like in an office, provide suggestions of nearby eating and drinking places where folks can continue discussions and perhaps grab a snack</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, IndieWeb meetups have moved to online formats. <a href="https://indieweb.org/Organizer" title="Organizer">Organizers</a> have been rotating organizing duties and are experimenting with different formats. Here are some of my notes from the last few weeks: <span><img src="https://gregorlove.com/site/assets/files/3473/profile-2016-med.jpg" alt="">  <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Gregorlove.com" title="User:Gregorlove.com">gRegor Morrill</a></span> 14:35, 8 April 2020 (PDT)

<ul><li>Familiarize yourself with <a href="https://indieweb.org/Zoom#Tips_for_Hosts" title="Zoom">Zoom - Tips for Hosts</a>
<ul><li>Screen sharing should be set to "Only Host". The host can share their screen to show people's sites during introductions. You may also be able to designate a co-host to handle screen sharing.</li></ul></li>
<li>Welcome
<ul><li>Direct attendees to <a href="https://indieweb.org/discuss">https://indieweb.org/discuss</a> for chat options; encourage notes and questions in the main channel instead of in Zoom chat</li>
<li>Point out the <a href="https://indieweb.org/code_of_conduct" title="code of conduct">code of conduct</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Introductions
<ul><li>Introduce yourself and your site following <a href="https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#HWC_Broadcast" title="Homebrew Website Club">HWC Broadcast</a>, then offer each attendee to introduce themselves. Note: attendee videos don't appear in the same order on everyone's screen, so a host should select the order to avoid confusion.</li></ul></li>
<li>Group photo: Explain you're taking a screenshot for the event page and the weekly newsletter, allowing people to turn their video on or off as they prefer.</li>
<li>Main meetup: This is where the format can vary. Some approaches so far:
<ul><li>Ask what topics people are interested in discussing, noting them in chat. Then attendees can vote on their preferred priority in chat. Set a timebox for each topic then proceed through each topic.</li>
<li>Looser, general discussion without timeboxes</li>
<li>A quiet writing period followed by discussion</li></ul></li>
<li>Group photo: if more people joined since the first photo, consider taking another photo</li></ul>

<p>This is an archive of the HWC 2016 planning, <a href="https://indieweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Planning&amp;oldid=50980#HWC_2016">originally found here</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<p><span id="HWC">2016 <a>Homebrew Website Club</a></span> start date! Should we start the 2016 HWC meetups on:
</p>
<ul><li><s>2016-01-06 only one week after 2015-12-30, </s>
</li>
<li><b>2016-01-13 two weeks after 2015-12-30</b>,
<ul><li>but collides with Wednesday before US Thanksgiving thus unlikely to have much (any) participation at US venues.</li>
<li>0 <span><img src="https://tantek.com/logo.jpg" alt=""> <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Tantek.com" title="User:Tantek.com">Tantek Çelik</a></span> ok with this.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Based on lack of strong input on this, we are going with the default continuing every two weeks from 2015-12-30 and <b>starting 2016 HWC with 2016-01-13.</b> - <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Tantek.com" title="User:Tantek.com">Tantek</a> 14:56, 23 December 2015 (PST) (updated, no objections, going with this plan. <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Tantek.com" title="User:Tantek.com">Tantek</a> 07:51, 31 December 2015 (PST))
</p><p>Getting some feedback that pages on organizing HWC hard to find, I think it maybe best to make a new page that is an HWC toolkit and port most of this content over. 
</p><p>At top of this page put two buttons one "Attend an HWC" and another "Organize an HWC"

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="tx2NYc"><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>We are excited to unveil <a href="https://cloud.google.com/infrastructure-manager/docs/overview">Infrastructure Manager</a>, which provides the capabilities of <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a> as a Google Cloud managed service. With Infrastructure Manager, you can manage your Google Cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, built on the robust foundation of Terraform. This brings the best of both worlds, offering a managed and streamlined experience for deploying, configuring, and managing your cloud resources using declarative configuration. Infrastructure Manager is generally available.&nbsp;</p><h3>Streamlining Google Cloud infrastructure with Terraform</h3><p>Infrastructure Manager leverages the Terraform infrastructure provisioning tool to provide an intuitive and robust way to manage Google Cloud infrastructure that’s fully integrated within the Google Cloud ecosystem. Now, you can harness the full potential of Google Cloud using <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax" target="_blank">Terraform's declarative syntax</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/blueprints/terraform-blueprints">reusable modules</a>, validation (<a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/validate" target="_blank">syntax</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/policy-validation">policy</a>), and infrastructure management capabilities, to reliably provision and scale your Google Cloud infrastructure.</p><h3>Key features and benefits</h3><ol><li><p><b>Infrastructure management</b>: Infrastructure Manager lets you manage your Google Cloud infrastructure using Terraform and <a href="https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/cloud-infrastructure/" target="_blank">IaC approach</a> without needing to set up build pipelines. This allows you to deploy, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share. Infrastructure Manager can help you to automate and standardize your deployment workflows, enabling consistency, efficiency, and scalability across your infrastructure deployments.</p></li><li><p><b>Resource Lifecycle Management</b>: Infrastructure Manager simplifies the management of your cloud deployments thanks to Terraform's state management capabilities. You can easily track and manage the lifecycle of your resources, update configurations, and apply changes in a controlled and auditable manner. With Terraform's Plan and Apply workflow, Infrastructure Manager helps ensure predictability and minimizes the risk of unintended infrastructure changes.</p></li><li><p><b>Streamlined Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</b>: Easily provision and manage Compute Engine instances, Cloud Storage buckets, BigQuery datasets, Kubernetes clusters, and more — all using Google Cloud’s library of pre-packaged and recommended <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/blueprints/terraform-blueprints">Terraform modules</a>, <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs" target="_blank">Terraform Providers</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions#section-3">Jump Start Solutions</a>. Let Infrastructure Manager take care of automation and managing dependencies.</p></li><li><p><b>Integration with the Google Cloud ecosystem</b>: Infrastructure Manager integrates with other Google Cloud products and services, further enhancing your infrastructure management experience. Whether it's Cloud Logging for monitoring and troubleshooting or Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control, Infrastructure Manager leverages Google Cloud's ecosystem to provide a comprehensive and cohesive solution.</p></li></ol><h3>Infrastructure management at scale</h3><p>Google Cloud Infrastructure Manager, built on Terraform, simplifies the way you manage your Google Cloud infrastructure. By combining the power of Infrastructure as Code with the flexibility and scalability of Terraform, Infrastructure Manager offers a managed, scalable, and efficient solution for provisioning, configuring, and managing your Google Cloud resources.</p><p>Start using Infrastructure Manager to manage your Google Cloud resources.

  <p>[<strong>Update 1/13/2021</strong>: I wrote a follow-up with <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2021/01/13/optimizing-donut.html">some optimizations</a>. ]</p>

<p>There has been a sudden resurgence of interest in my <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2006/09/15/obfuscated-c-donut.html">“donut” code from 2006</a>, and I’ve
had a couple requests to explain this one.  It’s been five years now, so it’s
not exactly fresh in my memory, so I will reconstruct it from scratch, in great
detail, and hopefully get approximately the same result.</p>

<p>This is the code:</p>
<pre>             k;double sin()
         ,cos();main(){float A=
       0,B=0,i,j,z[1760];char b[
     1760];printf("\x1b[2J");for(;;
  ){memset(b,32,1760);memset(z,0,7040)
  ;for(j=0;6.28&gt;j;j+=0.07)for(i=0;6.28
 &gt;i;i+=0.02){float c=sin(i),d=cos(j),e=
 sin(A),f=sin(j),g=cos(A),h=d+2,D=1/(c*
 h*e+f*g+5),l=cos      (i),m=cos(B),n=s\
in(B),t=c*h*g-f*        e;int x=40+30*D*
(l*h*m-t*n),y=            12+15*D*(l*h*n
+t*m),o=x+80*y,          N=8*((f*e-c*d*g
 )*m-c*d*e-f*g-l        *d*n);if(22&gt;y&amp;&amp;
 y&gt;0&amp;&amp;x&gt;0&amp;&amp;80&gt;x&amp;&amp;D&gt;z[o]){z[o]=D;;;b[o]=

  printf("\x1b[H");for(k=0;1761&gt;k;k++)
   putchar(k%80?b[k]:10);A+=0.04;B+=
     0.02;}}/*****####*******!!=;:~

<p>…and the output, animated in Javascript:

<pre id="d"></pre>

<p>At its core, it’s a framebuffer and a Z-buffer into which I render pixels.
Since it’s just rendering relatively low-resolution ASCII art, I massively
cheat.  All it does is plot pixels along the surface of the torus at
fixed-angle increments, and does it densely enough that the final result looks
solid.  The “pixels” it plots are ASCII characters corresponding to the
illumination value of the surface at each point: <code>.,-~:;=!*#$@</code> from dimmest to
brightest.  No raytracing required.</p>

<p>So how do we do that?  Well, let’s start with the basic math behind 3D
perspective rendering.  The following diagram is a side view of a person
sitting in front of a screen, viewing a 3D object behind it.</p>

<center><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/perspective.png"></center>

<p>To render a 3D object onto a 2D screen, we project each point (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) in
3D-space onto a plane located <em>z’</em> units away from the viewer, so that the
corresponding 2D position is (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>).  Since we’re looking from the side,
we can only see the <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> axes, but the math works the same for the <em>x</em>
axis (just pretend this is a top view instead).  This projection is really easy
to obtain: notice that the origin, the <em>y</em>-axis, and point (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) form a
right triangle, and a similar right triangle is formed with (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>,<em>z’</em>).
Thus the relative proportions are maintained:</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{y'}{z'} &amp;= \frac{y}{z} \\
y' &amp;= \frac{y z'}{z}.
\end{aligned}\]

<p>So to project a 3D coordinate to 2D, we scale a coordinate by the screen
distance <em>z’</em>.  Since <em>z’</em> is a fixed constant, and not functionally a
coordinate, let’s rename it to <em>K<sub>1</sub></em>, so our projection equation
becomes \((x',y') = (\frac{K_1 x}{z}, \frac{K_1 y}{z})\).  We can choose
<em>K<sub>1</sub></em> arbitrarily based on the field of view we want to show in our
2D window.  For example, if we have a 100x100 window of pixels, then the view
is centered at (50,50); and if we want to see an object which is 10 units wide
in our 3D space, set back 5 units from the viewer, then <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> should
be chosen so that the projection of the point <em>x</em>=10, <em>z</em>=5 is still on the
screen with <em>x’</em> &lt; 50: 10<em>K<sub>1</sub></em>/5 &lt; 50, or <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> &lt; 25.</p>

<p>When we’re plotting a bunch of points, we might end up plotting different
points at the same (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>) location but at different depths, so we maintain
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">z-buffer</a> which stores
the <em>z</em> coordinate of everything we draw.  If we need to plot a location, we
first check to see whether we’re plotting in front of what’s there already.  It
also helps to compute <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> \(= \frac{1}{z}\) and use that when depth
buffering because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> = 0 corresponds to infinite depth, so we can pre-initialize
our z-buffer to 0 and have the background be infinitely far away</li>
  <li>we can re-use <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> when computing <em>x’</em> and <em>y’</em>:
Dividing once and multiplying by <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> twice is cheaper than
dividing by <em>z</em> twice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, how do we draw a donut, AKA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus">torus</a>?  Well, a torus is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution">solid of
revolution</a>, so one way to do it is to draw a 2D circle around some point in
3D space, and then rotate it around the central axis of the torus.  Here is a
cross-section through the center of a torus:</p>

<center><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/torusxsec.png"></center>

<p>So we have a circle of radius <em>R</em><sub>1</sub> centered at point
(<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>,0,0), drawn on the <em>xy</em>-plane.  We can draw this by sweeping
an angle — let’s call it <em>θ</em> — from 0 to 2π:</p>

<p>\[
(x,y,z) = (R_2,0,0) + (R_1 \cos \theta, R_1 \sin \theta, 0)
\]</p>

<p>Now we take that circle and rotate it around the <em>y</em>-axis by another angle
— let’s call it φ.  To rotate an arbitrary 3D point around one of the
cardinal axes, the standard technique is to multiply by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix">rotation matrix</a>.  So if
we take the previous points and rotate about the <em>y</em>-axis we get:</p>

\[\left( \begin{matrix}
R_2 + R_1 \cos \theta, &amp;
R_1 \sin \theta, &amp;
0 \end{matrix} \right)
\cdot
\left( \begin{matrix}
\cos \phi &amp; 0 &amp; \sin \phi \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
-\sin \phi &amp; 0 &amp; \cos \phi \end{matrix} \right)\]

\[= \left( \begin{matrix}
(R_2 + R_1 \cos \theta)\cos \phi, &amp;
R_1 \sin \theta, &amp;
-(R_2 + R_1 \cos \theta)\sin \phi \end{matrix} \right)\]

<p>But wait: we also want the whole donut to spin around on at least two more axes
for the animation.  They were called <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> in the original code: it was a
rotation about the <em>x</em>-axis by <em>A</em> and a rotation about the <em>z</em>-axis by <em>B</em>.
This is a bit hairier, so I’m not even going write the result yet, but it’s a
bunch of matrix multiplies.</p>

\[\left( \begin{matrix}
R_2 + R_1 \cos \theta, &amp;
R_1 \sin \theta, &amp;
0 \end{matrix} \right)
\cdot
\left( \begin{matrix}
\cos \phi &amp; 0 &amp; \sin \phi \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
-\sin \phi &amp; 0 &amp; \cos \phi \end{matrix} \right)
\cdot
\left( \begin{matrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos A &amp; \sin A \\
0 &amp; -\sin A &amp; \cos A \end{matrix} \right)
\cdot
\left( \begin{matrix}
\cos B &amp; \sin B &amp; 0 \\
-\sin B &amp; \cos B &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right)\]

<p>Churning through the above gets us an (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) point on the surface of our
torus, rotated around two axes, centered at the origin.  To actually get screen
coordinates, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move the torus somewhere in front of the viewer (the viewer is at the
origin) — so we just add some constant to <em>z</em> to move it backward.</li>
  <li>Project from 3D onto our 2D screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we have another constant to pick, call it <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>, for the distance
of the donut from the viewer, and our projection now looks like:</p>

<p>\[
\left( x’, y’ \right)
=
\left( \frac{K_1 x}{K_2 + z} , \frac{K_1 y}{K_2 + z} \right)
\]</p>

<p><em>K</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>K</em><sub>2</sub> can be tweaked together to change the field
of view and flatten or exaggerate the depth of the object.</p>

<p>Now, we could implement a 3x3 matrix multiplication routine in our code and
implement the above in a straightforward way.  But if our goal is to shrink the
code as much as possible, then every 0 in the matrices above is an opportunity
for simplification.  So let’s multiply it out.  Churning through a bunch of
algebra (thanks Mathematica!), the full result is:</p>

\[\left( \begin{matrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{matrix} \right) =
\left( \begin{matrix}
 (R_2 + R_1 \cos \theta) (\cos B \cos \phi + \sin A \sin B \sin \phi) - 
   R_1 \cos A \sin B \sin \theta \\

 (R_2 + R_1 \cos \theta) (\cos \phi \sin B - \cos B \sin A \sin \phi) + 
   R_1 \cos A \cos B \sin \theta \\
 \cos A (R_2 + R_1 \cos \theta) \sin \phi + R_1 \sin A \sin \theta
\end{matrix} \right)\]

<p>Well, that looks pretty hideous, but we we can precompute some common
subexpressions (e.g. all the sines and cosines, and \(R_2 + R_1 \cos \theta\))
and reuse them in the code.  In fact I came up with a completely different
factoring in the original code but that’s left as an exercise for the reader.
(The original code also swaps the sines and cosines of A, effectively rotating
by 90 degrees, so I guess my initial derivation was a bit different but that’s
OK.)</p>

<p>Now we know where to put the pixel, but we still haven’t even considered which
shade to plot.  To calculate illumination, we need to know the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal">surface normal</a> —
the direction perpendicular to the surface at each point.  If we have that,
then we can take the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot
product</a> of the surface normal with the light direction, which we can choose
arbitrarily.  That gives us the cosine of the angle between the light direction
and the surface direction: If the dot product is &gt;0, the surface is facing
the light and if it’s &lt;0, it faces away from the light.  The higher the
value, the more light falls on the surface.</p>

<p>The derivation of the surface normal direction turns out to be pretty much the
same as our derivation of the point in space.  We start with a point on a
circle, rotate it around the torus’s central axis, and then make two more
rotations.  The surface normal of the point on the circle is fairly obvious:
it’s the same as the point on a unit (radius=1) circle centered at the origin.</p>

<p>So our surface normal (<em>N<sub>x</sub></em>, <em>N<sub>y</sub></em>, <em>N<sub>z</sub></em>) is
derived the same as above, except the point we start with is just (cos
<em>θ</em>, sin <em>θ</em>, 0).  Then we apply the same rotations:</p>

\[\left( \begin{matrix}
N_x, &amp;
N_y, &amp;
N_z \end{matrix} \right)
=
\left( \begin{matrix}
\cos \theta, &amp;
\sin \theta, &amp;
0 \end{matrix} \right)
\cdot
\left( \begin{matrix}
\cos \phi &amp; 0 &amp; \sin \phi \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
-\sin \phi &amp; 0 &amp; \cos \phi \end{matrix} \right)
\cdot
\left( \begin{matrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos A &amp; \sin A \\
0 &amp; -\sin A &amp; \cos A \end{matrix} \right)
\cdot
\left( \begin{matrix}
\cos B &amp; \sin B &amp; 0 \\
-\sin B &amp; \cos B &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right)\]

<p>So which lighting direction should we choose?  How about we light up surfaces
facing behind and above the viewer: \((0,1,-1)\).  Technically
this should be a normalized unit vector, and this vector has a magnitude of
√2.  That’s okay – we will compensate later.  Therefore we compute the
above (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>), throw away the <em>x</em> and get our luminance <em>L</em> = <em>y</em>-<em>z</em>.</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
L &amp;=
\left( \begin{matrix}
N_x, &amp;
N_y, &amp;
N_z \end{matrix} \right)
\cdot
\left( \begin{matrix}
0, &amp;
1, &amp;
-1 \end{matrix} \right)
\\
&amp;= 
\cos \phi \cos \theta \sin B - \cos A \cos \theta \sin \phi - \sin A \sin \theta + 
 \cos B ( \cos A \sin \theta - \cos \theta \sin A \sin \phi)
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Again, not too pretty, but not terrible once we’ve precomputed all the sines
and cosines.</p>

<p>So now all that’s left to do is to pick some values for <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>.  In the original donut
code I chose <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>=1 and <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>=2, so it has the same
geometry as my cross-section diagram above.  <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> controls the
scale, which depends on our pixel resolution and is in fact different for <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em> in the ASCII animation.  <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>, the distance from the viewer
to the donut, was chosen to be 5.</p>

<p>I’ve taken the above equations and written a quick and dirty canvas
implementation here, just plotting the pixels and the lighting values from the
equations above.  The result is not exactly the same as the original as some of
my rotations are in opposite directions or off by 90 degrees, but it is
qualitatively doing the same thing.</p>

<p>Here it is: </p>

<canvas id="canvasdonut" width="300" height="240">
</canvas>

<p>It’s slightly mind-bending because you can see right through the torus, but the
math does work!  Convert that to an ASCII rendering with <em>z</em>-buffering, and
you’ve got yourself a clever little program.</p>

<p>Now, we have all the pieces, but how do we write the code?  Roughly like this
(some pseudocode liberties have been taken with 2D arrays):</p>
