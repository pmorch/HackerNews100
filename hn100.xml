                Last year, the city of Las Vegas reached a record 120 degrees during the peak of summer. The Clark County Coroner's Office found that heat was a factor in more than 500 deaths. Now, city, county and local advocates are planting thousands of trees to help bring down temperatures in the hottest neighborhoods. Trees can have a significant impact on mitigating heat.

                The lack of tree canopy in many of Las Vegas' neighborhoods is an important issue. Research has shown trees can lower the temperature in the area around them by at least 10 degrees. Temperatures can range significantly more depending on the surroundings, but even 10 degrees can make a big difference.

                Studies show heat disproportionately affects lower-income neighborhoods. This has a ripple effect, according to Ariel Choinard of the Southern Nevada Heat Resilience Lab. People in these neighborhoods end up paying more to cool their homes. And they may have to choose between keeping their home at a livable temperature and other necessities like food or medication.

   <p>In April, Choinard visited several urban heat island neighborhoods to demonstrate how the built environment can dramatically increase surface temperatures, and the significant difference trees can make. </p>   
   <p>A <a href="https://www.rtcsnv.com/projects-initiatives/projects/current-projects/southern-nevada-urban-heat-mapping-project-v2/" target="_blank">2022 heat mapping project</a> found that several areas, including East Las Vegas and North Las Vegas, can experience temperatures up to 11 degrees hotter than other parts of the region. Each of these neighborhoods is relatively poorer than other parts of Las Vegas.</p>

   <p>"Folks here have to work harder and longer to afford to cool their homes," Choinard said. "And we know that people make really tough trade-offs when it's superhot."</p>   <p>That can mean choosing between keeping their homes at a safe and comfortable temperature and paying for groceries, or limiting medication. </p>   <p>Choinard pointed out a mature tree providing plenty of shade in a neighborhood without many others.</p>   <p>"It's this tree that's doing really great work here," she said.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-71099">

   <p>On this day in April, it was 95 degrees out. But under the tree, it was much cooler. Choinard measured the temperature on the ground with an infrared thermometer: 87 degrees.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/publications/urban-tree-cover-provides-consistent-mitigation-extreme-heat-arid-not-humid-cities" target="_blank">Trees help cool the air</a> through a process known as transpiration cooling. Essentially, trees release water into the atmosphere from their leaves, cooling the air around them. Tree cover also provides shade, keeping sidewalks, roads and buildings from absorbing and trapping as much of the sun's heat.</p>   <p>At the Desert Inn Estates, a mobile home community with few trees in East Las Vegas, Choinard pointed the infrared thermometer at a picnic table sitting directly in the sun.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-71133">

                Many older neighborhoods and mobile home communities still have palm trees and cactuses, which provide a particular visual aesthetic but little shade.&nbsp;Local leaders are moving toward nonnative, drought-tolerant trees that can provide shade. Here, at the Desert Inn Estates, two palm trees stand high above a road with little other foliage.

   <h3>Planting 2,000 trees a year</h3>   <p>That's why the county, the city and nonprofits are all increasing efforts to plant more trees in the desert.</p>   <p>"Our 2050 goal is to plant 60,000 trees within the city of Las Vegas, and that breaks down to a little over 2,000 trees a year," said Brad Daseler, the city's urban forester.</p>   
   <p>Daseler is bringing in mostly nonnative plants that provide shade and are drought tolerant, like oak trees from northern Mexico and eucalyptus trees from Australia. </p>   <p>"Las Vegas is a pretty challenging environment for plant material in general because we do get so warm, but we also have the ability to freeze," Daseler said. "So finding trees that can survive in both of those climate extremes absolutely is a challenge."</p>   <p>And you can't just plant any tree in any place, Daseler says. There's nuance and strategy to what kind of trees are chosen for what areas.</p>   <p>Walking through the city tree nursery, he pointed out a young bur oak.</p>   <p>"Those would be trees that we would use more in our park spaces," he said. Other trees, like the Indian rosewood, can better withstand the harshness of being planted in a median, surrounded by asphalt and concrete, with a "high heat load."</p>   <p>The region is currently <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/" target="_blank">in a drought</a> that the U.S. Drought Monitor has classified as "exceptional" — its severest category.</p>   <p>So there's a delicate balancing act, Daseler said, in maximizing both trees and water. </p>   <p>That's a constant challenge in the desert, says Choinard.</p>   <p>"There's always that question of, what is the highest use of a gallon of water?" she said. "But when we're talking about the long-term viability of our communities, I think a tree is a great thing to put water on."</p>   <div id="resg-s1-71135">

                Planting trees for their specific environment is an important piece of the puzzle, according to Brad Daseler. For example, he might choose to plant a tree with a smaller profile to fit a narrower patch of sidewalk or a backyard garden, versus a city park. Here, Daseler points out tree pots with a textured felt lining that helps keep roots from binding up. "There's a lot of nuance to planting trees," Daseler says.

   <h3>Teaching the next generation</h3>   <p>The tree-planting effort has also spread to some schools, which are starting garden clubs.</p>   <p>On a weekend this spring, students and parents gathered in the garden at Booker Elementary School. Students planted trees, fruits and vegetables in beds — each with its own letter, spelling out S-T-E-M (for science, technology, engineering and mathematics).</p>   <p>"Don't give plants too much water, but you need it to have some water so it can grow,"  said third-grader Donovan Pantoja. </p>   
   <p>His mom, Natalie Hernandez, said the project instills positive life lessons, and teaches kids to be environmentally conscious.</p>   <p>"And then they may teach their kids," she said.

    <a href="https://justin.searls.co/posts/why-agents-are-bad-pair-programmers/">
      
    </a>

    <p>LLM agents make bad pairs because <strong>they code faster than humans think</strong>.</p>
<p>I'll admit, I've had a lot of fun <a href="https://justin.searls.co/tubes/2025-04-19-17h46m37s/">using GitHub Copilot's agent mode in VS Code</a> this month. It's invigorating to watch it effortlessly write a working method on the first try. It's a relief when the agent unblocks me by reaching for a framework API I didn't even know existed. It's motivating to pair with someone even more tirelessly committed to my goal than I am.</p>
<p>In fact, pairing with top LLMs evokes many memories of pairing with top human programmers.</p>
<p><em>The worst memories.</em></p>
<p>Memories of my pair grabbing the keyboard and—in total and unhelpful silence—hammering out code faster than I could ever hope to read it. Memories of slowly, inevitably becoming disengaged after expending all my mental energy in a futile attempt to keep up. Memories of my pair hitting a roadblock and finally looking to me for help, only to catch me off guard and without a clue as to what had been going on in the preceding minutes, hours, or days. Memories of gradually realizing my pair had been building the <em>wrong thing all along</em> and then suddenly realizing the task now fell to me to remediate a boatload of incidental complexity in order to hit a deadline.</p>
<p>So yes, pairing with an AI agent can be uncannily similar to pairing with an expert programmer.</p>

<h2 id="the-path-forward">
    <a href="#the-path-forward">The path forward</a>
</h2>
<p>What should we do instead? Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The same thing I did with human pair programmers who wanted to take the ball and run with it: I let them have it. In a perfect world, pairing might lead to a better solution, but there's no point in forcing it when both parties aren't bought in. Instead, I'd break the work down into discrete sub-components for my colleague to build independently. I would then review those pieces as pull requests. Translating that advice to LLM-based tools: <strong>give up on editor-based agentic pairing in favor of asynchronous workflows like GitHub's new <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/">Coding Agent</a></strong>, whose work you can <em>also</em> review via pull request</li>
<li>Continue to practice pair-programming with your editor, but <strong>throttle down from the semi-autonomous "Agent" mode to the turn-based "Edit" or "Ask" modes</strong>. You'll go slower, and <em>that's the point</em>. Also, just like pairing with humans, try to establish a rigorously consistent workflow as opposed to only reaching for AI to troubleshoot. I've found that <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html#PingPong">ping-pong pairing</a> with an AI in Edit mode (where the LLM can propose individual edits but you must manually accept them) strikes the best balance between accelerated productivity and continuous quality control</li>
</ol>
<p>Give people a few more months with agents and I think (hope) others will arrive at similar conclusions about their suitability as pair programmers. My advice to the AI tool-makers would be to introduce features to make pairing with an AI agent more qualitatively similar to pairing with a human. Agentic pair programmers are not inherently bad, but their lightning-fast speed has the unintended consequence of undercutting any opportunity for collaborating with us mere mortals. If an agent were designed to type at a slower pace, pause and discuss periodically, and frankly expect more of us as equal partners, that could make for a hell of a product offering.</p>
<p>Just imagining it now, any of these features would make agent-based pairing much more effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let users set how many lines-per-minute of code—or words-per-minute of prose—the agent outputs</li>
<li>Allow users to pause the agent to ask a clarifying question or push back on its direction without derailing the entire activity or train of thought</li>
<li>Expand beyond the chat metaphor by adding UI primitives that mirror the work to be done. Enable users to pin the current working session to a particular GitHub issue. Integrate a built-in to-do list to tick off before the feature is complete. That sort of thing</li>
<li>Design agents to act with less self-confidence and more self-doubt. They should frequently stop to converse: validate <em>why</em> we're building this, solicit advice on the best approach, and express concern when we're going in the wrong direction</li>
<li>Introduce advanced voice chat to better emulate human-to-human pairing, which would allow the user both to keep their eyes on the code (instead of darting back and forth between an editor and a chat sidebar) and to light up the parts of the brain that find mouth-words more engaging than text</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, that's how I see it from where I'm sitting the morning of Friday, May 30th, 2025. Who knows where these tools will be in a week or month or year, but I'm fairly confident you could find worse advice on meeting this moment.</p>

            More than 700 Marines based out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in California have been mobilized to respond to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/politics/trump-national-guard-los-angeles-hegseth">the protests in Los Angeles</a>, and the troops will join the thousands of National Guard members who were activated by President Donald Trump over the weekend without the consent of California’s governor or LA’s mayor.

            The deployment of the full Marine battalion marks a significant escalation in Trump’s use of the military as a show of force against protesters, but it is still unclear what their specific task will be once in LA, sources told CNN. Like the National Guard troops, they are prohibited from conducting law enforcement activity such as making arrests unless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which permits the president to use the military to end an insurrection or rebellion of federal power.

            The Marines being activated are with 2nd battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine division, according to US Northern Command. The activation is “intended to provide Task Force 51 with adequate numbers of forces to provide continuous coverage of the area in support of the lead federal agency,” NORTHCOM said in statement, referring to US Army north’s contingency command post.

            One of the people familiar with the Marine mobilization said they will be augmenting the guard presence on the ground in LA.<strong> </strong>

            Approximately 1,700 National Guard members are now operating in the greater Los Angeles area, two days after Trump’s Saturday memorandum deploying 2,000 service members, according to a statement from NORTHCOM. On Monday evening, the Pentagon announced that Trump ordered the deployment of an additional batch of 2,000 more National Guard members. It is unclear when the rest of the initial group, or the new troops announced Monday, would arrive in Los Angeles.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbpx81n800033b6mkpbitc4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The Marines are expected to bolster some of the guard members who have been deployed to LA in the last two days, this person said.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbpiwbhi00053b6mtr3q7lia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            And while the person familiar stressed that the Marines were being deployed only to augment the forces already there, the image of US Marines mobilizing inside the United States will stand in contrast to National Guardsmen who more routinely respond to domestic issues. While some Marines have been assisting in border security at the southern border, one US official said Marines have not been mobilized within the US like they are in California now since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbphz76k00003b6m0ocepmlq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            While the Marines’ tasks have not been specified publicly, they could include assignments like crowd control or establishing perimeter security. Lawyers within the Defense Department are also still finalizing language around the use-of-force guidelines for the troops being mobilized, but the person familiar said it will likely mirror the military’s standing rules of the use of force.
    </p>

            California Gov. Gavin Newsom described the involvement of Marines as “unwarranted” and “unprecedented.”
    </p>

            “The level of escalation is completely unwarranted, uncalled for, and unprecedented — mobilizing the best in class branch of the U.S. military against its own citizens,” Newsom said in a statement linking to a news story about the Marines mobilizing.

            Newsom disputed the characterization as a “deployment,” which the governor described as different from mobilization. US Northern Command said in their statement, however, that the Marines will “seamlessly integrate” with National Guard forces “protecting federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles area.”
    </p>

The band played gospel music, seemingly a far cry from the funk and psychedelia he would later become known for, but Sly and the Family Stone would become known for its blending of music styles.</p><p>Sly Stone would answer simply when writing in his 2023 memoir, "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)," about how he wanted to be remembered: "Music, just music."</p><p>"I don't want to get in people's way and I don't want them to get in my way. I just want to play my songs," he said. "I would do it for nothing."</p><p>He was born in Texas in 1943, the second oldest of five children, but his family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area when he was young. He got a job as a disc jockey in the early '60s and played everything from British rock to soul music.</p><p>Sly and the Family Stone formed in 1966 as a combination of Sly and his brother Freddie's individual bands. Sister Rose also joined the group. Loretta chose not to pursue music while younger sister Vaetta performed in her own band, Little Sister, and would join Sly and the Family Stone for occasional gigs.</p><p>While Sly was predominantly a guitarist when the band formed, he allowed Freddie to take that role in the new group and mostly played keyboard. However, he was, by many accounts, a musical prodigy. He learned to play guitar, keyboard, bass and the drums as a child.</p><p>The Family Stone was the first major American rock band to be racially integrated.</p><p>Sly and the Family Stone released its first album in October 1967, "A Whole New Thing," but it received only limited attention. Just a month later, the band would be launched into the stratosphere when it released the single "Dance to the Music."</p><p>"Dance to the Music" peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart.</p><p>"I knew the music worked, but I didn’t know if people would get it," Stone <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/06/i-never-lived-a-life-i-didnt-want-to-live-sly-stone-on-addiction-ageing-and-changing-music-for-ever" target="_blank">told The Guardian</a> in 2023 in a rare interview during the later years of his life. “That’s what happened after the first album -- I poured everything into those songs.

Everything that was modern music, Sly pretty much built the blueprint.</p><p>At the height of the band's fame, the members took the stage at the original Woodstock in August 1969. The band went on stage at 3:30 a.m. on Sunday morning, just after Janis Joplin and just before The Who. The group ripped through an electric medley of hits including "Everyday People," "Dance To The Music," "Music Lover" and "I Want To Take You Higher."</p><p>However, it was not long after that the band devolved into drugs, finger-pointing and missed shows. Sly himself admitted in his memoir that he became dependent on cocaine and PCP. The band released several unheralded albums in the '70s but never reached the height of 1969 again. It was the same for Sly's solo career, which included several albums in the late '70s and early '80s, usually still under the Family Stone name.</p><p>"When you get success, why do you feel guilty about it? And why do we sabotage it?" Questlove told "GMA." "Even though he invented the alphabet for which we write many of the books, the culture doesn't know. They know him for not showing up for shows, being late, being an addict."</p><p>"Instead of saying, 'He became an addict,' we wanted to focus more on what events in life make you go there," Questlove added, about the documentary.</p><div data-testid="prism-inline-image"><figure data-testid="prism-figure"><div data-testid="prism-ratio-frame"><picture data-testid="prism-picture"><source media="(max-width: 414px)" srcset="https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f5e9f4ed-7359-437a-833c-71bd2f6ff00a/sly-stone-mo_1749501360940_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg?w=375, https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f5e9f4ed-7359-437a-833c-71bd2f6ff00a/sly-stone-mo_1749501360940_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg?w=750 2x"><source media="(min-width: 415px)" srcset="https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f5e9f4ed-7359-437a-833c-71bd2f6ff00a/sly-stone-mo_1749501360940_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg?w=750, https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f5e9f4ed-7359-437a-833c-71bd2f6ff00a/sly-stone-mo_1749501360940_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg?w=1500 2x"><img alt="" data-testid="prism-image" draggable="false" loading="lazy" src="https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f5e9f4ed-7359-437a-833c-71bd2f6ff00a/sly-stone-mo_1749501360940_hpEmbed_3x2.jpg"></picture></div><figcaption><div data-testid="prism-caption"><p><span data-testid="prism-truncate"><span><span>Sylvester "Sly" Stewart and his bride Kathy Silva, right, are congratulated during their wedding ceremony at a rock concert by Sly and the Family Stone at New York's Madison Square Garden on June 6, 1974.</span></span></span></p><p><span>Richard Drew/AP, FILE</span></p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p>Sly took the stage for a live performance at the 2006 Grammys, his first in decades, and made occasional appearances in the ensuing years.

Kennedy Jr. on Monday removed every member of a scientific committee that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to use vaccines and pledged to replace them with his own picks.</p><p>Major physicians and public health groups criticized the move to oust all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.</p><p>Kennedy, who was one of the nation’s leading anti-vaccine activists before becoming the nation’s top health official, has not said who he would appoint to the panel, but said it would convene in just two weeks in Atlanta.</p><p>Although it’s typically not viewed as a partisan board, the Biden administration had installed the entire committee.</p><p>“Without removing the current members, the current Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028,” Kennedy wrote in <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Wall Street Journal opinion piece</a></span>. “A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science. ”</p>
    
<p>Kennedy said the committee members had too many conflicts of interest. Currently, committee members are required to declare any potential such conflicts, as well as business interests, that arise during their tenure. They also must disclose any possible conflicts at the start of each public meeting.</p>



<p>Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives and former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Kennedy’s actions were based on false conflict-of-interest claims and set “a dangerous and unprecedented action that makes our families less safe” by potentially reducing vaccine access for millions of people.</p>
    
    
    
<p>“Make no mistake: Politicizing the ACIP as Secretary Kennedy is doing will undermine public trust under the guise of improving it,” he said in a statement. “We’ll look back at this as a grave mistake that sacrificed decades of scientific rigor, undermined public trust, and opened the door for fringe theories rather than facts.”</p>
    
<p>Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, called Kennedy’s mass ouster “a coup.” </p><p>“It’s not how democracies work. It’s not good for the health of the nation,” Benjamin told The Associated Press. </p><p>Benjamin said the move raises real concerns about whether future committee members will be viewed as impartial. He added that Kennedy is going against what he told lawmakers and the public, and the public health association plans to watch Kennedy “like a hawk.”</p><p>“He is breaking a promise,” Benjamin said. “He said he wasn’t going to do this.”</p><p>Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, called the committee a trusted source of science- and data-driven advice and said Kennedy’s move, coupled with declining vaccination rates across the country, will help drive an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases.</p><p>“Today’s action to remove the 17 sitting members of ACIP undermines that trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives,” Scott said in a statement.</p><p>Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a doctor who had expressed reservations about Kennedy’s nomination but voted to install him as the nation’s health secretary nonetheless, said he had spoken with Kennedy moments after the announcement.</p>
    
<p>“Of course, now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion,” Cassidy said in a social media post. “I’ve just spoken with Secretary Kennedy, and I’ll continue to talk with him to ensure this is not the case.”</p><p>The committee had been in a state of flux since Kennedy took over. Its first meeting this year had been delayed when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-cdc-rfk-trump-acip-74ad20e0a5430bfd6b48d35900c34d13">abruptly postponed</a></span> its February meeting. </p><p>During Kennedy’s confirmation, Cassidy <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cassidy-kennedy-trump-health-secretary-e826bc40fddf90829f6438681c5d9275">had expressed concerns</a></span> about preserving the committee, saying he had sought assurances that Kennedy would keep the panel’s current vaccine recommendations. </p><p>Kennedy did not stick to that.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="anchor-94dad4">The 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent vaccine advisory committee are being removed from their posts, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Monday afternoon.</p><p id="anchor-0b6167">Kennedy <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112?mod=opinion_lead_pos5" target="_blank">announced the change</a> in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, claiming that the “committee has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.”</p><p id="anchor-52d895">Such a claim is "deeply insulting to the many scientists who contribute countless hours to the process," said Dr. Sean O’Leary, an infectious disease expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics. "We are, in fact, a model for the rest of the world." </p><p id="anchor-45e6b9">"This is manufactured chaos," O'Leary said. </p><p id="anchor-c9666c">The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known more commonly as ACIP, consists of medical and public health experts — including pediatricians, epidemiologists and geriatricians — who make recommendations to the CDC about who should get certain vaccines, including the schedule for childhood vaccinations. Several times a year the committee holds public meetings where data is presented and reviewed. </p><p id="anchor-81ca1b">The committee reports the data to the CDC director, who then reviews the recommendations and can choose whether to adopt them. The CDC director isn't required to do so, but usually goes along with the ACIP recommendations.  </p><p id="anchor-6dff9b">Members of ACIP, who undergo an extensive vetting process before being appointed, are required to disclose conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from voting on vaccines for which a conflict exists. The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/disclosures/by-member.html" target="_blank">released a database</a> in March of some members’ previous work on clinical trials or vaccine research funded by drug companies, but much of the information was already public. Many public health experts argue that past associations with the pharmaceutical industry is relevant and valuable expertise for ACIP members, as long as conflicts are disclosed.</p><p id="anchor-fe8663">“To claim that you are doing this to restore faith in CDC is a special form of gaslighting,” said a CDC employee, referring to Kennedy's comments. The employee did not want to speak on the record for fear of retribution.</p><p id="anchor-0f0ca7">Dismantling the committee is among Kennedy’s most aggressive actions so far to reshape U.S. vaccine policy.<strong> </strong>Kennedy rose to prominence as a high-profile figure in the anti-vaccine movement, and has made a variety of specious and debunked claims about vaccine harms. Since aligning himself with President Donald Trump and becoming head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has overseen a series of steps that have undercut vaccine access, including the pullback of funds for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-children-weakening-system-hhs-budget-cuts-rcna199188" target="_blank">vaccine distribution to children of lower income families</a>.</p><p id="anchor-414673">Kennedy’s decision to fire ACIP members “should erase any remaining doubt that he intends to impose his personal anti-vaccine agenda on the American people,” Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting director of the CDC and current president of the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said in a statement. He added that Monday’s action will “make it far more difficult for pediatricians and other providers to care for their patients,” since they rely on ACIP’s guidance to make their own vaccine recommendations.</p><p id="anchor-6e1216">In his editorial, Kennedy called for a “clean sweep” of the ACIP, but did not say who he planned to appoint to the now-vacant positions or provide a timeline for filling the roles. HHS said <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html" target="_blank">in a press release</a> that ACIP will convene its next meeting from June 25 to June 27.</p><p id="anchor-af5b9b">“What I think Kennedy is doing here is attempting to replace career civil servants with scientific expertise with those who may be more amenable to his and the Trump administration’s agenda,” said Matt Motta, an assistant professor of health law and policy at Boston University’s School of Public Health.</p><p id="anchor-d84794">Motta said firing ACIP members is “an unequivocally clear attempt to break the promise” that Kennedy made during his confirmation hearings to not limit vaccine access. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., <a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/" target="_blank">said in February</a> that Kennedy had promised to maintain the ACIP “without changes.”</p><p id="anchor-092c25">Kennedy's shake up of the vaccine committee comes as the U.S. is experiencing a rise in vaccine-preventable outbreaks, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/track-measles-outbreak-cases-us-map-rcna198932" target="_blank">including measles</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/whooping-cough-pertussis-tdap-vaccination-outbreak-eb8f4776fdd0796ad789aac1ccdc9b67" target="_blank">whooping cough</a>. Since last fall, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-22.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_6-mortality-surveillance" target="_blank">241 mostly unvaccinated children have died of flu-related illnesses</a>, the highest number for a non-pandemic season since 2004.</p><p id="anchor-10c7a5">Members of the ACIP are appointed to four-year terms, and many were slated to serve on the committee for another three years. Kennedy wrote Monday that “without removing the current members, the current Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028.”</p><p id="anchor-68b2e5">The move further degrades the federal government as a trusted source on vaccines and could force consumers, doctors and insurers to look elsewhere for expert guidance on vaccines, according to one ACIP member.</p><p id="anchor-898c4d">“The clear implication is that CDC will no longer be credible in the space of vaccination,” said the ACIP member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because their employer does not allow them to speak to the media. “Insurers and other funding agencies will have to turn to the professional associations for recommendations about vaccines.” </p></div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/aria-bendix-ncpn1294089" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2024_38/3662657/240917-aria-bendix.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_38/3662657/240917-aria-bendix.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_38/3662657/240917-aria-bendix.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/aria-bendix-ncpn1294089">Aria Bendix</a></span><span><a href="https://x.com/ariabendix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:aria.bendix@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/brandy-zadrozny-ncpn858391" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2020_09/3242336/brandy-zadrozny-circle-byline-template.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_09/3242336/brandy-zadrozny-circle-byline-template.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_09/3242336/brandy-zadrozny-circle-byline-template.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/brandy-zadrozny-ncpn858391">Brandy Zadrozny</a></span><span><a href="https://x.com/brandyzadrozny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:brandy.zadrozny@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Brandy Zadrozny is a senior reporter for NBC News.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Containerization</h2><a id="user-content-containerization" aria-label="Permalink: Containerization" href="#containerization"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Containerization package allows applications to use Linux containers.
Containerization is written in <a href="https://www.swift.org/" rel="nofollow">Swift</a> and uses <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization" rel="nofollow">Virtualization.framework</a> on Apple silicon.</p>
<p dir="auto">Containerization provides APIs to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Manage OCI images.</li>
<li>Interact with remote registries.</li>
<li>Create and populate ext4 file systems.</li>
<li>Interact with the Netlink socket family.</li>
<li>Create an optimized Linux kernel for fast boot times.</li>
<li>Spawn lightweight virtual machines.</li>
<li>Manage the runtime environment of virtual machines.</li>
<li>Spawn and interact with containerized processes.</li>
<li>Use Rosetta 2 for executing x86_64 processes on Apple silicon.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Please view the <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main">API documentation</a> for information on the Swift packages that Containerization provides.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design</h2><a id="user-content-design" aria-label="Permalink: Design" href="#design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Containerization executes each Linux container inside of its own lightweight virtual machine. Clients can create dedicated IP addresses for every container to remove the need for individual port forwarding. Containers achieve sub-second start times using an optimized <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/kernel">Linux kernel configuration</a> and a minimal root filesystem with a lightweight init system.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/vminitd">vminitd</a> is a small init system, which is a subproject within Containerization.
<code>vminitd</code> is spawned as the initial process inside of the virtual machine and provides a GRPC API over vsock.
The API allows the runtime environment to be configured and containerized processes to be launched.
<code>vminitd</code> provides I/O, signals, and events to the calling process when a process is ran.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Requirements</h2><a id="user-content-requirements" aria-label="Permalink: Requirements" href="#requirements"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You need an Apple silicon Mac to build and run Containerization.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build the Containerization package, your system needs either:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>macOS 15 or newer and Xcode 26 Beta</li>
<li>macOS 26 Beta 1 or newer</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Applications built using the package will run on macOS 15 or later, but the following features are not available on macOS 15:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Non-isolated container networking - with macOS 15, containers on the same vmnet network cannot communicate with each other</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example Usage</h2><a id="user-content-example-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Example Usage" href="#example-usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For examples of how to use some of the libraries surface, the cctl executable is a good start. This tools primary job is as a playground to trial out the API. It contains commands that exercise some of the core functionality of the various products, such as:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/Sources/cctl/ImageCommand.swift">Manipulating OCI images</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/Sources/cctl/LoginCommand.swift">Logging in to container registries</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/Sources/cctl/RootfsCommand.swift">Creating root filesystem blocks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/Sources/cctl/RunCommand.swift">Running simple Linux containers</a></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Linux kernel</h2><a id="user-content-linux-kernel" aria-label="Permalink: Linux kernel" href="#linux-kernel"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A Linux kernel is required for spawning lightweight virtual machines on macOS.
Containerization provides an optimized kernel configuration located in the <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/kernel">kernel</a> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">This directory includes a containerized build environment to easily compile a kernel for use with Containerization.</p>
<p dir="auto">The kernel configuration is a minimal set of features to support fast start times and a light weight environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">While this configuration will work for the majority of workloads we understand that some will need extra features.
To solve this Containerization provides first class APIs to use different kernel configurations and versions on a per container basis.
This enables containers to be developed and validated across different kernel versions.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/kernel/README.md">README</a> in the kernel directory for instruction on how to compile the optimized kernel.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pre-build Kernel</h3><a id="user-content-pre-build-kernel" aria-label="Permalink: Pre-build Kernel" href="#pre-build-kernel"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to consume a pre-built kernel it must have <code>VIRTIO</code> drivers compiled into the kernel, not as modules.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers">Kata Containers</a> project provides an optimized kernel for containers with all the required configuration options enabled provided on the <a href="https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/releases/">releases</a> page.</p>
<p dir="auto">A kernel image named <code>vmlinux.container</code> can be found in the <code>/opt/kata/share/kata-containers/</code> directory of the release artifacts.</p>

<p dir="auto">Because the Containerization library is under active development, source stability is only guaranteed within minor versions (e.g. between 0.1.1 and 0.1.2). If you don't want potentially source-breaking package updates, you can specify your package dependency using .upToNextMinorVersion(from: "0.1.0") instead.</p>

<p>Matthew Garrett has a <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71646.html">nice post</a> about Twitter (uh, X)’s new end-to-end encryption messaging protocol, which is now called XChat. The TL;DR of Matthew’s post is that from a cryptographic perspective, XChat isn’t great. The details are all contained within Matthew’s post, but here’s a quick TL;DR:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>There’s no forward secrecy.</strong> Unlike Signal protocol, which uses a <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">double-ratchet</a> to continuously update the user’s secret keys, the XChat cryptography just encrypts each message under a recipient’s long-term public key. The actual encryption mechanism is based on an encryption scheme from <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/">libsodium</a>.</li>



<li><strong>User private keys are stored at X. </strong>XChat stores user <em>private key</em>s at its own servers. To obtain your private keys, you first log into X’s key-storage system using a password such as PIN. This is needed to support stateless clients like web browsers, and in fairness it’s not dissimilar to what Meta has done with its encryption for <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/">Facebook Messenger and Instagram</a>. Of course, those services use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), and critically, <span>X does not appear to.</span></li>



<li><strong>X’s key storage is based on “Juicebox.” </strong>To implement their secret-storage system, XChat uses a protocol called <a href="https://juicebox.xyz/">Juicebox</a>. Juicebox “shards” your key material across three servers, so that in principle the loss or compromise of one server won’t hurt you. </li>
</ul>



<p>Matthew’s post correctly identifies that the major vulnerability in X’s system is this key storage approach. If decryption keys live in three servers that are all under X’s control, then <span>X can probably obtain anyone’s key and decrypt their messages.</span><em> </em>X could do this for their own internal purposes: for example because their famously chill owner got angry at some user. Or they could do it because a warrant or subpoena compels them to. If we judge XChat as an end-to-end encryption scheme, this seems like a pretty game-over type of vulnerability.</p>



<p>So in a sense, everything comes down to the security of Juicebox <span>and the specific deployment choices that X made.</span> Since Matthew wrote his post, I’ve learned a bit more about both of these things. In this post I’d like to go on a slightly deeper dive into the Juicebox portion of X’s system. This will hopefully shed some light on what X is up to, and why you shouldn’t use XChat.</p>



<h3>What’s Juicebox even for?</h3>



<p>Many end-to-end encryption (E2E) apps have run into a specific problem: these systems require users to store their own secret keys. Unfortunately, users are just plain bad at this. </p>



<p>Sometimes we forget keys because we lose our devices. Often we have more than one device, which means our keys end up in the wrong place. A much worse situation occurs when apps want to work in ordinary web browsers: this means that secret keys have to be airlifted into that context as well. </p>



<p>The obvious remedy for this problem is just to store secret keys with the service provider itself. This is convenient, but completely misses the <em>whole point of end-to-end encryption</em>, which is that service providers should not have access to your secrets! Storing decryption keys — in an accessible form — on the provider’s servers is absolutely a no-go.</p>



<p>One way out of this conundrum is for the user to <span>encrypt</span> their secret key, then upload the encrypted value to the service provider. In theory, they can download their secret keys anytime they want and they should know that their secrets are safe. But of course there’s a problem: <em>what secret key are you going to use to encrypt your secret key!?</em> Answering this question quickly leads you into an infinite pile of turtles.</p>

<p>Rather than descend into paradox, systems like Juicebox, Signal SVR, and <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/08/13/is-apples-cloud-key-vault-crypto/">iCloud Key Vault</a> offer an alternative. Their observation is that while <em>cryptographic keys are hard to hang on to</em>, users generally <span>do</span> remember simple passwords like PINs, particularly if they’re asked to re-enter them periodically. <em>What if we use the user’s PIN/password to encrypt the stronger cryptographic key that we upload to the server?</em></p>



<p>While this is better than nothing, it isn’t good. Most human-selected passwords and PINs make for terrible cryptographic keys. In particular, short PINs (like the 6-digit decimal pins many people use for their phone passcode) are vulnerable to efficient brute-force guessing attacks. A six-digit PIN provides at most 2<sup>20</sup> security, which is what cryptographers call “a pretty small number.” Even if you use a “hard” key derivation function like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">Argon2</a> with insane difficulty settings, you’re still probably still going to lose your data.</p>



<p>Fortunately there is another way.</p>



<p>For many years, cryptographers have considered the problem of turning “weak secrets” into strong ones. The problem is sometimes known as <em><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-lai.pdf">password</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372297.3417266">hardening</a></em>, and doing it well usually requires additional components. First, you need to have some strong cryptographic secret that can be “mixed” into the user’s password to make a produce a truly strong encryption key. Second, you need some mechanism to <em>limit</em> the number of guessing attempts that the user makes, so an attacker can’t simply run an online attack to work through the PIN-space. <span>This cannot be enforced using cryptography alone</span>: you must add a server (or servers) to enforce these checks. Critically, the  server will place limits on how many <em>incorrect passwords</em> the user can enter: <em>e.g., </em>after ten incorrect attempts, the user’s account gets locked or erased.</p>



<p>In one sense, we’re right back where we started: someone needs to operate a a server. If that server is under the control of the service provider, then they can disable the guessing limits and/or extract the server’s secret key material, at which point you’re back to square one. </p>



<p>Many services have engineered some reasonable solutions to this problem, however. They boil down to the following alternatives, which can be implemented separately or together:</p>



<ol>
<li>The server can be implemented inside of a specialized Hardware Security Module, which is set up so that the provider cannot reprogram it or access its key material (at least, after it’s been configured.) This approach was pioneered by Apple, and is now in use by <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/08/13/is-apples-cloud-key-vault-crypto/">iCloud Key Vault</a>, <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/07/10/a-few-thoughts-about-signals-secure-value-recovery/">Signal SVR</a>, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/10/security/whatsapp-e2ee-backups/">WhatsApp</a> and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/">Facebook Messenger</a>.</li>



<li>Alternatively, the server can be “split up” into multiple pieces that are each run by different parties. The idea here is that the user must contact <em>T</em> out of <em>N</em> different servers in order to obtain the correct key (a common example is 2-of-3.) As long as an attacker cannot compromise <em>T</em> different servers, the combined system will still be able to enforce the guessing limits and prevent attackers from getting the key. Naturally this idea fundamentally depends on the assumption that the servers are not run by the same party!</li>
</ol>



<p>And at last, we come to Juicebox.</p>



<p>Juicebox is an software-based distributed key hardening service that can be implemented across multiple servers. Users can “enroll” their account into the system, at which point the Juicebox servers will convert their PIN/password into a strong cryptographic key (by mixing it with a secret stored on the Juicebox servers.) Later on, they can contact the Juicebox servers and — assuming they enter the right password, and don’t try too many incorrect guesses —&nbsp;they can obtain that same cryptographic key from the system. Users can specify the number of servers (<em>N</em>) and the threshold (<em>T</em>), and the goal is that the system can survive the loss (or unavailability) of N-T servers, and it should retain its security even if an attacker compromises <em>A&lt;T</em> of them. Most critically, Juicebox enforces limits: if too many incorrect passwords are entered, Juicebox will lock or destroy the user’s account.</p>



<p>In principle, Juicebox servers (called “<em>realms</em>” in the project’s lingo) can be either “software based” or they can be deployed inside of HSMs. <span>However, to the best of my knowledge the HSM capability is not fully supported outside of </span><u>Juicebox</u><span>’s one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superfell.bsky.social/post/3lr765dux5c2b">test deployment</a></span>, and has not been used in deployments (at X or anywhere else.) This means the security of XChat’s version of Juicebox probably comes down to a question of who runs the servers.</p>



<h3>So who runs X’s Juicebox servers, and do they use HSMs?</h3>



<p>To the best of my knowledge, all of the XChat servers are run in software by Twitter/X itself. If this turns out to be incorrect, I will be thrilled to update this post. But so far I’ve seen nothing to indicate that they’re run by different parties, or that this system is in any way hardened against legal requests.</p>



<p>To put this more explicitly, without any protections like the verifiable use of HSMs and/or distributing Juicebox servers across mutually-distrustful operators, having three servers does relatively little to protect users’ secrets against the service operator. And even if X is secretly implementing these protections, implementing them in secret is <span>stupid.</span> As a wise man once said:</p>

<p>Verifying that the XChat Juicebox servers are software-only is more complicated. Digging around in the Juicebox Github, you’ll find a software-only as well as an HSM-specific implementation of their “realms.” Specifically, there is an <a href="https://github.com/juicebox-systems/juicebox-hsm-realm">entire repository</a> dedicated to supporting Juicebox on <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/hsm/nshield-solo">Entrust nShield Solo XC HSMs</a> (see here for <a href="https://juicebox.xyz/blog/running-a-hsm-realm">instructions</a>) although this same code can also be deployed outside of HSMs. There is even a cool “<a href="https://github.com/juicebox-systems/ceremony">ceremony</a>” document that a group of administrators can perform to certify that they set the HSM up correctly, and that they destroyed all of the cards that could allow it to be re-programmed! </p>





<p>However, after speaking to Juicebox’s protocol designer <a href="https://github.com/imperiopolis">Nora Trapp</a>, I’m doubtful that any of this is in use at X. Nora told me that the Juicebox project shut down over a year ago and the engineers moved on, and what code there is now open source and not actively maintained (this matches with project commits I can see.) Nora also looked at XChat’s Juicebox deployment and sent me the following commentary:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From what I’ve seen, there are four realms currently in use by Twitter: <code><a href="http://realm-a.x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">realm-a.x.com</a></code>, <code><a href="http://realm-b.x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">realm-b.x.com</a></code>, <code><a href="http://realm-east1.x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">realm-east1.x.com</a></code>, and <code><a href="http://realm-west1.x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">realm-west1.x.com</a></code>.</p>



<ul>
<li><code>realm-a</code> and <code>realm-b</code> are definitely software realms. They don’t use Noise (only true of software realms) and rely solely on TLS. In contrast, HSM-backed realms use Noise within TLS, with TLS terminated at the LB and Noise inside the HSM.</li>



<li><code>realm-east1</code> and <code>realm-west1</code> appear to run code from <a href="https://github.com/juicebox-systems/juicebox-hsm-realm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">juicebox-hsm-realm</a>. For example, hitting <code><a href="https://realm-east1.x.com/livez" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://realm-east1.x.com/livez</a></code> shows they’re likely using the repo unmodified from <code>main</code>. However, this doesn’t mean they’re HSM-backed. The repo includes a “software HSM” for testing, which is insecure and doesn’t provide actual HSM properties.</li>
</ul>



<p>Timing analysis (e.g. via the convenient&nbsp;<code>x-exec-time</code>&nbsp;response header X left in place) suggests these are indeed using the software HSM. Real HSMs are typically significantly slower. And even if by some chance they’re running real HSMs, no ceremony has been published, so there’s no reason to trust they’re secure or that the key material isn’t exfiltrated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nora also <a href="https://juicebox.xyz/blog/dont-put-all-your-juice-in-one-box">wrote a post very recently warning deployers to stop placing all servers under the control of a single service provider</a>, which seems very applicable to what Twitter/X is doing.</p>



<p>Obviously this doesn’t prove that X isn’t using HSMs. Though, obviously, there’s no reason that you should hope something is secure when the deployer is going out of their way not to tell you it is. When it comes to XChat, my advice is that you should assume this deployment is (1) entirely in software, and (2) all Juicebox “realms” are run by the same organization. This means you should assume that <em>your decryption keys could be recovered by X’s server administrators</em> with at most a little fuss, unless you use a very strong password.</p>



<h3>That’s bad, but let’s talk more about the Juicebox protocol anyway!</h3>



<p>If all you came for was a bit of discussion about the security posture of XChat, then <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71646.html">Matthew’s post</a> and the additional notes above are all you need. Unless and until X proves that they’re using HSMs (and have destroyed all programming cards) you should just assume that their Juicebox instantiation is based on software realms under X’s control, and that means it is likely vulnerable to brute-force password-guessing attacks.</p>



<p>The rest of this post is going to look past X. </p>



<p>Let’s assume that a deployer has configured Juicebox intelligently: meaning that some/all realms will be deployed inside of HSMs, and/or realms are spread across multiple organizational trust boundaries — such that no single organization can easily demand recovery of anyone’s password. The question we want to ask now is: what guarantees does Juicebox provide in this setting, and how does the protocol work?</p>



<p><strong>Threshold OPRFs. </strong>The core cryptographic primitive <a href="https://juicebox.xyz/assets/whitepapers/juiceboxprotocol_revision7_20230807.pdf">inside of Juicebox</a> is called a <em>threshold oblivious pseudorandom function</em>, or t-OPRF. I’ve written about OPRFs before, specifically <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/10/19/lets-talk-about-pake/">in the context of Password-Authenticated Key Agreement</a> (PAKE schemes.) Nonetheless, I think it’s helpful to start from the top.</p>



<p>Let’s leave aside the “oblivious” part for a minute. <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2023/05/08/prfs-prps-and-other-fantastic-things/">PRFs are functions</a> that take in a key <em>K</em> and a string <em>P</em> (for example, a password), and output a string of bits. We might write as: </p>



<p><em>O</em> = PRF(<em>K, P</em>)</p>



<p>Provided that an attacker does not know the key, the resulting string <em>O</em> should <span>look</span> random, meaning that the output of a PRF makes for excellent cryptographic keys. In many practical implementations, PRFs are realized using functions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC-MAC">CBC-MAC</a>; however, there are many different ways to build them.</p>



<p>An <span>oblivious</span> PRF (OPRF) is a two-party cryptographic protocol that helps a client and server jointly compute the output of a PRF. It works like this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Imagine a server has the cryptographic key <em>K.</em></li>



<li>The client has their string <em>P</em> (such as a password.)</li>



<li>At the end of a successful protocol run, the <span>client</span> should obtain <em>O</em> = PRF(<em>K, P</em>). The server gets no output at all.</li>



<li>Critically: <span>neither party should learn the other party’s input</span>, and the server <span>should not learn the client’s result</span>, either.</li>
</ol>



<p>With this tool in hand, it’s easy to build a very simple password-hardening protocol. Simply configure the server with a key <em>K </em>(preferably a different key for every user account), and then have the client run the OPRF protocol with the server to obtain <em>O</em> = PRF(<em>K, P</em>). The resulting value <em>O</em> will make for an excellent encryption key, which the client can use to encrypt any secret values it wants. The best part of this arrangement is that the OPRF protocol ensures that the server never learns the user’s password <em>P</em>, so no information leaks even if the server is fully malicious!</p>



<p>This basic design has some limitations, of course. It does not allow the server to <span>limit</span> the number password guesses, nor does it allow us to spread the process over many different servers.</p>



<p>Addressing the first problem is easy. When the client first registers their account with the server, they can run the OPRF protocol to obtain <em>O</em> = PRF(<em>K, P</em>). Next, they compute some “authenticator tag” <em>T </em>that’s derived in some way from the secret <em>O</em>. They can then store that tag <em>T</em> on the server. When a user returns to log back into the system, the client and server can run the OPRF protocol, and then conduct some process to verify that the <em>O</em> received by the client is consistent with the tag <em>T</em> stored at the server. (<span>The exact process for doing this is important, and I’ll discuss it further below.)</span> If this is <em>unsuccessful</em>, then the server can increment a counter to indicate an incorrect password guess on that user’s account. If the protocol completes successfully, then the server should reset that counter back to zero.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>Critically, when the counter reaches some maximum (usually ten incorrect attempts), the server must lock the user’s account — or much better, delete the account-specific key <em>K</em>. This is what prevents attackers from systematically guessing their way through every possible PIN.</p>



<p>Splitting up the PRF into multiple servers is only slightly more complicated. The basic idea relies on the fact that the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9497/">specific OPRF used by Juicebox</a> is based on elliptic curves, and this makes it very amenable to threshold implementations. I’m going to put the details into a <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/some-quick-notes-on-t-oprfs/">separate page right here </a>since it’s a little boring. But you should just take away that (1) the service operator can split up the key <em>K</em> across multiple servers, and (2) a client can talk to any <em>T</em> of them and eventually obtain PRF(K, P). </p>



<h3><strong>How does the client prove it got the right key</strong>, and what attacks are there?</h3>



<p>You’ll notice that these “incorrect attempt” counters are a big part of the protection inside of a system like Juicebox. As long as an attacker can only make, say, a maximum of ten incorrect guessing attempts, then even a relatively weak password like 234984 is probably not too bad. If an attacker can make <em>many possible</em> guesses, then the whole system is fairly weak.</p>



<p>Note that in most of these attacks we are going to make the very strong assumption that <span>the server operator is the attacker</span><em> </em>and that they’ve deployed Juicebox in such a way that they can’t just read the secrets out of their own instance (e.g., in this hypothetical scenario, they have deployed Juicebox using HSMs or distributed trust.) Since the whole point of end-to-end encryption is that users’ secret keys should not be known to a server operator, this isn’t too strong of an assumption. Moreover, we’ve recently <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/12/u-k-asks-to-backdoor-icloud-backup-encryption/">seen governments make secret requests to companies like Apple</a> to force them to bypass their end-to-end encrypted services. This means that both hacking and legal compulsion are real concerns. </p>



<p>Within this setting there exist a handful of attacks that could come up in a system like Juicebox. Some are easier than others to prevent:</p>



<ol>
<li>An attacker could try to enter a few password guesses, then wait for the real user to log in. As long as the real user enters the correct password, the attempt counter on the server(s) will drop back to zero. This attack could allow you to make up to, say, nine invalid guesses for each genuine user login.<sup>2</sup> <p>The existence of this attack is kind of unavoidable in systems like Juicebox. Fortunately it’s probably not a very <em>efficient</em> attack. Unless the user is logging on constantly (say, because a web browser caches the user’s password and runs the protocol automatically), the rate of attacker guesses is going to be very low. Moreover: this attack can be mitigated by having the server inform the client of the number of incorrect guesses it’s seen since the last time the user logged in, which should help the user to detect the fact that they’re under attack.</p></li>



<li>If the servers don’t coordinate with each other, a smart attacker could try to guess passwords against different subsets of the Juicebox servers: for example if 2-of-10 servers are needed to recover the key, then an attacker actually could actually obtain many more than ten guesses. This is because the attacker could make at least ten attempts with each <em>subset</em> comprising two servers, before all the necessary servers locked them out. Juicebox’s <a href="https://github.com/juicebox-systems/juicebox-hsm-realm?tab=readme-ov-file">HSM implementation</a> actually goes to some lengths to prevent this (as <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/SecureValueRecovery2">SVR</a> did before them) by having servers share the current password counter values with each other using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">consensus protocol</a>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Another possibility is that a malicious (software) server operator could try to attack the protocol directly. Just for fun, I thought it might be interesting to conclude with one <em>possible</em> attack I noticed while perusing the protocol description. I’m almost certain this won’t work in practice — and the Juicebox developers agree, but I thought it was a fun illustration of the <em>types</em> of vulnerabilities that show up in these systems.</p>



<p>Recall that whenever a Juicebox client successfully completes the protocol with a set of <em>T</em> servers, it must somehow convince those servers that it obtained the right key. This is necessary because a correct password entry should <span>reset</span> those servers’ attempt counters back to zero, whereas an <em>incorrect</em> guess will increase the attempt counter. (Without a mechanism to reset the counter, the counter will keep rising until the user’s account gets permanently locked.)</p>



<p><a href="https://juicebox.xyz/assets/whitepapers/juiceboxprotocol_revision7_20230807.pdf">The client deals with this</a> by first computing a value called the unlockKey from the t-OPRF output, and then calculating a set of “tags” called the unlockKeyTags, one for each server (realm) in the system:</p>

<p>The calculation of each unlockKeyTags[i] value is customized to include the “realm ID” of the server, which means that the tag for server <em>i</em> is specific only to that server. It cannot be extracted from a malicious server <em>i </em>and replayed against server <em>j</em>, which would be very bad. The client then sends each value unlockKeyTags[i] to the appropriate server. The servers can verify the received tag against a copy they stored during the account registration process. If it matches, they reset their counter back to zero as follows:</p>

<p>However, the only thing that differentiates these tags from one another is the notion that realm IDs for different servers will always be different. What if this assumption isn’t correct?</p>



<p>The attack I’m concerned about is pretty bizarre, but it looks like this. Imagine a user has previously registered its key into several real HSM-based servers. Now someone hacks into the service provider. This hacker “tricks” clients into sending subsequent login requests to a <span>new set of malicious servers</span> that the attacker spins up using software (i.e., no HSM protections.)</p>



<p>Ordinarily this attack wouldn’t be a disaster, since the OPRF should prevent those new servers from learning the user’s password inputs. But let’s imagine that the hacker sets the “realm ID” of these new servers to be identical to the realm ID of the real (HSM) servers. In this case, the value of unlockKeyTag[i] sent to the malicious servers will be <em>identical</em> to the value that would have been stored within the HSM-based servers. Once the attacker learns this value, they can make an unlimited number of guesses against the HSM server with the same realm ID: this is because the stolen unlockKeyTags[i] value will reset the HSM server’s counter. </p>



<p>I ran this past Nora and she pointed out a number of practical issues that will probably make this sort of attack much less likely to work, but it’s still fun to find this sort of thing. More importantly, I think it shows how delicate distributed protocols like this can be, and how sometimes one’s assumptions may not always be valid. </p>

<p><em>Notes:</em></p>



<ol>
<li>Obviously this can be dangerous. An attacker who just wants to deny service to the user can enter deliberately-incorrect guesses until the user’s account becomes permanently locked. To prevent this, most services require that you log In using a traditional password first, then you can access the password strengthening server second. Some systems also add time delays, to ensure that an attacker cannot quickly exhaust the counter.</li>



<li>The “try N attempts and then let the client log in normally” attack was outlined to me by Ian Miers.</li>

                 <div>This year, App Intents gains support for visual intelligence. This enables apps to provide visual search results within the visual intelligence experience, allowing users to go directly into the app from those results. For instance, Etsy is leveraging visual intelligence to enhance the user experience in its iOS app by facilitating faster and more intuitive discovery of goods and products.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“At Etsy, our job is to seamlessly connect shoppers with creative entrepreneurs around the world who offer extraordinary items — many of which are hard to describe. The ability to meet shoppers right on their iPhone with visual intelligence is a meaningful unlock, and makes it easier than ever for buyers to quickly discover exactly what they’re looking for while directly supporting small businesses,” said Etsy CTO Rafe Colburn.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>To ensure kids have enjoyable, enriching, and appropriate in-app experiences, developers can utilize a range of tools — including parental controls and the Sensitive Content Analysis framework — to enhance child safety and ensure privacy. Building on these existing tools, developers can use the new Declared Age Range API to deliver age-appropriate content based on a user’s age range. When developers implement this API, parents can allow their children to share their age range without disclosing a birthdate or other sensitive information, enabling developers to tailor experiences accordingly. The feature is built around privacy: Age range data is shared only if parents choose to allow it, and they can disable sharing at any time.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h2><a id="user-content-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Architecture" href="#architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS started as a toy project to practice systems programming, and over the years morphed into a full-blown OS and a playground to explore new ideas. It aims to re-examine principles of OS design, and see how much is really needed today to make a functional OS, and where shortcuts can be taken using modern tools. The design has no pretention to be superior to anything else, rather it is an experiment in striving for simplicity of the codebase (but not necessarily a lightweight binary or minimal dependencies).</p>
<p dir="auto">In particular, here are usual cornerstones of OS design that Munal OS does <strong>NOT</strong> implement:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Bootloader</li>
<li>Page mapping</li>
<li>Virtual address space</li>
<li>Interrupts</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EFI binary</h3><a id="user-content-efi-binary" aria-label="Permalink: EFI binary" href="#efi-binary"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS has no bootloader; instead, the entire OS is compiled into a single EFI binary that embeds the kernel, the WASM engine and all the applications. The UEFI boot services are exited almost immediately and no UEFI services are used except for the system clock.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Address space</h3><a id="user-content-address-space" aria-label="Permalink: Address space" href="#address-space"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">UEFI leaves the address space as identity-mapped and Munal OS does not remap it. In fact the page tables are not touched at all, because the OS does not make use of virtual address mechanisms. The entire OS technically runs within a single memory space, but something akin to the userspace/kernelspace distinction is provided by WASM sandboxing (see below), preventing arbitrary access to kernel memory by user applications.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Drivers</h3><a id="user-content-drivers" aria-label="Permalink: Drivers" href="#drivers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS does not rely on PS/2 inputs or VGA/UEFI GOP framebuffers for display. Instead, it implements a PCI driver which is used to communicate with QEMU via the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/csprd01/virtio-v1.1-csprd01.html" rel="nofollow">VirtIO 1.1 specification</a>. A generic virtqueue system serves as the basis for 4 different VirtIO drivers: keyboard, mouse, network and GPU. Notably, the drivers are entirely polling-based and do not rely on CPU interrupts at all (in fact Munal OS does not implement any).</p>
<p dir="auto">The reliance on VirtIO means Munal OS does not support running on real hardware yet; more work would be needed, either to use BIOS/UEFI-provided methods (such as PS/2, VGA, GOP) or to implement full-blown GPU and USB drivers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Event loop</h3><a id="user-content-event-loop" aria-label="Permalink: Event loop" href="#event-loop"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For simplicity, Munal OS does not implement multi-core support or even interrupts, and everything happens linearly within one single, global event loop. Every iteration of the loop polls the network and input drivers, draws the desktop interface, runs one step of each active WASM application, and flushes the GPU framebuffer.</p>
<p dir="auto">One advantage of this approach is that it is trivial to inspect the performance of each OS component and user application, simply by measuring how much of the total frametime they eat. For now, the loop should run at well over 60 FPS on a modern CPU with all applications open.</p>
<p dir="auto">The downside of course is that each step of the loop is not allowed to hold the CPU for arbitrary amounts of time, and must explicitly yield for long-running tasks.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Applications</h3><a id="user-content-applications" aria-label="Permalink: Applications" href="#applications"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS embeds the <a href="https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi">wasmi</a> WASM engine for running WASM applications. This achieves full sandboxing of user applications and memory separation from the kernel without the use of a virtual address space (or, moving the virtual address space to a VM, rather). A "system call" API is provided by the kernel so that apps can interact with the system. In particular, apps can query mouse/keyboard events, open/use TCP sockets, and send output framebuffers which are then read by the OS and composited onto the desktop. This lets apps use any drawing library they want (at the cost of a framebuffer copy).</p>
<p dir="auto">All showcased applications are written in Rust, but there would be nothing preventing apps to be made in other languages, as long as it can compile to WASM.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because of its custom "system call" API, Munal OS does not aim for compatibility with the WASI standards. However, the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/README.md">WASI Preview1</a> standard is partially supported, mostly so that applications can be compiled without using <code>#![no_std]</code> (which is often a blocker for pulling in external dependencies). Only the bare minimum is implemented, and WASI functions that have no analog in Munal OS (e.g <code>path_rename()</code>) are simply stubbed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS relies on cooperative scheduling, meaning that applications are given control of the CPU every iteration of the global event loop, and must explicitly relinquish it. This is less an intentional design decision and more a consequence of using Wasmi as the WASM engine, which does not support interrupting and resuming functions mid-excution. However Wasmi does support fuel limiting, and so in theory it would be possible to terminate misbehaving apps that hold the CPU for too long (though that's not implemented yet).</p>
<p dir="auto">Each app has a dedicated log stream (akin to stdout in the UNIX world) which can be inspected from the desktop in a dedicated "audit" view. This view also shows how much of the system resources (frametime, memory, resources) are consumed by this app.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">UI Library</h3><a id="user-content-ui-library" aria-label="Permalink: UI Library" href="#ui-library"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Munal OS has its own UI toolkit (plainly named Uitk) which is used throughout the desktop UI. It is also used by WASM applications, though that's just for convenience and consistency with the desktop styling; it is just a shared library and applications could in theory swap for any other library they wish, as long as it can render to a generic framebuffer.</p>
<p dir="auto">Uitk is an immediate mode toolkit which supports some basic widgets: buttons, progress bars, text editing, scrollable canvas...a generic triangle rasterizer is also provided (which is used to draw the radial pie menu and the 3D cube demo),</p>
<p dir="auto">Styling is supported via a global stylesheet which can be shared between OS and apps, and can be overriden for individual UI elements.</p>
<p dir="auto">A basic caching system is implemented to avoid unnecessary redraws: for example, generic scrollable canvases (like the web browser) are split into "tiles" tracked with a unique content ID. A system based on Rust's mutability rules automatically keeps track of changes to the content, and so tiles are only redrawn if the content ID changes, and pulled from a cache otherwise.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building and running</h2><a id="user-content-building-and-running" aria-label="Permalink: Building and running" href="#building-and-running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This project compiles as of Rust Nightly 2025-06-01 and runs as of QEMU 10.0.0.</p>
<p dir="auto">First add the required rustup components:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rustup target add --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu wasm32-wasip1
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"><pre><code>rustup target add --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu wasm32-wasip1
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-2025-06-01-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then execute this script to build and run:</p>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/munal-os/blob/master/run.sh">run.sh</a> script is very straightforward, it simply builds the WASM apps one by one, then builds the kernel, then runs QEMU.</p>
<p dir="auto">The script assumes that the QEMU command is named <code>qemu-system-x86_64</code>, so if that's not the case on your system just replace it with the proper name.</p>

It’s crafted with a new material called Liquid Glass. This translucent material reflects and refracts its surroundings, while dynamically transforming to help bring greater focus to content, delivering a new level of vitality across controls, navigation, app icons, widgets, and more. For the very first time, the new design extends across platforms — iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26<sup>1</sup> — to establish even more harmony while maintaining the distinct qualities that make each unique.

Meticulously crafted by rethinking the fundamental elements that make up our software, the new design features an entirely new material called Liquid Glass. It combines the optical qualities of glass with a fluidity only Apple can achieve, as it transforms depending on your content or context. It lays the foundation for new experiences in the future and, ultimately, it makes even the simplest of interactions more fun and magical.”

                 <h2><strong>Introducing Liquid Glass: A New and Expressive Material</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Inspired by the depth and dimensionality of visionOS, the new design takes advantage of Apple’s powerful advances in hardware, silicon, and graphics technologies. The new material, Liquid Glass, is translucent and behaves like glass in the real world. Its color is informed by surrounding content and intelligently adapts between light and dark environments. Born out of a close collaboration between the design and engineering teams, Liquid Glass uses real-time rendering and dynamically reacts to movement with specular highlights. This creates a lively experience that makes using iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV even more delightful.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>This gorgeous new material extends from the smallest elements users interact with every day — like buttons, switches, sliders, text, and media controls — to larger elements, including tab bars and sidebars for navigating apps. It also shines in system experiences, such as the Lock Screen, Home Screen, notifications, Control Center, and more.

                 <h2><strong>Updated App Designs&nbsp;</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Driven by the goal of bringing greater focus to content that’s instantly familiar, Apple’s design team considered every aspect of Apple’s platforms to identify improvements that could be made across the board.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Controls, toolbars, and navigation within apps have been redesigned. Previously configured for rectangular displays, they now fit perfectly concentric with the rounded corners of modern hardware and app windows — establishing greater harmony between hardware, software, and content. Controls are crafted out of Liquid Glass and act as a distinct functional layer that sits above apps. They give way to content and dynamically morph as users need more options or move between different parts of an app. And with thoughtful groupings, it’s easier for users to find the controls they need.
</div>

        <div>
             
                 <div>Tab bars and sidebars have been redesigned with the same approach. In iOS 26, when users scroll, tab bars shrink to bring focus to the content while keeping navigation instantly accessible. The moment users scroll back up, tab bars fluidly expand. In iPadOS and macOS, updated sidebars make apps like Apple TV even more immersive. They refract the content behind them — while reflecting content and the user’s wallpaper from around them — which ensures users always have a sense of their context.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>These updated design elements apply across fresh new experiences in apps such as Camera, Photos, Safari, FaceTime, Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple Podcasts.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The new design extends across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, with updates to system experiences like the Lock Screen, Home Screen, desktop, and Dock. To maintain the focus on the subject of photo wallpapers on the Lock Screen, the time is now crafted out of Liquid Glass and fluidly adapts to fit elegantly behind the subject.

        <div>On the Home Screen and desktop, the Dock, app icons, and widgets have all been crafted from multiple layers of Liquid Glass. They look stunning, with specular highlights, and allow for greater personalization options while still maintaining the familiarity that users rely on. For example, in macOS Tahoe 26, users can customize the desktop and Dock with widgets and app icons that come to life in light or dark appearances, colorful new light and dark tints, as well as an elegant new clear look. And it’s made even better with a completely transparent menu bar that makes the Mac display feel even larger.

If you have $1 million in sales, and $900k in costs, you have $100k in profit, and the government taxes you on that profit.</p><p>Section 174 says you can't do this for software engineers. If you pay a software engineer, that's not "really" an "expense", regardless of the fact that you paid them.</p><p>What you've actually done, Congress said, is bought a capital good, like a machine. And for calculating tax owed, you have to depreciate that over several years (5 in this case).</p><p>Depreciating means that if you pay an engineer $200k in a year, in tax-world you only had $40k of real expense that year, even though you paid them $200k.</p><p>So the effect is that it makes engineers much more expensive, because normally when a company hires an engineer, like they spend on any other expense, they can at least think "well, they will reduce our profit, which reduces our tax obligation," but in this case software engineers are <i>special</i> and aren't deductible in the same way.</p><p>In the case of the $200k engineer, you deduct the first $40k in the first year, then you can expense another $40k from that first year in the second year, the third $40k in the third year, and so on through the fifth year. So eventually you get to expense the entire first year of the engineer's pay, but only after five years.</p><p>The effect is that companies wind up using their scarce capital to loan the federal government money for five years, and so engineers become a heavy financial burden. If a company hires too many engineers, they will owe the federal government income tax <i>even in years in which they were unprofitable.</i></p><p>These rules, by the way, don't apply to other personnel costs. If you hire an HR person or a corporate executive, you expense them in the year you paid them. It's a special rule for software engineers.</p><p>It was passed by Congress during the first Trump administration in order to offset the costs of other corporate tax rate cuts, due to budgeting rules.</p></div></td></tr>

Instead, the $1M was to be amortized over 5 years, so now the business can only count $200K as the deductible expense for that year. So now it's going to be taxed on "profits" of $900K. Assuming the tax rate is 50%, that means the business owes $450K in taxes, even though it has a total of $100K in the bank after the actual expenses were paid. So it would have to either borrow to pay taxes or raise venture capital, meaning that VC-funded companies would be advantaged over bootstrapped ones!</p><p>- The letter's goal is to bring things back to how they were (and how they are for all other businesses): let businesses deduct their actual expenses from their actual revenue, and tax that actual profit.</p><p>I am neither a lawyer nor an accountant, this is just my understanding of this issue.</p></div></td></tr>

Not even close.</p><p>Here's the key:</p><pre><code>  Development costs incurred to remove uncertainty are amortized.  
  All other costs are deductible during the tax year where they are incurred.
</code></pre><p>
How does this work?</p><p>You are going to design a new robot arm.</p><p>In January, you spend $100K to "remove uncertainty". In rough strokes, this means discovering all the things you don't know and need to know for this robot arm to become a product. This amount will be amortized over five years under 174.</p><p>Now, with uncertainty removed, you spend an additional $1.1MM from January until December for engineering implementation. No uncertainty being removed. Just building a product. This is 100% deductible that tax year.</p><p>Analogy: You want to build a new brick wall with specific properties. You spend $100K to develop a new type of brick and $1.1MM to build the wall using that brick. The $100K is amortized, the $1.1MM is deductible in one shot.</p><p>BTW, at year 6 the amortization schedule reaches steady-state and you are amortizing the full $100K every year. In other words, the impact of 174, if treated intelligently, is the time value of money until steady state is reached for the engineering costs incurred to remove uncertainty.</p><p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.174-2" rel="nofollow">https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.174-2</a></p></div></td></tr>

Usual suspects are BigTech and large consulting groups. The later act as intermediaries: they sell worker hours at a higher rate, skimming the difference between their prices and employee's salary. If they were somehow barred from H1B program the H1B visa holders would presumably find better paying jobs elsewhere.</p><p>H1B rules around changing jobs means that even if the employee joins at a market-level salary when they come to the US, they tent to stay at the same company much longer and can be exploited. The new company has to go through a lengthy paperwork process to allow the visa holder to switch jobs. Also, since the tech world tends to use things like stock options / RSUs / monetary bonuses for large parts of compensation package and those do not count towards "salary" you may have a situation where an h1b holder on paper seems to be paid fairly but in practice get only about 40-50% of what their peers get.</p><p>If they were allowed to change jobs freely they would be able to negotiate their compensation fairly. The companies would be less intensified to hire H1Bs to save money and would also consider local talent for same positions. Everybody would win: both H1B visa holders and their families <i>and</i> American workers, too. The only losers would be consulting firms (not a huge loss, to be honest, most of their employees are overseas anyway, so the can absorb the cost) and BigTech (they have enough money, anyway).</p><p>There are other problems for H1B holders, like getting a green card is something their employer, and not them, can do - another area for abuse. And then some nationalities have to wait much longer to go through this process then others (essentially, the US migration service says that the country has too many people from India and Pakistan already, thank you very much), and there are other issues I don't recall.</p></div></td></tr>

The concept of it seems sensible, in practice you end up justifying why something is R&amp;D to essentially non-technical people, probably at some consultancy who can then repeat a moderately garbled version of your description to HMRC who presumably just approve in most cases because they also don't have the expertise to truly assess the subject matter (and let's face it, we'd all struggle, even if we believe we're expert software engineers, how do you assess whether work on a mortgage issuing product for a bank is truly R&amp;D if you have no familiarity with the domain).</p>

The rule is not about taxation, but deductions/expenses. If your expenses cover most revenue, you owe little in taxes. With this rule, a particular type of expense (software engineering salaries) is no longer deductible from revenue to calculate taxable income over which taxes are owed. So you might previously owe no taxes, but now you do. The deduction might carry over to the next few years and eventually (after 6 years) you will reach the same point - assuming your salaries don't go up and your business doesn't grow. The remainder in deductions will be returned after the business stops employing software engineers. I'm not sure why anyone would want the tax code to incentivize a business outcome that all of us would consider failure.</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! We're Shreyash and Bhavnick. We're building Chonkie (<a href="https://chonkie.ai/">https://chonkie.ai</a>), an open-source library for chunking and embedding data.</p><p>Python: <a href="https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie">https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie</a></p><p>TypeScript: <a href="https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie-ts">https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie-ts</a></p><p>Here's a video showing our code chunker: <a href="https://youtu.be/Xclkh6bU1P0" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/Xclkh6bU1P0</a>.</p><p>Bhavnick and I have been building personal projects with LLMs for a few years. For much of this time, we found ourselves writing our own chunking logic to support RAG applications. We often hesitated to use existing libraries because they either had only basic features or felt too bloated (some are 80MB+).</p><p>We built Chonkie to be lightweight, fast, extensible, and easy. The space is evolving rapidly, and we wanted Chonkie to be able to quickly support the newest strategies. We currently support: Token Chunking, Sentence Chunking, Recursive Chunking, Semantic Chunking, plus:</p><p>-  Semantic Double Pass Chunking: Chunks text semantically first, then merges closely related chunks.</p><p>-  Code Chunking: Chunks code files by creating an AST and finding ideal split points.</p><p>-  Late Chunking: Based on the paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04701" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04701</a>), where chunk embeddings are derived from embedding a longer document.</p><p>-  Slumber Chunking: Based on the "Lumber Chunking" paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17526" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17526</a>). It uses recursive chunking, then an LLM verifies split points, aiming for high-quality chunks with reduced token usage and LLM costs.</p><p>You can see how Chonkie compares to LangChain and LlamaIndex in our benchmarks: <a href="https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md">https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie/blob/main/BENCHMARKS....</a></p><p>Some technical details about the Chonkie package:  - ~15MB default install vs. ~80-170MB for some alternatives. - Up to 33x faster token chunking compared to LangChain and LlamaIndex in our tests. - Works with major tokenizers (transformers, tokenizers, tiktoken). - Zero external dependencies for basic functionality. - Implements aggressive caching and precomputation. - Uses running mean pooling for efficient semantic chunking. - Modular dependency system (install only what you need).</p><p>In addition to chunking, Chonkie also provides an easy way to create embeddings. For supported providers (SentenceTransformer, Model2Vec, OpenAI), you just specify the model name as a string. You can also create custom embedding handlers for other providers.</p><p>RAG is still the most common use case currently. However, Chonkie makes chunks that are optimized for creating high quality embeddings and vector retrieval, so it is not really tied to the "generation" part of RAG. In fact, We're seeing more and more people use Chonkie for implementing semantic search and/or setting context for agents.</p><p>We are currently focused on building integrations to simplify the retrieval process. We've created "handshakes" – thin functions that interact with vector DBs like pgVector, Chroma, TurboPuffer, and Qdrant, allowing you to interact with storage easily. If there's an integration you'd like to see (vector DB or otherwise), please let us know.</p><p>We also offer hosted and on-premise versions with OCR, extra metadata, all embedding providers, and managed vector databases for teams that want a fully managed pipeline. If you're interested, reach out at shreyash@chonkie.ai or book a demo: <a href="https://cal.com/shreyashn/chonkie-demo" rel="nofollow">https://cal.com/shreyashn/chonkie-demo</a>.</p><p>We're eager to hear your feedback and comments! Thanks!</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

                  <p>Just this week I was working on something similar but specifically for users who have disabilities, so they can more easily report issues to site owners.

And also compatibility with Hypothesis (<a href="https://github.com/hypothesis">https://github.com/hypothesis</a>, <a href="https://hypothes.is/" rel="nofollow">https://hypothes.is</a>), also using the W3C Web Annotation spec.
I hadn't thought of the drag-and-drop bug metaphor; I like it.
I had also considered recording mouse and keystroke events up until the time that the bug is marked, and then bundling those events (sanitized) with the bug report for more precise repro steps, but of course that's a bigger ask for the opt-in.</p>

                  <p>You write that "reporting bugs is usually a terrible experience".  I find bugs ALL THE TIME, and yet, when I even try to find a way to contact ANYONE, let alone a developer, they leave no door open at all. No method, no form, no contact name, no nothing. I (along with many, I presume), actually want those companies to excel. I WANT to let them know what to fix. But, they just don't want to hear about it. Really sad I think.</p>

People do find bugs all the time, and making it super frictionless to report bugs will result in a deluge of reports. Some reports will be outright spam, some could be mistaking a feature for a bug, some could be duplicates. Someone needs to do the triage and try to reproduce before the issue is forwarded to developers. Few companies have the role of Quality Test Engineer (QTE) to do this job; most don't so they have no means to triage the bug reports.</p><p>The only exception is indie apps I pay for on the App Store. There is usually only one or perhaps two people behind it, so by definition that person is SWE, QTE, PM and several jobs rolled into one.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Doctors Could Hack the Nervous System With Ultrasound"><p><strong>Inflammation: It’s the body’s</strong> natural response to injury and infection, but medical science now recognizes it as a double-edged sword. When inflammation becomes chronic, it can contribute to a host of serious health problems, including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/arthritis">arthritis</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/heart-disease">heart disease</a>, and certain cancers. As this understanding has grown, so too has the search for effective ways to manage harmful inflammation.</p><p>Doctors and researchers are exploring various approaches to tackle this pervasive health issue, from new medications to dietary interventions. But what if one of the most promising treatments relies on a familiar technology that’s been in hospitals for decades?</p><p>Enter <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165027020301448" target="_blank">focused ultrasound stimulation</a> (FUS), a technique that uses sound waves to reduce inflammation in targeted areas of the body. It’s a surprising new application for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ultrasound">ultrasound</a> technology, which most people associate with prenatal checkups or diagnostic imaging. And FUS may help with many other disorders too, including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/diabetes">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/obesity">obesity</a>. By modifying existing ultrasound technology, we might be able to offer a novel approach to some of today’s most pressing health challenges.</p><p>Our team of biomedical researchers at the <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/bioelectronic-medicine" target="_blank">Institute of Bioelectronic Medicine</a> (part of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research), in Manhasset, N.Y., has made great strides in learning the electric language of the nervous system. Rather than treating disease with drugs that can have broad side effects throughout the body, we’re learning how to stimulate nerve cells, called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/neurons">neurons</a>, to intervene in a more targeted way. Our goal is to activate or inhibit specific functions within organs.</p><p>The relatively new application of FUS for <a href="https://www.neuromodulation.com/about-neuromodulation" target="_blank">neuromodulation</a>, in which we hypothesize that sound waves activate neurons, may offer a precise and safe way to provide healing treatments for a wide range of both acute and chronic maladies. The treatment doesn’t require <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/surgery">surgery</a> and potentially could be used at home with a wearable device. People are accustomed to being prescribing pills for these ailments, but we imagine that one day, the prescriptions could be more like this: “Strap on your ultrasound belt once per day to receive your dose of stimulation.”</p><h2>How Ultrasound Stimulation Works</h2><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/mems-ultrasound-history" target="_self">Ultrasound</a> is a time-honored medical technology. Researchers began experimenting with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ultrasound-imaging">ultrasound imaging</a> in the 1940s, bouncing low-energy <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ultrasonic">ultrasonic</a> waves off internal organs to construct medical images, typically using intensities of a few hundred milliwatts per square centimeter of tissue. By the late 1950s, some doctors were using the technique to show expectant parents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_ultrasonography" target="_blank">developing fetus inside the mother’s uterus</a>. And high-intensity ultrasound waves, which can be millions of milliwatts per square centimeter, have a variety of therapeutic uses, including <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16541-hifu-high-intensity-focused-ultrasound" target="_blank">destroying tumors</a>.</p><p>The use of low-intensity ultrasound (with intensities similar to that of imaging applications) to alter the activity of the nervous system, however, is relatively unexplored territory. To understand how it works, it’s helpful to compare FUS to the most common form of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/neuromodulation">neuromodulation</a> today, which uses electric current to alter the activity of neurons to treat conditions like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/parkinson-s-disease">Parkinson’s disease</a>. In that technique, electric current increases the voltage inside a neuron, causing it to “fire” and release a neurotransmitter that’s received by connected neurons, which triggers those neurons to fire in turn. For example, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/deep-brain-stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a> used to treat Parkinson’s activates certain neurons to restore healthy patterns of brain activity.</p><div id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes/particle-2" data-basename="particle-2" data-post-id="2672317304" data-published-at="1749235165" data-use-pagination="False"><p><strong></strong>In FUS, by contrast, the sound waves’ vibrations interact with the membrane of the neuron, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28040-1" target="_blank">opening channels</a> that allow ions to flow into the cell, thus indirectly changing the cell’s voltage and causing it to fire. One promising use is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2021.12.010" target="_blank">transcranial ultrasound stimulation</a>, which is being tested extensively as a noninvasive way to stimulate the brain and treat neurological and psychiatric diseases.</p><p>We’re interested in FUS’s effect on the peripheral nerves—that is, the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. We think that activating specific nerves in the abdomen that regulate inflammation or metabolism may help address the root causes of related diseases, rather than just treating the symptoms.</p><h2>FUS for Inflammation</h2><p>Inflammation is something that we know a lot about. Back in 2002, <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/kevin-j-tracey-md" target="_blank">Kevin Tracey</a>, currently the president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes, upset the conventional wisdom that the nervous system and the immune system operate independently and serve distinct roles. He discovered the body’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01321" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inflammatory reflex</a>: a two-way neural circuit that sends signals between the brain and body via the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/vagus-nerve">vagus nerve</a> and the nerves of the spleen. These nerves control the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cytokines</a>, which are proteins released by immune cells to trigger inflammation. Tracey and colleagues found that stimulating nerves in this neural circuit suppressed the inflammatory response. The discoveries led to the first clinical trials of electrical neuromodulation devices to treat chronic inflammation and launched the field of bioelectronic medicine.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem4" data-id="4" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes/particle-4" data-basename="particle-4" data-post-id="2672317304" data-published-at="1749235165" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Tracey has been a pioneer in treating inflammation with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-vagus-nerve-a-back-door-for-brain-hacking" target="_self">vagus nerve stimulation</a> (VNS), in which electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve activates neurons in the spleen. In animals and humans, VNS has been shown to reduce harmful inflammation in both chronic diseases such as arthritis and acute conditions such as sepsis. But direct VNS requires surgery to place an implant in the body, which makes it risky for the patient and expensive. That’s why we’ve pursued noninvasive ultrasound stimulation of the spleen.</p><p>Working with Tracey, collaborators at <a href="https://www.gehealthcare.com/" target="_blank">GE Research</a>, and others, we first experimented with rodents to show that ultrasound stimulation of the spleen <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08750-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">affects an anti-inflammatory pathway</a>, just as VNS does, and reduces cytokine production as much as a VNS implant does. We then conducted the first-in-human trial of <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/non-invasive-ultrasound-stimulation-spleen-reduces-inflammation-in-humans-new-study" target="_blank">FUS for controlling inflammation</a>.</p><p>We initially enrolled 60 healthy people, none of whom had signs of chronic inflammation. To test the effect of a 3-minute ultrasound treatment, we were measuring the amount of a molecule called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tumor necrosis factor</a> (TNF), which is a biomarker of inflammation that’s released when white blood cells go into action against a perceived pathogen. At the beginning of the study, 40 people received focused ultrasound stimulation, while 20 others, serving as the control group, simply had their spleens imaged by ultrasound. Yet, when we looked at the early data, <em>everyone</em> had lower levels of TNF, even the control group. It seemed that even imaging with ultrasound for a few minutes had a moderate anti-inflammatory effect! To get a proper control group, we had to recruit 10 more people for the study and devise a different sham experiment, this time unplugging the ultrasound machine.</p></div><p><img id="f166b" data-rm-shortcode-id="2ae16b235445ec02f72e63b3c909cc7a" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-collage-with-neuron-brain-textures-and-dynamic-wave-patterns-in-pastel-colors.jpg?id=60560952&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-collage-with-neuron-brain-textures-and-dynamic-wave-patterns-in-pastel-colors.jpg?id=60560952&amp;width=980" width="1200" height="1500" alt="Abstract collage with neuron, brain textures, and dynamic wave patterns in pastel colors."><small><p>Shonagh Rae</p></small></p><div id="rebelltitem6" data-id="6" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes/particle-6" data-basename="particle-6" data-post-id="2672317304" data-published-at="1749235165" data-use-pagination="False"><p>After the subjects received either the real or sham stimulation, we took blood samples from all of them. We next simulated an infection by adding a bacterial toxin to the blood in the test tubes, then measured the amount of TNF released by the white blood cells to fight the toxin. The results, which we published in the journal <em>Brain Stimulation</em> in 2023, showed that people who had received FUS treatments <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X23017436" target="_blank">had lower levels of TNF</a> than the true control group. We saw no problematic side effects of the ultrasound: The treatment didn’t adversely affect <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/heart-rate">heart rate</a>, blood pressure, or the many other biomarkers that we checked.</p><p>The results also showed that when we repeated the blood draw and experiment 24 hours later, the treatment groups’ TNF levels had returned to baseline. This finding suggests that if FUS becomes a treatment option for inflammatory diseases, people might require regular, perhaps even daily, treatments.</p><p>One surprising result was that it didn’t seem to matter which location within the spleen we targeted—all the locations we tried produced similar results. Our hypothesis is that hitting any target within the spleen activates enough nerves to produce the beneficial effect. What’s more, it didn’t matter which energy intensity we used. We tried intensities ranging from about 10 to 200 mW per cm<sup>2</sup>, well within the range of intensities used in ultrasound imaging; remarkably, even the lowest intensity level caused subjects’ TNF levels to drop.</p><p>Our big takeaway from that first-in-human study was that targeting the spleen with FUS is not just a feasible treatment but could be a gamechanger for inflammatory diseases. Our next steps are to investigate the mechanisms by which FUS affects the inflammatory response, and to conduct more animal and human studies to see whether prolonged administration of FUS to the spleen can treat chronic inflammatory diseases.</p><h2>FUS for Obesity and Diabetes</h2><p>For much of our research on FUS, we’ve partnered with GE Research, whose parent company is one of the world’s leading makers of ultrasound equipment. One of our first projects together explored the potential of FUS as a treatment for the widespread inflammation that often accompanies obesity, a condition that now affects about <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank">890 million people</a> around the world. In this study, we fed lab mice a high-calorie and high-fat “Western diet” for eight weeks. During the following eight weeks, half of them received ultrasound stimulation while the other half received daily sham stimulation. We found that the <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/feinstein-institutes-and-ge-research-demonstrate-ultrasound-stimulation-reduces-obesity" target="_blank">mice that received FUS had lower levels of cytokines</a>—and to our surprise, those mice also ate less and lost weight.</p><p>In related work with our GE colleagues, we examined the potential of FUS as a <a href="https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/research-team-treats-diabetes-using-ultrasound" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">treatment for diabetes</a>, which now affects <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">830 million people</a> around the world. In a healthy human body, the liver stores glucose as a reserve and releases it only when it registers that glucose levels in the bloodstream have dropped. But in people with diabetes, this sensing system is dysfunctional, and the liver releases glucose even when blood levels are already high, causing a host of health problems.</p></div><p><span>For diabetes, our ultrasound target was the network of nerves that transmit signals between the liver and the brain: specifically, glucose-sensing neurons in the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porta_hepatis" target="_blank">porta hepatis</a><span>, which is essentially the gateway to the liver. We gave diabetic rats 3-minute daily ultrasound stimulation over a period of 40 days. Within just a few days, the treatment <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00870-w" target="_blank">brought down the rats’ glucose levels</a> from dangerously high to normal range. We got similar results in mice and pigs, and </span>published these exciting results<span> in 2022 in </span><em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em><span>.</span></p><p>Those diabetes experiments shed some light on why ultrasound had this effect. We decided to zero in on a brain region called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus" target="_blank">hypothalamus</a>, which controls many crucial automatic body functions, including metabolism, circadian rhythms, and body temperature. Our colleagues at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ge-research">GE Research</a> started investigating by blocking the nerve signals that travel from the liver to the hypothalamus in two different ways—both cutting the nerves physically and using a local anesthetic. When we then applied FUS, we didn’t see the beneficial decrease in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/glucose">glucose</a> levels. This result suggests that the ultrasound treatment works by changing glucose-sensing signals that travel from the liver to the brain—which in turn changes the commands the hypothalamus issues to the metabolic systems of the body, essentially telling them to lower glucose levels.</p><p>The next steps in this research involve both technical development and clinical testing. Currently, administering FUS requires technical expertise, with a sonographer looking at ultrasound images, locating the target, and triggering the stimulation. But if FUS is to become a practical treatment for a chronic disease, we’ll need to make it usable by anyone and available as an at-home system. That could be a wearable device that uses ultrasound imaging to automatically locate the anatomical target and then delivers the FUS dose: All the patient would have to do is put on the device and turn it on. But before we get to that point, FUS treatment will have to be tested clinically in randomized controlled trials for people with obesity and diabetes. GE HealthCare recently <a href="https://www.gehealthcare.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/ge-healthcare-and-novo-nordisk-to-collaborate-to-advance-novel-non-invasive-treatment-for-type-2-diabetes-and-obesity-with-ultrasound" target="_blank">partnered</a> with Novo Nordisk to work on the clinical and product development of FUS in these areas.</p><h2>FUS for Cardiopulmonary Diseases</h2><p>FUS may also help with chronic cardiovascular diseases, many of which are associated with immune dysfunction and inflammation. We began with a disorder called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension" target="_blank">pulmonary arterial hypertension</a>, a rare but incurable disease in which <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/blood-pressure">blood pressure</a> increases in the arteries within the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lungs">lungs</a>. At the start of our research, it wasn’t clear whether inflammation around the pulmonary arteries was a cause or a by-product of the disease, and whether targeting inflammation was a viable treatment. Our group was the first to try FUS of the spleen in order to reduce the inflammation associated <a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/feinstein-institutes-ultrasound-neuromodulation-for-pulmonary-hypertension" target="_blank">with pulmonary hypertension</a> in rats.</p><p>The results, published last year, were very encouraging. We found that 12-minute FUS sessions <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.323679" target="_blank">reduced pulmonary pressure</a>, improved heart function, and reduced lung inflammation in the animals in the experimental group (as compared to animals that received sham stimulation). What’s more, in the animals that received FUS, the progression of the disease slowed significantly even after the experiment ended, suggesting that this treatment could provide a lasting effect.</p><p>One day, an AI system might be able to guide at-home users as they place a wearable device on their body and trigger the stimulation.</p><p>This study was, to our knowledge, the first to successfully demonstrate an ultrasound-based therapy for any cardiopulmonary disease. And we’re eager to build on it. We’re next interested in studying whether FUS can help with congestive <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/heart-failure">heart failure</a>, a condition in which the heart can’t pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. In the United States alone, more than <a href="https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/ddi/heart-failure-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank">6 million people</a> are living with heart failure, and that number could surpass 8 million by 2030. We know that inflammation plays a significant role in heart failure by damaging the heart’s muscle cells and reducing their elasticity. We plan to test FUS of the spleen in mice with the condition. If those tests are successful, we could move toward clinical testing in humans.</p><h2>The Future of Ultrasound Stimulation</h2><p>We have one huge advantage as we think about how to bring these results from the lab to the clinic: The basic hardware for ultrasound already exists, it’s already <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fda">FDA</a> approved, and it has a stellar safety record through decades of use. Our collaborators at GE have already experimented with modifying the typical ultrasound devices used for imaging so that they can be used for FUS treatments.</p><p>Once we get to the point of optimizing FUS for clinical use, we’ll have to determine the best neuromodulation parameters. For instance, what are the right acoustic wavelengths and frequencies? Ultrasound imaging typically uses higher frequencies than FUS does, but human tissue absorbs more acoustic energy at higher frequencies than it does at lower frequencies. So to deliver a good dose of FUS, researchers are exploring a wide range of frequencies. We’ll also have to think about how long to transmit that ultrasound energy to make up a single pulse, what rate of pulses to use, and how long the treatment should be.</p><p>In addition, we need to determine how long the beneficial effect of the treatment lasts. For some of the ailments that researchers are exploring, like <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8261174/" target="_blank">FUS of the brain to treat chronic pain</a>, a patient might be able to go to the doctor’s office once every three months for a dose. But for diseases associated with inflammation, a regular, several-times-per-week regimen might prove most effective, which would require at-home treatments.</p><p>For home use to be possible, the wearable device would have to locate the targets automatically via ultrasound imaging. As vast databases already exist of human ultrasound images from the liver, spleen, and other organs, it seems feasible to train a machine-learning algorithm to detect targets automatically and in real time. One day, an AI system might be able to guide at-home users as they place a wearable device on their body and trigger the stimulation. A few startups are working on building such <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wearable-devices">wearable devices</a>, which could take the form of a belt or a vest. For example, the company <a href="https://www.secondwaveus.com/" target="_blank">SecondWave Systems</a>, which has partnered with the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, has already conducted a small <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240501993182/en/SecondWave-Systems-Demonstrates-Reduction-in-Disease-Activity-in-Clinical-Study-Evaluating-Novel-Ultrasound-Based-Anti-Inflammatory-Therapy-in-Rheumatoid-Arthritis" target="_blank">pilot study</a> of its wearable device, trying it out on 13 people with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/rheumatoid-arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and seeing positive outcomes.</p><p>While it will be many years before FUS treatments are approved for clinical use, and likely still more years for wearable devices to be proven safe enough for home use, the path forward looks very promising. We believe that FUS and other forms of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/bioelectronic-medicine">bioelectronic medicine</a> offer a new paradigm for human health, one in which we reduce our reliance on pharmaceuticals and begin to speak directly to the body electric.</p></div></div>]]></description>

              Can we even brute this?
            </h3><p>My first attempts were futile. It seemed to ratelimit your IP address after a few requests and present a captcha.</p>
<p>‎</p>


<p>‎</p>
<p>Perhaps we could use proxies to get around this? If we take Netherlands as an example, the <a href="https://g.co/AccountRecoveryRequest">forgot password flow</a> provides us with the phone hint <code>•• ••••••03</code></p>
<p>‎</p>
<p>For Netherlands mobile numbers, they always start with <code>06</code>, meaning there's 6 digits we'd have to brute. 10**6 = 1,000,000 numbers. That might be doable with proxies, but there had to be a better way.</p>

              How do we know which country code a victim's phone is?
            </h4><p>Interestingly enough, it's possible for us to figure out the country code based off of the phone mask that the <a href="https://g.co/AccountRecoveryRequest">forgot password flow</a> provides us. Google actually just uses <a href="https://github.com/google/libphonenumber">libphonenumbers</a>'s "national format" for each number.</p>
<p>Here's some examples:</p>
<pre><code>{
    ...
    "• (•••) •••-••-••": [
        "ru"
    ],
    "•• ••••••••": [

              How do we get the victim's Google account display name?
            </h4><p>Initially in 2023, Google changed their policy to only show names if there was direct interaction from the target to you (emails, shared docs, etc.), so they slowly removed names from endpoints. By April 2024, they updated their internal <code>FocusBackend</code> service to completely stop returning display names for unauthenticated accounts, removing display names almost everywhere. </p>
<p>‎</p>
<p>It was going to be tricky to find a display name leak after all that, but eventually after looking through random Google products, I found out that I could create a <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/">Looker Studio</a> document, transfer ownership of it to the victim, and the victim's display name would leak on the home page, <strong>with 0 interaction required from the victim</strong>:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This post is making a point - generative AI is relatively cheap -
that might seem so obvious it doesn't need making. I'm mostly writing it because I've
repeatedly had the same discussion in the past six months where people claim the opposite.
Not only is the misconception still around, but it's not even getting less frequent. This
is mainly written to have a document I can point people at, the next time it repeats.</p>

<p>It seems to be a common, if not a majority, belief that Large
Language Models (in the colloquial sense of "things that are like
ChatGPT") are very expensive to operate. This then leads to a ton
of innumerate analyses about how AI companies must be obviously
doomed, as well as a myopic view on how consumer AI businesses can/will
be monetized.</p>
<p>It's an understandable mistake, since inference was indeed very
expensive at the start of the AI boom, and those costs were talked about
a lot. But inference has gotten cheaper even faster
than models have gotten better, and nobody has an intuition for
something becoming 1000x cheaper in two years. It just doesn't happen.
It doesn't help that the common pricing model ("$ per million tokens")
is very hard to visualize.</p>
<p>So let's compare LLMs to web search. I'm choosing search as the
comparison since it's in the same vicinity and since it's
something everyone uses and nobody pays for, not because I'm suggesting that
ungrounded generative AI is a good substitute for search.</p>

<read-more></read-more>

<p>(It should also go without saying that these are just my personal
opinions.)</p>
<h3 id="what-does-a-web-search-cost">What is the price of a web search?</h3>
<p>Here's the public API pricing for some companies operating their own
web search infrastructure, retrieved on 2025-05-02:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing">Gemini API pricing</a>
lists a "Grounding with Google Search" feature at $35/1k queries. I
believe that's the best number we can get for Google, they don't publish
prices for a "raw" search result API.<br>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/pricing">Bing Search API</a>
is priced at $15/1k queries at the cheapest tier.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://brave.com/search/api/">Brave</a>
has a price of $5/1k searches at the cheapest tier. Though there's something very
strange about their pricing structure, with the unit pricing increasing as
the quota increases, which is the opposite of what you'd expect. The
tier with real quota is priced at $9/1k searches.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there's a range of prices, but not a horribly wide one, and with the
engines you'd expect to be of higher quality also having higher prices.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-equivalent-llm-usage-cost">What is the price of LLMs in a similar domain?</h3>
<p>To make a reasonable comparison between those search prices and LLM
prices, we need two numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many tokens are output per query?<br>
</li>
<li>What's the price per token?</li>
</ul>
<p>I picked a few arbitrary queries from my search history, and phrased
them as questions, and ran them on Gemini 2.5 Flash (thinking mode off)
in AI Studio:</p>
<ul>
<li>[When was the term LLM first used?] -&gt; 361 tokens, 2.5
seconds<br>
</li>
<li>[What are the top javascript game engines?] -&gt; 1145 tokens, 7.6
seconds<br>
</li>
<li>[What are the typical carry-on bag size limits in europe?] -&gt; 506
tokens, 3.4 seconds<br>
</li>
<li>[List the 10 largest power outages in history] -&gt; 583 tokens, 3.7
seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I'm not judging the quality of the answers here. The
purpose is just to get rough numbers for how large typical responses
are. A 500-1000 token range seems like a reasonable estimate.</p>
<p>What's the price of a token? The pricing is sometimes different for input
and output tokens. Input tokens tend to be cheaper, and our inputs are
very short compared to the outputs, so for simplicity let's consider all
the tokens to be outputs. Here's the pricing of some relevant models,
retrieved on 2025-05-02:</p>

<p>If we assume the average query uses 1k tokens, these prices would be
directly comparable to the prices per 1k search queries. That's convenient.</p>
<p>The low end of that spectrum is at least an order of magnitude
cheaper than even the cheapest search API, and even the models at the
low end are pretty capable. The high end is about on par with the
highest end of search pricing. To compare a midrange pair on quality,
the Bing Search vs. a Gemini 2.5 Flash comparison shows the LLM being
1/25th the price.</p>
<p>Note that many of the above models have cheaper pricing in exchange
for more flexible scheduling (Anthropic, Google and OpenAI give a 50%
discount for batch requests, Deepseek is 50%-75% cheaper during off-peak
hours). I've not included those cheaper options in the table to keep
things comparable, but the presence of those cheaper tiers is worth
keeping in mind when thinking about the next section...</p>
<h3 id="objection">Objection!</h3>
<p>I know some people are going to have objections to this
back-of-the-envelope calculation, and a lot of them will be totally
legit concerns. I'll try to address some of them preemptively. Slightly
different assumptions can easily lead to clawing back 10% here and 50%
there. But I don't see how to bridge a 25x gap just for breaking even,
let alone making the AI significantly more expensive. If you want to play
around with different assumptions, there's a little calculator widget
below.</p>
<p><strong>Surely the typical LLM response is longer than that</strong>
- I already picked the upper end of what the (very light) testing
suggested as a reasonable range for the type of question that I'd use
web search for. There's a lot of use cases where the inputs and outputs
are going to be much longer (e.g. coding), but then you'd need to also
switch the comparison to something in that same domain as well.</p>
<p><strong>The LLM API prices must be subsidized to grab market
share -- i.e. the prices might be low, but the costs are high</strong> -
I don't think they are, for a few reasons. I'd instead assume
APIs are typically profitable on a unit basis. I have not found any
credible analysis suggesting otherwise.</p>
<p>First, there's not that much motive to gain API market share
with unsustainably cheap prices. Any gains would be temporary, since
there's no long-term lock-in, and better models are released weekly.
Data from paid API queries will also typically not be used for training
or tuning the models, so getting access to more data wouldn't explain
it. Note that it's not just that you'd be losing money on each of
these queries for no benefit, you're losing the compute that could
be spent on training, research, or more useful types of inference.</p>
<p>Second, some of those models have been released with open weights and
API access is also available from third-party providers who would have
no motive to subsidize inference. (Or the number in the table isn't even
first party hosting -- I sure can't figure out what the Vertex AI
pricing for Gemma 3 is). The pricing of those third-party hosted APIs
appears competitive with first-party hosted APIs. For example, the
<a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/deepseek-r1/providers">Artificial Analysis
summary on Deepseek R1 hosting</a>.</p>
<p>Third, Deepseek released <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/open-infra-index/blob/main/202502OpenSourceWeek/day_6_one_more_thing_deepseekV3R1_inference_system_overview.md">actual
numbers</a> on their inference efficiency in February. Those numbers
suggest that their normal R1 API pricing has about 80% margins
when considering the GPU costs, though not any other serving costs.</p>
<p>Fourth, there are a bunch of first-principles analyses on the cost structure
of models with various architectures should be. Those are of course mathematical
models, but those costs line up pretty well with the observed end-user
pricing of models whose architecture is known. See the references section for
links.</p>
<p><strong>The search API prices amortize building and updating the
search index, LLM inference is based on just the cost of
inference</strong> - This seems pretty likely to be true, actually? But
the effect can't really be <em>that</em> large for a popular model:
e.g. the allegedly leaked OpenAI financials claimed $4B/year spent on
inference vs. $3B/year on training. Given the crazy growth of
inference volumes (e.g. Google recently claimed a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/io-2025-keynote/">
50x increase in token volumes in the last year</a>) the training costs
are getting amortized much more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>The search API prices must have higher margins than LLM
inference</strong> - It's possible. I certainly don't know what the
margins of any Search API providers are, though it seems fair to assume
they're pretty robust. But, well, see the point above about Deepseek's
releasd numbers on the R1 profit margins.</p>
<p>Also, it seems quite plausible that some Search providers would
accept lower margins, since at least Microsoft execs have testified
under oath that they'd be willing to pay more for the iOS query stream
than their revenue, just to get more usage data.</p>
<p><strong>Web search returns results 20x-100x faster than an LLM
finishes the query, how could it be more expensive?</strong> - Search
latency can be improved by parallelizing the problem, while LLM
inference is (for now) serial in nature. The task of predicting a single token can
be parallelized, but the you can't predict all the output tokens at
once.</p>

<p><strong>But OpenAI made a loss, and they don't expect to make profit for years!</strong> -
That's because a huge proportion of their usage is not monetized at all,
despite the usage pattern being ideal for it. OpenAI reportedly made a
loss of $5B in 2024. They also reportedly have 500M MAUs. To reach break-even,
they'd just need to monetize (e.g. with ads) those free users for an average of $10/year,
or $1/month. A $1 ARPU for a service like this would be pitifully low.
</p>

<p>If the reported numbers are true, OpenAI doesn't actually have
high costs for a consumer service that popular, which is what you'd
expect to see if the high cost of inference was the problem. They just
have a very low per-user revenue, by choice.</p>

<h3 id="widget">Sensitivity analysis</h3>

<p>
  If you want to play around with different assumptions, here's
  a calculator:

<h3 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h3>
<p>I mean, you're right to ask that. Nothing really matters and
eventually we'll all be dead.</p>
<p>But it is interesting how many people have built their mental
model for the near future on a premise that was true for only a brief
moment. Some things that will come as a surprise to them even assuming
all progress stops right now:</p>
<p>There's an argument advanced by some people about how low
prices mean it'll be impossible for AI companies to ever recoup
model training costs. The thinking seems to be that it's just
the prices that have been going down, but not the costs, and
the low prices must be an unprofitable race to the bottom for
what little demand there is. What's happening and will continue
to happen instead is that as costs go down, the prices go down too,
and demand increases as new uses become viable. For an example,
look at the <a href="https://openrouter.ai/rankings">OpenRouter
API traffic volumes</a>, both in aggregate and in the relative
share of cheaper models.
</p>
<p>This post was mainly about APIs, but consumer usage will have
exactly the same cost structure, just a different monetization
structure. And given how low the unit costs must be, advertising isn't merely
viable but lucrative.</p>
<p>From this it follows that the financials of frontier AI labs are a
lot better than some innumerate pundits would have you believe. They're
making a loss because they're not under pressure to be profitable, and
aren't actively trying to monetize consumer traffic yet. This
could well be a land grab unlike APIs, since unpaid consumer queries
may be used for training while paid API queries typically are not.
Even the subscription pricing might be there
mainly for demand management rather than trying to run a profit.</p>
<p>The real cost problem isn't going to be with the LLMs themselves,
it's with all the backend services that AI agents will want to access
if even a rudimentary form of the agentic vision actually materializes.
Running the AI is already cheap, will keep getting cheaper, and will always
have a monetization model of some sort since it's what the end user is
interacting with. Neither of those is true for the end-user services
that have been turned into AI backends without their consent. An AI
trying to, I don't know, book concert tickets whenever a band I like
plays in my town will probably be phenomenally expensive to its
third-party backends (e.g. scraping ticket sites). Those sites will be
uncompensated for the expense while also removing their actual revenue
streams.</p>
<p>I don't really know how that plays out.</p>
<p>Obviously many service owners will try to make unauthorized scraping
harder, but that's a very hard problem to solve on the web. Maybe some
of them give up on the web entirely, and move to mobile where they can
at least get device attestations. Some might just give up on the open
web, and require all usage to be signed in, with account creation being
gated on something scarce. Some might become unviable and close up shop
entirely.</p>
<p>If/when that happens, what's the play on the AI agent side? Will they
choose an escalating adversarial arms race with increasingly dodgy
tactics, or will they eventually decide that it's better to pay for the
services they use? The former seems unsustainable. If the latter, then
it feels like the core engineering challenge becomes one of building data
provider backends optimized specifically for AI use, with the goal of scaling to
massive volumes and cheaper unit prices, with the trade-off being higher latency, lower
reliability and lower quality.
That could be quite interesting from a systems perspective. (Yes, I'm aware
of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">MCP</a>,
but it's a solution to an orthogonal issue.)
</p>
<p>But one thing I'm confident won't be happening is that it's the AIs that
turn out to be too expensive to run.</p>

<p>Ajit Pai is back on the telecom policy scene as chief lobbyist for the mobile industry, and he has quickly managed to anger a coalition that includes both cable companies and consumer advocates.</p>
<p>Pai was the Federal Communications Commission chairman during President Trump's first term and then spent several years at private equity firm Searchlight Capital. He changed jobs in April, becoming the president and CEO of wireless industry lobby group CTIA. Shortly after, he visited the White House to discuss wireless industry priorities and had a <a href="https://x.com/AjitPai/status/1914845780826873974">meeting with Brendan Carr</a>, the current FCC chairman who was part of Pai's Republican majority at the FCC from 2017 to 2021.</p>
<p>Pai's new job isn't surprising. He was once a lawyer for Verizon, and it's not uncommon for FCC chairs and commissioners to be lobbyists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/04/fccs-revolving-door-former-chairman-leads-charge-against-title-ii/">before or after</a> terms in government.</p>
<p>Pai's move to CTIA means he is now battling a variety of industry players and advocacy groups over the allocation of spectrum. As always, wireless companies AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile want more spectrum and the exclusive rights to use it. The fight puts Pai at odds with the cable industry that cheered his many deregulatory actions when he led the FCC.</p>
<p>Pai wrote a May 4 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/america-has-lost-its-lead-in-5g-fcc-tech-telecom-spectrum-auctions-c64d395f">op-ed in The Wall Street Journal</a> arguing that China is surging ahead of the US in 5G deployment and that "the US doesn't even have enough licensed spectrum available to keep up with expected consumer demand." He said that Congress must restore the FCC's lapsed authority to auction spectrum licenses, and auction off "at least 600 megahertz of midband spectrum for future 5G services."</p>
<p>"During the first Trump administration, the US was determined to lead the world in wireless innovation—and by 2021 it did," Pai wrote. "But that urgency and sense of purpose have diminished. With Mr. Trump's leadership, we can rediscover both."</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Pai's op-ed drew a quick rebuke from a group called Spectrum for the Future, which alleged that Pai mangled the facts.</p>
<p>"Mr. Pai's arguments are wrong on the facts—and wrong on how to accelerate America's global wireless leadership," the vaguely named group said in a <a href="https://spectrumfuture.com/ctia-has-lost-the-plot-on-5g/">May 8 press release</a> that accused Pai of "stunning hypocrisy." Spectrum for the Future said Pai is wrong about the existence of a spectrum shortage, wrong about how much money a spectrum auction could raise, and wrong about the cost of reallocating spectrum from the military to mobile companies.</p>
<p>"Mr. Pai attributes the US losing its lead in 5G availability to the FCC's lapsed spectrum auction authority. He'd be more accurate to blame his own members' failure to build out their networks," the group said.</p>
<h2>Big Cable finds allies</h2>
<p>Pai's op-ed said that auctioning 600 MHz "could raise as much as $200 billion" to support other US government priorities. Spectrum for the Future called this an "absurd claim" that "presumes that this auction of 600 MHz could approach the combined total ($233 billion) that has been raised by every prior spectrum auction (totaling nearly 6 GHz of bandwidth) in US history <em>combined</em>."</p>
<p>The group also said Pai "completely ignores the immense <em>cost</em> to taxpayers to relocate incumbent military and intelligence systems out of the bands CTIA covets for its own use." Spectrum for the Future didn't mention that one of the previous auctions, for the 3.7–3.98 GHz band, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/auction/107">netted over $81 billion</a> in winning bids.</p>
<p>So who is behind Spectrum for the Future? The group's <a href="https://spectrumfuture.com/about-us/">website lists 18 members</a> , including the biggest players in the cable industry. Comcast, Charter, Cox, and lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association are all members of Spectrum for the Future. (<em>Disclosure: The Advance/Newhouse Partnership, which owns 12 percent of Charter, is part of Advance Publications, which owns Ars Technica parent Condé Nast.</em>)</p>

<p>When contacted by Ars, a CTIA spokesperson criticized cable companies for "fighting competition" and said the cable firms are being "disingenuous." Charter and Cox declined to answer our questions about their involvement in Spectrum for the Future. Comcast and the NCTA didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The NCTA and big cable companies are no strangers to lobbying the FCC and Congress and could fight for CBRS entirely on their own. But as it happens, some consumer advocates who regularly oppose the cable industry on other issues are on cable's side in this battle.</p>
<p>With Spectrum for the Future, the cable industry has allied not just with consumer advocates but also small wireless ISPs and operators of private networks that use spectrum the big mobile companies want for themselves. Another group that is part of the coalition represents schools and libraries that use spectrum to provide local services.</p>
<p>For cable, joining with consumer groups, small ISPs, and others in a broad coalition has an obvious advantage from a public relations standpoint. "This is a lot of different folks who are in it for their own reasons. Sometimes that's a big advantage because it makes it more authentic," said Harold Feld, senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, which is part of Spectrum of the Future.</p>
<p>In some cases, a big company will round up nonprofits to which it has donated to make a show of broad public support for one of the company's regulatory priorities—like a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/business/media/comcasts-web-of-lobbying-and-philanthropy.html">needed merger approval</a>. That's not what happened here, according to Feld. While cable companies probably provided most of the funding for Spectrum for the Future, the other members are keenly interested in fighting the wireless lobby over spectrum access.</p>
<p>"There's a difference between cable being a tentpole member and this being cable with a couple of friends on the side," Feld told Ars. Cable companies "have the most to lose, they have the most initial resources. But all of these other guys who are in here, I've been on these calls, they're pretty active. There are a lot of diverse interests in this, which sometimes makes it easier to lobby, sometimes makes it harder to lobby because you all want to talk about what's important to you."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Feld didn't help write the group's press release criticizing Pai but said the points made are "all things I agree with."</p>
<h2>The “everybody but Big Mobile” coalition</h2>
<p>Public Knowledge and New America's Open Technology Institute (OTI), another Spectrum for the Future member, are both longtime proponents of shared spectrum. OTI's Wireless Future Project director, Michael Calabrese, told Ars that Spectrum for the Future is basically the "everybody but Big Mobile" wireless coalition and "a very broad but ad hoc coalition."</p>
<p>While Public Knowledge and OTI advocate for shared spectrum in many frequency bands, Spectrum for the Future is primarily focused on one: the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), which spans from 3550 MHz to 3700 MHz. The CBRS spectrum is used by the Department of Defense and shared with non-federal users.</p>
<p>CBRS users in the cable industry and beyond want to ensure that CBRS remains available to them and free of high-power mobile signals that would crowd out lower-power operations. They were disturbed by <a href="https://www.attconnects.com/ten-years-later-a-new-vision-for-the-3-ghz-band/">AT&amp;T's October 2024 proposal</a> to move CBRS to the lower part of the 3 GHz band, which is also used by the Department of Defense, and auction existing CBRS frequencies to 5G wireless companies "for licensed, full-power use."</p>
<p>The NCTA <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/120632176086/1">told the FCC in December</a> that "AT&amp;T's proposal to reallocate the entire 3 GHz band is unwarranted, impracticable, and unworkable and is based on the false assertion that the CBRS band is underutilized."</p>
<p>Big mobile companies want the CBRS spectrum because it is adjacent to frequencies that are already licensed to them. The Department of Defense seems to support AT&amp;T's idea, even though it would require moving some military operations and sharing the spectrum with non-federal users.</p>

<h2>Pentagon plan similar to AT&amp;T’s</h2>
<p>In a May research note provided to Ars, New Street Research Policy Advisor Blair Levin reported some details of a Department of Defense proposal for several bands of spectrum, including CBRS. The White House asked the Department of Defense "to come up with a plan to enable allocation of mid-band exclusive-use spectrum," and the Pentagon recently started circulating its initial proposal.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The Pentagon plan is apparently similar to AT&amp;T's, as it would reportedly move current CBRS licensees and users to the lower 3 GHz band to clear spectrum for auctions.</p>
<p>"It represents the first time we can think of where the government would change the license terms of one set of users to benefit a competitor of that first set of users... While the exclusive-use spectrum providers would see this as government exercising its eminent domain rights as it has traditionally done, CBRS users, particularly cable, would see this as the equivalent of a government exercis[ing] its eminent domain rights to condemn and tear down a Costco to give the land to a Walmart," Levin wrote.</p>
<p>If the proposal is implemented, cable companies would likely sue the government "on the grounds that it violates their property rights" under the priority licenses they purchased to use CBRS, Levin wrote. Levin's note said he doesn't think this proposal is likely to be adopted, but it shows that "the game is afoot."</p>
<p>CBRS is important to cable companies because they have increasingly focused on selling mobile service as another revenue source on top of their traditional TV and broadband businesses. Cable firms got into the mobile business by reselling network access from the likes of Verizon. They've been increasing the use of CBRS, reducing their reliance on the major mobile companies, although a recent <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/a-hunt-for-cable-s-cbrs-deployments-turns-up-not-much">Light Reading article</a> indicates that cable's progress with CBRS deployment has been slow.</p>

<p>In its statement to Ars, CTIA said the cable industry "opposes full-power 5G access in the US at every opportunity" in CBRS and other spectrum bands. Cable companies are "fighting competition" from wireless operators "every chance they can," CTIA said. "With accelerating losses in the marketplace, their advocacy is now more aggressive and disingenuous."</p>
<p>The DoD plan that reportedly mirrors AT&amp;T's proposal seems to represent a significant change from the Biden-era Department of Defense's stance. In September 2023, the department issued a <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/DoD-EMBRSS-FeasabilityAssessmentRedacted.pdf?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com">report</a> saying that sharing the 3.1 GHz band with non-federal users would be challenging and potentially cause interference, even if rules were in place to protect DoD operations.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>"DoD is concerned about the high possibility that non-Federal users will not adhere to the established coordination conditions at all times; the impacts related to airborne systems, due to their range and speed; and required upgrades to multiple classes of ships," the 2023 report said.&nbsp;We contacted the Department of Defense and did not receive a response.</p>
<p>Levin quoted Calabrese as saying the new plan "would pull the rug out from under more than 1,000 CBRS operators that have deployed more than 400,000 base stations. While they could, in theory, share DoD spectrum lower in the band, that spectrum will now be so congested it's unclear how or when that could be implemented."</p>

<h2>Small ISP slams “AT&amp;T and its cabal of telecom giants”</h2>
<p>AT&amp;T argues that CBRS spectrum is underutilized and should be repurposed for commercial mobile use because it "resides between two crucial, high-power, licensed 5G bands"—specifically 3.45–3.55 GHz and 3.7–3.98 GHz. It said its proposal would expand the CBRS band's total size from 150 MHz to 200 MHz by relocating it to 3.1–3.3 GHz.</p>
<p>Keefe John, CEO of a Wisconsin-based wireless home Internet provider called Ethoplex, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/great-spectrum-heist-how-att-corporate-elites-plotting-keefe-john-7o0sc/">argued</a> that "AT&amp;T and its cabal of telecom giants" are "scheming to rip this resource from the hands of small operators and hand it over to their 5G empire. This is nothing less than a brazen theft of America's digital future, and we must fight back with unrelenting resolve."</p>
<p>John is vice chairperson of the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (WISPA), which represents small ISPs and is a member of Spectrum for the Future. He wrote that CBRS is a "vital spectrum band that has become the lifeblood of rural connectivity" because small ISPs use it to deliver fixed wireless Internet service to underserved areas.</p>
<p>John called the AT&amp;T proposal "a deliberate scheme to kneecap WISPs, whose equipment, painstakingly deployed, would be rendered obsolete in the lower band." Instead of moving CBRS from one band to another, John said CBRS should stay on its current spectrum and expand into additional spectrum "to ensure small providers have a fighting chance."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>An AT&amp;T spokesperson told Ars that "CBRS can coexist with incumbents in the lower 3 GHz band, and with such high demand for spectrum, it should. Thinking creatively about how to most efficiently use scarce spectrum to meet crucial needs is simply good public policy."</p>
<p>AT&amp;T said that an auction "would provide reimbursement for costs associated with" moving CBRS users to other spectrum and that "the Department of Defense has already stated that incumbents in the lower 3 GHz could share with low-power commercial uses."</p>
<p>"Having a low-power use sandwiched between two high-power use cases is an inefficient use of spectrum that doesn't make sense. Our proposal would fix that inefficiency," AT&amp;T said.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has previously said that under its proposal, CBRS priority license holders "would have the choice of relocating to the new CBRS band, accepting vouchers they can use toward bidding on new high-power licenses, or receiving a cash payment in exchange for the relinquishment of their priority rights."</p>
<h2>Democrat warns of threat to naval operations</h2>
<p>Reallocating spectrum could require the Navy to move from the current CBRS band to the lower part of 3 GHz. US Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) sent a <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/2B29105E-75BF-4D7B-B6B2-7AEC58053698">letter</a> urging the Department of Defense to avoid major changes, saying the current sharing arrangement "allows the Navy to continue using high-power surveillance and targeting radars to protect vessels and our coasts, while also enabling commercial use of the band when and where the Navy does not need access."</p>
<p>Moving CBRS users would "disrupt critical naval operations and homeland defense" and "undermine an innovative ecosystem of commercial wireless technology that will be extremely valuable for robotic manufacturing, precision agriculture, ubiquitous connectivity in large indoor spaces, and private wireless networks," Cantwell wrote.</p>
<p>Cantwell said she is also concerned that "a substantial number of military radar systems that operate in the lower 3 GHz band" will be endangered by moving CBRS. She pointed out that the DoD's September 2023 report said the 3.1 GHz range has "unique spectrum characteristics" that "provide long detection ranges, tracking accuracy, and discrimination capability required for DoD radar systems." The spectrum "is low enough in the frequency range to maintain a high-power aperture capability in a transportable system" and "high enough in the frequency range that a sufficient angular accuracy can be maintained for a radar track function for a fire control capability," the DoD report said.</p>

<h2>Spectrum for the Future members</h2>
<p>In addition to joining the cable industry in Spectrum for the Future, public interest groups are fighting for CBRS on their own. Public Knowledge and OTI teamed up with the American Library Association, the Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society, the Schools Health &amp; Libraries Broadband (SHLB) Coalition, and others in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1107113725696/1">November 2024 FCC filing</a> that praised the pro-consumer virtues of CBRS.</p>
<p>"CBRS has been the most successful innovation in wireless technology in the last decade," the groups said. They accused the big three mobile carriers of "seeking to cripple CBRS as a band that promotes not only innovation, but also competition."</p>
<p>These advocacy groups are interested in helping cable companies and small home Internet providers compete against the big three mobile carriers because that opens new options for consumers. But the groups also point to many other use cases for CBRS, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>CBRS has encouraged the deployment of "open networks" designed to host users needing greater flexibility and control than that offered by traditional CMRS [Commercial Mobile Radio Services] providers, at higher power and with greater interference protection than possible using unlicensed spectrum. Manufacturing campuses (such as John Deere and Dow Chemical), transit hubs (Miami International Airport, Port of Los Angeles), supply chain and logistic centers (US Marine Corps), sporting arenas (Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center), school districts and libraries (Fresno Unified School District, New York Public Library) are all examples of a growing trend toward local spectrum access fueling purpose-built private LTE/5G networks for a wide variety of use cases.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SHLB told Ars that "CBRS spectrum plays a critical role in helping anchor institutions like schools and libraries connect their communities, especially in rural and underserved areas where traditional broadband options may be limited. A number of our members rely on access to shared and unlicensed spectrum to deliver remote learning and essential digital services, often at low or no cost to the user."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Spectrum for the Future's members also include companies that sell services to help customers deploy CBRS networks, as well as entities like Miami International Airport that deploy their own CBRS-based private cellular networks. The NCTA featured Miami International Airport's private network in a recent <a href="https://www.ncta.com/news/cbrs-at-work-miami-international-airport/">press release</a>, saying that CBRS helped the airport "deliver more reliable connectivity for visitors while also powering a robust Internet of Things network to keep the airport running smoothly."</p>
<p>Spectrum for the Future doesn't list any staff on its website. Media requests are routed to a third-party public relations firm. An employee of the public relations firm declined to answer our questions about how Spectrum for the Future is structured and operated but said it is "a member-driven coalition with a wide range of active supporters and contributors, including innovators, anchor institutions, and technology companies."</p>
<p>Spectrum for the Future appears to be organized by Salt Point Strategies, a public affairs consulting firm. Salt Point Spectrum Policy Analyst David Wright is described as Spectrum for the Future's policy director in an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1022061330085/1">FCC filing</a>. We reached out to Wright and didn't receive a response.</p>

<p>The Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill," approved by the House, is one area of interest for both sides of the CBRS debate. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1">bill</a> would restore the FCC's expired authority to auction spectrum and require new auctions. One question is whether the bill will simply require the FCC to auction a minimum amount of spectrum or if it will require specific bands to be auctioned.</p>
<p>WISPA provided us with a statement about the version that passed the House, saying the group is glad it "excludes the 5.9 GHz and 6 GHz bands from its call to auction off 600 megahertz of spectrum" but worried because the bill "does not exclude the widely used and previously auctioned Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band from competitive bidding, leaving it vulnerable to sale and/or major disruption."</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>WISPA said that "spectrum auctions are typically designed to favor large players" and "cut out small and rural providers who operate on the front lines of the digital divide." WISPA said that over 60 percent of its members "use CBRS to deliver high-quality broadband to hard-to-serve and previously unserved Americans."</p>

<p>On June 5, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/6/chairman-cruz-releases-budget-reconciliation-text">released the text</a> of the Senate Commerce Committee proposal, which also does not exclude the 3550–3700 MHz from potential auctions. Pai and AT&amp;T issued statements praising Cruz's bill.</p>
<p>Pai said that Cruz's "bold approach answers President Trump's call to keep all options on the table and provides the President with full flexibility to identify the right bands to meet surging consumer demand, safeguard our economic competitiveness, and protect national security." AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.attconnects.com/att-statement-on-senate-commerce-budget-reconciliation-text/">said</a> that "by renewing the FCC's auction authority and creating a pipeline of mid-band spectrum, the Senate is taking a strong step toward meeting consumers' insatiable demand for mobile data."</p>
<p>The NCTA said it welcomed the plan to restore the FCC's auction authority but urged lawmakers to "reject the predictable calls from large mobile carriers that seek to cripple competition and new services being offered over existing Wi-Fi and CBRS bands."</p>
<h2>Licensed, unlicensed, and in-between</h2>
<p>Spectrum is generally made available on a licensed or unlicensed basis. Wireless carriers pay big bucks for licenses that grant them exclusive use of spectrum bands on which they deploy nationwide cellular networks. Unlicensed spectrum—like the bands used in Wi-Fi—can be used by anyone without a license as long as they follow rules that prevent interference with other users and services.</p>
<p>The FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-rules-innovative-spectrum-sharing-35-ghz-band">issued rules for the CBRS band</a> in 2015 during the Obama administration, using a somewhat different kind of system. The FCC rules allow "for dynamic spectrum sharing in the 3.5 GHz band between the Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial spectrum users," the National Telecommunications and Information Administration <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/press-release/2024/ntia-fcc-navy-work-expand-innovative-35-ghz-spectrum-sharing-framework">notes</a>. "DoD users have protected, prioritized use of the spectrum. When the government isn't using the airwaves, companies and the public can gain access through a tiered framework."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Instead of a binary licensed-versus-unlicensed system, the FCC implemented a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/35-ghz-band/35-ghz-band-overview">three-tiered system</a> of access. Tier 1 is for incumbent users of the band, including federal users and fixed satellite service. Tier 1 users receive protection against harmful interference from Tier 2 and Tier 3 users.</p>
<p>Tier 2 of CBRS consists of Priority Access Licenses (PALs) that are distributed on a county-by-county basis through competitive bidding. Tier 2 users get interference protection from users of Tier 3, which is made available in a manner similar to unlicensed spectrum.</p>
<p>Tier 3 "is licensed-by-rule to permit open, flexible access to the band for the widest possible group of potential users," the FCC says. Tier 3 users can operate throughout the 3550–3700 MHz band but "must not cause harmful interference to Incumbent Access users or Priority Access Licensees and must accept interference from these users. GAA users also have no expectation of interference protection from other GAA users."</p>
<p>The public interest groups' November 2024 filing with the FCC said the unique approach to spectrum sharing "allow[s] all would-be users to operate where doing so does not threaten harmful interference" and provides a happy medium between high-powered operations in exclusively licensed spectrum bands and low-powered operations in unlicensed spectrum.</p>
<p>CTIA wants the ability to send higher-power signals in the band, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1106313426200/1">arguing</a> that full-power wireless transmissions would help the US match the efforts of other countries "where this spectrum has been identified as central to 5G." The public interest groups urged the FCC to reject the mobile industry proposal to increase power levels, saying it "would disrupt and diminish the expanding diversity of GAA users and use cases that represent the central purpose of CBRS's innovative three-tier, low-power and coordinated sharing framework."</p>
<h2>Pai helped carriers as FCC chair</h2>
<p>The FCC's original plan for PALs during the Obama administration was to auction them off for individual Census tracts, small areas containing between 1,200 and 8,000 people each. During President Trump's first term, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/10/ajit-pais-5g-plans-make-it-harder-for-small-isps-to-deploy-broadband/">Pai FCC granted a CTIA request</a> to boost the size of license areas from census tracts to counties, making it harder for small companies to win at auction.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>The FCC <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-366624A1.pdf">auctioned PALs</a> in 2020, getting bids of nearly $4.6 billion from 228 bidders. The <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/cbrs-spectrum-auction-maps-who-won-what-and-where">biggest winners</a> were Verizon, Dish Network, Charter, Comcast, and Cox.</p>
<p>Although Verizon uses CBRS for parts of its network, that doesn't mean it's on the same side as cable users in the policy debate. Verizon <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/11071224022983/1">urged the FCC</a> to increase the allowed power levels in the band. Dish owner EchoStar also <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1206040236805/1">asked</a> for power increases. Cable companies <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/120632176086/1">oppose</a> raising the power levels, with the NCTA saying that doing so would "jeopardize the continued availability of the 3.5 GHz band for lower-power operations" and harm both federal and non-federal users.</p>

<p>As head of CTIA, one of Pai's main jobs is to obtain more licensed spectrum for the exclusive use of AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and other mobile companies that his group represents. Pai's Wall Street Journal op-ed said that "traffic on wireless networks is expected to triple by 2029," driven by "AI, 5G home broadband and other emerging technologies." Pai cited a <a href="https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Looming-Spectrum-Crisis-Accenture.pdf">study</a> commissioned by CTIA to argue that "wireless networks will be unable to meet a quarter of peak demand in as little as two years."</p>
<p>Spectrum for the Future countered that Pai "omits that the overwhelming share of this traffic will travel over Wi-Fi, not cellular networks." CTIA told Ars that "the Ericsson studies we use for traffic growth projections only consider demand over commercial networks using licensed spectrum."</p>
<p>Spectrum for the Future pointed to statements made by the CEOs of wireless carriers that seem to contradict Pai's warnings of a spectrum shortage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Pai cites a CTIA-funded study to claim "wireless networks will be unable to meet a quarter of peak demand in as little as two years." If that's true, then why are his biggest members' CEOs telling Wall Street the exact opposite?</p>
<p>Verizon's CEO <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/2024-12/UBS_Conference_Transcript_120924.pdf">insists</a> he's sitting on "a generation of spectrum"—"years and years and years" of spectrum capacity still to deploy. The CEO of Verizon's consumer group goes even further, insisting they have "<a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/2024-05/MN_Conference_Transcript_051424.pdf">almost unlimited spectrum</a>." T-Mobile agrees, <a href="https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/t-mobile-ceo-bigs-spectrum-ubs-event">bragging</a> that it has "only deployed 60 percent of our mid-band spectrum on 5G," leaving "lots of spectrum we haven't put into the fight yet."</p></blockquote>
<h2>Battle could last for years</h2>
<p>Spectrum for the Future also scoffed at Pai's comparison of the US to China. Pai's op-ed said that China "has accelerated its efforts to dominate in wireless and will soon boast more than four times the amount of commercial midband spectrum than the US." Pai added that "China isn't only deploying 5G domestically. It's exporting its spectrum policies, its equipment vendors (such as Huawei and ZTE), and its Communist Party-centric vision of innovation to the rest of the world."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Spectrum for the Future responded that "China's spectrum policy goes all-in on exclusive-license frameworks, such as 5G, because they limit spectrum access to just a small handful of regime-aligned telecom companies complicit in Beijing's censorship regime... America's global wireless leadership, by contrast, is fueled by spectrum innovations like unlicensed Wi-Fi and CBRS spectrum sharing, whose hardware markets are dominated by American and allied companies."</p>
<p>Spectrum for the Future also said that Pai and CTIA "blasting China for 'exporting its spectrum policies'—while asking the US to adopt the same approach—is stunning hypocrisy."</p>
<p>CTIA's statement to Ars disputed Spectrum for the Future's description. "The system of auctioning spectrum licenses was pioneered in America but is not used in China. China does, however, allocate unlicensed spectrum in a similar manner to the United States," CTIA told Ars.</p>
<p>The lobbying battle and potential legal war that has Pai and CTIA lined up against the "everybody but Big Mobile" wireless coalition could last throughout Trump's second term. Levin's research note about the DoD proposal said, "the path from adoption to auction to making the spectrum available to the winners of an auction is likely to be at least three years." The fight could go on a lot longer if "current licensees object and litigate," Levin wrote.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">My input stream is full of it: Fear and loathing and cheerleading and prognosticating on what generative AI means and whether
    it’s Good or Bad and what we should be doing. All the channels: Blogs and peer-reviewed papers and social-media posts and
    business-news stories. So there’s lots of AI angst out there, but this is mine.
    I think the following is a bit unique because it focuses on cost, working backward from there. As for the
    genAI tech itself, I guess I’m a moderate; there is a there there, it’s not all slop. But first…</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>The rent is too damn high</span> · 
I promise I’ll talk about genAI applications but let’s start with money. <em>Lots</em> of money, big numbers! For example,
    venture-cap startup money pouring into AI, which as of now apparently adds up to
    <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-nvidia-played-a-central-role-in-the-306-billion-ai-startup-boom-195741749.html">$306
    billion</a>. And that’s just startups; Among the giants, Google alone
    <a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/google-cloud-generative-ai-data-center-capacity-buildouts/739357/">apparently plans
    $75B</a> in capital expenditure on AI
    infrastructure, and they represent maybe a quarter at most of cloud capex. You think those are big numbers? McKinsey offers
    <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-cost-of-compute-a-7-trillion-dollar-race-to-scale-data-centers">The cost of compute: A $7 trillion race to scale data centers</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, lots of people are
    wondering when and where the revenue will be to pay for it all. There’s one thing we know for sure:
    The pro-genAI voices are fueled by hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fear and desire; fear that it’ll
    never pay off and desire for a piece of the money. Can you begin to imagine the pressure for revenue that investors and
    executives and middle managers are under?</p>

<p><a href="https://cosocial.ca/@timbray/114572118905328515">Here’s an example</a> of the kind of debate that ensues.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/-big/Anil-MCP.jpg.html"><img alt="Anil Dash on Mastodon, on MCP vs the Fediverse" title="Anil Dash on Mastodon, on MCP vs the Fediverse" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/Anil-MCP.png"></a></p>
<p>“MCP” is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol">Model Context Protocol</a>, used for communicating between LLM
    software and other systems and services.<br>
I have no opinion as to its quality or utility.</p>
<p>I suggest that when you’re getting a pitch for genAI technology, you should have that greed and
    fear in the back of your mind. Or maybe at the front.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>And that’s just the money</span> · 
For some reason, I don’t hear much any more about the environmental cost of genAI, the gigatons of carbon pouring out of the
    system, imperilling my children’s future. Let’s please not ignore that; let’s read things like
    <a href="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-center-energy-needs-are-upending-power-grids-and-threatening-the-climate">Data
    Center Energy Needs Could Upend Power Grids and Threaten the Climate</a> and let’s make sure every freaking conversation about
    genAI acknowledges this grievous cost.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at a few sectors where genAI is said to be a big deal: Coding, teaching, and professional
    communication. To keep things balanced, I’ll start in a space where I have kind things to say.</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>Coding</span> · 
Wow, is my tribe ever melting down. The pro- and anti-genAI factions are hurling polemical thunderbolts at each
    other, and I mean extra hot and pointy ones. For example, here are 5600 words entitled
    <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2025/06/i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now.html">I Think I’m Done Thinking About genAI
    For Now</a>. Well-written words, too.</p>

<p>But, while I have a lot of sympathy for the contras and am sickened by some of the promoters, at the moment
    I’m mostly in tune with Thomas Ptacek’s
    <a href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/">My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts</a>. It’s long and (fortunately) well-written
    and I (mostly) find it hard to disagree with.</p>

<p>it’s as simple as this: I keep hearing talented programmers
    whose integrity I trust tell me “Yeah, LLMs are helping me get shit done.” The probability that they’re all lying or being
    fooled seems very low.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I note an absence of concern for cost and carbon in these conversations. Which is unacceptable. But let’s
    move on.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that I learned two useful things from Ptacek’s essay that I hadn’t really understood. First, the “agentic”
    architecture of programming tools: You ask the agent to create code and it asks the LLM, which will sometimes 
    hallucinate; the agent will observe that it doesn’t compile or makes all the unit tests fail, discards it, and re-prompts. If
    it takes the agent module 25 prompts to generate code that while imperfect is at least correct, who cares?</p>

<p>Second lesson, and to be fair this is just anecdata: It feels like the Go programming language is especially well-suited to
    LLM-driven automation. It’s small, has a large standard library, and a culture that has strong shared idioms for doing almost
    anything. Anyhow, we’ll find out if this early impression stands up to longer and wider industry experience.</p>

<p>Turning our attention back to cost, let’s assume that eventually all or most developers become somewhat LLM-assisted. Are
    there enough of them, and will they pay enough, to cover all that investment?  Especially given that models that are both
    open-source and excellent are certain to proliferate? Seems dubious.</p>

<p>Suppose that, as Ptacek suggests, LLMs/agents allow us to automate the tedious low-intellectual-effort parts of our
    job. Should we be concerned about how junior developers learn to get past that “easy stuff” and on the way to senior skills?
    That seems a very good question, so…</p>

<p id="p-10"><span>Learning</span> · 
Quite likely you’ve already seen Jason Koebler’s
    <a href="https://www.404media.co/teachers-are-not-ok-ai-chatgpt/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter">Teachers Are Not OK</a>, a
    frankly horrifying survey of genAI’s impact on secondary and tertiary education. It is a tale of unrelieved grief and pain
    and wreckage. Since genAI isn’t going to go away and students aren’t going to stop being lazy, 
    it seems like we’re going to re-invent the way people teach and learn.</p>

<p>The stories of students furiously deploying genAI to avoid the effort of actually, you know,
    learning, are sad. Even sadder  are those of genAI-crazed administrators leaning on faculty to become more efficient and
    “businesslike” by using it.</p>

<p>I really don’t think there’s a coherent pro-genAI case to be made in the education context.</p>

<p id="p-11"><span>Professional communication</span> · 
If you want to use LLMs to automate communication with your family or friends or lovers, there’s nothing I can say that will
    help you. So let’s restrict this to conversation and reporting around work and private projects and voluntarism and so on.</p>

<p>I’m
    pretty sure this is where the people who think they’re going to make big money with AI think it’s going to come from.
    If you’re interested in that thinking,
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Der8WWGeVxdOWx37bMV_nj9N1tUAVcvSSRa6qxKx75g/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1">here’s
    a sample</a>; a slide deck by a Keith Riegert for the book-publishing business which, granted, is a bit stagnant and a whole lot
    overconcentrated these days. I suspect scrolling through it will produce a strong emotional reaction for quite a few readers here.
    It’s also useful in that it talks specifically about costs.</p>

<p>That is for corporate-branded output. What about personal or internal professional communication; by which I mean emails and
    sales reports and committee drafts and project pitches and so on? I’m pretty negative about this. If your email or pitch
    doc or whatever needs to be summarized, or if it has the colorless affectless error-prone polish of 2025’s LLMs, I would
    probably discard it unread.
    I already found the switch to turn off Gmail’s attempts to summarize my emails.</p>

<p>What’s the genAI world’s equivalent of “Tl;dr”? I’m thinking “TA;dr” (A for AI)
    or “Tg;dr” (g for genAI) or just “LLM:dr”.</p>

<p>And this vision of everyone using genAI to amplify their output and everyone else using it to summarize and filter
    their input feels simply perverse.</p>

<p>Here’s what I think is 
    <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@codinghorror/114606355212363074">an important finding</a>, ably summarized by Jeff Atwood:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/-big/Dare-Jeff.jpg.html"><img alt="Dare Obasanjo and Jeff Atwood on how to survive AI" title="Dare Obasanjo and Jeff Atwood on how to survive AI" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/06/06/Dare-Jeff.png"></a></p>
<p>Seriously, since LLMs by design emit streams that are optimized for plausibility and for harmony with the model’s
    training base, in an AI-centric world there’s a powerful incentive to say things that are implausible, that are out of tune,
    that are, bluntly, weird. So there’s one upside.</p>

<p>And let’s go back to cost. Are the prices in Riegert’s slide deck going to pay for trillions in capex?
    Another example: My family has a Google workplace account, and the price just went up from $6/user/month to
    $7. The announcement from Google emphasized that this was related to the added value provided by Gemini. Is $1/user/month gonna
    make this tech make business sense?</p>

<p id="p-13"><span>What I can and can’t buy</span> · 
I can sorta buy the premise that there are genAI productivity boosts to be had in the code space and maybe some other
    specialized domains.  I can’t buy for a second that genAI is anything but toxic for anything education-related.  On the
    business-communications side, it’s damn well gonna be tried because billions of dollars and many management careers depend on
    it paying off. We’ll see but I’m skeptical.</p>

<p>On the money side? I don’t see how the math and the capex work. And all the time, I think about the carbon that’s poisoning
    the planet my children have to live on.</p>

<p>I think that the best we can hope for is the eventual financial meltdown leaving a few useful islands of things that
    are actually useful at prices that make sense.</p>

<p>And in a decade or so, I can see business-section stories about all the big data center shells that were never filled in,
    standing there empty, looking for another use. It’s gonna be tough, what can you do with buildings that have no windows?</p>
