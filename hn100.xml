<p>The FTC declined to comment on the lawsuits today. The agency's rule is not enforced yet, as it is scheduled to take full effect 180 days after publication in the Federal Register.</p>
<h2>Cable firms don’t want canceling to be easy</h2>
<p>The NCTA cable lobby group, which represents companies like Comcast and Charter, have complained about the rule's impact on their ability to talk customers out of canceling. NCTA CEO Michael Powell <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/cable-firms-to-ftc-we-shouldnt-have-to-let-users-cancel-service-with-a-click/">claimed during a January 2024 hearing</a> that "a consumer may easily misunderstand the consequences of canceling and it may be imperative that they learn about better options" and that the rule's disclosure and consent requirements raise "First Amendment issues."</p>
<p>The Interactive Advertising Bureau argued at the same hearing that the rule would "restrict innovation without any corresponding benefit" and "constrain companies from being able to adapt their offerings to the needs of their customers."</p>
<p>The FTC held firm, adopting its proposed rule without major changes. In addition to the click-to-cancel provision, the FTC set out other requirements for "negative option" features in which a consumer's silence or failure to take action to reject or cancel an agreement is interpreted by the seller as acceptance of an offer.</p>
<p>The FTC said its rule "prohibits misrepresentations of any material fact made while marketing using negative option features; requires sellers to provide important information prior to obtaining consumers' billing information and charging consumers; [and] requires sellers to obtain consumers' unambiguously affirmative consent to the negative option feature prior to charging them."</p>
<p>The FTC will have to defend its authority to issue the rule in court. The agency decision cites authority under Section 18 of the FTC Act to make "rules that define with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive" and "prescribe requirements for the purpose of preventing these unfair or deceptive acts and practices."</p>
<p>"Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription," FTC Chair Lina Khan said. "The FTC's rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><p>React Native 0.76 with the New Architecture by default is now available on npm!</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/release-0.76-new-architecture">0.76 release blog post</a>, we shared a list of significant changes included in this version. In this post, we provide an overview of the New Architecture and how it shapes the future of React Native.</p>
<p>The New Architecture adds full support for modern React features, including <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-suspense-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suspense</a>, <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-feature-transitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transitions</a>, <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-feature-automatic-batching" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automatic batching</a>, and <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useLayoutEffect</code></a>. The New Architecture also includes new <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/turbo-native-modules-introduction">Native Module</a> and <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/fabric-native-components-introduction">Native Component</a> systems that let you write type-safe code with direct access to native interfaces without a bridge.</p>
<p>This release is the result of a ground-up rewrite of React Native we’ve been working on since 2018, and we’ve taken extra care to make the New Architecture a gradual migration for most apps. In 2021, we created <a href="https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the New Architecture Working Group</a> to collaborate with the community on ensuring a smooth upgrade experience for the entire React ecosystem.</p>
<p>Most apps will be able to adopt React Native 0.76 with the same level of effort as any other release. The most popular React Native libraries already support the New Architecture. The New Architecture also includes an automatic interoperability layer to enable backward compatibility with libraries targeting the old architecture.</p>
<p>Over the past several years of development, our team has publicly shared our vision for the New Architecture. If you missed any of these talks, check them out here:</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-new-architecture">What is the New Architecture<a href="#what-is-the-new-architecture" aria-label="Direct link to What is the New Architecture" title="Direct link to What is the New Architecture">​</a></h2>
<p>The New Architecture is a complete rewrite of the major systems that underpin React Native, including how components are rendered, how JavaScript abstractions communicates with native abstractions, and how work is scheduled across different threads. Although most users should not have to think about how these systems work, these changes bring improvements and new capabilities.</p>
<p>In the old architecture, React Native communicated with the native platform using an asynchronous bridge. To render a component or call a native function, React Native needed to serialize and enqueue native functions calls with the bridge, which would be processed asynchronously. The benefit of this architecture is that the main thread was never blocked for rendering updates or handling native module function calls, since all work was done on a background thread.</p>
<p>However, users expect immediate feedback to interactions to feel like a native app. This means some updates need to render synchronously in response to user input, potentially interrupting any in-progress render. Since the old architecture was only asynchronous, we needed to rewrite it to allow for both asynchronous and synchronous updates.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the old architecture, serializing function calls over the bridge quickly became a bottleneck, especially for frequent updates or large objects. This made it hard for apps to achieve 60+ FPS reliably. There were also synchronization issues: when the JavaScript and native layer got out of sync, it was impossible to reconcile them synchronously, resulting bugs like lists showing frames of empty space and visual UI jumps due to intermediate states rendering.</p>
<p>Finally, since the old architecture kept a single copy of the UI using the native hierarchy, and mutated that copy in place, layout could only be computed on a single thread. This made it impossible to process urgent updates like user inputs, and layout could not be read synchronously, such as reading in a layout effect to update the position of a tooltip.</p>
<p>All of these problems meant that it was not possible to properly support React’s concurrent features. To solve these problems, the New Architecture includes four main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The New Native Module System</li>
<li>The New Renderer</li>
<li>The Event Loop</li>
<li>Removing the Bridge</li>
</ul>
<p>The New Module system allows the React Native Renderer to have synchronous access to the native layer, which allows it to handle events, schedule updates, and read layout both asynchronously and synchronously. The new Native Modules are also lazily loaded by default, giving apps a significant performance gain.</p>
<p>The New Renderer can handle multiple in progress trees across multiple threads, which allows React to process multiple concurrent update priorities, either on the main thread or a background thread. It also supports reading layout from multiple threads synchronously or asynchronously, to support more responsive UIs without jank.</p>
<p>The new Event Loop can process tasks on the JavaScript thread in a well-defined order. This allows React to interrupt rendering to process events so urgent user events can take priority over lower priority UI transitions. The Event Loop also aligns with web specifications, so we can support for browser features like microtasks, <code>MutationObserver</code>, and <code>IntersectionObserver</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, removing the bridge allows for faster startup and direct communication between JavaScript and the native runtime, so that the cost of switching work is minimized. This also allows for better error reporting, debugging, and reducing crashes from undefined behavior.</p>
<p>The New Architecture is now ready to be used in production. It is already used at scale at Meta in the Facebook app and in other products. We successfully used React Native and the New Architecture in the Facebook and Instagram app we developed for our <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/10/02/android/react-at-meta-connect-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quest devices</a>.</p>
<p>Our partners have already been using the New Architecture in production for months now: have a look at these success stories by <a href="https://blog.swmansion.com/sunrising-new-architecture-in-the-new-expensify-app-729d237a02f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expensify</a> and <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/product/engineering/how-kraken-fixed-performance-issues-via-incremental-adoption-of-the-react-native-new-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kraken</a>, and give <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/releases/tag/1.92.0-na-rc.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueSky</a> a shot with their new release.</p>
<h3 id="new-native-modules">New Native Modules<a href="#new-native-modules" aria-label="Direct link to New Native Modules" title="Direct link to New Native Modules">​</a></h3>
<p>The new Native Module System is a major rewrite of how JavaScript and the native platform communicate. It’s written entirely in C++, which unlocks many new capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronous access to and from the native runtime</li>
<li>Type safety between JavaScript and native code</li>
<li>Code sharing across platforms</li>
<li>Lazy module loading by default</li>
</ul>
<p>In the new Native Module system, JavaScript and the native layer can now synchronously communicate with each other through the JavaScript Interface (JSI), without the need to use an asynchronous bridge. This means your custom Native Modules can now synchronously call a function, return a value, and pass that value back to another Native Module function.</p>
<p>In the old architecture, in order to handle a response from native function calls, you needed to provide a callback, and the value returned needed to be serializable:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// ❌ Sync callback from Native Module</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>nativeModule</span><span>.</span><span>getValue</span><span>(</span><span>value </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// ❌ value cannot reference a native object</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  nativeModule</span><span>.</span><span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the New Architecture, you can make synchronous calls to native functions:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// ✅ Sync response from Native Module</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>const</span><span> value </span><span>=</span><span> nativeModule</span><span>.</span><span>getValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>// ✅ value can be a reference to a native object</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>nativeModule</span><span>.</span><span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>With the New Architecture, you can finally leverage the full power of a C++ native implementation while still accessing it from JavaScript/TypeScript APIs. The New Module System supports <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/the-new-architecture/pure-cxx-modules">modules written in C++</a> so you can write your module once, and it works across all platforms, including Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS. Implementing modules in C++ allows for more fine-grained memory management and performance optimizations.</p>
<p>Additionally, with <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/the-new-architecture/what-is-codegen">Codegen</a>, your modules can define a strongly typed contract between the JavaScript layer and the native layer. From our experience, cross-boundary type errors are one of the most common sources of crashes in cross-platform apps. Codegen lets you overcome those problems while also generating boilerplate code for you.</p>
<p>Finally, modules are now lazily loaded: they are loaded in memory only when they’re effectively needed rather than at startup. This reduces the app startup time and keeps it low as the application grows in complexity.</p>
<p>Popular libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-native-mmkv</a> have already seen benefits from migrating to the new Native Modules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The new Native Modules greatly simplified setup, autolinking, and initialization for <code>react-native-mmkv</code>. Thanks to the New Architecture, <code>react-native-mmkv</code> is now a pure C++ Native Module, which allows it to work on any platform. The new Codegen allows MMKV to be fully type-safe, which fixed a long-standing <code>NullPointerReference</code> issue by enforcing null-safety, and being able to call Native Module functions synchronously allowed us to replace custom JSI access with the new Native Module API.”</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="new-renderer">New Renderer<a href="#new-renderer" aria-label="Direct link to New Renderer" title="Direct link to New Renderer">​</a></h3>
<p>We've also completely rewritten the Native Renderer, adding several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates can be rendered on different threads at different priorities.</li>
<li>Layout can be read synchronously and across different threads.</li>
<li>The renderer is written in C++ and shared across all platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The updated Native Renderer now stores the view hierarchy in an immutable tree structure. This means that the UI is stored in a way that cannot be changed directly, allowing for thread-safe processing of updates. This allows it to handle multiple in-progress trees, each representing a different version of the user interface. As a result, updates can be rendered in the background without blocking the UI (such as during transitions) or on the main thread (in response to user input).</p>
<p>By supporting multiple threads, React can interrupt a low-priority update to render an urgent one, such as those generated by user inputs, and then resume the low-priority update as needed. The new renderer can also read layout information synchronously and across different threads. This enables background computation for low-priority updates and synchronous reads when needed, such as repositioning a tooltip.</p>
<p>Finally, rewriting the renderer in C++ allows it to be shared across all platforms. This ensures that the same code runs on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and any other React Native-supported platform, providing consistent rendering capabilities without needing re-implementation for each platform.</p>
<p>This is a significant step towards our <a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/08/26/many-platform-vision">Many Platform Vision</a>. For example, View Flattening was an Android-only optimisation to avoid deep layout trees. The new renderer, with shared C++ core, <a href="https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions/110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brings this feature to iOS</a>. This optimisation is automatic and does not require setup, it comes for free with the shared renderer.</p>
<p>With these changes, React Native now fully supports Concurrent React features like Suspense and Transitions, making it easier to build complex user interfaces that respond quickly to user input without jank, delays, or visual jumps. In the future, we will leverage these new capabilities to bring more improvements to built-in components such as FlatList and TextInput.</p>
<p>Popular libraries like <a href="https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reanimated</a> are already taking advantage of the New Renderer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Reanimated 4, currently in development, introduces a new animation engine that works directly with the New Renderer, allowing it to handle animations and manage layout across different threads. The New Renderer’s design is what truly enables these features to be built without relying on numerous workarounds. Moreover, because it’s implemented in C++ and shared across platforms, large portions of Reanimated can be written once, reducing platform-specific issues, minimizing the codebase, and streamlining adoption for out-of-tree platforms.”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/kzzzf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Krzysztof Magiera</a>, creator of <a href="https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reanimated</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-event-loop">The Event Loop<a href="#the-event-loop" aria-label="Direct link to The Event Loop" title="Direct link to The Event Loop">​</a></h3>
<p>The New Architecture allowed us to implement a well-defined event loop processing model, as described in this <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0744-well-defined-event-loop.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC</a>. This RFC follows the specifications described in the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML Standard</a>, and it describes how React Native should perform tasks on the JavaScript thread.</p>
<p>Implementing a well-defined event loop closes gaps between React DOM and React Native: the behavior of a React Native application is now closer to the behavior of a React DOM application, making it easier to learn once, and write anywhere.</p>
<p>The event loop brings many benefits to React Native:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to interrupt rendering to process events and tasks</li>
<li>Closer alignment with web specifications</li>
<li>Foundation for more browser features</li>
</ul>
<p>With the Event Loop, React is able to predictably order updates and events. This allows React to interrupt a low priority update with an urgent user event, and the New Renderer allows us to render those updates independently.</p>
<p>The Event Loops also aligns the behavior of events and task like timers with web specifications, which means React Native works more like what users are familiar with in the Web, and allows for better code sharing between React DOM and React Native.</p>
<p>It also allows for the implementation of more compliant browser features like microtasks, <code>MutationObserver</code>, and <code>IntersectionObserver</code>. These features are not ready to use in React Native yet, but we are working on bringing them to you in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, the Event Loop and the New Renderer changes to support reading layout synchronously allow React Native to add proper support for <code>useLayoutEffect</code> to read layout information synchronously and update the UI in the same frame. This allows you to position elements correctly before they are displayed to the user.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here#uselayouteffect"><code>useLayoutEffect</code></a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="removing-the-bridge">Removing the Bridge<a href="#removing-the-bridge" aria-label="Direct link to Removing the Bridge" title="Direct link to Removing the Bridge">​</a></h3>
<p>In the New Architecture, we've also fully removed React Native's dependency on the bridge, replacing it with direct, efficient communication between JavaScript and native code using JSI:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://reactnative.dev/assets/images/0.76-bridge-diagram-a653d794d04871e5b7a026e35d8edf03.png" width="1143" height="736"></p>
<p>Removing the bridge improves startup time by avoiding bridge initialization. For example, in the old architecture, in order to provide global methods to JavaScript, we would need to initialize a module in JavaScript on startup, causing a small delay in app startup time:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// ❌ Slow initialization</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>NativeTimingModule</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'NativeTimingModule'</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>global</span><span>.</span><span>setTimeout</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>timer</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>NativeTimingModule</span><span>.</span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>timer</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>// App.js</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the New Architecture, we can directly bind methods from C++:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// ✅ Initialize directly in C++</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>runtime</span><span>.</span><span>global</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>setProperty</span><span>(</span><span>runtime</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"setTimeout"</span><span>,</span><span> createTimer</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// App.js</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rewrite also improves error reporting, particularly for JavaScript crashes at startup, and reduces crashes from undefined behavior. If crashes occur, the new <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/react-native-devtools">React Native DevTools</a> simplify debugging and support the New Architecture.</p>
<p>The bridge remains for backward compatibility to support gradual migration to the New Architecture. In the future, we will remove the bridge code completely.</p>
<h3 id="gradual-migration">Gradual Migration<a href="#gradual-migration" aria-label="Direct link to Gradual Migration" title="Direct link to Gradual Migration">​</a></h3>
<p>We expect most apps can upgrade to 0.76 with the same effort as any other release.</p>
<p>When you upgrade to 0.76, the New Architecture and React 18 are enabled by default. However, to use concurrent features and gain the full benefits of the New Architecture, your app and libraries will need to be gradually migrated to fully support the New Architecture.</p>
<p>When you first upgrade, your app will run on the New Architecture with an automatic interoperability layer with the old architecture. For most apps, this will work without any changes, but there are <a href="https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions/237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known limitations</a> with the interop layer, as it does not support accessing custom Shadow Nodes or concurrent features.</p>
<p>To use concurrent features, apps will also need to be updated to support <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#what-is-concurrent-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concurrent React</a> by following the <a href="https://react.dev/reference/rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rules of React</a>. To migrate your JavaScript code to React 18 and its semantics, follow the <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React 18 Upgrade guide</a>.</p>
<p>The overall strategy is to get your application running on the New Architecture without breaking existing code. You can then gradually migrate your app at your own pace. For new surfaces that have migrated all modules to the New Architecture, you can start using concurrent features immediately. For existing surfaces, you may need to address some issues and migrate modules before adding concurrent features.</p>
<p>We've collaborated with the most popular React Native libraries to ensure support for the New Architecture. More than 850 libraries are already compatible, including all libraries with over 200K weekly downloads (~10% of downloaded libraries). You can check library compatibility with the New Architecture on the <a href="https://reactnative.directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reactnative.directory</a> website:</p>

<p>Transitions are a new concept in React 18 to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urgent updates</strong> reflect direct interaction, like typing and pressing.</li>
<li><strong>Transition updates</strong> transition the UI from one view to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Urgent updates need immediate response to match our intuitions about how physical objects behave. However, transitions are different because the user doesn’t expect to see every intermediate value on screen. In the New Architecture, React Native is able to support rendering urgent updates and transition updates separately.</p>
<p>Typically, for the best user experience, a single user input should result in both an urgent update and a non-urgent one. Similar to ReactDOM, events like <code>press</code> or <code>change</code> are handled as urgent and rendered immediately. You can use the <code>startTransition</code> API inside an input event to inform React which updates are “transitions” and can be deferred to the background:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>startTransition</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>// Urgent: Show the slider value</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>// Mark any state updates inside as transitions</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>startTransition</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// Transition: Show the results</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>setNumberOfTiles</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Separating urgent events from transitions allows for a more responsive user interface, and a more intuitive user experience.</p>
<p>Here's a comparison of the old architecture without transitions and the new architecture with transitions. Imagine that each tile isn't a trivial view with a background color, but a rich component containing images and other components that are expensive to render. <strong>After</strong> using <code>useTransition</code> you avoid thrashing your app with updates and falling behind.</p>

<h3 id="automatic-batching">Automatic Batching<a href="#automatic-batching" aria-label="Direct link to Automatic Batching" title="Direct link to Automatic Batching">​</a></h3>
<p>When upgrading to the New Architecture, you will benefit from automatic batching from React 18.</p>
<p>Automatic batching allows React to batch together more state updates when rendering to avoid the rendering of intermediate states. This allows React Native to be faster and less susceptible to lags, without any additional code from the developer.</p>

<p>In the old architecture, more intermediate states are rendered, and the UI keeps updating even when the slider stops moving. The New Architecture, renders fewer intermediate states and completes the rendering much sooner thanks to automatically batching the updates.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.75/the-new-architecture/landing-page#support-for-concurrent-renderer-and-features">Support for Concurrent Renderer and Features</a>.</p>
<h3 id="uselayouteffect">useLayoutEffect<a href="#uselayouteffect" aria-label="Direct link to useLayoutEffect" title="Direct link to useLayoutEffect">​</a></h3>
<p>Building on the Event Loop and the ability to read layout synchronously, in the New Architecture we added proper support for <code>useLayoutEffect</code> in React Native.</p>
<p>In the old architecture, you needed to use the asynchronous <code>onLayout</code> event to read layout information of a view (which was also asynchronous). As a result there would be at least one frame where the layout was incorrect until the layout was read and updated, causing issues like tooltips placed in the wrong position:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// ❌ async onLayout after commit</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>const</span><span> onLayout </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>useCallback</span><span>(</span><span>event </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// ❌ async callback to read layout</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  ref</span><span>.</span><span>current</span><span>?.</span><span>measureInWindow</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> y</span><span>,</span><span> width</span><span>,</span><span> height</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>setPosition</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> y</span><span>,</span><span> width</span><span>,</span><span> height</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>// ...</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>ViewWithTooltip</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>onLayout</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>onLayout</span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>ref</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>ref</span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>position</span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>/&gt;</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The New Architecture fixes this by allowing synchronous access to layout information in <code>useLayoutEffect</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// ✅ sync layout effect during commit</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>useLayoutEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// ✅ sync call to read layout</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> rect </span><span>=</span><span> ref</span><span>.</span><span>current</span><span>?.</span><span>getBoundingClientRect</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>setPosition</span><span>(</span><span>rect</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>// ...</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>ViewWithTooltip</span><span> </span><span>ref</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>ref</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>position</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This change allows you to read layout information synchronously and update the UI in the same frame, allowing you to position elements correctly before they are displayed to the user:</p>

<h3 id="full-support-for-suspense">Full Support for Suspense<a href="#full-support-for-suspense" aria-label="Direct link to Full Support for Suspense" title="Direct link to Full Support for Suspense">​</a></h3>
<p>Suspense lets you declaratively specify the loading state for a part of the component tree if it’s not yet ready to be displayed:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Suspense</span><span> </span><span>fallback</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Spinner</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comments</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Suspense</span><span>&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We introduced a limited version of Suspense several years ago, and React 18 added full support. Until now, React Native was not able to support concurrent rendering for Suspense.</p>
<p>The New Architecture includes full support for Suspense introduced in React 18. This means that you can now use Suspense in React Native to handle loading states for your components, and the suspended content will render in the background while the loading state is displayed, giving higher priority to user input on visible content.</p>
<p>For more, see the <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0213-suspense-in-react-18.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC for Suspense in React 18</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-upgrade">How to Upgrade<a href="#how-to-upgrade" aria-label="Direct link to How to Upgrade" title="Direct link to How to Upgrade">​</a></h2>
<p>To upgrade to 0.76, follow the steps in the <a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/release-0.76-new-architecture#upgrade-to-076">release post</a>. Since this release also upgrades to React 18, you will also need to follow the <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React 18 Upgrade guide</a>.</p>
<p>These steps should be enough for most apps to upgrade to the New Architecture thanks to the interop layer with the old architecture. However, to take full advantage of the New Architecture and to start using concurrent features, you will need to migrate your custom Native Modules and Native Components to support the new Native Module and Native Component APIs.</p>
<p>Without migrating your custom Native Modules, you will not get the benefits of shared C++, synchronous method calls, or type-safety from codegen. Without migrating your Native Components, you will not be able to use concurrent features. We recommend migrating all Native Components and Native Modules to the New Architecture as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="apps">Apps<a href="#apps" aria-label="Direct link to Apps" title="Direct link to Apps">​</a></h3>
<p>If you are an app developer, to fully support the New Architecture, you will need to upgrade your libraries, custom Native Components, and custom Native Modules to fully support the New Architecture.</p>
<p>We've collaborated with the most popular React Native libraries to ensure support for the New Architecture. You can check library compatibility with the New Architecture on the <a href="https://reactnative.directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reactnative.directory</a> website.</p>
<p>If any of the libraries your app depends on are not compatible yet, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open an issue with the library and ask the author to migrate to the New Architecture.</li>
<li>If the library is not maintained, consider alternative libraries with the same features.</li>
<li><a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here#opt-out">Opt-out from the New Architecture</a> while those libraries are migrated.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your app has custom Native Modules or custom Native Components, we expect them to work fine, thanks to our <a href="https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions/135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interop layer</a>. However, we recommend upgrading them to the new Native Module and Native Component APIs to fully support the New Architecture and adopt concurrent features.</p>
<p>Please follow these guides to migrate your modules and components to the New Architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/turbo-native-modules-introduction">Native Modules</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/fabric-native-components-introduction">Native Components</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="libraries">Libraries<a href="#libraries" aria-label="Direct link to Libraries" title="Direct link to Libraries">​</a></h3>
<p>If you are a library maintainer, please first test that your library works with the interop layer. If it does not, please open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Architecture Working Group</a>.</p>
<p>To fully support the New Architecture, we recommend migrating your library to the new Native Module and Native Component APIs as soon as possible. This will allow users of your library to take full advantage of the New Architecture and support concurrent features.</p>
<p>You can follow these guides to migrate your modules and components to the New Architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/turbo-native-modules-introduction">Native Modules</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/fabric-native-components-introduction">Native Components</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opt-out">Opt-out<a href="#opt-out" aria-label="Direct link to Opt-out" title="Direct link to Opt-out">​</a></h3>
<p>If, for any reason, the New Architecture is not behaving properly in your application, there is always the option to opt-out from it until you are ready to turn it on again.</p>
<p>To opt-out from the New Architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Android, modify the <code>android/gradle.properties</code> file and turn off the <code>newArchEnabled</code> flag</li>
</ul>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>-</span><span>newArchEnabled=true</span><br></span><span><span></span><span>+</span><span>newArchEnabled=false</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>On iOS, you can reinstall the dependencies by running the command:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span> bundle </span><span>exec</span><span> pod </span><span>install</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks<a href="#thanks" aria-label="Direct link to Thanks" title="Direct link to Thanks">​</a></h2>
<p>Delivering the New Architecture to the OSS community has been a huge effort that took us several years of research and development. We want to take a moment to thank all the current and past members of the React team who helped us achieve this result.</p>
<p>We are also extremely grateful to all the partners who collaborated with us to make this happen. Specifically, we would like to call out:</p>

<p dir="auto">Traditional approaches to browser automations required writing custom scripts for websites, often relying on DOM parsing and XPath-based interactions which would break whenever the website layouts changed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of only relying on code-defined XPath interactions, Skyvern relies on prompts in addition to computer vision and LLMs to the mix to parse items in the viewport in real-time, create a plan for interaction and interact with them.</p>
<p dir="auto">This approach gives us a few advantages:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Skyvern can operate on websites it’s never seen before, as it’s able to map visual elements to actions necessary to complete a workflow, without any customized code</li>
<li>Skyvern is resistant to website layout changes, as there are no pre-determined XPaths or other selectors our system is looking for while trying to navigate</li>
<li>Skyvern is able to take a single workflow and apply it to a large number of websites, as it’s able to reason through the interactions necessary to complete the workflow</li>
<li>Skyvern leverages LLMs to reason through interactions to ensure we can cover complex situations. Examples include:
<ol dir="auto">
<li>If you wanted to get an auto insurance quote from Geico, the answer to a common question “Were you eligible to drive at 18?” could be inferred from the driver receiving their license at age 16</li>
<li>If you were doing competitor analysis, it’s understanding that an Arnold Palmer 22 oz can at 7/11 is almost definitely the same product as a 23 oz can at Gopuff (even though the sizes are slightly different, which could be a rounding error!)</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Skyvern was inspired by the Task-Driven autonomous agent design popularized by <a href="https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi">BabyAGI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT">AutoGPT</a> -- with one major bonus: we give Skyvern the ability to interact with websites using browser automation libraries like <a href="https://playwright.dev/" rel="nofollow">Playwright</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Skyvern uses a swarm of agents to comprehend a website, and plan and execute its actions:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Interactable Element Agent</strong>: This agent is responsible for parsing the HTML of a website and extracting the interactable elements.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation Agent</strong>: This agent is responsible for planning the navigation to complete a task. Examples include clicking buttons, inserting text, selecting options, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Data Extraction Agent</strong>: This agent is responsible for extracting data from a website. It's capable of reading the tables and text on the page, and extract the output in a user-defined structured format</li>
<li><strong>Password Agent</strong>: This agent is responsible for filling out password forms on a website. It's capable of reading the username and password from a password manager, and filling out the form while preserving the privacy of the user-defined secrets.</li>
<li><strong>2FA Agent</strong>: This agent is responsible for filling out 2FA forms on a website. It's capable of  intercepting website requests for 2FAs, and either requesting user-defined APIs for 2FA codes or waiting for users to feed 2FA codes into it, and then completing the login process.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Auto-complete Agent</strong>: This agent is responsible for filling out dynamic auto-complete forms on a website. It's capable of reading the options presented to it, and selecting the appropriate option based on the user's input, adjusting its inputs based on the feedback from inside the form. Popular examples include: Address forms, university dropdowns, and more.</li>

</ol>
<p dir="auto">Here are some tips that may help you on your adventure:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Skyvern is really good at carrying out a single goal. If you give it too many instructions to do, it has a high likelihood of getting confused along the way.</li>
<li>Being really explicit about goals is very important. For example, if you're generating an insurance quote, let it know very clearly how it can identify it's accomplished its goals. Use words like "COMPLETE" or "TERMINATE" to indicate success and failure modes, respectively.</li>
<li>Workflows can be used if you'd like to do more advanced things such as chaining multiple instructions together, or securely logging in. If you need any help with this, please feel free to book some time with us! We're always happy to help</li>

<p dir="auto">Tasks are the fundamental building block inside Skyvern. Each task is a single request to Skyvern, instructing it to navigate through a website and accomplish a specific goal.</p>
<p dir="auto">Tasks require you to specify a <code>url</code>, <code>navigation_goal</code>, and optionally <code>data_extraction_goal</code> if you'd like to extract data from the website, and a <code>navigation_payload</code> if you'd like to provide additional context to help Skyvern fill information or answer questions presented by a website.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Skyvern Workflows</h2><a id="user-content-skyvern-workflows" aria-label="Permalink: Skyvern Workflows" href="#skyvern-workflows"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Workflows are a way to chain multiple tasks together to form a cohesive unit of work.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, if you wanted to download all invoics newer than January 1st, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the invoices page, then filtered down to only show invoices newer than January 1st, extracted a list of all eligilble invoices, and iterated through each invoice to download it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another example is if you wanted to automate purchasing products from an e-commerce store, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the desired product, added it to cart. Second, it would navigate to the cart and validate the cart state. Finally, it would go through the checkout process to purchase the items.</p>
<p dir="auto">Supported workflow features include:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Tasks (+ chained tasks)</li>
<li>Loops</li>
<li>File parsing</li>
<li>Uploading files to block storage</li>
<li>Sending emails</li>
<li>Text Prompts</li>
<li>(Coming soon) Conditionals</li>
<li>(Coming soon) Custom Code Block</li>

<p dir="auto">This is our planned roadmap for the next few months. If you have any suggestions or would like to see a feature added, please don't hesitate to reach out to us <a href="mailto:founders@skyvern.com">via email</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/fG2XXEuQX3" rel="nofollow">discord</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Open Source</strong> - Open Source Skyvern's core codebase</li>
<li> <strong>[BETA] Workflow support</strong> - Allow support to chain multiple Skyvern calls together</li>
<li> <strong>Improved context</strong> - Improve Skyvern's ability to understand content around interactable elements by introducing feeding relevant label context through the text prompt</li>
<li> <strong>Cost Savings</strong> - Improve Skyvern's stability and reduce the cost of running Skyvern by optimizing the context tree passed into Skyvern</li>
<li> <strong>Self-serve UI</strong> - Deprecate the Streamlit UI in favour of a React-based UI component that allows users to kick off new jobs in Skyvern</li>
<li> <strong>Workflow UI Builder</strong> - Introduce a UI to allow users to build and analyze workflows visually</li>
<li> <strong>Chrome Viewport streaming</strong> - Introduce a way to live-stream the Chrome viewport to the user's browser (as a part of the self-serve UI)</li>
<li> <strong>Past Runs UI</strong> - Deprecate the Streamlit UI in favour of a React-based UI that allows you to visualize past runs and their results</li>
<li> <strong>Prompt Caching</strong> - Introduce a caching layer to the LLM calls to dramatically reduce the cost of running Skyvern (memorize past actions and repeat them!)</li>
<li> <strong>Web Evaluation Dataset</strong> - Integrate Skyvern with public benchmark tests to track the quality our models over time</li>
<li> <strong>Improved Debug mode</strong> - Allow Skyvern to plan its actions and get "approval" before running them, allowing you to debug what it's doing and more easily iterate on the prompt</li>
<li> <strong>Auto workflow builder ("Observer") mode</strong> - Allow Skyvern to auto-generate workflows as it's navigating the web to make it easier to build new workflows</li>
<li> <strong>Chrome Extension</strong> - Allow users to interact with Skyvern through a Chrome extension (incl voice mode, saving tasks, etc.)</li>
<li> <strong>Skyvern Action Recorder</strong> - Allow Skyvern to watch a user complete a task and then automatically generate a workflow for it</li>
<li> <strong>Interactable Livestream</strong> - Allow users to interact with the livestream in real-time to intervene when necessary (such as manually submitting sensitive forms)</li>
<li> <strong>Integrate LLM Observability tools</strong> - Integrate LLM Observability tools to allow back-testing prompt changes with specific data sets + visualize the performance of Skyvern over time</li>
<li> <strong>Langchain Integration</strong> - Create langchain integration in langchain_community to use Skyvern as a "tool".</li>

Hello Linux-kernel community,

I am sure you have already heard the news caused by the recent Greg' commit
6e90b675cf942e ("MAINTAINERS: Remove some entries due to various compliance
requirements."). As you may have noticed the change concerned some of the
Ru-related developers removal from the list of the official kernel maintainers,
including me.

The community members rightly noted that the _quite_ short commit log contained
very vague terms with no explicit change justification. No matter how hard I
tried to get more details about the reason, alas the senior maintainer I was
discussing the matter with haven't given an explanation to what compliance
requirements that was. I won't cite the exact emails text since it was a private
messaging, but the key words are "sanctions", "sorry", "nothing I can do", "talk
to your (company) lawyer"... I can't say for all the guys affected by the
change, but my work for the community has been purely _volunteer_ for more than
a year now (and less than half of it had been payable before that). For that
reason I have no any (company) lawyer to talk to, and honestly after the way the
patch has been merged in I don't really want to now. Silently, behind everyone's
back, _bypassing_ the standard patch-review process, with no affected
developers/subsystem notified - it's indeed the worse way to do what has been
done. No gratitude, no credits to the developers for all these years of the
devoted work for the community. No matter the reason of the situation but
haven't we deserved more than that? Adding to the GREDITS file at least, no?..

I can't believe the kernel senior maintainers didn't consider that the patch
wouldn't go unnoticed, and the situation might get out of control with
unpredictable results for the community, if not straight away then in the middle
or long term perspective. I am sure there have been plenty ways to solve the
problem less harmfully, but they decided to take the easiest path. Alas what's
done is done. A bifurcation point slightly initiated a year ago has just been
fully implemented. The reason of the situation is obviously in the political
ground which in this case surely shatters a basement the community has been built
on in the first place. If so then God knows what might be next (who else might
be sanctioned...), but the implemented move clearly sends a bad signal to the
Linux community new comers, to the already working volunteers and hobbyists like
me.

Thus even if it was still possible for me to send patches or perform some
reviews, after what has been done my motivation to do that as a volunteer has
simply vanished. (I might be doing a commercial upstreaming in future though).
But before saying goodbye I'd like to express my gratitude to all the community
members I have been lucky to work with during all these years. Specifically:

NTB-folks, Jon, Dave, Allen. NTB was my starting point in the kernel upstream
work. Thanks for the initial advices and despite of very-very-very tough reviews
with several complete patchset refactorings, I learned a lot back then. That
experience helped me afterwards. Thanks a lot for that. BTW since then I've got
several thank-you letters for the IDT NTB and IDT EEPROM drivers. If not for you
it wouldn't have been possible.

Andy, it's hard to remember who else would have given me more on my Linux kernel
journey as you have. We first met in the I2C subsystem review of my DW I2C
driver patches. Afterwards we've got to be frequently meeting here and there -
GPIO, SPI, TTY, DMA, NET, etc, clean/fixes/features patch(set)s. Quite heat
discussions in your first reviews drove me crazy really. But all the time we
managed to come up with some consensus somehow. And you never quit the
discussions calmly explaining your point over and over. You never refused to
provide more detailed justification to your requests/comments even though you
didn't have to. Thanks to that I learned how to be patient to reviewers
and reviewees. And of course thank you for the Linux-kernel knowledges and all
the tips and tricks you shared.

* Andy, please note due to the situation I am not going to work on my DW DMAC
fixes patchset anymore. So if you ever wish to have DW UART stably working with the
DW DMA-engine driver, then feel free to pick the series up:
Link: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/dmaengine/20240911184710.4207-1-fancer.lancer@gmail.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/dmaengine/20240911184710.4207-1-fancer.lancer@gmail.com/</a>

Linus (Walleij), after you merged one of my pretty much heavy patchset in you
suggested to me to continue the DW APB GPIO driver maintaining. It was a first
time I was asked to maintain a not-my driver. Thank you for the trust. I'll
never forget that.

Mark, thank you very much for entrusting the DW APB SSI driver maintenance to
me. I've put a lot of efforts into making it more generic and less errors-prune,
especially when it comes working under a DMA-engine control or working in the
mem-ops mode. I am sure the results have been beneficial to a lot of DW
SPI-controller users since then.

Damien, our first and last meeting was at my generic AHCI-platform and DW AHCI
SATA driver patches review. You didn't make it a quick and easy path. But still
all the reviews comments were purely on the technical basis, and the patches
were eventually merged in. Thank you for your time and experience I've got from
the reviews.

Paul, Thomas, Arnd, Jiaxun, we met several times in the mailing list during my
MIPS P5600 patches and just generic MIPS patches review. It was always a
pleasure to discuss the matters with such brilliant experts in the field. Alas
I've spent too much time working on the patches for another subsystems and
failed to submit all the MIPS-related bits. Sorry I didn't keep my promise, but
as you can see the circumstances have suddenly drawn its own deadline.

Bjorn, Mani, we were working quite a lot with you in the framework of the DW
PCIe RC drivers. You reviewed my patches. I helped you to review another patches
for some time. Despite of some arguing it was always a pleasure to work with
you.  Mani, special thanks for the cooperative DW eDMA driver maintenance. I
think we were doing a great work together.

Paolo, Jakub, David, Andrew, Vladimir, Russell. The network subsystem and
particularly the STMMAC driver (no doubt the driver sucks) have turned to be a
kind of obstacle on which my current Linux-kernel activity has stopped. I really
hope that at least in some way my help with the incoming STMMAC and DW XPCS
patches reviews lightened up your maintainance duty. I know Russell might
disagree, but I honestly think that all our discussions were useful after all,
at least for me. I also think we did a great work working together with Russell
on the DW GMAC/QoS ETH PCS patches. Hopefully you'll find a time to finish it up
after all. 

Rob, Krzysztof, from your reviews I've learned a lot about the most hardwary part
of the kernel - DT sources and DT-bindings. All your comments have been laconic
and straight to the point. That made reviews quick and easy. Thank you very
much for that.

Guenter, special thanks for reviewing and accepting my patches to the hwmon and
watchdog subsystems. It was pleasure to be working with you.

Borislav, we disagreed and argued a lot. So my DW uMCTL2 DDRC EDAC patches even
got stuck in limbo for quite a long time. Anyway thank you for the time
you spent reviewing my patches and trying to explain your point.

* Borislav, it looks like I won't be able to work on my Synopsys EDAC patchsets
anymore. If you or somebody else could pick them up and finish up the work it
would be great (you can find it in the lore archive). The patches convert the
mainly Zynq(MP)-specific Synopsys EDAC driver to supporting the generic DW
uMCTL2 DDRC. It would be very beneficial for each platform based on that
controller.

Greg, we met several times in the mailing lists. You reviewed my patches sent
for the USB and TTY subsystems, and all the time the process was straight,
highly professional, and simpler than in the most of my other case.
Thank you very much for that.

Yoshihiro, Keguang, Yanteng, Kory, Cai and everybody I was lucky to meet in the
kernel mailing lists, but forgot to mention here. Thank you for the time spent
for our cooperative work on making the Linux kernel better. It was a pleasure to
meet you here.

I also wish to say huge thanks to the community members trying to
defend the kicked off maintainers and for support you expressed in
these days. It means a lot.

A little bit statics of my kernel-work at the end:

Signed-off patches:		518
Reviewed and Acked patches:	253
Tested patches:			80

You might say not the greatest achievement for seven years comparing to some
other developers. Perhaps. But I meant each of these tags, be sure.

I guess that's it. If you ever need some info or consultation regarding the
drivers I used to maintain or the respective hardware or the Synopsys IP-cores
(about which I've got quite comprehensive knowledge by this time), feel free to
reach me out via this email. I am always willing to help to the community
members.

Hope we'll meet someday in more pleasant circumstances and drink a
couple or more beers together. But now it's time to say good bye.
Sorry for a long-read text. I wish good luck on your Linux-way.

Hello Serge!
I do not have many contributions to show to give it extra weight nor do
I actually know you.
Nevertheless I still wanted to say thank you for your nice message even if
it is for a sad occasion, and share your sentiment of hoping
for more pleasant circumstances.

Best regards,
Reimar

(and apologies if anyone is annoyed by the wide CC list, but I think it's
important for at least some thank yous to be public and nobody else seems
to have written one yet)

&gt; 
&gt; Hello Linux-kernel community,
&gt; 
&gt; I am sure you have already heard the news caused by the recent Greg' commit
&gt; 6e90b675cf942e ("MAINTAINERS: Remove some entries due to various compliance
&gt; requirements."). As you may have noticed the change concerned some of the
&gt; Ru-related developers removal from the list of the official kernel maintainers,
&gt; including me.
&gt; 
&gt; The community members rightly noted that the _quite_ short commit log contained
&gt; very vague terms with no explicit change justification. No matter how hard I
&gt; tried to get more details about the reason, alas the senior maintainer I was
&gt; discussing the matter with haven't given an explanation to what compliance
&gt; requirements that was. I won't cite the exact emails text since it was a private
&gt; messaging, but the key words are "sanctions", "sorry", "nothing I can do", "talk
&gt; to your (company) lawyer"... I can't say for all the guys affected by the
&gt; change, but my work for the community has been purely _volunteer_ for more than
&gt; a year now (and less than half of it had been payable before that). For that
&gt; reason I have no any (company) lawyer to talk to, and honestly after the way the
&gt; patch has been merged in I don't really want to now. Silently, behind everyone's
&gt; back, _bypassing_ the standard patch-review process, with no affected
&gt; developers/subsystem notified - it's indeed the worse way to do what has been
&gt; done. No gratitude, no credits to the developers for all these years of the
&gt; devoted work for the community. No matter the reason of the situation but
&gt; haven't we deserved more than that? Adding to the GREDITS file at least, no?..
&gt; 
&gt; I can't believe the kernel senior maintainers didn't consider that the patch
&gt; wouldn't go unnoticed, and the situation might get out of control with
&gt; unpredictable results for the community, if not straight away then in the middle
&gt; or long term perspective. I am sure there have been plenty ways to solve the
&gt; problem less harmfully, but they decided to take the easiest path. Alas what's
&gt; done is done. A bifurcation point slightly initiated a year ago has just been
&gt; fully implemented. The reason of the situation is obviously in the political
&gt; ground which in this case surely shatters a basement the community has been built
&gt; on in the first place. If so then God knows what might be next (who else might
&gt; be sanctioned...), but the implemented move clearly sends a bad signal to the
&gt; Linux community new comers, to the already working volunteers and hobbyists like
&gt; me.
&gt; 
&gt; Thus even if it was still possible for me to send patches or perform some
&gt; reviews, after what has been done my motivation to do that as a volunteer has
&gt; simply vanished. (I might be doing a commercial upstreaming in future though).
&gt; But before saying goodbye I'd like to express my gratitude to all the community
&gt; members I have been lucky to work with during all these years. Specifically:
&gt; 
&gt; NTB-folks, Jon, Dave, Allen. NTB was my starting point in the kernel upstream
&gt; work. Thanks for the initial advices and despite of very-very-very tough reviews
&gt; with several complete patchset refactorings, I learned a lot back then. That
&gt; experience helped me afterwards. Thanks a lot for that. BTW since then I've got
&gt; several thank-you letters for the IDT NTB and IDT EEPROM drivers. If not for you
&gt; it wouldn't have been possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Andy, it's hard to remember who else would have given me more on my Linux kernel
&gt; journey as you have. We first met in the I2C subsystem review of my DW I2C
&gt; driver patches. Afterwards we've got to be frequently meeting here and there -
&gt; GPIO, SPI, TTY, DMA, NET, etc, clean/fixes/features patch(set)s. Quite heat
&gt; discussions in your first reviews drove me crazy really. But all the time we
&gt; managed to come up with some consensus somehow. And you never quit the
&gt; discussions calmly explaining your point over and over. You never refused to
&gt; provide more detailed justification to your requests/comments even though you
&gt; didn't have to. Thanks to that I learned how to be patient to reviewers
&gt; and reviewees. And of course thank you for the Linux-kernel knowledges and all
&gt; the tips and tricks you shared.
&gt; 
&gt; * Andy, please note due to the situation I am not going to work on my DW DMAC
&gt; fixes patchset anymore. So if you ever wish to have DW UART stably working with the
&gt; DW DMA-engine driver, then feel free to pick the series up:
&gt; Link: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/dmaengine/20240911184710.4207-1-fancer.lancer@gmail.com/">https://lore.kernel.org/dmaengine/20240911184710.4207-1-fancer.lancer@gmail.com/</a>
&gt; 
&gt; Linus (Walleij), after you merged one of my pretty much heavy patchset in you
&gt; suggested to me to continue the DW APB GPIO driver maintaining. It was a first
&gt; time I was asked to maintain a not-my driver. Thank you for the trust. I'll
&gt; never forget that.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark, thank you very much for entrusting the DW APB SSI driver maintenance to
&gt; me. I've put a lot of efforts into making it more generic and less errors-prune,
&gt; especially when it comes working under a DMA-engine control or working in the
&gt; mem-ops mode. I am sure the results have been beneficial to a lot of DW
&gt; SPI-controller users since then.
&gt; 
&gt; Damien, our first and last meeting was at my generic AHCI-platform and DW AHCI
&gt; SATA driver patches review. You didn't make it a quick and easy path. But still
&gt; all the reviews comments were purely on the technical basis, and the patches
&gt; were eventually merged in. Thank you for your time and experience I've got from
&gt; the reviews.
&gt; 
&gt; Paul, Thomas, Arnd, Jiaxun, we met several times in the mailing list during my
&gt; MIPS P5600 patches and just generic MIPS patches review. It was always a
&gt; pleasure to discuss the matters with such brilliant experts in the field. Alas
&gt; I've spent too much time working on the patches for another subsystems and
&gt; failed to submit all the MIPS-related bits. Sorry I didn't keep my promise, but
&gt; as you can see the circumstances have suddenly drawn its own deadline.
&gt; 
&gt; Bjorn, Mani, we were working quite a lot with you in the framework of the DW
&gt; PCIe RC drivers. You reviewed my patches. I helped you to review another patches
&gt; for some time. Despite of some arguing it was always a pleasure to work with
&gt; you.  Mani, special thanks for the cooperative DW eDMA driver maintenance. I
&gt; think we were doing a great work together.
&gt; 
&gt; Paolo, Jakub, David, Andrew, Vladimir, Russell. The network subsystem and
&gt; particularly the STMMAC driver (no doubt the driver sucks) have turned to be a
&gt; kind of obstacle on which my current Linux-kernel activity has stopped. I really
&gt; hope that at least in some way my help with the incoming STMMAC and DW XPCS
&gt; patches reviews lightened up your maintainance duty. I know Russell might
&gt; disagree, but I honestly think that all our discussions were useful after all,
&gt; at least for me. I also think we did a great work working together with Russell
&gt; on the DW GMAC/QoS ETH PCS patches. Hopefully you'll find a time to finish it up
&gt; after all. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rob, Krzysztof, from your reviews I've learned a lot about the most hardwary part
&gt; of the kernel - DT sources and DT-bindings. All your comments have been laconic
&gt; and straight to the point. That made reviews quick and easy. Thank you very
&gt; much for that.
&gt; 
&gt; Guenter, special thanks for reviewing and accepting my patches to the hwmon and
&gt; watchdog subsystems. It was pleasure to be working with you.
&gt; 
&gt; Borislav, we disagreed and argued a lot. So my DW uMCTL2 DDRC EDAC patches even
&gt; got stuck in limbo for quite a long time. Anyway thank you for the time
&gt; you spent reviewing my patches and trying to explain your point.
&gt; 
&gt; * Borislav, it looks like I won't be able to work on my Synopsys EDAC patchsets
&gt; anymore. If you or somebody else could pick them up and finish up the work it
&gt; would be great (you can find it in the lore archive). The patches convert the
&gt; mainly Zynq(MP)-specific Synopsys EDAC driver to supporting the generic DW
&gt; uMCTL2 DDRC. It would be very beneficial for each platform based on that
&gt; controller.
&gt; 
&gt; Greg, we met several times in the mailing lists. You reviewed my patches sent
&gt; for the USB and TTY subsystems, and all the time the process was straight,
&gt; highly professional, and simpler than in the most of my other case.
&gt; Thank you very much for that.
&gt; 
&gt; Yoshihiro, Keguang, Yanteng, Kory, Cai and everybody I was lucky to meet in the
&gt; kernel mailing lists, but forgot to mention here. Thank you for the time spent
&gt; for our cooperative work on making the Linux kernel better. It was a pleasure to
&gt; meet you here.
&gt; 
&gt; I also wish to say huge thanks to the community members trying to
&gt; defend the kicked off maintainers and for support you expressed in
&gt; these days. It means a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; A little bit statics of my kernel-work at the end:
&gt; 
&gt; Signed-off patches: 518
&gt; Reviewed and Acked patches: 253
&gt; Tested patches: 80
&gt; 
&gt; You might say not the greatest achievement for seven years comparing to some
&gt; other developers. Perhaps. But I meant each of these tags, be sure.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess that's it. If you ever need some info or consultation regarding the
&gt; drivers I used to maintain or the respective hardware or the Synopsys IP-cores
&gt; (about which I've got quite comprehensive knowledge by this time), feel free to
&gt; reach me out via this email. I am always willing to help to the community
&gt; members.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope we'll meet someday in more pleasant circumstances and drink a
&gt; couple or more beers together. But now it's time to say good bye.
&gt; Sorry for a long-read text. I wish good luck on your Linux-way.
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards,
&gt; -Serge(y)

I'm also quite shocked and even baffled about how this has been
handled. This is not how leaders should communicate difficult or big
decisions. It's the most disappointing event I have witnessed in the
project.

There is the form and there is the content – about the content one
cannot do much, when the state he or his organization resides in gives
an order.

But about the form one can indeed do much. No "Thank you!", no "I hope
we can work together again once the world has become sane(r)"... srsly,
what the hell.

No idea why they felt the need to do it that way, but it certainly is
not the open source way, neither is it decent or honorable.


That said, thank you for all your work, Serge!

I believe that nothing that has been accomplished with a candid mindset
and decent intentions is ever done for nothing, although it often pays
off way differently than expected.
So I hope this will be the case for you, too.

Take care,
Philipp


<span>&gt; 
&gt; Thus even if it was still possible for me to send patches or perform
&gt; some
&gt; reviews, after what has been done my motivation to do that as a
&gt; volunteer has
&gt; simply vanished. (I might be doing a commercial upstreaming in future
&gt; though).
&gt; But before saying goodbye I'd like to express my gratitude to all the
&gt; community
&gt; members I have been lucky to work with during all these years.
&gt; Specifically:
&gt; 
&gt; NTB-folks, Jon, Dave, Allen. NTB was my starting point in the kernel
&gt; upstream
&gt; work. Thanks for the initial advices and despite of very-very-very
&gt; tough reviews

&gt; 
&gt; Andy, it's hard to remember who else would have given me more on my

&gt; journey as you have. We first met in the I2C subsystem review of my
&gt; DW I2C
&gt; driver patches. Afterwards we've got to be frequently meeting here

&gt; DW DMAC
&gt; fixes patchset anymore. So if you ever wish to have DW UART stably
&gt; working with the
&gt; DW DMA-engine driver, then feel free to pick the series up:

&gt; 
&gt; Linus (Walleij), after you merged one of my pretty much heavy
&gt; patchset in you
&gt; suggested to me to continue the DW APB GPIO driver maintaining. It
&gt; was a first
&gt; time I was asked to maintain a not-my driver. Thank you for the
&gt; trust. I'll
&gt; never forget that.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark, thank you very much for entrusting the DW APB SSI driver
&gt; maintenance to
&gt; me. I've put a lot of efforts into making it more generic and less
&gt; errors-prune,
&gt; especially when it comes working under a DMA-engine control or
&gt; working in the
&gt; mem-ops mode. I am sure the results have been beneficial to a lot of
&gt; DW
&gt; SPI-controller users since then.
&gt; 
&gt; Damien, our first and last meeting was at my generic AHCI-platform
&gt; and DW AHCI
&gt; SATA driver patches review. You didn't make it a quick and easy path.
&gt; But still
&gt; all the reviews comments were purely on the technical basis, and the
&gt; patches
&gt; were eventually merged in. Thank you for your time and experience
&gt; I've got from
&gt; the reviews.
&gt; 
&gt; Paul, Thomas, Arnd, Jiaxun, we met several times in the mailing list
&gt; during my
&gt; MIPS P5600 patches and just generic MIPS patches review. It was
&gt; always a
&gt; pleasure to discuss the matters with such brilliant experts in the
&gt; field. Alas
&gt; I've spent too much time working on the patches for another
&gt; subsystems and
&gt; failed to submit all the MIPS-related bits. Sorry I didn't keep my
&gt; promise, but
&gt; as you can see the circumstances have suddenly drawn its own
&gt; deadline.
&gt; 
&gt; Bjorn, Mani, we were working quite a lot with you in the framework of
&gt; the DW
&gt; PCIe RC drivers. You reviewed my patches. I helped you to review
&gt; another patches
&gt; for some time. Despite of some arguing it was always a pleasure to
&gt; work with
&gt; you.&nbsp; Mani, special thanks for the cooperative DW eDMA driver
&gt; maintenance. I
&gt; think we were doing a great work together.
&gt; 
&gt; Paolo, Jakub, David, Andrew, Vladimir, Russell. The network subsystem
&gt; and
&gt; particularly the STMMAC driver (no doubt the driver sucks) have
&gt; turned to be a
&gt; kind of obstacle on which my current Linux-kernel activity has
&gt; stopped. I really
&gt; hope that at least in some way my help with the incoming STMMAC and
&gt; DW XPCS
&gt; patches reviews lightened up your maintainance duty. I know Russell
&gt; might
&gt; disagree, but I honestly think that all our discussions were useful
&gt; after all,
&gt; at least for me. I also think we did a great work working together
&gt; with Russell
&gt; on the DW GMAC/QoS ETH PCS patches. Hopefully you'll find a time to
&gt; finish it up
&gt; after all. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rob, Krzysztof, from your reviews I've learned a lot about the most
&gt; hardwary part
&gt; of the kernel - DT sources and DT-bindings. All your comments have
&gt; been laconic
&gt; and straight to the point. That made reviews quick and easy. Thank
&gt; you very
&gt; much for that.
&gt; 
&gt; Guenter, special thanks for reviewing and accepting my patches to the
&gt; hwmon and
&gt; watchdog subsystems. It was pleasure to be working with you.
&gt; 
&gt; Borislav, we disagreed and argued a lot. So my DW uMCTL2 DDRC EDAC
&gt; patches even
&gt; got stuck in limbo for quite a long time. Anyway thank you for the
&gt; time
&gt; you spent reviewing my patches and trying to explain your point.
&gt; 
&gt; * Borislav, it looks like I won't be able to work on my Synopsys EDAC
&gt; patchsets
&gt; anymore. If you or somebody else could pick them up and finish up the
&gt; work it
&gt; would be great (you can find it in the lore archive). The patches
&gt; convert the
&gt; mainly Zynq(MP)-specific Synopsys EDAC driver to supporting the
&gt; generic DW
&gt; uMCTL2 DDRC. It would be very beneficial for each platform based on
&gt; that
&gt; controller.
&gt; 
&gt; Greg, we met several times in the mailing lists. You reviewed my
&gt; patches sent
&gt; for the USB and TTY subsystems, and all the time the process was
&gt; straight,
&gt; highly professional, and simpler than in the most of my other case.
&gt; Thank you very much for that.
&gt; 
&gt; Yoshihiro, Keguang, Yanteng, Kory, Cai and everybody I was lucky to
&gt; meet in the
&gt; kernel mailing lists, but forgot to mention here. Thank you for the
&gt; time spent
&gt; for our cooperative work on making the Linux kernel better. It was a
&gt; pleasure to
&gt; meet you here.
&gt; 
&gt; I also wish to say huge thanks to the community members trying to
&gt; defend the kicked off maintainers and for support you expressed in
&gt; these days. It means a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; A little bit statics of my kernel-work at the end:
&gt; 
&gt; Signed-off patches:		518
&gt; Reviewed and Acked patches:	253
&gt; Tested patches:			80
&gt; 
&gt; You might say not the greatest achievement for seven years comparing
&gt; to some
&gt; other developers. Perhaps. But I meant each of these tags, be sure.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess that's it. If you ever need some info or consultation
&gt; regarding the
&gt; drivers I used to maintain or the respective hardware or the Synopsys
&gt; IP-cores
&gt; (about which I've got quite comprehensive knowledge by this time),
&gt; feel free to
&gt; reach me out via this email. I am always willing to help to the
&gt; community
&gt; members.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope we'll meet someday in more pleasant circumstances and drink a
&gt; couple or more beers together. But now it's time to say good bye.
&gt; Sorry for a long-read text. I wish good luck on your Linux-way.
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards,
&gt; -Serge(y)

<p dir="auto">The goals for Pretty C are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
  <li>Provide so much syntactic sugar as to cause any C developer a
    diabetes-induced heart attack.</li>
  <li>Deprecate Lua, Python, JavaScript, Ruby and a dozen other languages,
    because Pretty C is the ultimate scripting language, but
    lightning-fast and strongly typed!</li>
  <li>Including only one header (yes, Pretty C is a header-only library
    <code>#include</code>-able from arbitrary C file!)  to turn any codebase into a
    beginner friendly one.</li>

<p dir="auto">This ensures that you never have use-after-free, because you provide

<p dir="auto">Offloads the code to be executed after the following block. Not at the

<p dir="auto">This project is an RF Signal Scanner built using an ESP32, AD8317 RF detector, and various other components. It's designed to detect and measure RF signals in the environment and display the signal strength on an OLED display. It's useful to find hidden cameras, wiretapping devices, and other RF-enabled devices.</p>

<p dir="auto">This video had V3 which required a 9V battery and an external USB Power Supply. V4 here snaps together with zero tools, has space in the bottom for a battery, and a charge controller, and in place of the 9V batter you have a boost converter.  Now you only need 1 battery, and it should last weeks or months depending on usage cycles.</p>

Making art is hard. But art is mostly about surfacing the inner world, and only in part about skill. It’s unfortunate that art selects so strongly for skill. Can we decorrelate the two? It seems so. Cheap interpolative* creativity used by 8 billion non-artists surely surfaces new views of the world.</p><p>For these reasons and since I suck at art I’ve been very excited about the various AI-driven art forms popping up. A couple of months ago I started playing with real-time diffusion of my webcam feed using <a href="https://github.com/cumulo-autumn/StreamDiffusion">StreamDiffusion</a>. Specifically, with the intent of generating pretty visuals and hoping to elicit new/interesting feelings. Although it’s very fun, the laptop form-factor breaks the illusion. It feels all temporary and geeky. So, I recently built an LCD frame that can be hanged to a wall with minimal illusion breakers. What I really like about this setup is that making it a proper object opens up new channels of interaction. It’s no longer just a screen, it has permanence. You can leave it there, come back to it at a different time, in a different mood, with different lighting, objects, friends, etc.</p><div><video width="300" height="550" object-fit="fill" controls="">

<p>21st October 2024</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of Claude’s <strong>Artifacts</strong> feature, which lets you prompt <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> to create an interactive Single Page App (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and then view the result directly in the Claude interface, iterating on it further with the bot and then, if you like, copying out the resulting code.</p>
<p>I was digging around in my <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9450526-how-can-i-export-my-claude-ai-data">Claude activity export</a> (I built a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-to-sqlite">claude-to-sqlite</a> tool to convert it to SQLite I could explore it in <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>) and decided to see how much I’d used artifacts <a href="https://github.com/simonw/claude-to-sqlite/issues/2#issuecomment-2425658909">in the past week</a>. It was more than I expected!</p>
<p>Being able to spin up a full interactive application—sometimes as an illustrative prototype, but often as something that directly solves a problem—is a remarkably useful tool.</p>
<p>Here’s most of what I’ve used Claude Artifacts for in the past seven days. I’ve provided prompts or a full transcript for nearly all of them.</p>

So I built a simple web UI that lets me enter a URL, calls the <a href="https://jina.ai/reader">Jina Reader API</a> to generate Markdown (which uses Puppeteer under the hood) and gives me that Markdown with a convenient “Copy” button.</p>
<p>Try it out: <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/jina-reader">https://tools.simonwillison.net/jina-reader</a> (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/jina-reader.html">Code</a>)</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/14/my-jina-reader-tool/?uu">more about that project here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="sqlite-in-wasm-demo">SQLite in WASM demo</h4>
<p>A Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41851051#41851788">conversation about SQLite’s WASM build</a> lead me to the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm">@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm</a> package on NPM, and I decided to knock together a quick interactive demo.</p>

<p>I found myself wanting to extract all of the underlying URLs that were linked to from a chunk of text on a web page. I realized the fastest way to do that would be to spin up an artifact that could accept rich-text HTML pastes and use an HTML parser to extract those links.</p>

<h4 id="clipboard-viewer">Clipboard viewer</h4>
<p>Messing around with a tool that lets you paste in rich text reminded me that the browser clipboard API is a fascinating thing. I decided to build a quick debugging tool that would let me copy and paste different types of content (plain text, rich text, files, images etc) and see what information was available to me in the browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/clipboard-viewer.jpg" alt="Clipboard format viewer. Paste here or anywhere on the page. Shows text/html with a fragment of HTML, text/plain with some text and Clipboard Event Information showing event type paste and formats available text/html and text/plain"></p>

<h4 id="pyodide-repl">Pyodide REPL</h4>
<p>I didn’t put a lot of effort into this one. While poking around with Claude Artifacts in the browser DevTools I spotted this CSP header:</p>
<p><code>content-security-policy: default-src https://www.claudeusercontent.com; script-src 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.claudeusercontent.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/; connect-src https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/; worker-src https://www.claudeusercontent.com blob:; style-src 'unsafe-inline' https://www.claudeusercontent.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src blob: data: https://www.claudeusercontent.com; font-src data: https://www.claudeusercontent.com; object-src 'none'; base-uri https://www.claudeusercontent.com; form-action https://www.claudeusercontent.com; frame-ancestors https://www.claudeusercontent.com https://claude.ai https://preview.claude.ai https://claude.site https://feedback.anthropic.com; upgrade-insecure-requests; block-all-mixed-content</code></p>
<p>The <code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/</code> in there caught my eye, because it suggested that the Anthropic development team had deliberately set it up so <a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a>—Python compiled to WebAssembly—could be loaded in an artifact.</p>
<p>I got Claude to spin up a very quick demo to prove that this worked:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/pyodide-repl.jpg" alt="Pyodide Python REPL -   3 + 4 returns 7. A textarea to enter python code and a Run button."></p>

<p>I’ve not bothered to extract this one to my own <code>tools.simonwillison.net</code> site yet because it’s purely a proof of concept that Pyodide can load correctly in that environment.</p>
<h4 id="photo-camera-settings-simulator">Photo Camera Settings Simulator</h4>
<p>I was out on a photo walk and got curious about whether or not JavaScript could provide a simulation of camera settings. I didn’t get very far with this one (prompting on my phone while walking along the beach)—the result was buggy and unimpressive and I quickly lost interest. It did expose me to the <a href="http://fabricjs.com/">Fabric.js</a> library for manipulating canvas elements though.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/photo-settings.jpg" alt="Photo Camera Settings Simulator.

<h4 id="llm-pricing-calculator">LLM pricing calculator</h4>
<p>This one I <em>did</em> finish. I built this pricing calculator as part of my experiments with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/17/video-scraping/">Video scraping using Google Gemini</a>, because I didn’t trust my own calculations for how inexpensive Gemini was! Here are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/17/video-scraping/#bonus-calculator">detailed notes</a> on how I built that.</p>

<h4 id="yaml-to-json-converter">YAML to JSON converter</h4>
<p>I wanted to remind myself how certain aspects of YAML syntax worked, so I span up a quick YAML to JSON converter tool that shows the equivalent JSON live as you type YAML.</p>

<h4 id="openai-audio">OpenAI Audio</h4>
<p>This is my most interesting artifact of the week. I was exploring OpenAI’s new Audio APIs and decided to see if I could get Claude to build we a web page that could request access to my microphone, record a snippet of audio, then base64 encoded that and send it to the OpenAI API.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/18/openai-audio/">the full details on how I built this tool</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/openai-audio-card.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the OpenAI Audio tool. A start recording button is visible, and a 00:00 timer, and a playback audio element. There is a textarea for a prompt and a Submit to API button."></p>
<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/openai-audio">https://tools.simonwillison.net/openai-audio</a></p>
<p>Claude Artifacts can’t make API requests to external hosts directly, but it can still spin up enough of a working version that it’s easy to take that, move it to different hosting and finish getting it working.</p>
<p>I wrote more about this API pattern in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/26/gemini-bounding-box-visualization/">Building a tool showing how Gemini Pro can return bounding boxes for objects in images</a>.</p>
<h4 id="qr-code-decoder">QR Code Decoder</h4>
<p>I was in a meeting earlier this week where one of the participants shared a slide with a QR code (for joining a live survey tool). I didn’t have my phone with me, so I needed a way to turn that QR code into a regular URL.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/qr.gif" alt="QR Code Decoder  Uses jsQR by Cosmo Wolfe  Upload, drag and drop, or paste a QR code image: Select a file or drag and drop here  I drag on a QR code and the box says:  Decoded content: https://simonwillison.net/"></p>

<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/qr">https://tools.simonwillison.net/qr</a></p>
<p>Knocking up this QR decoder in Claude Artifacts took just a few seconds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build an artifact (no react) that lets me paste in a QR code and displays the decoded information, with a hyperlink if necessary</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ ... ]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>have a file open box that also lets you drag and drop and add a onpaste handler to the page that catches pasted images as well</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c2b0c42cd1541d6ed6bfe5c17d638039">Full conversation here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="image-converter-and-downloader">Image Converter and Page Downloader</h4>
<p>Another very quick prototype. On Hacker News someone demonstrated a neat idea for a tool that let you drop photos onto a page and it would bake them into the page as base64 URLs such that you could “save as HTML” and get a self-contained page with a gallery.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41876750#41880857">suggested they could add</a> a feature that generated a “Download link” with the new page baked in—useful on mobile phones that don’t let you “Save as HTML”—and got Claude to knock up a quick prototype:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/image-converter-and-downloader.jpg" alt="Image converter and page downloader - I've selected an image and there is now a Download Page link below that image."></p>
<p>In this case I shared the code in <a href="https://gist.github.com/egeozcan/b27e11a7e776972d18603222fa523ed4">a Gist</a> and then used the new-to-me <code>https://gistpreview.github.io/?GIST_ID_GOES_HERE</code> trick to render the result:</p>
<p><a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?14a2c3ef508839f26377707dbf5dd329">https://gistpreview.github.io/?14a2c3ef508839f26377707dbf5dd329</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gistpreview/gistpreview.github.io">gistpreview</a> turns out to be a really quick way to turn a LLM-generated demo into a page people can view.</p>

<h4 id="html-entity-escaper">HTML Entity Escaper</h4>
<p>Another example of on-demand software: I needed to escape the HTML entities in a chunk of text on my phone, so I got Claude to build me a tool for that:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/html-entities.jpg" alt="HTML entity escaper. In the input box I have typed in text with some double quotes. The output box has those correctly escaped, and a copy to clipboard button."></p>
<p><a href="https://claude.site/artifacts/46897436-e06e-4ccc-b8f4-3df90c47f9bc">https://claude.site/artifacts/46897436-e06e-4ccc-b8f4-3df90c47f9bc</a></p>
<p>Here’s the prompt I used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build an artifact (no react) where I can paste text into a textarea and it will return that text with all HTML entities - single and double quotes and less than greater than ampersand - correctly escaped. The output should be in a textarea accompanied by a "Copy to clipboard" button which changes text to "Copied!" for 1.5s after you click it. Make it mobile friendly</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="text-wrap-balance-nav">text-wrap-balance-nav</h4>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/10/you-can-use-text-wrap-balance-on-icons/">Terence Eden</a> I decided to do a quick experiment with the <code>text-wrap: balance</code> CSS property. I got Claude to build me an example nav bar with a slider and a checkbox. I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/20/you-can-use-text-wrap-balance-on-icons/">wrote about that here</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Animated demo. A navigation menu with 13 items - things like Home and About and Services and a products. These are wrapped on four lines with 4, 4, 4 and then 1 item.

<h4 id="ares-phonetic-alphabet-converter">ARES Phonetic Alphabet Converter</h4>
<p>I was volunteering as a HAM radio communications operator for <a href="https://hmbpumpkinfest.com/featured-exhibits/great-pumpkin-run.html">the Half Moon Bay Pumpkin Run</a> and got nervous that I’d mess up using the phonetic alphabet—so I had Claude build me this tool:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/claude-artifacts/phonetic-alphabet.jpg" alt="ARES PHonetic Alphabet Converter. I have entered the text Cleo is a lobster. After clicking the Convert button I get the output Charlie Lima Echo Oscar (Space) India Sierra (Space) Alpha (Space) Lima Oscar Sierra Tango Echo Romeo"></p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6ad4133c93e22df4c0ce731fdd7a2a91">Claude transcript here</a>. Amusingly it built it in Python first, then switched to JavaScript after I reminded it that I wanted “an interactive web app”.</p>
<h4 id="this-is-so-useful-and-so-much-fun-">This is so useful, and so much fun!</h4>
<p>As you can see, I’m a <em>heavy</em> user of this feature—I just described 14 projects produced in a single week. I’ve been using artifacts since they were released <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/20/claude-35-sonnet/">on 20th June</a> (alongside the excellent Claude 3.5 Sonnet, still my daily-driver LLM) and I’m now at a point where I fire up a new interactive artifact several times a day.</p>
<p>I’m using artifacts for idle curiosity, rapid prototyping, library research and to spin up tools that solve immediate problems.</p>
<p>Most of these tools took less than five minutes to build. A few of the more involved ones took longer than that, but even the OpenAI Audio one took <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0a4b826d6d32e4640d67c6319c7ec5ce">11:55am to 12:07pm</a> for the first version and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a04b844a5e8b01cecd28787ed375e738">12:18pm to 12:27pm</a> for the second iteration—so 21 minutes total.</p>
<p>Take a look at my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">claude-artifacts</a> tag for even more examples, including <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/6/svg-to-jpg-png/">SVG to JPG/PNG</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/21/markdown-and-math-live-renderer/">Markdown and Math Live Renderer</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/26/image-resize-and-quality-comparison/">Image resize and quality comparison</a>.</p>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/dashboard-tools/">dashboard</a> of every post that links to my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> site, and the underlying <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">simonw/tools</a> GitHub repo includes more unlisted tools, most of which link to their Claude conversation transcripts in their commit history.</p>
<p>I’m beginning to get a little frustrated at their limitations—in particular the way artifacts are unable to make API calls, submit forms or even link out to other pages. I’ll probably end up spinning up my own tiny artifacts alternative based on everything I’ve learned about them so far.</p>
<p>If you’re <em>not</em> using artifacts, I hope I’ve given you a sense of why they’re one of my current favourite LLM-based tools.</p>
