(Image source: Brecht Corbeel on Unsplash)</figcaption></figure><div><p>A new report out of Taiwan has revealed that the current US administration is tying the reduction on trade of trade tariffs on Taiwan to significant TSMC investment in the US. This investment includes a 49% stake in Intel.</p></div></header>
	</div><div id="c14039107">
	<p>The current US administration, led by President Donald Trump, has employed trade tariffs as the primary way to reduce the US's trade deficit with partner countries. However, the US tariff policy has been erratic and unpredictable. These tariffs have also affected Taiwan, one of the US’s biggest trading partners.</p><p>Currently standing at 20%, the US trade tariff on Taiwan is more than that of countries like Japan, which pays a baseline tariff of 15%. Unsurprisingly, a 20% levy on Taiwanese exports to the US will hurt Taiwanese businesses quite a bit, which is why the country needs to negotiate further with the US to bring the tariffs down or downright eliminate then. However, according to a new report out of Taiwan, US President Trump has presented Taiwan with two conditions for tariff relief, both of which are quite stringent.</p><p><a href="https://www.mnews.tw/story/mm-20250804fin003" target="_blank">Per the Taiwanese outlet mnews.tw</a>, an industry source told the publication that President Donald Trump has mandated TSMC fulfill two conditions if Taiwan is to see any tariff reduction:</p><div><ol><li>Buy a 49% stake in Intel</li><li>Invest a further $400 billion in the US</li></ol></div><p>While ignoring the industrial ramifications of TSMC owning 49% of Intel, these are humongous financial commitments. <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/TSMC-s-second-Kumamoto-fab-reportedly-slips-to-2029-as-attention-shifts-to-U-S-expansion.1069608.0.html" target="_self">TSMC is already investing a ton of money in the US</a>, with one of the company’s fabs achieving volume production in 2024. The Taiwanese giant is on its way to building two more fabs at its Arizona facility, alongside an R&amp;D Center and a packaging facility. Overall, TSMC has planned to invest a total of $165 billion in the US.</p><p>So, President Trump’s alleged condition of investing a further $400 billion in the US alongside buying a stake in Intel seems improbable from a purely financial standpoint.</p><p><h2>The US is trying to save Intel from collapse</h2></p><p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-is-absolutely-hammering-Intel-in-CPU-sales-as-even-old-AM4-chips-outsold-latest-Arrow-Lake-CPUs-last-week.1063493.0.html" target="_self">Intel is on the decline</a>. From the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-now-reportedly-focusing-on-14A-production-as-18A-proves-to-be-a-billion-dollar-failure.1049302.0.html" target="_self">company’s fab operations</a> to consumer products, virtually every Intel department is taking a hit. This has shown in the company’s reported annual revenue figure, which has come down from a high of $79 billion in 2021 to $53 billion in 2024, is a massive 33% reduction.</p><p>Intel is a vital part of the US’s plans regarding domestic semiconductor manufacturing. As such, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/intel-has-already-received-2-2b-in-federal-grants-for-chip-production/" target="_blank">the company has already received billions in federal grants</a>. However, this funding has not solved Intel’s troubles, as the company has delayed its Ohio fab from an initial target of 2025 to 2030/31. A primary reason for this delay seems to be Intel’s efforts to preserve capital resources amidst a lack of significant help from the US CHIPS Act and outside partners.</p><div><p>In short, the US administration seems to be pressuring TSMC to acquire a considerable stake in Intel to inject some much-needed capital into the company and keep the US government's plans of a domestic chip supply chain afloat. However, TSMC is unlikely to agree to this proposal.
</p>
<p>It'd be interesting to see what happens to Intel the coming months. Intel has a few exciting products in the works with <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-Panther-Lake-could-take-handheld-gaming-to-the-next-level.1072173.0.html" target="_self">Panther Lake</a> and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-Nova-Lake-based-Ryzen-X3D-equivalent-to-launch-with-28-CPU-cores.1066983.0.html" target="_self">Nova Lake CPUs</a>. So, things could improve for Team Blue if these products deliver.</p></div></div><div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" rel="author"><div><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Notebookcheck-Team.212978.0.html?&amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Bmode%5D=show&amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Buid%5D=316"><picture><source srcset="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/6/1/csm_IMG_1224_1_162133c8b0.jpg 1x, https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/6/1/csm_IMG_1224_1_c8771969bf.jpg 2x"><img src="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/6/1/csm_IMG_1224_1_162133c8b0.jpg" loading="lazy" width="120" height="120" alt="Fawad Murtaza"></picture></a></div><p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Notebookcheck-Team.212978.0.html?&amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Bmode%5D=show&amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Buid%5D=316">Fawad Murtaza</a> - Senior Tech Writer <span title="1302&nbsp;"> - 1302 articles published on Notebookcheck</span> since 2021</p><p>I am Fawad, a fellow tech nerd.

The model is encouraged to write down its thoughts as it solves the problem distinct from our usual thinking mode, during the multi-turn trajectories to best leverage its reasoning abilities.

We no longer include the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool">third ‘planning tool’</a> used by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. On all Claude 4 models, we report scores out of the full 500 problems.

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://openai.com/open-models" rel="nofollow">gpt-oss models</a> were trained on the <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/openai-harmony" rel="nofollow">harmony response format</a> for defining conversation structures, generating reasoning output and structuring function calls. If you are not using gpt-oss directly but through an API or a provider like HuggingFace, Ollama, or vLLM, you will not have to be concerned about this as your inference solution will handle the formatting. If you are building your own inference solution, this guide will walk you through the prompt format. The format is designed to mimic the OpenAI Responses API, so if you have used that API before, this format should hopefully feel familiar to you. gpt-oss should not be used without using the harmony format as it will not work correctly.</p>
<p dir="auto">The format enables the model to output to multiple different channels for chain of thought, and tool calling premables along with regular responses. It also enables specifying various tool namespaces, and structured outputs along with a clear instruction hierarchy. <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/openai-harmony" rel="nofollow">Check out the guide</a> to learn more about the format itself.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 16:07:46 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://yoyo-code.com/why-is-github-ui-getting-so-much-slower/">https://yoyo-code.com/why-is-github-ui-getting-so-much-slower/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44799861">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I couldn't help but notice - GitHub UI has been getting slower and slower recently. Some things that were snappy before are
hellishly slow nowadays. GitHub is doing something weird and I just can't wrap my head around what's going on there.</p>
<p><strong>You guys developing at GitHub, you're using GitHub to develop it, right? Do you not see this? What's going on?</strong></p>
<p>Whenever I bump into slow website which drives me nuts, I open the devtools and profile it. Who knows, maybe I
find something to report and the problem will get fixed.</p>
<p>To give one representative example, here's a profile for switching from "Conversation" tab to
"Files changed" tab on a PR.</p>
<p>Before we look into the profile, notice that this takes over 5s. How is anything like that acceptable in 2025 is beyond me.</p>
<p><img src="https://yoyo-code.com/file-view-route-change.webp" alt="file-view-route-change.png"></p>
<p>Now, if you dive deep into this, you'll see that GitHub uses <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev/">Turbo</a> to preload next page and swap out the
content without page reload. This is usually done as a performance optimization, but here, we see something completely
absurd.</p>
<p>If you try this out at home and play around with it, you'll find out that <strong>opening the "Files changed" link in a new tab is
actually 2x faster:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://yoyo-code.com/fresh-file-view.webp" alt="img.png"></p>
<p>And not only that - the client side post-processing in the first profile actually takes longer than loading the html
from the server. This whole thing just doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>The cherry on top is the new loading bar that just drives me absolutely nuts, because it reminds me how slow
the whole transition is:</p>
<p><img src="https://yoyo-code.com/github-progress-bar.webp" alt="github-progress-bar.png"></p>
<p>Guys... can you just make the transition fast such that you don't need a new loading bar?
Like, what's the point of doing client side routing, when you just recreate the full page reload experience, but slower?
<strong>The whole point of doing SPAs was to avoid this. Client side routing should be instant.</strong></p>
<p>This is just one of many performance problems on GitHub. It didn't use to be that way. Trying to go through multiple PRs and 
issues is just suffering now. Imagine you have 20 PRs to find out which one introduced a regression, and every click takes more than 5 seconds to show something.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on the diff view itself - yes, the one that periodically freezes for 2 seconds while browsing through
large PR's - maybe it has something to do with the fact that it renders thousands of invisible plus buttons with the
same inlined svg icon:</p>
<p><img src="https://yoyo-code.com/invisible-plus-icon.webp" alt="invisible-plus-icon.webp"></p>
<p><img src="https://yoyo-code.com/invisible-plus-icon-html.webp" alt="invisible-plus-icon-html.png"></p>
<p>Or, you know, maybe not trying to render <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/111001">100 000 DOM nodes</a> in general would
also help.</p>
<p>The whole window freezes for 3 seconds when you resize the dev tools window because you want to profile
this thing.</p>
<h2 id="does-this-ever-improve">Does this ever improve?<span>
<a href="#does-this-ever-improve" aria-label="Anchor link for: does-this-ever-improve">🔗</a>
</span>
</h2>
<p>So, maybe, when <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/33663">some of the popular issues</a> are related to performance, and GitHub has this seemingly related <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/1?filterQuery=is%3Aopen+product-focus-area%3A%22%E2%9B%B0+Platform+for+collaboration+at+scale%22">"Platform collaboration at scale"</a> focus area in the roadmap, maybe this will change?</p>
<p>Let's look at the roadmap and see if we can find
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agithub%2Froadmap%20slow&amp;type=code">anything</a> <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agithub%2Froadmap+slow+ui&amp;type=issues">related</a> to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agithub%2Froadmap+web+performance&amp;type=code">performance</a>. Did you find something?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-510135">

				


				


				<h3>from the <i>this-is-why-we-can't-have-nice-things</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>Section 706 of the Telecom Act&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/1302">requires</a>&nbsp;the FCC to determine whether broadband is being deployed “on a reasonable and timely basis” to everyone. If the answer is no, the law says the FCC must “take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market.”</p>
<p>For decades, the FCC has tap-danced around this mandate. Corruption and regulatory capture has resulted in a U.S. telecom sector that’s barely competitive, highly consolidated, and dominated by a handful of regional telecom monopolies. Those monopolies don’t have to try very hard to expand access, lower prices, or improve speeds. The FCC has been historically feckless about doing anything about it. </p>
<p>Every so often the FCC tries to do the absolute bare minimum to improve on this dynamic. Like during the Biden administration, when the Biden FCC <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/20/fcc-finally-updates-americas-pathetic-definition-of-broadband-to-100-mbps/#:~:text=According%20to%20FCC%20boss%20Jessica,our%20colleagues%20at%20other%20agencies.">last year boosted the definition of broadband</a> to a still pathetic 100 Mbps downstream, 10 Mbps upstream, pledged to hold gigabit access as a future goal, and made a thin pledge to <strong>maybe</strong> take a closer look at why U.S. broadband is so expensive. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/fcc-to-eliminate-gigabit-speed-goal-and-scrap-analysis-of-broadband-prices/">the Trump administration is killing all of that</a>. </p>
<p>In a flimsy explanation, Trump FCC boss Brendan Carr claims that having meaningful standards and ensuring that broadband is affordable are “extraneous”&nbsp;matters. To further prop up his agency’s apathy, he points to the recent Loper Bright Supreme Court ruling that curtail the FCC’s authority to do anything that might upset a big U.S. corporation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Carr FCC’s proposal points to a&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/scotus-kills-chevron-deference-giving-courts-more-power-to-block-federal-rules/">Supreme Court ruling</a>&nbsp;that limited the ability of federal agencies to interpret ambiguous laws. Given that ruling, “we believe it is most prudent to strictly adhere to the statutory text,” the proposal said.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve noted repeatedly how this is the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/05/01/brendan-carrs-fcc-abuses-run-face-first-into-trump-court-efforts-to-destroy-regulatory-power/">legal and logical incoherence</a> at the heart of Trump and Brendan Carr’s FCC. Carr wants to wield FCC authority like a tyrant, leveraging often <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/25/fcc-commissioner-brendan-carr-continues-to-enjoy-oodles-of-free-press-for-fear-mongering-about-tiktok/">completely nonexistent agency power to force TikTok to sell itself to Trump’s buddies</a>, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/fcc-boss-brendan-carr-investigating-verizon-for-not-being-racist-enough/">bully telecom companies into being more racist</a>, or cajole media companies into softening their journalism of our idiot king.</p>
<p>The problem is, only one side can “win” this standoff, and it’s corporate power. Carr can saber rattle and threaten all he likes, but the primary agenda of Trump 2.0 (outside of the racism) is delivering the final killing blow to federal consumer protection, regulatory autonomy, and corporate oversight.</p>
<p>If you’re an amoral billionaire or corporation with zero interest in a habitable planet, any sort of equality, or functioning democracy, the project is going very well. If you’re an actual resident of the United States, interested in things like labor rights, clean drinking water, or evenly available and affordable broadband access, you are in <em>very, very serious trouble</em>. </p>
<p>Companies like Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon want a federal government that just mindlessly rubber stamps their harmful mergers, then turns a blind eye to all of the harms of consolidation and market failure. And while U.S. regulators were already terrible at taking meaningful action to stop this, Trump 2.0 is making all of our regulatory capture and corruption problems<em> immeasurably worse</em>.</p>
<p>Our broken, consolidated corporate press doesn’t much want to talk about it, but <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/07/federal-consumer-protection-is-dead-the-fate-of-net-neutrality-warned-you-it-was-coming/">U.S. federal consumer protection and corporate oversight is effectively dead</a>, the impact will reverberate for decades, and a significant portion of the damage of the second Trump Presidency will be permanent. </p>
<p>Even under an ideal situation where Trump authoritarianism is conquered and some sort of sensible alternative takes office, restoring oversight of companies like Comcast and AT&amp;T — both bone-grafted to our domestic surveillance networks — is never going to be a priority in a Congress that’s now too corrupt to function, under a broken court system that treats corporate power as an unimpeachable deity.</p>
<p>If the FCC was a serious agency, there’s plenty it could do to improve broadband access. It could take aim at monopoly power. It could encourage municipal broadband and local cooperatives. It could impose real penalties for service quality and privacy violations. It could implement and enforce consistent standards demanding better of our regional monopoly giants. </p>
<p>With only the occasional short-lived exceptions, at every opportunity the U.S. does the exact opposite, in blind service to telecom monopoly power.</p>

These cookies will provide analytics to improve the site experience and personalize content and ads for enterprise users.

We want to thank everyone for their review and feedback on the Privacy Statement Update. We appreciate and share your passion for developer privacy. GitHub remains committed to having the highest privacy standards and will continue to center the needs of developers in all of our platform decisions. We intend for this to be a minimally invasive change that will enable us to provide the best tools to our users. In response to your comments, we are providing the following changes and points of clarification:<br>
DNT and self-help browser extensions<br>
Commenters raised questions about our language on DNT and self-help browser extensions. We've pushed a <a href="https://github.com/github/site-policy/pull/582/commits/4a61c4e2be67c12a1cc200ef3e804db400ce1426">commit</a> that:<br>
• Folds the existing DNT and browser extension information into a new section on disabling non-essential cookies.<br>
• Specifies there will be a user setting to disable non-essential cookies and provides additional details to clarify which cookies will be used and for what reasons.<br>
• Specifies that DNT will be honored on GitHub, and that if a DNT signal is sent, GitHub will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies, so that we do not have to rely on third parties honoring DNT.<br>
• Browsers' built-in tracking protection has advanced significantly in recent years, so we've noted that configuring that built-in protection may block non-essential cookies.<br>
• Separated mentions of browser extensions designed to block tracking, and extensions designed to block unwanted content with the effect of blocking tracking, for clarity, though using either alone or in combination may block non-essential cookies.<br>
• Changed links with additional information on DNT and browser extensions to point to their respective Wikipedia articles for neutrality, currency, and to clarify that these are not GitHub products (though of course we're proud that many privacy protection tools are developed on GitHub).<br>
Finally, some have asked why we’re explaining technical self-help tools. GitHub has a very broad user base, including new developers – and we want everyone to be informed about the scope of their options, including technical options.<br>
Enterprise user experience<br>
Commenters asked for clarification about how this change will impact the enterprise user experience. We are introducing cookies on GitHub’s Enterprise Marketing Pages (e.g. <a href="http://resources.github.com/">resources.github.com</a>), not on Enterprise user accounts. We intend for this change to make it easier for our Marketing team to better understand the needs of users who are visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages and connect them with the solutions that will benefit them most.<br>
Users who visit these pages will have the option to express their cookies preferences by navigating to the link in the footer of the page.<br>
Stylistic change<br>
Commenters have asked why ‘Personal Data’ was changed to ‘personal data’ in the Privacy Statement update. We made personal data lowercase because it is not a defined term in our Terms of Service, for consistency with “All capitalized terms have their definition in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service">GitHub’s Terms of Service</a>, unless otherwise noted here.” The stylistic change does not impact its definition.</p>

<p dir="auto">Presuming this capitalization change is unintentional, it has the unfortunate effect of decoupling "Personal Data" from the definition provided in the GitHub Terms of Service, which means that "personal data" is no longer as delineated there, but could well be anything.</p>
<p dir="auto">If this is an intentional change, it would seem better made as a visible change to the Terms of Service. If the intent is not to change the Terms of Service but to arbitrarily expand "personal data" without drawing attention, well, that seems evil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I also think that they should avoid using confusing privacy policies; the mention of DNT should either be kept as is if GitHub uses the DNT header to reduce tracking, or deleted entirely if GitHub does not use the DNT header. If it does so only in some cases, <b>it should mention what cases these are</b>. The privacy policy made sense before the change in the section about DNT, although the change mentioned above makes it confusing (as other comments already mention).</p>
<p dir="auto">[..]</p>
<p dir="auto">I have no problem with adding these non-essential cookies to the enterprise marketing pages, as long as the rest of GitHub can be used without it <b>and it is documented which pages these are</b> (and if the cookie domain is the same, also which cookies). Moving the enterprise marketing pages to a separate domain seems to me to be a good idea though, in order to be clearly distinguished (although a subdomain is probably good enough, in my opinion; <b>as long as it is documented clearly which subdomains these are</b>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Emphasis are mine.<br>
In my opinion, <code>documented</code> should mean being very specific and being part of a legally binding document like the privacy policy.</p>
<p dir="auto">An example for not being specific is this part of the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">As described below, we may use non-essential cookies on <b>certain pages</b> of our website</p>

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Why are people getting so riled up when this change <em>only</em> impacts the Enterprise marketing subdomains? Makes no sense to me how this of all things is getting negative attention. Majority of people don't use GitHub Enterprise, as its only for businesses, And they're just cookies. Use uBlock Origin as it says if you really can't stand a few cookies on subdomains you'll probably never end up going to.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, people love pointing the finger at Microsoft, as if this change was demanded by them. It more than likely wasn't. There are always going to be changes that people don't like, but not all changes are influenced by the parent company. If Microsoft was puttng their hands all over GitHub, they probably would've moved GitHub to the Microsoft Policy Statement a long time ago.</p>

<p dir="auto">"We are also committing that going forward, we will only use cookies that are required for us to serve GitHub.com."</p>
<p dir="auto">Apparently in corporate terms, a "commitment" is now less than two calendar years of obligation. Good to know. Though, I guess I don't visit the marketing pages and hence, don't really care that much? Corporations being untrustworthy isn't new territory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Literally just "business advice": Your marketing teams should be weighing the value of the data here against the cost of "yet another breach of user trust and commitment", user trust, of course, being something extremely hard to earn back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">How exactly does this in any way impact user trust? It doesn't impact the main site, like the dashboard, the landing page, or <em>any</em> other part of GitHub like profiles, repositories, or organizations. It literally <em>only</em> impacts the enterprise marketing pages, and its for sales data tracking &amp; analytics. GitHub Enterprise is a very business-oriented product, so the only visitors to those pages will be by business leaders potentially interested in GitHub Enterprise, or users who land on that page by mistake.</p>
<p dir="auto">And I believe that is what GitHub meant when they said "to serve GitHub.com" - the main site (dashboard, repos, profiles, etc), not including stuff related to their Enterprise product, so I genuinely don't believe they broke their commitment. People are overreacting, as usual, to insignificant changes that don't really impact them.</p>

If it does so only in some cases, it should mention what cases these are. The privacy policy made sense before the change in the section about DNT, although the change mentioned above makes it confusing (as other comments already mention).</p>
<p dir="auto">Mentioning other programs such as Privacy Badger and uBlock Origin are OK, although it might be worth to add a disclaimer if GitHub is not affiliated with such programs, even if they are hosted on GitHub. (Since GitHub is used for many FOSS projects, it is likely that some of them will be.)</p>
<p dir="auto">I have no problem with adding these non-essential cookies to the enterprise marketing pages, as long as the rest of GitHub can be used without it and it is documented which pages these are (and if the cookie domain is the same, also which cookies). Moving the enterprise marketing pages to a separate domain seems to me to be a good idea though, in order to be clearly distinguished (although a subdomain is probably good enough, in my opinion; as long as it is documented clearly which subdomains these are).</p>
<p dir="auto">About alternatives to GitHub, I would not recommend GitLab because it will not display the files if JavaScripts are not enabled. However, it is acceptable to use GitLab if there are mirrors on multiple services. GitHub, Codeberg, and NotABug, and some others, also use JavaScripts, although the files can be displayed even if JavaScripts are disabled (even though there is a note that says enable JavaScripts, it is not required to simply view files), so it is acceptable. Another alternative is Sourcehut, which also doesn't need JavaScripts (and says that all features work without JavaScripts, although it still has some).</p>

We want to thank everyone for their review and feedback on the Privacy Statement Update. We appreciate and share your passion for developer privacy. GitHub remains committed to having the highest privacy standards and will continue to center the needs of developers in all of our platform decisions. We intend for this to be a minimally invasive change that will enable us to provide the best tools to our users. In response to your comments, we are providing the following changes and points of clarification:<br>
DNT and self-help browser extensions<br>
Commenters raised questions about our language on DNT and self-help browser extensions. We've pushed a <a href="https://github.com/github/site-policy/pull/582/commits/4a61c4e2be67c12a1cc200ef3e804db400ce1426">commit</a> that:<br>
• Folds the existing DNT and browser extension information into a new section on disabling non-essential cookies.<br>
• Specifies there will be a user setting to disable non-essential cookies and provides additional details to clarify which cookies will be used and for what reasons.<br>
• Specifies that DNT will be honored on GitHub, and that if a DNT signal is sent, GitHub will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies, so that we do not have to rely on third parties honoring DNT.<br>
• Browsers' built-in tracking protection has advanced significantly in recent years, so we've noted that configuring that built-in protection may block non-essential cookies.<br>
• Separated mentions of browser extensions designed to block tracking, and extensions designed to block unwanted content with the effect of blocking tracking, for clarity, though using either alone or in combination may block non-essential cookies.<br>
• Changed links with additional information on DNT and browser extensions to point to their respective Wikipedia articles for neutrality, currency, and to clarify that these are not GitHub products (though of course we're proud that many privacy protection tools are developed on GitHub).<br>
Finally, some have asked why we’re explaining technical self-help tools. GitHub has a very broad user base, including new developers – and we want everyone to be informed about the scope of their options, including technical options.<br>
Enterprise user experience<br>
Commenters asked for clarification about how this change will impact the enterprise user experience. We are introducing cookies on GitHub’s Enterprise Marketing Pages (e.g. <a href="http://resources.github.com/">resources.github.com</a>), not on Enterprise user accounts. We intend for this change to make it easier for our Marketing team to better understand the needs of users who are visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages and connect them with the solutions that will benefit them most.<br>
Users who visit these pages will have the option to express their cookies preferences by navigating to the link in the footer of the page.<br>
Stylistic change<br>
Commenters have asked why ‘Personal Data’ was changed to ‘personal data’ in the Privacy Statement update. We made personal data lowercase because it is not a defined term in our Terms of Service, for consistency with “All capitalized terms have their definition in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service">GitHub’s Terms of Service</a>, unless otherwise noted here.” The stylistic change does not impact its definition.</p>

We appreciate and share your passion for developer privacy. GitHub remains committed to having the highest privacy standards and will continue to center the needs of developers in all of our platform decisions. We intend for this to be a minimally invasive change that will enable us to provide the best tools to our users. In response to your comments, we are providing the following changes and points of clarification: DNT and self-help browser extensions Commenters raised questions about our language on DNT and self-help browser extensions. We've pushed a <a href="https://github.com/github/site-policy/pull/582/commits/4a61c4e2be67c12a1cc200ef3e804db400ce1426">commit</a> that: • Folds the existing DNT and browser extension information into a new section on disabling non-essential cookies. • Specifies there will be a user setting to disable non-essential cookies and provides additional details to clarify which cookies will be used and for what reasons. • Specifies that DNT will be honored on GitHub, and that if a DNT signal is sent, GitHub will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies, so that we do not have to rely on third parties honoring DNT. • Browsers' built-in tracking protection has advanced significantly in recent years, so we've noted that configuring that built-in protection may block non-essential cookies. • Separated mentions of browser extensions designed to block tracking, and extensions designed to block unwanted content with the effect of blocking tracking, for clarity, though using either alone or in combination may block non-essential cookies. • Changed links with additional information on DNT and browser extensions to point to their respective Wikipedia articles for neutrality, currency, and to clarify that these are not GitHub products (though of course we're proud that many privacy protection tools are developed on GitHub). Finally, some have asked why we’re explaining technical self-help tools. GitHub has a very broad user base, including new developers – and we want everyone to be informed about the scope of their options, including technical options. Enterprise user experience Commenters asked for clarification about how this change will impact the enterprise user experience. We are introducing cookies on GitHub’s Enterprise Marketing Pages (e.g. <a href="http://resources.github.com/">resources.github.com</a>), not on Enterprise user accounts. We intend for this change to make it easier for our Marketing team to better understand the needs of users who are visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages and connect them with the solutions that will benefit them most. Users who visit these pages will have the option to express their cookies preferences by navigating to the link in the footer of the page. Stylistic change Commenters have asked why ‘Personal Data’ was changed to ‘personal data’ in the Privacy Statement update. We made personal data lowercase because it is not a defined term in our Terms of Service, for consistency with “All capitalized terms have their definition in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service">GitHub’s Terms of Service</a>, unless otherwise noted here.” The stylistic change does not impact its definition.</p>

      Enough is enough—I dumped Google’s worsening search for Kagi

    <p>
      I like how the search engine is the product instead of <em>me</em>.

<p>Mandatory AI summaries have come to Google, and they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/research-shows-google-ai-overviews-reduce-website-clicks-by-almost-half/">gleefully showcase hallucinations while confidently insisting on their truth</a>. I feel about them the same way I felt about mandatory G+ logins when all I wanted to do was access my damn YouTube account: I hate them. Intensely.</p>
<p>But <em>unlike</em> those mandatory G+ logins—on which Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/google-officially-ends-forced-google-integration-first-up-youtube/">eventually relented</a> before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/google-shuts-down-april-2-all-data-will-be-deleted/">shutting down the G+ service</a>—our reading of the tea leaves suggests that, this time, the search giant <em>is extremely pleased</em> with how things are going.</p>
<p>Fabricated AI dreck polluting your search? It's the new normal. Miss your little results page with its 10 little blue links? Too bad. They're gone now, and you can't get them back, no matter what <a href="https://gizmodo.com/add-fcking-to-your-google-searches-to-neutralize-ai-summaries-2000557710">ephemeral workarounds</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/research-shows-google-ai-overviews-reduce-website-clicks-by-almost-half/?comments=1&amp;post=43861979">temporarily functional flags</a> or <a href="https://udm14.com/">undocumented, could-fail-at-any-time URL tricks</a> you use.</p>
<p>And the galling thing is that Google expects you to be a good consumer and just <em>take it</em>. The subtext of the company's (probably AI-generated) robo-MBA-speak non-responses to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">criticism</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/education-tech-firm-sues-google-over-ai-search-summaries/">complaining</a> is clear: "LOL, what are you going to do, use a different search engine? Now, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/the-gmail-app-will-now-create-ai-summaries-whether-you-want-them-or-not/">shut up and have some more AI</a>!"</p>
<p>But like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h97kbv4mbsc">the old sailor used to say</a>: "That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no more." So I <em>did</em> start using a different search engine—one that doesn't constantly shower me with half-baked, anti-consumer AI offerings.</p>
<p>Out with Google, in with <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a>.</p>
<h2>What the hell is a Kagi?</h2>
<p>Kagi was founded in 2018, but its search product has only been publicly available since <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-orion-public-beta">June 2022</a>. It purports to be an <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/company/">independent search engine</a> that pulls results from around the web (<a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/search-details/search-sources.html">including from its own index</a>) and is aimed at returning search to a user-friendly, user-focused experience. The company's stated purpose is to deliver useful search results, full stop. The goal is <em>not</em> to blast you with AI garbage or bury you in "Knowledge Graph" summaries hacked together from posts in a 12-year-old Reddit thread between two guys named /u/WeedBoner420 and /u/14HitlerWasRight88.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Kagi's offerings (it has <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/">a web browser, too</a>, though I've not used it) are based on a simple idea. There's an (oversimplified) axiom that if a good or service (like Google search, for example, or good ol' Facebook) is free for you to use, it's because you're the product, not the customer. With Google, you pay with your attention, your behavioral metrics, and the intimate personal details of your wants and hopes and dreams (and the contents of your emails and other electronic communications—Google's got most of that, too).</p>
<p>With Kagi, you pay for the product using <em>money</em>. That's it! You give them some money, and you get some service—great service, really, which I'm overall quite happy with and which I'll get to shortly. You don't have to look at any ads. You don't have to look at AI droppings. You don't have to give perpetual ownership of your mind-palace to a pile of optioned-out tech bros in sleeveless Patagonia vests while you are endlessly subjected to amateur AI Rorschach tests every time you search for "pierogis near me."</p>

<h2>How much money are we talking?</h2>
<p>I dunno, about <a href="https://kagi.com/pricing">a hundred bucks a year</a>? That's what I'm spending as an individual for unlimited searches. I'm using Kagi's "Professional" plan, but there are others, including a free offering so that you can poke around and see if the service is worth your time.</p>

<p>I'd previously bounced off two trial runs with Kagi in 2023 and 2024 because the idea of <em>paying for search</em> just felt so alien. But that was before Google's AI enshittification rolled out in full force. Now, sitting in the middle of 2025 with the world burning down around me, a hundred bucks to kick Google to the curb <em>and</em> get better search results feels totally worth it. Your mileage may vary, of course.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>The other thing that made me nervous about paying for search was the idea that my money was going to enrich some scumbag VC fund, but fortunately, there's good news on that front. According to <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/company/">the company's "About" page</a>, Kagi has not taken any money from venture capitalist firms. Instead, it has been funded by a combination of self-investment by the founder, selling equity to some Kagi users in two rounds, and subscription revenue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kagi was bootstrapped from 2018 to 2023 with ~$3M initial funding from the founder. In 2023, <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/safe-round">Kagi raised $670K</a> from Kagi users in its first external fundraise, followed by <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/what-is-next-for-kagi#3">$1.88M raised in 2024</a>, again from our users, bringing the number of users-investors to 93... In early 2024, Kagi became a <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/what-is-next-for-kagi#4">Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What about DuckDuckGo? Or Bing? Or Brave?</h2>
<p>Sure, those can be perfectly cromulent alternatives to Google, but honestly, I don't think they go far enough. DuckDuckGo is fine, but it largely utilizes <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/sources">Bing's index</a>; and while DuckDuckGo exercises considerable control over its search results, the company is tied to the vicissitudes of Microsoft by that index. It's a bit like sitting in a boat tied to a submarine. Sure, everything's fine now, but at some point, that sub will do what subs do—and your boat is gonna follow it down.</p>
<p>And as for Bing itself, perhaps I'm nitpicky [Ed. note: He is!], but using Bing feels like interacting with 2000-era MSN's slightly perkier grandkid. It's younger and fresher, yes, but it still radiates that same old stanky feeling of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUXnJraKM3k">taste-free, designed-by-committee artlessness</a>. I'd rather just use Google—which is saying something. At least Google's search home page remains uncluttered.</p>
<p><a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a> is another fascinating option I haven't spent a tremendous amount of time with, largely because Brave's <a href="https://brave.com/wallet/">cryptocurrency ties</a> still feel <a href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/">incredibly low-rent and skeevy</a>. I'm slowly warming up to the Brave Browser as a replacement for Chrome (see the screenshots in this article!), but I'm just not comfortable with Brave yet—and likely won't be unless the company divorces itself from cryptocurrencies entirely.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<h2>More anonymity, if you want it</h2>
<p>The feature that convinced me to start paying for Kagi was its <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/privacy/privacy-pass.html">Privacy Pass</a> option. Based on a clean-sheet Rust implementation of the Privacy Pass standard (IETF RFCs <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9576.html">9576</a>, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9577.html">9577</a>, and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9578.html">9578</a>) by <a href="https://github.com/raphaelrobert/privacypass">Raphael Robert</a>, this is a technology that uses cryptographic token-based auth to send an "I'm a paying user, please give me results" signal to Kagi, without Kagi knowing which user made the request. (There's a much longer <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-privacy-pass">Kagi blog post</a> with actual technical details for the curious.)</p>
<p>To search using the tool, you install the Privacy Pass extension (linked in the docs above) in your browser, log in to Kagi, and enable the extension. This causes the plugin to request a bundle of tokens from the search service. After that, you can log out and/or use private windows, and those tokens are utilized whenever you do a Kagi search.</p>

<p>The obvious flaw here is that Kagi still records source IP addresses along with Privacy Pass searches, potentially de-anonymizing them, but there's a path around that: Privacy Pass functions with <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/privacy/tor.html">Tor</a>, and Kagi maintains <a href="http://kagi2pv5bdcxxqla5itjzje2cgdccuwept5ub6patvmvn3qgmgjd6vid.onion/">a Tor onion address</a> for searches.</p>
<p>So why do I keep using Privacy Pass without Tor, in spite of the opsec flaw? Maybe it's the placebo effect in action, but I feel better about putting at least a tiny bit of friction in the way of someone with root attempting to casually browse my search history. Like, I want there to be at least a SQL <code>JOIN</code> or two between my IP address and my searches for "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/the-correct-alien-sex-choices-in-the-mass-effect-trilogy/">best <em>Mass Effect</em> alien sex choices</a>" or "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/04/hands-on-with-biowares-garrus-vakarian-body-pillow-very-very-hands-on/">cleaning tips for Garrus body pillow</a>." I mean, you know, assuming I were ever to search for such things.</p>
<h2>What’s it like to use?</h2>
<p>Moving on with embarrassed rapidity, let's look at Kagi a bit and see how using it feels.</p>

<p>My anecdotal observation is that Kagi doesn't favor Reddit-based results nearly as much as Google does, but sometimes it still has them near or at the top. And here is where Kagi curb-stomps Google with quality-of-life features: Kagi lets you prioritize or de-prioritize a website's prominence in your search results. You can even pin that site to the top of the screen or block it completely.</p>
<p>This is a feature I've wanted Google to get for about <em>25 damn years</em> but that the company has consistently refused to properly implement (likely because allowing users to exclude sites from search results notionally reduces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement_marketing">engagement</a> and therefore reduces the potential revenue that Google can extract from search). Well, screw you, Google, because Kagi lets me prioritize or exclude sites from my results, and it works <em>great</em>—I'm extraordinarily pleased to never again have to worry about Quora or Pinterest links showing up in my search results.</p>
<p>Further, Kagi lets me adjust these settings both for the current set of search results (if you don't want Reddit results for <em>this</em> search but you don't want to drop Reddit altogether) and also globally (for all future searches):</p>

<p>Another tremendous quality-of-life improvement comes via Kagi's image search, which does a bunch of stuff that Google should and/or used to do—like giving you direct right-click access to save images without having to fight the search engine with workarounds, plugins, or <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a>-esque userscripts.</p>



<p>The Kagi experience is also vastly more customizable than Google's (or at least, how Google's has become). The widgets that appear in your results can be turned off, and the "lenses" through which Kagi sees the web can be adjusted to influence what kinds of things do and do not appear in your results.</p>


<p>If that doesn't do it for you, how about the ability to <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/custom-css.html">inject custom CSS</a> into your search and landing pages? Or to <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/redirects.html">automatically rewrite search result URLs</a> to taste, doing things like redirecting <code>reddit.com</code> to <code>old.reddit.com</code>? Or breaking free of AMP pages and always viewing originals instead?</p>

<h2>Is that all there is?</h2>
<p>Those are really all the features <em>I</em> care about, but there are loads of other Kagi bits to discover—like a Kagi Maps tool (it's pretty good, though I'm not ready to take it up full time yet) and a Kagi video search tool. There are also tons of classic old-Google-style inline search customizations, including <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/verbatim.html">verbatim mode</a>, where instead of trying to infer context about your search terms, Kagi searches for <em>exactly</em> what you put in the box. You can also add custom search operators that do whatever you program them to do, and you get API-based access for doing programmatic things with search.</p>

<p>I haven't spent any time with <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/">Kagi's Orion browser</a>, but it's there as an option for folks who want a WebKit-based browser with baked-in support for Privacy Pass and other Kagi functionality. For now, Firefox continues to serve me well, with Brave as a fallback for working with Google Docs and other tools I can't avoid and that treat non-Chromium browsers like second-class citizens. However, Orion is probably on the horizon for me if things in Mozilla-land <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/firefox-deletes-promise-to-never-sell-personal-data-asks-users-not-to-panic/">continue to sour</a>.</p>

<h2>Cool, but is it any good?</h2>
<p>Rather than fill space with a ton of comparative screenshots between Kagi and Google or Kagi and Bing, I want to talk about my subjective experience using the product. (You can do all the comparison searches you want—<a href="https://kagi.com/">just go and start searching</a>—and your comparisons will be a lot more relevant to your personal use cases than any examples I can dream up!)</p>
<p>My time with Kagi so far has included about seven months of casual opportunistic use, where I'd occasionally throw a query at it to see how it did, and about five months of committed daily use. In the five months of daily usage, I can count on one hand the times I've done a supplementary Google search because Kagi didn't have what I was looking for on the first page of results. I've done searches for all the kinds of things I usually look for in a given day—article fact-checking queries, searches for details about the parts of speech, hunts for duck facts (we have some feral Muscovy ducks nesting in our front yard), obscure technical details about Project Apollo, who the hell played Dupont in <em>Equilibrium</em> (Angus Macfadyen, who also played Robert the Bruce in <em>Braveheart</em>), and many, many other queries.</p>

<p>For all of these things, Kagi has responded quickly and correctly. The time to service a query feels more or less like Google's service times; according to the timer at the top of the page, my Kagi searches complete in between 0.2 and 0.8 seconds. Kagi handles misspellings in search terms with the grace expected of a modern search engine and has had no problem figuring out my typos.</p>
<p>Holistically, taking search customizations into account on top of the actual search performance, my subjective assessment is that Kagi gets me accurate, high-quality results on more or less any given query, and it does so without festooning the results pages with features I find detractive and irrelevant.</p>
<p>I know that's not a data-driven assessment, and it doesn't fall back on charts or graphs or figures, but it's how I feel after using the product every single day for most of 2025 so far. For me, Kagi's search performance is firmly in the "good enough" category, and that's what I need.</p>
<h2>Kagi and AI</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the thing that's stopping me from being completely effusive in my praise is that Kagi is exhibiting a disappointing amount of "keeping-up-with-the-Joneses" by rolling out a big 'ol pile of (optional, so far) AI-enabled search features.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-ai-search">blog post from founder Vladimir Prelovac</a> talks about the company's use of AI, and it says all the right things, but at this point, I trust written statements from tech company founders about as far as I can throw their corporate office buildings. (And, dear reader, that ain't very far).</p>

<p>The short version is that, like Google, Kagi has some AI features: There's an AI search results summarizer, an AI page summarizer, and an "ask questions about your results" chatbot-style function where you can interactively interrogate an LLM about your search topic and results. So far, all of these things can be disabled or ignored. I don't know how good any of the features are because I have disabled or ignored them.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>If the existence of AI in a product is a bright red line you won't cross, you'll have to turn back now and find another search engine alternative that doesn't use AI and also doesn't suck. When/if you do, let me know, because the pickings are slim.</p>
<h2>Is Kagi for you?</h2>
<p>Kagi <em>might</em> be for you—especially if you've recently typed a simple question into Google and gotten back a pile of fabricated gibberish in place of those 10 blue links that used to serve so well. Are you annoyed that Google's search sucks vastly more now than it did 10 years ago? Are you unhappy with how difficult it is to get Google search to do what you want? Are you fed up? Are you <em>pissed off</em>?</p>
<p>If your answer to those questions is the same full-throated "Hell yes, I am!" that mine was, then perhaps it's time to try an alternative. And Kagi's a pretty decent one—if you're not averse to paying for it.</p>
<p>It's a fantastic feeling to type in a search query and once again get useful, relevant, non-AI results (that I can customize!). It's a bit of sanity returning to my Internet experience, and I'm grateful. Until Kagi is bought by a value-destroying vampire VC fund or implodes into its own AI-driven enshittification cycle, I'll probably keep paying for it.</p>
<p>After that, who knows? Maybe I'll throw away my computers and live in a cave. At least until the cave's robot exclusion protocol fails and <a href="https://www.ftrain.com/robot_exclusion_protocol">the Googlebot comes for me</a>.</p>

<p>Curing Your AI 10x Engineer Imposter Syndrome</p>

<ul>
	<li><time datetime="2025-08-05">05 August 2025</time></li>

</ul>

<p>A few months ago I went through a bit of a mental slump. I've always been confident of my abilities as an engineer, but I couldn't help but feel like my skills were falling hopelessly behind as I scrolled places like LinkedIn and Twitter. If these sources were to be believed, engineering had moved on from the medieval practice of typing code into an editor. <em>Real</em> engineers were now 10-100x more productive than I was. I'm writing this hoping to help others who are feeling similar anxieties.</p>
<p>I'm a skeptical person so I don't usually fall over myself immediately when I hear a claim like that. I usually roll my eyes in the same way I do when someone tells me a simple herbal remedy cures all disease. But the sheer volume these 10x engineer claims are reaching right now started to hit a nerve. What if I'm <em>wrong</em>? Will I miss the bus and become unemployable if I don't learn to use AI right now? After all, there are a lot of fancy words going around that distance the "AI" these people are talking about with the "AI" I was familiar with.</p>
<p>These people were using <em>✨agentic✨</em> AI. They were using <em>✨thinking✨</em> models that surfed the internet, ran tests, and corrected their own mistakes. Sure I popped into a chat window here and there and asked it to write some code, then promptly discarded most of the output once I got the idea that I needed. But these engineers were letting Claude fully take the wheel and had agents ripping 5 PRs for them while they made morning coffee. Was I becoming a dinosaur, an old man yelling at cloud?</p>
<p>Part of what made me feel so anxious was that it was entirely possible AI changed without me knowing it because I didn't use AI very much. Because I didn't <em>like</em> using AI that much. Reviewing code is vastly less enjoyable process than writing it. Had my stubborn desire to <em>enjoy coding</em> set me up to be left behind?</p>
<h2 id="diving-in">Diving In</h2>
<p>Eventually I hit a breaking point and decided I simply had to dive in head first to AI coding. I tried Claude Code, Cursor, Roo Code, and Zed for their agentic coding promises. I started asking AI to write all sorts of code in all sorts of projects. I tried the different models and compared them. I even vibe coded a few things, not editing the code manually once.</p>
<p>And it was... Fine. Despite claims that AI today is improving at a fever pitch, it felt largely the same as before. It's good at writing boilerplate, especially in Javascript, and particularly in React. It's not good at keeping up with the standards and utilities of your codebase. It tends to struggle with languages like Terraform. It still hallucinates libraries leading to significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slopsquatting">security vulnerabilities</a>.</p>
<p>AIs still struggle to absorb the context of a larger codebase, even with a great prompt and <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file. If you use a library that isn't StackOverflow's favorite it will butcher it even after an agentic lookup of the documentation. Agents occasionally do something neat like fix the tests they broke. Often they just waste time and tokens, going back and forth with themselves not seeming to gain any deeper knowledge each time they fail. Thus, AI's best use case for me remains writing one-off scripts. Especially when I have no interest in learning deeper fundamentals for a single script, like when writing a custom ESLint rule.</p>
<p>Dark warnings that if I didn't start using AI now I'd be hopelessly behind proved unfounded. Using AI to code is not hard to learn. Obviously? Well, the AI coding community seems split on whether AI makes coding so easy a caveman can do it and that it requires an advanced, dedicated prompt engineer skillset. There are a few things you need to learn but they come quickly. You learn how to split up tasks into smaller pieces so the AI doesn't lose its mind late in the context window. Tools like Claude Code can do a bit of this themselves, even, though not always reliably. And you learn to identify when the AI is too far off and it's time to take the wheel.</p>
<p>A competent engineer will figure this stuff out in less than a week of moderate AI usage. Further, if AI is about to get 2x, 10x, or 100x better at any minute (as everyone keeps saying it will), then any lessons about how to use it now are moot for the future.</p>
<p>Every time I encountered AI working "just okay", it strangely made me more anxious, not less. It meant I couldn't find the spicy secret sauce that made everyone else so productive. I just didn't have what it takes: dinosaur, meet asteroid, thy name is AI. Eventually, a few things shook me out of this slump. One of those was <a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/contra-ptaceks-terrible-article-on-ai/">this article</a> from Ludicity, directly countering the claims of the AI pumpers. I write this article to share more things that helped me get out of the AI 10x engineer imposter syndrome.</p>
<h2 id="the-math">The Math</h2>
<p>Let's start by looking at the simple math of 10-100x productivity. 10x productivity means ten times the outcomes, not ten times the lines of code. This means what you used to ship in a quarter you now ship in a week and a half. These numbers should make even the truest AI believer pause. The amount of product ideation, story point negotiation, bugfixing, code review, waiting for deployments, testing, and QA in that go into what was traditionally 3 months of work is now getting done in 7 work days? For that to happen each and every one of these bottlenecks has to also seen have 10x productivity gains.</p>
<p>Any software engineer who has worked on actual code in an actual company knows this isn't possible. You can't compress the back and forth of 3 months of code review into 1.5 weeks. When you code review you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tag your reviewer</li>
<li>Hope they will get to it sooner rather than later (which will be tough because they are apparently code reviewing 10x as much code as before)</li>
<li>Context switch to something else while you wait</li>
<li>See a notification (perhaps immediately, perhaps 2 hours after your reviewer went offline for the day)</li>
<li>Context switch back to the review</li>
<li>Read their comments</li>
<li>Respond accordingly</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process can be made fairly efficient at a competent company with good standards and communication practices. But you're telling me you made this process <strong>10 times</strong> as efficient to handle 10x the work? This simply can not be done.</p>
<p>The human processes involved in actual corporate software engineering have not changed significantly. Product managers might use ChatGPT to do "research" but they aren't suddenly pumping out ten times as many well vetted, well justified, well estimated stories as they did before. They can not do 10 user interviews all at once. The same goes for Designers and QA testers. Hiring 10x the number of PMs to keep up isn't feasible. Each hire has diminishing returns as network effects and bureaucracy take hold.</p>
<p>Even if we assume people mean only the actual code writing process is now 10-100x faster, we should still be skeptical of how this maths out. When you write code, how much of your time do you truly spend pushing buttons on the keyboard? It's probably less than you think. Much of your prime coding time is actually reading and thinking, often while waiting for compiling, a page refresh, or for tests to run. LLMs do not make <code>rustc</code> go faster.</p>
<p>What LLMs produce is often broken, hallucinated, or below codebase standards. The frequency of these errors go up with the size of the codebase. When that happens you have to re-prompt, which could instantly fix the problem or could be a huge waste of time. Or you can go in and fix the code yourself. But then you're back to measly 1x engineer status, perhaps worse if you've gotten so used to vibe coding you <a href="https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-and-learning">forgot how to code</a>. If you're "embracing the vibes" and not even looking at the code produced, you're simply going to hit a productivity wall once the codebase gets large enough. And once you do you'll have to reckon with the complete lack of standards and proper abstractions.</p>
<p>I think sometimes people lose the scale of just how big a 10x improvement is. 10x is the difference between your mini-van and a record setting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThrustSSC">supersonic land jet</a>. Imagine trying to drive your 10 minute commute down your city streets in a car that goes 600mph. Will you get to the other side of town in one tenth the time? No, because even a single 60 second stoplight will eat up your entire time budget. F1 cars slow down to mini-van speeds in basic turns. It turns out that most of any activity is not spent going at top speed.</p>
<p>100x productivity means you now do what used to be one year of work in two days. I shouldn't even need to touch the ludicrousness of numbers at that scale.</p>
<h2 id="do-10x-engineers-exist">Do 10x Engineers Exist?</h2>
<p>This debate isn't something I want to weigh in on but I might have to. My answer is sometimes, kinda. When I have had engineers who were 10x as valuable as others it was primarily due to their ability to <em>prevent unnecessary work</em>. Talking a PM down from a task that was never feasible. Getting another engineer to not build that unnecessary microservice. Making developer experience investments that save everyone just a bit of time on every task. Documenting your work so that every future engineer can jump in faster. These things can add up over time to one engineer saving 10x the time company wide than what they took to build it.</p>
<p>Work of this nature is not always available, so great engineers will only find themselves being 10x as productive in certain situations. At a certain point every engineer just needs to build features, which a great engineer might do twice as fast as a junior engineer, but they'll still hit the same bottlenecks as before. Flawed as story points are, I've never seen an engineer actually complete ten times as many as an average engineer consistently.</p>
<p>Notably, AI coding assistants do very little to prevent unnecessary work. On the contrary, AI often seems to encourage hastiness and over-building. When I ask architectural questions, it often recommends something that I realize is not necessary after a good night's sleep or a talk with a great engineer. All other things held the same, is a faster coder a better engineer? Yes, but it's not the 10x difference maker and it's hard to hold everything else constant. The more you focus on pumping out tasks as fast as possible the easier is to miss the important time savers that reduce total work.</p>
<h2 id="so-are-the-ai-posters-lying-or-what">So are the AI-posters lying or what?</h2>
<p>I think the AI-posters are a mix of the following, in order of least to most malevolent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good-natured folks who are mismeasuring themselves and others</li>
<li>People heavily invested, personally or financially, in the success of AI (AI startup founders, investors, etc.)</li>
<li>Bosses outright trying to make their engineers feel precarious so they don't quit, look for other jobs, or ask for raises</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-good-natured-engineer-with-bad-math-skills">The good-natured engineer with bad math skills</h3>
<p>In my experience, AI delivers rare, short bursts of 10-100x productivity. When I have AI write me a custom ESLint rule in a few minutes, which would have taken hours of documentation surfing and tutorials otherwise, that's a genuine order of magnitude time and effort improvement. Moments like this do happen with AI. Many career non-coders have felt the magic in the first few days after spinning an app up with Lovable.</p>
<p>The problem is that productivity does not scale. I don't write more than one ESLint rule per year. This burst of productivity was enabled solely by the fact that I didn't care about this code and wasn't going to work to make it readable for the next engineer. If constantly writing ESLint rules became a core job requirement I'd sink the one-time cost to learn how ESLint internals work. After that, there simply wouldn't be a big difference in the time it takes to vibe code a rule vs. write it myself, especially when you add in the extra time to make my code human readable for when I come back to this file in 6 months.</p>
<p>Eventually every vibe coder reaches the point where the returns start heavily diminishing. Their <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/03/18/guys-im-under-attack-ai-vibe-coding-in-the-wild/">site gets hacked</a> and they need to actually sink the time to learn how security works. The app gets too big for context windows and things start looking and functioning inconsistently. Real frontend engineers who know what they are doing are hired to implement a consistent design system and UX.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of simple biases and blind spots that can cause a productivity illusion. If you leave the depths of big corporate for a startup you will genuinely be shocked at how much more productive each engineer is. It's easy to credit this to AI. Some people really enjoy the technological novelty of AI coding and when you are working in something new you often feel like you're doing more than you ever did. I know the first time I used Python I felt like I was "sipping rocket fuel", but, as with all other technologies, it always comes back down to earth.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the more genuine 10x AI hype is coming from people who are simply in the honeymoon phase or haven't sat down to actually consider what 10x improvement means mathematically. I wouldn't be surprised to learn AI helps many engineers do certain tasks 20-50% faster, but the nature of software bottlenecks mean this doesn't translate to a 20% productivity increase and certainly not a 10x increase.</p>
<h3 id="incentives-matter">Incentives matter</h3>
<p>Look, I'm not an AI startup hater. If you want to plug OpenAI's API into your healthcare startup I might raise an eyebrow of concern over the risks, but I'd do the same for any startup desiring to move fast and break things in the medical field. My goal here isn't to say AI startup founders or investors are evil or even dishonest. My point is to say in the droll voice of your high school Econ 101 professor, "Incentives Matter".</p>
<p>If you are running an AI startup and every other AI startup is telling investors they are seeing 10x more productivity thanks to AI, the incentives are plain and simple: you should say the same publicly and privately. If your company is built on the back of AI, you are incentivized to sell AI as a miracle solution in every part of life. If you are an engineer at an AI startup and your boss asks you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, you're getting 10x the productivity thanks to AI, just like all the other engineers, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are strongly incentivized to say yes. And when every other engineer also says yes for the same reason, that CEO <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn_PSJsl0LQ">isn't lying</a>, they are just relaying what they heard.</p>
<p>What I'd like to stress to those feeling anxiety like me is that this is nothing new. CEOs are not unbiased sources. Executives have been claiming that everything from Agile to Meyers-Briggs have unlocked limitless productivity. There will always be a new synergistic buzzword on LinkedIn, don't let it get you down. In fact, stop scrolling LinkedIn at all. It's a silly place.</p>
<h3 id="outright-malice">Outright Malice</h3>
<p>When something is said that makes people feel anxious, at least some of the time you should conclude it's because that's what the speaker wanted to happen. Bosses trying to make their engineers feel like their position is precarious is also nothing new. We all remember the narrative that a 3 month coding bootcamp could churn out 4-year-degree quality engineers, so you'd best not get too uppity or you'll be replaced with a bachelor of arts doing a career pivot. Then a few years went by and people realized that bootcamp grads were usually <a href="https://www.sandofsky.com/lambda-school/">woefully underprepared</a> for actual software engineering since they were not given the proper foundation.</p>
<p>Bootcamps and AI are just examples in a long series of poorly born out threats to commoditize the highly expensive, highly professionalized field of software engineering. They are rhetorical devices designed to imply precarity. Your boss can't actually fire you and replace you with AI, but he can make you <em>feel</em> like he <em>could</em>, and maybe not ask for that raise.</p>
<p>Some amount of the 10x AI engineer story is likely being told by people who simply want you to feel bad for this purpose. How much of it, I don't know. Despite how highly distrustful we've become of each other in these times, I still believe most people are fundamentally decent, so I'm not inclined to believe it's a high percentage.</p>
<h2 id="degrees-of-separation">Degrees of separation</h2>
<p>One thing I've noticed about all these characters in AI coding hype pieces is there is almost always a degree of separation from the writer to the actual productivity benefits. The poster is a founder, or a manager, or an investor, making grandiose claims about someone else's productivity. There's nothing wrong with secondary sources but if you can't find a primary source, you might start questioning the reliability of the information.</p>
<p>Presentations from actual engineers demonstrating how they achieve more productivity with AI are much more varied and much more muted in their praise. These demos show largely AI as the same technology you and I were familiar with before we got so anxious: a neat text generator that sometimes does magic but often requires you to take the wheel.</p>
<p>AI usage on open source projects, where the productive process can be publicly witnessed, has famously been a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/">hilarious failure</a>. I have learned things about how to use AI better from a few youtube videos. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQYXZCUvpIc">Here's</a> a good one referenced in that Ludicity article above. I'll spoil it for you though, this engineer has not found the fountain of coding productivity.</p>
<h2 id="its-okay-to-be-less-productive">It's okay to be less productive</h2>
<p>Even after I got over the idea that there was a secret clade of engineer who was now ten times as productive and strong and tall and sexy as I was, I still felt some anxiety over the fact that I still didn't enjoy using AI very much. Vibe coding is a complete bore once the magic wears off. Reading LLM generated code sucks. Asking it politely to use a not hallucinated library is painful. But what if I was, despite all that, 20% more productive vibe coding than regular coding? Would it be wrong for me to do "normal" coding if a higher output path is available?</p>
<p>No. It's okay to sacrifice some productivity to make work enjoyable. More than okay, it's <em>essential</em> in our field. If you force yourself to work in a way you hate, you're just going to burn out. Only so much of coding is writing code, the rest is solving problems, doing system design, reasoning about abstractions, and interfacing with other humans. You are better at all those things when you feel good. It's okay to feel pride in your work and appreciate the craft. Over the long term your codebase will benefit from it.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if digital music sounds objectively better than vinyl. It doesn't matter if flipping the record is less "productive" than letting the streaming service automatically roll over to the next song in 100x less time. If listening to a 70 year old disk makes you happier, just do it. You'll listen to more music if you do that than you would by forcing yourself to use the more "productive" streaming service. You will spend more time writing code and you'll write better code if you do it the way you like to.</p>
<p>Oh, and this exact argument works in reverse. If you feel good doing AI coding, just do it. If you feel so excited that you code more than ever before, that's awesome. I want everyone to feel that way, regardless of how they get there.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-be-a-good-ai-leader">How to be a good AI leader</h2>
<p>Making all your engineers feel constantly anxious about their performance is <em>bad for your company</em>. It will make your engineers not want to work for you. This is a recipe for short term thinking that will encourage engineers to max out bad metrics, like lines of code. Code review will get neglected, tech debt will compound, and in the long term the whole company will be footing the bill of those errors.</p>
<p>Unrealistic 10x expectations will result in rushed and thus subpar work without fail. Engineers need to have room to breathe. Room to take a little bit more time to do the thing right. Good codebases and good companies are built on a healthy balance of thinking for today and tomorrow. I'm thankful to work at one of these companies right now, but many aren't so fortunate.</p>
<p>Do not scold engineers for not using enough tokens. Your engineers are highly educated professionals in an extremely competitive field. Software engineers are already infamous for an over-eager cycle of embracing and abandoning new languages and tools. If you are paying these people this much, you should have the trust in them that if a super amazing productivity boost becomes available, they'll <em>come to you</em> asking for the pro plan. If you're worried about missing out on all the AI coding gains everyone else seems to be getting, sign up for a LLM team plan, host a training session, and see what comes out of it. That's all you need to do.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is no secret herbal medicine that prevents all disease sitting out in the open if you just follow the right Facebook groups. There is no AI coding revolution available if you just start vibing. You are not missing anything. Trust yourself. You are enough.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't scroll LinkedIn. Or Twitter. Ever.</p>

The tree houses vary in size and design, some resembling whimsical castles, others cozy cabins. Tiny details, like glowing windows and miniature balconies, add to their charm. A winding path, barely visible beneath the undergrowth, leads the viewer's eye deeper into the enchanted forest. The overall scene evokes a sense of wonder, tranquility, and the magic of childhood dreams.</p>

    <p data-block-key="qmqby"><strong>Prompt:</strong> A serene Irish landscape, with rolling emerald-green hills, misty lakes, and rugged mountains, suddenly trembles violently—as if the earth itself is being torn apart. In a moment of surreal chaos, entire sections of land rip free, rising into the sky in jagged, brutalist formations, their rocky undersides exposed like raw, fractured earth. The lakes are wrenched upward, now suspended in the sky, their waters spilling downward in colossal waterfalls, creating an apocalyptic storm of mist and rain over the land below. The camera pulls back, revealing a new impossible geography—mountains floating, cliffs inverted, rivers twisting mid-air—as gravity itself bends, turning the once-peaceful countryside into a brutalist, surreal monument to nature’s violent transformation.</p>

During the auto-regressive generation of each frame, the model has to take into account the previously generated trajectory that grows with time. For example, if the user is revisiting a location after a minute, the model has to refer back to the relevant information from a minute ago. To achieve real-time interactivity, this computation must happen multiple times per second in response to new user inputs as they arrive.</p>

However, generating an environment auto-regressively is generally a harder technical problem than generating an entire video, since inaccuracies tend to accumulate over time. Despite the challenge, Genie 3 environments remain largely consistent for several minutes, with visual memory extending as far back as one minute ago.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><strong>VIENNA, Austria – August 05, 2025 –</strong> Leading open-source server solutions provider Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH (henceforth "Proxmox"), celebrating its 20th year of innovation, today announced the release of Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) 9.0. Main highlight of this update is a modernized core built upon Debian 13 “Trixie”, ensuring a robust foundation for the platform.</p>
<p>Proxmox VE 9.0 further introduces significant advancements in both storage and networking capabilities, addressing critical enterprise demands. A highlight is the long-awaited support for snapshots on thick-provisioned LVM shared storage, improving storage management capabilities especially for enterprise users with Fibre Channel (FC) or iSCSI SAN environments. With newly added “fabric” support for Software-Defined Networking (SDN), administrators can construct highly complex and scalable network architectures.</p>
<h2>Highlights in Proxmox Virtual Environment 9.0</h2>
<p>Debian 13 “Trixie” at the core</p>
<p>This core update is based on Debian 13 “Trixie”, bringing the latest Debian release as foundation for Proxmox VE including newer packages, improved hardware support, and enhanced security. Proxmox VE is using a newer Linux kernel 6.14.8-2 as stable default enhancing hardware compatibility and performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, updates to the latest versions of leading open-source technologies for virtual environments like QEMU 10.0.2, LXC 6.0.4, Ceph Squid 19.2.3, and ZFS 2.3.3 are included. ZFS now supports adding new devices to existing RAIDZ pools with minimal downtime. For existing users of Proxmox VE 8.4 or older versions, an extensively tested and detailed upgrade path is available to enable a smooth upgrade.</p>
<p>Snapshots for thick-provisioned LVM shared storage</p>
<p>Virtual Machines (VMs) utilizing thick-provisioned LVM shared storages, such as those backed by iSCSI or FC-based SANs, now benefit from snapshot functionality out of the box. This is achieved by implementing snapshots as volume chains, where a volume based on a snapshot only records differences to its parent snapshot volume. Directory, NFS, and CIFS storages also gain additional support for snapshots as volume chains.</p>
<p>This new feature provides a powerful and highly requested capability for customers with traditional SAN infrastructure who have historically relied on clustered file systems. While direct integrations from many storage vendors continue to grow, this new feature closes the gap by providing a storage-independent solution for snapshots. This gives customers the independence to seamlessly manage their snapshots regardless of their hardware, without compromising on convenience.</p>
<p>New Fabrics feature for the SDN stack</p>
<p>This release enhances the SDN capabilities with the introduction of an SDN Fabrics feature, designed to simplify the configuration and management of complex routed networks. Engineered for reliability, SDN Fabrics facilitates multiple paths between nodes and automatic failover across Network Interface Cards (NICs), enabling the configuration of robust two-layer spine-leaf architectures for improved network redundancy and performance.</p>
<p>This new feature simplifies the management of dynamically routed networks which can for example be used as Ethernet VPN (EVPN) underlay or full-mesh networks for Ceph. The SDN stack in Proxmox VE gains support for two different routing protocols, OpenFabric and OSPF, and provides intuitive tools for the simplified configuration and precise management of those dynamic routing protocols.</p>
<p>Affinity rules in High Availability (HA) clusters</p>
<p>The Proxmox team introduces HA resource affinity rules to enable fine-grained control and flexibility over resource placement in HA clusters, ensuring optimal performance, enhanced resiliency, and minimized latency for critical workloads. To better control complex, interconnected applications, the new HA Resource Affinity Rules allow administrators to precisely define how virtual machines and other HA resources are distributed across a cluster.</p>
<p>Interdependent HA resources, such as for example an application server and its associated database, can be kept together on the same physical node to minimize network latency. For services requiring maximum redundancy, like multiple VMs running the same mission-critical application, the rules can ensure these instances are kept on different nodes. This increases fault tolerance and ensures resiliency even during HA failovers.</p>
<p>Enhanced mobile interface</p>
<p>The Proxmox VE mobile interface has been thoroughly reworked, using the new Proxmox widget toolkit powered by the Rust-based Yew framework. The redesigned interface provides quick access to service overviews and includes essential management functions, including starting and stopping virtual guests and basic configuration. It is now easier than ever for users to access fundamental functionalities of Proxmox VE directly from their mobile browsers.</p>
<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>Proxmox VE 9.0 is available for download.&nbsp;The ISO contains the complete feature-set and can be installed on bare-metal. The virtualization platform from Proxmox comes stocked with all the essential management tools, as well as an easy-to-use, web-based user interface. This allows for simple, out-of-the-box management of the host, either through the command line or a standard web browser.</p>
<p>Seamless upgrade instructions from Proxmox VE 8 to 9 are available. It’s also possible to install Proxmox VE 9.0 on top of Debian.</p>
<p>License: Proxmox Virtual Environment is free and open-source software, published under the GNU Affero General Public License, v3.<br>Support Subscriptions: For enterprise users, Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH offers a subscription-based support model, which provides access to the extensively tested Enterprise Repository, with regular updates via the web interface, as well as technical support on a subscription basis. Prices start at EUR 115 per year and CPU.</p>

  <h5>4 Aug 2025</h5>



  

  
  
  



<p>There’s something icky about LLM-generated text when you think it’s written by a human. I think I finally put my finger on one reason why I feel this way.</p>
<p>Note on the title: “Artificial Inanity” comes from Neal Stephenson’s novel <em>Anathem</em>.</p>
<p>At work I was sent a long design document and asked for my thoughts on it. As I read, I had a really hard time following it. Eventually I guessed correctly (confirmed via a follow-up conversation I had with the “author”<label for="sn1"></label>

<span>
I have “author” in quotes because, if a machine wrote it, you don’t merit being called the <em>author</em> of the work.
</span>
) that an LLM had generated the majority of the document. Parts of it <em>sounded</em> like a decent design document, but there was just way too much fluff that served only to confuse me.</p>
<p>When I read technical documents, I read to understand the content. In this mode of reading, I operate under the assumption that the author had a reason for choosing the words they did, and that every sentence is there to convey something that the author wishes me to understand.</p>
<p>This mode fails when an LLM or the like has generated the text. When I read something I know came out of a computer’s probabilistic sampling of a token-space, I have read knowing that every statement might be some hallucinated slop or incidental filler. I <em>cannot</em> trust that the human operator’s intent is expressed by the machine. In fact, I am confident that it is often <em>not</em>, but I have to waste tremendous effort trying to find that gap. Reading slop text when I think I’m reading real text is exhausting: since I am not on the alert for hallucinations or irrelevancies, every turn of phrase that seems out of place causes me to wonder <em>why that phrase it there</em> and <em>what am I missing</em> when in reality, such questions are ill formed: that was just a phrase composed by accident that <em>sounds</em> good but actually is devoid of much intent at all.</p>
<p><em>Intent</em> is the core thing: the <em>lack</em> of intent is what makes reading AI-slop so revolting. There needs to be a human intent—human will and human care—behind everything that is demanded of our care and attention. Even if you agree with Rolland Barthes’<label for="sn2"></label>

<span>
The author of <em>The Death of the Author</em>, an essay where Barthes argues that focusing on the author’s intent is fruitless—the meaning of a text is the effect it has on the audience.
</span>
views on literary criticism, the fact that there <em>is</em> an author who put care and intent into a work imbues that work with infinitely more meaning than if it were spat out by a machine.</p>
<p>Counterfeits to human connection will—unfortunately—always be in demand. The multi-billion dollar industry churning out pornography is proof enough. People will probably always, from here on out, be using LLMs to cheat their way through classes and themselves out of learning. Some might turn to them for some faux-companionship. Others will be prompting themselves to death by offloading more and more of their reasoning to machines, convinced that the computer—like a slot machine—somehow will let them win bigger in life.</p>
<p>I am <strong>not</strong> saying that LLMs are worthless—they are marvels of engineering and can solve some particularly thorny problems that have confounded us for decades. But it’s important to remember that, no matter how capable these machines get, they are not humans. And no human is so worthless as to be replaceable with a machine.</p></article>

TSMC fired the individuals concerned and is now taking legal action against them. The former employees may also face criminal prosecution.</p>



<p>The report relates to the company’s 2-nanometer chip process, which is expected to be used for the A20 chips across next year’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 18</a> lineup …</p>

<h2 id="h-tsmc-says-employees-tried-to-steal-trade-secrets">TSMC says employees tried to steal trade secrets</h2>



<p><em><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/tsmc-fires-workers-for-breaching-data-rules-on-cutting-edge-chip-tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikkei Asia</a></em> reports that TSMC accused several former employees of attempting to obtain secret information about its 2nm chip development and production process.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Several former employees of TSMC are suspected of attempting to obtain critical proprietary information on 2-nanometer chip development and production while working at the company, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.</p>



<p>In response to Nikkei Asia’s questions, TSMC said that it recently “detected unauthorized activities during routine monitoring, leading to the discovery of potential trade secret leaks.”</p>



<p>The world’s top chipmaker said on Monday it took “strict disciplinary actions against the personnel involved and has initiated legal proceedings.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The attempt was detected by spotting “unusual access patterns” on the part of one of the employees.</p>



<p>The report says there could even be national security implications, as the Taiwanese government takes extremely seriously the protection of advanced technology developed within the country. Prosecutors have confirmed that they are investigating, and TSMC says that it will seek prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.</p>



<p>No details have been shared on the nature of the information obtained. It is likely that it relates to the 2nm process in general rather than anything specific to Apple’s A20 chip.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/en/basics/release-note/v6-feature/">https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/en/basics/release-note/v6-feature/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44794926">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article> <p>Twelve years ago, ECharts was first released on GitHub, planting the seed for an open-source journey.</p> <p>From a simple charting tool to a visualization powerhouse supporting millions of developers; from a single front-end charting library to a comprehensive technology system covering mobile, large screens, and server-side rendering—over these 12 years, we've witnessed ECharts' continuous technical breakthroughs and have been delighted to see developers worldwide create countless stunning data stories with ECharts.</p> <p>Now, Apache ECharts 6.0 is officially released, bringing 12 major upgrades to take your data visualization to the next level.</p> <h2 id="feature-overview" tabindex="-1">Feature Overview</h2> <p>Twelve years of accumulation, all for more ultimate visual expression. The core strength of Apache ECharts has always come from a deep understanding of developers' real challenges. When defining the direction for 6.0, the question was clear: <strong>How can we make complex data presentation both powerful and elegant?</strong></p> <p>This drove us to evolve deeply around three core dimensions:</p> <ul><li><strong>More professional visual presentation</strong>: From a meticulously crafted default theme to intelligent dark mode switching, ensuring charts have a professional look and seamlessly integrate into modern applications.</li> <li><strong>Expanding the boundaries of data expression</strong>: New chart types and features to handle complex scenarios and enable intuitive expression of deep data.</li> <li><strong>Unleashing freedom of composition</strong>: From the revolutionary matrix coordinate system to reusable custom series and optimized axis labels—empowering developers to freely compose and turn creativity into unconstrained visual works.</li></ul> <p>We have made 12 upgrades across these three core dimensions. These are not just simple feature additions, but a solid foundation for building the next generation of data-driven applications. They all point to one goal: <strong>to make ECharts powerful, reliable, and stable in the background, leaving the stage and spotlight for your creative expression.</strong></p> <p>Below, we introduce these twelve upgrades in detail:</p> <ul><li><strong>More professional visual presentation</strong> <ul><li><strong>1. Brand New Default Theme</strong>: Modern design language for professional data expression</li> <li><strong>2. Dynamic Theme Switching</strong>: Seamless runtime theme switching for multi-theme scenarios</li> <li><strong>3. Dark Mode Support</strong>: Automatically adapts to system dark/light mode for better UX</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Expanding the boundaries of data expression</strong> <ul><li><strong>4. New Chord Chart</strong>: Visualize complex relationships and distributions</li> <li><strong>5. New Beeswarm Chart</strong>: Smartly expand overlapping data points into a honeycomb layout</li> <li><strong>6. New Scatter Jittering</strong>: Add jitter to scatter plots for better readability of dense data</li> <li><strong>7. New Broken Axis</strong>: Easily present data with large magnitude differences</li> <li><strong>8. Enhanced Stock Trading Charts</strong>: Improved label capabilities and more out-of-the-box trading charts</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Unleashing freedom of composition</strong> <ul><li><strong>9. New Matrix Coordinate System</strong>: Freely combine chart types and components like a table</li> <li><strong>10. Enhanced Custom Series</strong>: Support npm publishing and dynamic registration for code reuse</li> <li><strong>11. New Custom Charts</strong>: Violin, contour, stage, bar range, and line range charts</li> <li><strong>12. Axis Label Optimization</strong>: Smarter default axis label layout to prevent overflow and overlap</li></ul></li></ul> <p>With these upgrades, Apache ECharts 6.0 helps users create more charts more flexibly and conveniently, truly achieving "unlimited possibilities in charting"!</p> <h2 id="feature-details" tabindex="-1">Feature Details</h2> <h3 id="1.-brand-new-default-theme" tabindex="-1">1. Brand New Default Theme</h3> <p>During the development of ECharts 6.0, we analyzed real user scenarios and found that over 70% of developers use the default theme. This made us realize: an excellent default theme should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also meet the general needs of various business scenarios.</p> <p>The new theme system uses design tokens to reconstruct colors, spacing, and other design elements, <strong>making different chart types and components more harmonious and consistent</strong>.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/1-default-theme.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/1-default-theme.png"> <p>Although the 6.0 theme has significant changes from 5.x, we provide a <a href="https://github.com/apache/echarts/blob/master/theme/v5.js">v5.js</a> theme file for developers who want to use new features but keep the old style for quick migration.</p> <h3 id="2.-dynamic-theme-switching" tabindex="-1">2. Dynamic Theme Switching</h3> <p>In previous versions, changing a chart's theme required disposing of the chart instance and re-initializing, which could negatively impact user experience due to repeated animations. In the new version, we implemented <strong>dynamic theme switching</strong> (see documentation), significantly improving the user experience.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/2-switch-themes.gif" width="600px"> <h3 id="3.-dark-mode-support" tabindex="-1">3. Dark Mode Support</h3> <p>With dynamic theme registration and switching, a typical scenario is <strong>listening to the system's dark mode and dynamically adjusting the chart's theme</strong>.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/3-responsive-themes.gif" width="600px"> <p>This is crucial for business scenarios supporting dark mode, ensuring the application interface matches the system theme and greatly enhancing user experience.</p> <p>Here's how to listen for system dark mode and change the chart theme:</p> <div><pre><code><span>const</span> darkModeMediaQuery <span>=</span> window<span>.</span><span>matchMedia</span><span>(</span><span>'(prefers-color-scheme: dark)'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>function</span> <span>updateDarkMode</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div> <h3 id="4.-new-chord-chart" tabindex="-1">4. New Chord Chart</h3> <p>Chord charts intuitively show flows and weights in complex relationship networks, ideal for scenarios like financial transactions and social networks. ECharts innovatively supports <strong>using gradient colors from source and target nodes for edges, creating unique visual effects</strong>. See <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#series-chord">series-chord</a>.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/4-chord.gif" width="600px"> <h3 id="5.-new-beeswarm-chart" tabindex="-1">5. New Beeswarm Chart</h3> <p>Traditional scatter plots can become overcrowded on category axes. Beeswarm charts use non-numeric axis offsets to <strong>distribute points without overlap while preserving value axis accuracy</strong>. Set <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#xAxis.jitter">jitter</a> to a non-zero value and <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#xAxis.jitterOverlap">jitterOverlap</a> to <code>false</code> to enable beeswarm charts.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/5-beeswarm.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/5-beeswarm.png"> <h3 id="6.-new-scatter-jittering" tabindex="-1">6. New Scatter Jittering</h3> <p>Scatter jittering adds random offsets to non-data dimensions, <strong>solving the problem of overly dense data points</strong>.</p> <p>Without jittering, it's hard to see the distribution when data is dense:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/6-jittering-off.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/6-jittering-off.png"> <p>With jittering enabled, the densest range (6-8) becomes clear. Compared to beeswarm, scatter jittering offers better performance.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/6-jittering-on.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/6-jittering-on.png"> <p>Set <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#xAxis.jitter">jitter</a> to a non-zero value and <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#xAxis.jitterOverlap">jitterOverlap</a> to <code>true</code> to enable scatter jittering.</p> <h3 id="7.-new-broken-axis" tabindex="-1">7. New Broken Axis</h3> <p>Broken axis is a visualization technique for showing data with large magnitude differences. In ECharts 6.0, we innovatively implemented a <strong>torn-paper effect for broken axes</strong>, making the meaning more intuitive, and supporting click-to-expand to restore the real data ratio.</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/7-break-axis.gif" width="600px"> <h3 id="8.-enhanced-stock-trading-charts" tabindex="-1">8. Enhanced Stock Trading Charts</h3> <p>ECharts 6.0 deeply optimizes for financial trading scenarios, enhancing label positioning relative to coordinate systems to help developers quickly build professional-grade trading analysis tools.</p> <p>Below is a comprehensive stock trading chart using ECharts, combining <strong>time-sharing, MACD, volume, order book, and depth chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/8-stock.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/8-stock.png"> <p>These examples help developers quickly meet financial trading needs. For example, displaying numbers in the four corners of the chart can be achieved with <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/$%7BoptionPathseries-line.markPoint.data.relativeTo">relativeTo</a>.</p> <h3 id="9.-new-matrix-coordinate-system" tabindex="-1">9. New Matrix Coordinate System</h3> <p>The above example also uses the new matrix coordinate system in ECharts 6.0, which is very powerful. It can be used for covariance matrix charts:</p>  <p>Periodic table:</p>  <p>As a layout, it also allows developers to combine various chart types and components to create flexible and complex visualizations:</p>  <h3 id="10.-enhanced-custom-series" tabindex="-1">10. Enhanced Custom Series</h3> <p>Previously, using ECharts custom series meant developers had to write complex <code>renderItem</code> logic from scratch, and code reuse was limited to copy-pasting. Now, ECharts 6.0 brings a standardized, reusable solution:</p> <ul><li><strong>Custom series registration</strong>: Like theme registration, custom series can be dynamically registered and used as easily as built-in series. See <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#series-custom.renderItem">series-custom.renderItem</a></li> <li><strong>Official custom series project</strong>: The official project at <a href="https://github.com/apache/echarts-custom-series">https://github.com/apache/echarts-custom-series</a> provides multiple custom series, available via npm after the official release</li> <li><strong>Publish your own custom series</strong>: Submit a pull request to the above project or publish to your own repo for code reuse</li></ul> <h3 id="11.-new-custom-charts" tabindex="-1">11. New Custom Charts</h3> <p>This release provides 6 practical custom charts in the custom series project. See <a href="https://github.com/apache/echarts-custom-series">echarts-custom-series</a> for usage and documentation. Including <strong>violin chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-violin.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/11-violin.png"> <p><strong>Contour chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-contour.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/11-contour.png"> <p><strong>Sleep stage chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-stage.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/11-stage.png"> <p><strong>Segmented doughnut chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-segmentedDoughnut.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/11-segmentedDoughnut.png"> <p><strong>Bar range chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-barRange.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/11-barRange.png"> <p><strong>Line range chart</strong>:</p> <img data-src="images/feature-v6/11-lineRange.png" width="600px" src="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/images/feature-v6/11-lineRange.png"> <p>Unleash your creativity and join us in creating more custom charts!</p> <h3 id="12.-axis-label-optimization" tabindex="-1">12. Axis Label Optimization</h3> <p>In previous versions, axis labels and names in rectangular coordinate systems could easily overflow or overlap when data was long. Users couldn't always predict space needs as data changed. In this version, we've optimized the default strategies to prevent overflow and overlap.</p> <h2 id="upgrade-guide" tabindex="-1">Upgrade Guide</h2> <p>See the full <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/changelog.html#v6-0-0">changelog</a> and <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/en/basics/release-note/v6-upgrade-guide">upgrade guide</a>.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
            <p>PHP 8.5, due out November of this year, will bring with it another long-sought-after feature: the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator-v3">pipe operator</a> (<code>|&gt;</code>).  It's a small feature with huge potential, yet it still took years to happen.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-pipe-operator%3F">What is a pipe operator?</h2>

<p>The pipe operator, spelled <code>|&gt;</code>, is deceptively simple.  It takes the value on its left side and passes it as the single argument to a function (or in PHP's case, <code>callable</code>) on its right side:</p>

<pre><code>$result = "Hello World" |&gt; strlen(...)

// Is equivalent to
$result = strlen("Hello World");
</code></pre>

<p>On its own, that is not all that interesting.  Where it becomes interesting is when it is repeated, or chained, to form a "pipeline."  For example, here's real code from a real project I've worked on, recast to use pipes:</p>

<pre><code>$arr = [
  new Widget(tags: ['a', 'b', 'c']),
  new Widget(tags: ['c', 'd', 'e']),
  new Widget(tags: ['x', 'y', 'a']),
];

$result = $arr
    |&gt; fn($x) =&gt; array_column($x, 'tags') // Gets an array of arrays
    |&gt; fn($x) =&gt; array_merge(...$x)       // Flatten into one big array
    |&gt; array_unique(...)                  // Remove duplicates
    |&gt; array_values(...)                  // Reindex the array.
;

// $result is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'x', 'y']
</code></pre>

<p>The same code without pipes would require either this horribly ugly nest of evil:</p>

<pre><code>array_values(array_unique(array_merge(...array_column($arr, 'tags'))));
</code></pre>

<p>Or manually creating a temporary variable for each step.  While temp variables are not the worst thing in the world, they are extra mental overhead, and mean that a chain like that cannot be used in a single-expression context, like a <code>match()</code> block.  A pipe chain can.</p>

<p>Anyone who has worked on the Unix/Linux command line will likely recognize the similarity to the shell pipe, <code>|</code>.  That's very deliberate, as it is effectively the same thing: Use the output from the left side as the input on the right side.</p>

<h2 id="where-did-it-come-from%3F">Where did it come from?</h2>

<p>The <code>|&gt;</code> operator appears in many languages, mostly in the functional world.  F# has essentially the exact same operator, as does OCaml.  Elixir has a slightly fancier version (which we considered but ultimately decided against for now).  Numerous PHP libraries exist in the wild that offer similar capability with many extra expensive steps, including my own <a href="https://github.com/Crell/fp/">Crell/fp</a>.</p>

<p>The story for PHP pipes, though, begins with Hack/HHVM, Facebook's PHP fork née competitive implementation.  Hack included many features beyond what PHP 5 of the day offered; many of them eventually ended up in later PHP versions.  One of its features was a unique spin on a pipe operator.</p>

<p>In 2016, Sara Golemon, long-time PHP contributor and former Open Source lead on the HHVM project, proposed porting <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator">Hack's pipes</a> to PHP directly.  In that RFC, the right side of a pipe wasn't a <code>callable</code> but an expression, and used a magic <code>$$</code> token (lovingly called <code>T_BLING</code>, at least according to yours truly) to inject the left-side result into it.  In that case, the example above would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$result = $arr
    |&gt; array_column($$, 'tags')
    |&gt; array_merge(...$$)
    |&gt; array_unique($$)
    |&gt; array_values($$)
;
</code></pre>

<p>While powerful, it was also somewhat limiting.  It was very non-standard, unlike any other language.  It also meant a weird, one-off syntax for partially-calling functions that worked only when paired with pipes.</p>

<p>That RFC didn't go as far as a vote.  Nothing much happened for several years, until 2020/2021.  That's when I, fresh off of writing a book on functional programming in PHP that talked about function composition, decided to take a swing at it.  In particular, I partnered with a team to work on <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/partial_function_application">Partial Function Application</a> (PFA) as a separate RFC from a more <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator-v2">traditional pipe</a>.  The idea was that turning a multi-parameter function (like <code>array_column()</code> above) into the single-parameter function that <code>|&gt;</code> needed was a useful feature on its own, and should be usable elsewhere.  The syntax was a bit different than the Hack version, in order to make it more flexible: <code>some_function(?, 5, ?, 3, ...)</code>, which would take a 5-or-more parameter function and turn it into a 3 parameter function.</p>

<p>Sadly, PFA didn't pass due to some engine complexity issues, and that largely undermined the v2 Pipe RFC, too.  However, we did get a consolation prize out of it: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/first_class_callable_syntax">First Class Callables</a> (the <code>array_values(...)</code> syntax), courtesy Nikita Popov, were by design a "junior", degenerate version of partial function application.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2025, and I was sufficiently bored to take another swing at pipes.  This time with a better implementation with lots of hand-holding from Ilija Tovilo and Arnaud Le Blanc, both part of the PHP Foundation dev team, I was able to get it through.</p>

<p>Third time's the charm.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts">More than the sum of its parts</h2>

<p>Above, we described pipes as "deceptively simple."  The implementation itself is almost trivial; it's just syntax sugar for the temp variable version, effectively.  However, the best features are the ones that can combine with others or be used in novel ways to punch above their weight.</p>

<p>We saw above how a long array manipulation process could now be condensed into a single chained expression.  Now imagine using that in places where only a single expression is allowed, such as a <code>match()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$string = 'something GoesHERE';

$newString = match ($format) {
    'snake_case' =&gt; $string
        |&gt; splitString(...)
        |&gt; fn($x) =&gt; implode('_', $x)
        |&gt; strtolower(...),
    'lowerCamel' =&gt; $string
        |&gt; splitString(...),
        |&gt; fn($x) =&gt; array_map(ucfirst(...), $x)
        |&gt; fn($x) =&gt; implode('', $x)
        |&gt; lcfirst(...),
    // Other case options here.
};
</code></pre>

<p>Or, consider that the right-side can also be a function call that returns a <code>Closure</code>.  That means with a few functions that return functions:</p>

<pre><code>$profit = [1, 4, 5] 
    |&gt; loadSeveral(...)
    |&gt; filter(isOnSale(...))
    |&gt; map(sellWidget(...))
    |&gt; array_sum(...);
</code></pre>

<p>Which... gives us mostly the same thing as the long-discussed scalar methods!  Only pipes are more flexible as you can use any function on the right-side, not just those that have been blessed by the language designers as methods.</p>

<p>At this point, pipe comes very close to being "extension functions", a feature of Kotlin and C# that allows writing functions that look like methods on an object, but are actually just stand-alone functions.  It's spelled a bit differently (<code>|</code> instead of <code>-</code>), but it's 75% of the way there, for free.</p>

<p>Or take it a step further.  What if some steps in the pipe may return <code>null</code>?  We can, with a single function, "lift" the elements of our chain to handle <code>null</code> values in the same fashion as null-safe methods.</p>

<pre><code>function maybe(\Closure $c): \Closure
{
    return fn(mixed $arg) =&gt; $arg === null ? null : $c($arg);
}

$profit = [1, 4, 5] 
    |&gt; maybe(loadSeveral(...))
    |&gt; maybe(filter(isOnSale(...)))
    |&gt; maybe(map(sellWidget(...)))
    |&gt; maybe(array_sum(...));
</code></pre>

<p>That's right, we just implemented a Maybe Monad with a pipe and a single-line function.</p>

<p>Now, think about that for streams...</p>

<pre><code>fopen('pipes.md', 'rb') // No variable, so it will close automatically when GCed.
    |&gt; decode_rot13(...)
    |&gt; lines_from_charstream(...)
    |&gt; map(str_getcsv(...))
    |&gt; map(Product::create(...))
    |&gt; map($repo-&gt;save(...))
;
</code></pre>

<p>The potential is absolutely huge.  I don't think it's immodest to say that the pipe operator has one of the highest "bangs for the buck" of any feature in recent memory, alongside such niceties as constructor property promotion.  And all thanks to a little syntax sugar.</p>

<h2 id="what-comes-next%3F">What comes next?</h2>

<p>Although pipes are a major milestone, we're not done.  There is active work on not one but two follow-up RFCs.</p>

<p>The first is a second attempt at <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/partial_function_application_v2">Partial Function Application</a>.  This is a larger feature, but with first-class callables already bringing in much of the necessary plumbing, which simplifies the implementation.  With pipes now providing a natural use case, as well as easy optimization points, it's worth a second attempt.  Whether it makes it into PHP 8.5, is delayed to 8.6, or is again rejected is still an open question as of this writing, though I am hopeful.  Major thanks to Arnaud Le Blanc from the PHP Foundation team for picking it up to update the implementation.</p>

<p>The second is a <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/function-composition">function composition operator</a>.  Where pipe executes immediately, function composition creates a new function by sticking two functions end-to-end.  That would mean the streams example above could be further optimized by combining the <code>map()</code> calls:</p>

<pre><code>fopen('pipes.md', 'rb')
    |&gt; decode_rot13(...)
    |&gt; lines_from_charstream(...)
    |&gt; map(str_getcsv(...) + Product::create(...) + $repo-&gt;save(...))
;
</code></pre>

<p>This one is definitely not going to make it into PHP 8.5, but I am hopeful that we'll be able to get it into 8.6.  Stay tuned.</p>

    <h3>
        3D Gaussian Splatting
    </h3>
    <p>
    3D Gaussian Splatting is a technique that transforms collections of <span>posed images</span>
    <label for="mn-5402d3"></label>
    
    <span>Images for which we estimate the relative position and rotation of the camera in the scene. Usually, this is computed using Structure-from-Motion (SfM).</span> into a volumetric representation called a radiance field. Generally, scenes can be created from collections of images captured from multiple overlapping viewpoints, either by taking multiple photographs from different angles or by sampling an input video while moving through the scene. For more complete details on 3D Gaussian Splatting, I encourage you to read <a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the paper</a> or watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkIJbpdTujE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explanation video</a> from Computerphile.
</p>
<p>
The scenes that are produced using 3D Gaussian Splatting are photorealistic and can be rendered at real-time rates using existing tools such as WebGL. However, I noticed that if the images used to train the 3D Gaussian Splat were swapped out with the <span>line-drawing counterparts</span>
<label for="mn-459d32"></label>

<span>While I transformed the images into line drawings, this transformation could be carried out using a number of other stylistic effects.</span> then the resulting scene would depict a kind of 3D line drawing. Similar to <span>regular sketching</span>
<label for="mn-ea08a3"></label>

<span>Illustrating a 3D scene as a 2D drawing from a specific perspective.</span>, the lines that are rendered are view-dependant and change based on your perspective in the scene.
</p>
<h3>
    Swapping Source Images
</h3>
<figure>
    <label for="mn-figure-5dc885">⊕</label>
    
    <span>
        <em>Figure 2.</em> The transformed images can be used to create 3D line drawings by swapping them for the original images in one of two places, shown here in green. Either before using SfM to generate the sparse model and camera poses or prior to training the 3D Gaussian Splat. The former computes SfM points based on the transformed images, while the latter keeps the points from the original images and computes the rendering loss using the transformed images. Figure adapted from the <a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/">original 3D Gaussian Splatting paper</a>.
    </span>
    <img src="https://amritkwatra.com/assets/3d_line_drawing__swap-xknqvGhJ.png" alt="Figure 2">
</figure>
<p>
Generating these 3D line drawings requires only a slight modification to the conventional process for generating 3D Gaussian Splats. At a high level, we simply swap the original images with the ones generated using Chan et al.'s method for transforming images into informative line drawings. This swap can happen in two places: prior to training the 3D Gaussian Splat or prior to estimating camera poses and sparse points using structure-from-motion (SfM).
</p>
<p>
When images are transformed prior to training the 3D Gaussian Splat, the camera poses and initial 3D Gaussians are derived from the original images but the loss is computed by comparing the rasterization output to the informative line drawing. As a result, the final scene also captures slight amounts of color that is not present in the transformed images. I believe this is a side-effect of intializing the 3D Gaussians using the original images. If you transform the images prior to applying SfM, the initialization and camera poses are based on the transformed images and the color artifacts are removed.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
If you replace the images prior to applying SfM, there is less information to use when generating a sparse model and estimating camera poses. As a result, the process is more reliable when images are replaced prior to training the 3D Gaussian Splat. Additionally, if you're iterating on different styles and tweaking the transformation process, swapping prior to training the 3D Gaussian Splat lets you avoid re-running COLMAP (or other SfM tools) for each iteration. For the majority of my examples, I swapped the images prior to training the 3D Gaussian Splat. Figure 3 shows a comparison between scenes generated using these two methods.

        <em>Figure 4.</em> <em>(a)</em> A 3D line drawing created by swapping the original images with informative line drawings prior to training the 3D Gaussian Splat. Note that the slight amount of color is an artifact that is likely the result of initializing the 3D Gaussians from the original set of images. <em>(b)</em> A 3D line drawing that blends low-frequency color information from the original scene to produce a watercolor-like effect.

<p>
I wanted to see how we could add some color information back into the generated line drawings and ultimately into the generated scenes. To do this, I generated a slightly modified <span>hybrid image</span>
<label for="mn-a23a0a"></label>

<span>"A hybrid image is a picture that combines the low-spatial frequencies of one picture with the high spatial frequencies of another picture" - <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee367/reading/OlivaTorralb_Hybrid_Siggraph06.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oliva, Torralba &amp; Schyns</a> </span> which blends color information from the original image into the line drawing to create a watercolor effect in the final image. Figure 4 shows the contour image and the blended hybrid image. There are a few scenes in the interactive example above that use this method of adding color, such as the <a href="https://splat-serve.pages.dev/?id=caterpillar-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blended Caterpillar Scene</a>, and <a href="https://splat-serve.pages.dev/?id=lighthouse-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blended Lighthouse Scene</a>.

    A subtle, but interesting effect can be achieved by splicing together the source scene and color scene. By training a 3D Gaussian Splat to reconstruct photorealistic images from one set of perspectives and colored, contour images from another distinct set of perspectives, you can gradually transition styles within the same scene based on the viewing perspective. Figure 5 demonstrates this by orbiting around a scene in the <a href="https://splat-serve.pages.dev/?id=caterpillar-real-hybrid-blend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spliced Caterpillar Scene</a>.

        <em>Figure 6.</em> A <em>collage</em> image that segments out an object (in this example the tractor) in a scene and replaces it with the corresponding object from the stylized scene. This replacement, or collage, happens in image space prior to training the Gaussian Splat. <em>(a)</em> Inserts the <em>contour</em> style into the original scene. <em>(b)</em> Inserts the original scene into the stylized <em>contour</em> scene.

Another experiment I tried was to create a <em>collage</em> scene that renders only the subject of the scene as a line drawing and leaves the background unaltered. To do this I used a Meta's <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#model-checkpoints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segment-Anything Model</a> <span>(SAM)</span>
<label for="mn-f88186"></label>

<span>To avoid manually specifying areas in the image to segment using SAM, I used <a href="https://github.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LangSAM</a> to automatically segment images based on a text prompt.</span>  to mask out the subject in each input photograph and replace it with the corresponding area from the generated line drawing image. The resulting scene is depicted in Figure 6 and can be explored here: <a href="https://splat-serve.pages.dev/?id=caterpillar-collage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caterpillar Collage Scene</a>.

This method can also render multiple subjects in the scene in different styles. Figure 6 shows multiple objects (benches) being rendered as line drawings within a scene. View the full scene here: [Family Collage Scene](https://splat-serve.pages.dev/?id=family-collage). It is also possible to mix and match different styles applied to different objects in the same scene. -->

        <em>Figure 7.</em> The same scene rendered by line drawings at two output resolutions. In each scene the inset image is one of the transformed images used to generate the scene. <em>(a)</em> <a href="https://splat-serve.pages.dev/?id=caterpillar-contour-256p">460x256 pixels</a>. <em>(b)</em> <a href="https://splat-serve.pages.dev/?id=caterpillar-contour">1940x1080 pixels</a>.

</figure>
<p>
The scenes so far have been trained on high resolution images (~1080p). This not only effects how long it takes to train the 3D Gaussian Splat, but also the fidelity of details captured in the line drawing. The lower resolution outputs capture the major lines that define the shape of the subject in the scene, while higher resolution outputs can pick up on more minor details in the scene. Figure 7 shows the same scene rendered at a variety of resolutions.
</p>
<p>
The following table describes the training time and number of splats generated for line drawings generated in a range of resolutions. Each scene is trained using the same parameters for 21,000 iterations. The final row describes the original scene using images from the Caterpillar scene in the Tanks and Temples Benchmark.

    <p>
    It is notable that a line drawing scene is roughly double the size of it's source scene in both number of splats and file size. I hypothesize that this is because splats are better suited at modelling large areas and textures than they are at strokes. As a result, a scene of a 3D line drawing must use more individual gaussians to render long, thin lines in the scene.

The code to generate these is a mashup of scripts to orchestrate between the different libraraies referenced in this post. Contact me if you're curious about running this yourself.

      <h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

      <p>Please note that we list not only the camera model, but also its SoC, image sensor, Wi-Fi module, and flash chip size.
        These must match to be supported by the firmware. We have found that some manufacturers change the hardware in different
        batches of the same module without notice.</p>

        They digitally sign the installed firmware with a matching key, so that replacing the pre-installed
        firmware with one that is not signed with the same key will render the camera unusable, unless you
        replace the SoC with a new, undamaged one.</p>

      <p>These cameras are not necessarily based on Ingenic SoC. Some units purchased on AliExpress were marketed as the same model, but they came with unsupported ARM processors.</p>

      

      <h2>Potentially Supported Cameras</h2>

      <p>We've heard that these cameras use Ingenic SoC, so we think they could be added to the supported list. Unfortunately, we don't have a sample of this camera to work on, so we'd be happy to accept it as a donation to the project. Just a heads-up, this is a non-commercial project, and the people working on it contribute their free time for nothing more than a sense of accomplishment. If you want things to develop faster, offer your help.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>  <p>Spaced repetition systems are powerful, but they have a fundamental blind spot: they don’t understand what your flashcards are&nbsp;<em>about</em>.</p>
<p>To your SRS, a card asking “what’s the capital of Italy?” and another asking “what country is Rome the capital of?” are treated independently, each with its own isolated review history. It has no concept that reviewing related material should reinforce your memory of the whole topic.</p>
<p>At the heart of every SRS is a&nbsp;<strong>memory model</strong> which predicts how long you’ll remember each card based on your past performance. Most of today’s models ignore the <em>content</em> of the cards entirely. This is where <strong>content-aware memory models</strong> come in: they account for the semantic meaning of your cards, not just your review ratings.</p>
<p>This is more than a minor tweak for scheduling accuracy. It’s a foundational change that makes it practical to build the fluid, intelligent learning tools many have envisioned: from&nbsp;<a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7wCFe7MP9VeCVApcBLC7SN">idea-centric memory systems</a>&nbsp;that test understanding from multiple angles to truly&nbsp;<a href="https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2024-03-04-conversational-spaced-repetition/">conversational spaced repetition</a>&nbsp;with a voice-enabled AI agent as tutor.</p>

<h2 id="schedulers-and-memory-models">Schedulers and memory models</h2>
<p>I find it useful to distinguish between schedulers and memory models. This distinction wasn’t immediately obvious to me when I first approached the topic, but I’ve found it essential for thinking clearly about spaced repetition systems (SRS). Here, I’ll introduce both concept and I’ll make the case that separating schedulers from memory models enables independent innovation and simplifies the development of each component by isolating user experience (UX) concerns within the scheduler. In the literature, the scheduler is sometimes called the “teacher model” since it decides what to teach, while the memory model is the “student model” since it represents what the student knows.</p>
<p>In Anki and other spaced repetition systems, the <strong>scheduler</strong> is an algorithm that picks the next card to review today, answering the question <em>“Given the review history of every card in the student’s collection, which cards should the student review in this session?”</em>. In practice, when building a spaced repetition system, this is the question you actually care about. The scheduler’s core job is deciding&nbsp;<em>which cards to show today</em>, not just&nbsp;<em>when each card should ideally be reviewed</em>. A card might be “due” for review, but the scheduler might skip it due to daily review limits, prioritize other overdue cards, or defer it based on other goals.</p>
<p>For a long time, the only scheduler available in Anki was <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm">a variant of SuperMemo’s SM-2 scheduler</a>, which dates back to <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/the-true-history-of-spaced-repetition#1987">1987</a>. It’s remarkably simple yet effective. SuperMemo has since advanced its scheduler, now at version <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-18">SM-18</a>. The latest iterations of the algorithm achieve the same retention levels with fewer reviews, and are more robust when reviews deviate from optimal intervals, for example when a student returns from a break of several weeks. While the SuperMemo schedulers are closed-source, an explanation of how they work is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-17">available</a>. <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki">FSRS</a> is an open-source scheduler by Jarrett Ye built on similar principles to modern SuperMemo algorithms and can be used in Anki.</p>
<p>A <strong>memory model</strong> predicts forgetting curves, answering the question <em>“Given the review history of every card in the student’s collection, what are the chances the student remembers a specific card at any given moment?”</em></p>
<p>We define <strong>retrievability</strong> as the probability that a student remembers a card at a particular time. In practice, we often model this as a binary outcome where a student either remembers or forgets a card. Some spaced repetition systems allow for more nuanced grading. For example, Anki has four options: “Again”, “Hard”, “Good”, “Easy”. This additional information from the review history can be used to make memory models more accurate.</p>
<p>The forgetting curve plots this retrievability over time. A memory model’s job is to compute these curves based on a student’s review history. Retrievability generally decreases over time, as it becomes more likely that the student will forget the card. For example, here are the forgetting curves estimated by different memory models from the same review history (the figure comes from my <a href="https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/186407">master’s thesis</a>):</p>
<p><img alt="Plot of forgetting curves estimated by different memory models from the same review history" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1500" height="900" src="https://www.giacomoran.com/_astro/fc_comparison.DEARgvNj_2owL0b.webp"></p>
<p>The relationship between schedulers and memory models varies across different systems. A scheduler may or may not use a memory model. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system">Leitner system</a> and SM-2 do not rely on a memory model to schedule reviews, they are based on simple mechanical rules. Modern schedulers like SM-18 and FSRS instead include a memory model (stability and difficulty are used to compute retrievability). I recommend taking a look at Fernando Borretti’s articles on the implementing <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-sm2-in-rust">SM-2</a> and <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">FSRS</a>. Note that FSRS ties together the scheduler and the memory model at the implementation level, but they can be separated quite easily to unlock more flexibility in designing the system. There are also <a href="https://siddharth.io/files/deep-tutor.pdf">schedulers based on model-free reinforcement-learning</a>, that learn a scheduling policy directly from user interactions, without building an explicit, human-interpretable model of forgetting like the ones we’re discussing.</p>
<p>Once you have a memory model that estimates how likely the student is to remember each card, you can build different schedulers with various strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can schedule a card for review when retrievability drops below 90%. This is the most common strategy in SRS as far as I can tell. This is more or less what FSRS does, you can also adjust the <em>desired retention</em> to other values.</li>
<li>You can randomly select cards for review, with probability proportional to how likely they have been forgotten (one minus retrievability). <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-021-00105-8">Example</a>.</li>
<li>You can override the default scheduler behavior for new cards or after a failed review by implementing custom&nbsp;<em>learning</em> and&nbsp;<em>relearning steps</em>. This is also included in most FSRS implementations.</li>
<li>You can fuzz the intervals (adjust them randomly by small amounts) or apply load balancing to smooth out the amount of reviews scheduled for the student over a few days.</li>
<li>You can implement different strategies for when the student takes a break of weeks or months. For example, in Rember we mark cards overdue for a week as stale and the student can limit the amount of stale cards in each review session. This is an idea we took from <a href="https://www.remnote.com/">RemNote</a>.</li>
<li>You can build an exam feature, where the student sets the date for the exam and you schedule reviews in order to achieve high retrievability on that date for cards related to the exam. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08322">Example</a>.</li>
<li>You can account for goals complementary to retention, for example the student workload, the amount of new cards the student is adding, or the estimated answering time for each card. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-020-00074-4">Example</a>.</li>
<li>You can optimize for long-term outcomes, not just today’s retrievability. For example, if a student fails a card today, reviewing it again tomorrow might boost its future stability more than waiting a week. This forward-looking approach considers how today’s review outcome affects the card’s entire future learning trajectory. Some of the examples above account for similar ramifications. Nate Meyvis has explored <a href="https://www.natemeyvis.com/notes-on-spaced-repetition-scheduling.html">similar ideas</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As these examples illustrate, a single, accurate memory model can act as a foundation for a diverse ecosystem of schedulers, each optimized for different goals and user experiences.</p>
<p>The distinction between memory models and schedulers offers two key advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Independent innovation cycles.</strong> We can innovate on schedulers independently of memory models, and vice versa. Scheduler research can treat memory models as a black box to obtain retrievability predictions.</li>
<li><strong>Separation from UX concerns.</strong> We can focus on building better memory models independently of product or UX considerations. The design of schedulers is deeply intertwined with product and UX considerations. For example, a scheduler might ensure a student re-attempts a failed card before the session ends. The primary benefit here might be psychological, providing the student with the assurance of getting it right, rather than a decision optimized purely for long-term retention. Another example is load balancing, the goal of which is primarily improving the student’s experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>This architectural separation isn’t just theoretical. It enables practical benefits: you can A/B test different scheduling strategies using the same underlying memory model, swap in improved memory models without rebuilding your entire system, and allow users to choose scheduling approaches that fit their learning style while maintaining consistent forgetting predictions underneath.</p>
<p>Most current SRS implementations conflate these concerns. The next generation of systems will likely benefit from treating them as distinct, composable components.</p>
<h2 id="content-aware-memory-models">Content-aware memory models</h2>
<p>This section explores how leveraging the textual content and semantic relationships between cards can improve memory models.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, most memory models in real-world spaced repetition systems treat each card in isolation. SM-2, SM-18, and FSRS rely solely on each card’s individual review history to predict its forgetting curve. Ignoring the following factors means we are leaving useful information on the table:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The review histories of related cards</strong>. Card semantics allow us to identify related cards. This enables memory models to account for the review histories of&nbsp;<em>all</em> relevant cards when estimating a specific card’s retrievability.</li>
<li><strong>The card’s textual content</strong>. Beyond identifying related cards, the semantic content itself can directly inform the memory model. A model could, for example, estimate the inherent difficulty of a card based on its question or answer text, even before any reviews have taken place.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to note that “card semantics” encompasses more than simple textual similarity. We’re looking to capture the card’s quality: how effectively the question can activate the memory pathways that lead the student to remember the concept. For example, we need to detect slight ambiguities in the question, which would make it difficult to answer. Moreover, we will likely need to examine the semantics of groups of cards, not just cards in isolation. For example, to memorize a list of three items, you might want a card for each item, plus an integrative card for the entire list. The card for the entire list in isolation would be quite poor in terms of card quality and would be very difficult to remember without the other three cards supporting it.</p>
<p>Informally, this direction proposes shifting the memory model’s focus from:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>retrievability(t) = f(t; single_card_history)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>To leveraging a richer context:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>retrievability(t) = f(t; all_cards_history, all_cards_content)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Where <code>t</code> is the time since the last review, and each history (whether <code>single_card_history</code> or <code>all_cards_history</code>) is a chronological sequence of review events, typically comprising a timestamp and the student’s rating for that review.</p>
<p>Note that current memory models treat all new cards (cards with no reviews) as the same. Considering the textual content would allow us to obtain more informed initial estimates of a card’s inherent difficulty, leading to better scheduling for cards with no or few reviews compared to uniform defaults.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following collection of cards:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>Q: In reinforcement learning, broadly, what is the Bellman equation?</span></span>
<span><span>A: An equation that describes the fundamental relationship between the value of a state and the values of its successor states</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>Q: In reinforcement learning, what equation describes the fundamental relationship between the value of a state and the values of its successor states?</span></span>
<span><span>A: The Bellman equation</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>Q: In reinforcement learning, what's the formula of the Bellman equation?</span></span>
<span><span>A: $$ v_{\pi}(s) = \sum_{a} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s', r} p(s', r|s, a) [r + \gamma v_{\pi}(s')] $$</span></span></code></pre>
<p>All three cards are semantically related, but the first two, being conceptual inversions of each other, share a much stronger connection than with the third, which focuses on the formula.
Reviewing either of the first two cards would likely make recalling the other significantly easier. The third card might have a similar effect, but considerably weaker. (Alternatively, if a student successfully reviews either of the first two cards, we should increase our confidence that they’ll recall the other). The third card is also inherently more challenging due to its “less atomic” nature: a student must recall multiple components of the formula, increasing the likelihood of forgetting a single element and marking the card as forgotten.</p>
<h3 id="karl">KARL</h3>
<p>This idea has been explored in the literature by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12291">Shu et al., 2024 - KARL: Knowledge-Aware Retrieval and Representations aid Retention and Learning in Students</a>, where they introduce the term <strong>content-aware scheduling</strong>. The memory model in KARL encodes the textual content of the cards with BERT embeddings.</p>
<p>These embeddings play a dual role:</p>
<ol>
<li>They facilitate the&nbsp;retrieval of the top-k semantically similar cards&nbsp;from the user’s study history, whose review histories are then passed to the memory model</li>
<li>The&nbsp;embeddings of the current card and these top-k similar cards&nbsp;are themselves fed into the memory model</li>
</ol>
<p>The KARL scheduler was evaluated on a dataset consisting of 123,143 study logs on diverse trivia questions, collected from 543 users within a custom flashcard app. It slightly outperformed FSRSv4, which has improved since then, being now at version 6. This result is remarkable because KARL does not model the memory dynamics explicitly, like FSRS does by estimating difficulty and stability, and using a power-law forgetting curve. I wonder how the performance would be for a model that is good at both capturing the memory dynamics, like FSRSv6, and at accounting for card semantics, like KARL.</p>
<h3 id="small-experiments-on-rember-data">Small experiments on Rember data</h3>
<p>I ran a few small experiments myself that provide additional evidence that this direction is promising. In <a href="https://rember.com/">Rember</a> we group cards around small notes; at the time of the experiment, my account had 4,447 reviews for 940 cards, grouped in 317 notes. You can think of notes as grouping together semantically similar cards.</p>
<p>I ran a couple of experiments on top of FSRS:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>exp_1</code>: when the card has no reviews, set the initial stability to the average stability of other cards in the note.</li>
<li><code>exp_2</code>: multiply stability by a constant factor when other cards from the note have been reviewed between now and the card’s last review (the constant factor is optimized using grid search). This simulates a “priming” effect where recent exposure to related concepts reinforces the current card</li>
</ul>
<p>Stability represents how long the card will last in memory, it’s defined as the interval at which the card’s retrievability drops to 90%.</p>
<p>I compared the following memory models:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>random</code>: random retrievability predictions in <code>[0,1]</code></li>
<li><code>fsrs</code>: FSRSv5 with default parameters</li>
<li><code>fsrs_optimized</code>: FSRSv5 with parameters optimized on the collection</li>
<li><code>fsrs_exp_1</code>: <code>fsrs</code> + <code>exp_1</code></li>
<li><code>fsrs_exp_2</code>: <code>fsrs</code> + <code>exp_2</code></li>
<li><code>fsrs_optimized_exp_1</code>: <code>fsrs_optimized</code> + <code>exp_1</code></li>
<li><code>fsrs_optimized_exp_2</code>: <code>fsrs_optimized</code> + <code>exp_2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I performed 4-fold cross-validation splitting by note IDs, and compared the models on the same evaluation metrics from my <a href="https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/186407">master’s thesis</a>: <em>AUC</em> (measuring discrimination, the highest the better), <em>ICI</em> (measuring the average calibration error, the lower the better), <em>E_max</em> (measuring the maximum calibration error, the lower the better).</p>
<p>The results are summarized in the following table:</p>
<div>




















































<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>AUC</th><th>ICI</th><th>E_max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>random</code></td><td>0.4887±0.0156</td><td>0.4235±0.0055</td><td>0.9193±0.0099</td></tr><tr><td><code>fsrs</code></td><td>0.5708±0.0172</td><td>0.0364±0.0120</td><td>0.2720±0.0912</td></tr><tr><td><code>fsrs_optimized</code></td><td>0.6294±0.0115</td><td>0.0108±0.0041</td><td>0.1904±0.0689</td></tr><tr><td><code>fsrs_exp_1</code></td><td>0.5883±0.0248</td><td>0.0281±0.0086</td><td>0.2204±0.0640</td></tr><tr><td><code>fsrs_exp_2</code></td><td>0.5716±0.0159</td><td>0.0307±0.0079</td><td>0.2355±0.0867</td></tr><tr><td><code>fsrs_optimized_exp_1</code></td><td>0.6148±0.0128</td><td><strong>0.0070±0.0021</strong></td><td>0.1383±0.0356</td></tr><tr><td><code>fsrs_optimized_exp_2</code></td><td><strong>0.6386±0.0185</strong></td><td>0.0075±0.0031</td><td><strong>0.1285±0.0522</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The experimental results, though based on a small dataset, indicate a clear trend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporating note-level information into FSRS, even with default parameters (<code>fsrs_exp_1</code> and <code>fsrs_exp_2</code>), generally outperforms <code>fsrs</code> across all metrics.</li>
<li>The optimal performance is achieved when FSRS is first optimized on the collection and then combined with note-level information.</li>
</ul>
<p>These results, while preliminary given the dataset size, support the hypothesis that integrating semantic context enhances memory models.</p>
<h3 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mathacademy.com/">MathAcademy</a> includes an interesting spaced repetition feature, which accounts for the card semantics. They manually create a tree of concepts, with dependencies between them. The spaced repetition scheduler accounts for reviews of prerequisite concepts when scheduling a card. You can read more about how their scheduler works <a href="https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works">here</a>. Here’s a quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Existing spaced repetition algorithms are limited to the context of independent flashcards - but this is not appropriate for a hierarchical body of knowledge like mathematics. For instance, if a student practices adding two-digit numbers, then they are effectively practicing adding one-digit numbers as well! In general, repetitions on advanced topics should “trickle down” the knowledge graph to update the repetition schedules of simpler topics that are implicitly practiced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is amazing work, but the scheduler is limited to MathAcademy’s tree of concepts; we need memory models that account for card semantics and apply more generally.</p>
<p>A general caveat might be the computational cost of the scheduler. For example, FSRS can schedule thousands of reviews in a few milliseconds on my M2 MacBook Pro, and therefore it can easily run on-device in a SRS. A memory model that accounts for the review history of all cards and the textual content of the cards will likely be more computationally intensive and might not be able to run on-device without excessive delays or battery drain. KARL addresses this computational challenge by considering only the top-k most semantically similar cards rather than all cards in the collection.</p>
<p>This kind of models will likely be trained on data from many spaced repetition students, which has a few implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if a student has no reviews in the system, the model will still be able to estimate the initial difficulty for their cards.</li>
<li>We are making the implicit assumption that card semantics influence reviews in the same way across students, this might not always be true. For example, a card difficult for one person might be easy for another due to differing familiarity with the topic. However, if a card is hard to remember for most students, it is reasonable to assume it will be hard for others. Potential solutions include: focusing on how the question relates to the underlying topic, rather than the topic itself, or somehow modeling the student’s ability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ux-unlocks">UX unlocks</h2>
<p>While accuracy improvements are valuable, the bigger impact comes from the UX opportunities unlocked by card semantics. By removing the rigid coupling between cards and their review histories, content-aware memory models give designers of spaced repetition systems much more freedom.</p>
<p>Here’s a concrete example of this constraint in action. When we started working on Rember (in the pre-LLM era), we considered building a fully markdown-based SRS. The main reason we dropped the idea is that you need an ID for each card, to link a card to its review history. Keeping IDs in the markdown quickly gets messy. You end up with something like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>[card:abcxyz]</span></span>
<span><span>Q: What's the capital of Italy?</span></span>
<span><span>A: Rome</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Which is far from ideal, it’s fragile since the user might accidentally edit the ID, or end up with duplicate IDs by copy-pasting cards.</p>
<p>Solutions that get rid of the IDs were all dead-ends. You cannot rely on exact textual matches because the user might edit a card, and you don’t want to reset the review history if the user fixes a typo. You cannot rely on the relative position of the card in the document, as the user might move cards around. Forcing a GUI on top of the markdown that takes care of the IDs is viable, but kinda defeats the point of markdown.</p>
<p>The key insight is decoupling cards from their specific review histories. Instead of linking reviews to card IDs, the memory model considers only a universal history of content-based reviews, as triples: <code>(rating, timestamp, card's textual content)</code>. This eliminates the need for card consistency over time. There’s no “card’s review history” anymore, a single “review history” spans the entire student’s collection.</p>
<p>The scheduler can then assess the retrievability of all current cards in a student’s collection, including newly added ones, without relying on past review IDs. Students can edit cards freely without disrupting the scheduler. The memory model, using semantic understanding, differentiates between minor stylistic edits (like typos, which maintain the core meaning) and substantive changes to the card’s content (like replacing an answer, which would alter its semantic meaning sufficiently to be treated as a distinct card).</p>
<p>This decoupling also simplifies systems that dynamically generate prompts. Andy Matuschak explored bringing <em>ideas</em> rather than cards into the system. Prompts are dynamically generated during each review session to test the ideas from multiple angles, and evolve over time as you get more familiar with the ideas (see his Patreon post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/fluid-practice-83882597">Fluid practice for fluid understanding</a>&nbsp;or his public&nbsp;<a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7wCFe7MP9VeCVApcBLC7SN">notes</a>). Content-aware memory models make this approach much more tractable.&nbsp;Current schedulers assume a review history per card. For dynamically generated prompts, this forces an awkward choice: either treat each unique prompt variation as a new card, losing its connection to the core idea, or group them coarsely at the idea level, which likely leads to under-reviewing the individual prompts.&nbsp;Content-aware memory models, however, naturally handle this gray area.</p>
<p>Taking this further, we could design a SRS where the flashcard-based review session is replaced with a conversation with a voice-enabled AI agent that asks questions or engages in open-ended discussion. This is part of the idea of <a href="https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2024-03-04-conversational-spaced-repetition/">conversational spaced repetition</a> explored by David Bieber. The AI agent could track the key ideas or concept the student goes over during the conversation, somehow judging whether the user could remember them or not. The content-aware memory model should be able account for those less structured reviews, even if they don’t directly map to Q&amp;A cards.</p>
<p>Additional benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having duplicates cards in the system is less disruptive to the review practice, since the scheduler will consider them as one and the same (even though you might still want to implement ways to detect and remove them from the system).</li>
<li>Reduced migration costs between SRS. Current importers must meticulously map both cards and review histories. With content-aware memory models, importing reviews could leverage the prior system’s textual card representation, enabling the new model to “understand” review histories from&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;system, regardless of perfect content mapping.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this approach reduces some direct user control over individual card histories, such as manually resetting a specific card’s schedule, I believe we can mitigate the problem and that the benefits of the approach far outweigh the costs.</p>
<p>In summary, I predict that content-aware memory models will make it much easier to design and build new interfaces for memory systems. They remove annoying hurdles that occupy the minds of SRS developers.</p>
<h2 id="data-problem">Data problem</h2>
<p>The main challenge in building content-aware memory models is lack of data. To my knowledge, no publicly available dataset exists that contains real-world usage data with both card textual content and review histories.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12291">KARL</a>, mentioned above, is trained on a dataset collected by paying users to review trivia flashcards on a custom app. I would hesitate to rely on a memory model trained solely on artificial data for my own spaced repetition practice. FSRS is trained on <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-spaced-repetition/anki-revlogs-10k">anki-revlogs-10k</a>, a large dataset consisting of more than 200M reviews from 10k Anki collections. The dataset includes only card, note, and deck IDs, omitting their textual content due to Anki’s <a href="https://ankiweb.net/account/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the interests of research and product development, we may use your review history and options (but not the text or media on cards) for statistical purposes, such as calculating the average pass rate across all users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While other review datasets exist, a crucial missing piece is a large dataset that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is non-commercial and can be used for research purposes</li>
<li>Includes review histories</li>
<li>Includes cards’ textual content</li>
<li>Covers a wide range of topics (e.g. not just language learning data)</li>
</ol>
<p>Building on <a href="https://www.natemeyvis.com/notes-on-spaced-repetition-scheduling.html">Nate Meyvis’s insights</a>, I’ll add another requirement (I’ll discuss below why this is important):</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>A small fraction of the reviews are scheduled at random to provide unbiased data points</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the challenges with data coming from spaced repetition systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The data is sparse.</strong> Limited to a time-stamped binary sequence of review ratings, spaced repetition data offers only a faint and insufficient signal to fully reconstruct the complex, dynamic state of a student’s memory.</li>
<li><strong>The data is incomplete.</strong> The limited data captured by spaced repetition systems fails to account for crucial out-of-system interactions that significantly shape a student’s memory. Students interact with material outside the SRS: through reading, conversation, or practical application. These interactions, important for memory, are not captured by the system. Furthermore, each review significantly alters the card’s future schedule. Consequently, unrecorded external recall events can have a substantial but uncaptured effect on the memory state assumed by the system.</li>
<li><strong>The data is biased.</strong> Spaced repetition data is inherently biased by the memory model that schedules reviews, creating a “chicken or the egg” problem where the data used to train the model is influenced by the model itself, potentially hindering further optimization (see <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1432/sl_pap3.pdf">this paper</a>). This is why scheduling a small fraction of reviews at random in a real-world SRS could significantly improve the accuracy of memory models.</li>
<li><strong>The data is self-reported.</strong>&nbsp;We assume students provide ratings that truly reflect their inner memory state, but they may mark cards as “remembered” when they’ve actually forgotten them, perhaps to avoid the discomfort of perceived failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The strong results achieved by current-generation schedulers like FSRS and SM-18 provide compelling evidence that a valuable signal indeed exists and can be separated from noise, despite the challenges described above.</p>
<p>One potential path forward is an open-source, community-contributed dataset where users voluntarily share their Anki and other SRS data, complete with tools to filter out sensitive content and eventually standardized benchmarks for evaluating memory models. If you’re interested in contributing data, have experience building community-driven datasets, or have thoughts on this approach, I’d love to <a href="https://www.giacomoran.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#31565850525e5c5e43505f71565c50585d1f525e5c">hear from you</a>.</p>
