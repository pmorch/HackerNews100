<p>People who buy a Fire TV from Amazon are probably looking for a cheap and simple way to get an affordable 4K smart TV. When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/amazon-new-4k-tvs-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-announced/#:~:text=Amazon%20on%20Thursday%20announced%20its,Amazon's%20Fire%20TV%20operating%20system.">Amazon announced its first self-branded TVs</a> in September 2021, it touted them as being a "great value." But owners of the devices will soon be paying for some of those savings in the form of more prominently displayed advertisements.</p>
<p>Charlotte Maines, Amazon's director of Fire TV advertising, monetization, and engagement, detailed the new types of ads that Amazon is selling on Fire TVs. In a <a href="https://www.streamtvinsider.com/advertising/amazon-fire-tv-intros-new-options-advertisers-including-contextual-sponsored-tiles">StreamTV Insider</a> report from November 1, Amazon said the new ads will allow advertisers to reach an average of 155 million unique monthly viewers.</p>
<p>Some of the changes targeting advertisers, like connecting display placement ads with specific in-stream video ads, seem harmless enough. Others could jeopardize the TV-watching experience for owners.</p>
<h2>New ads tied to generative AI Alexa</h2>
<p>For example, Amazon is preparing to make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazons-generative-ai-powered-alexa-is-as-big-a-privacy-red-flag-as-old-alexa/">Alexa with generative AI</a> more useful for finding content on Fire TVs. This could help Alexa, which has struggled alongside other tech giants' voice assistants to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/">generate significant revenue</a>. Amazon gets money every time someone interacts with digital content through Alexa.</p>
<p>However, the company is double-dipping on this idea by also tying ads to generative AI on Fire TVs. When users ask Alexa to help them find media with queries such as "play the show with the guy who plays the lawyer in <em>Breaking Bad,"&nbsp;</em>they will see ads that are relevant to the search.</p>
<p>Amazon has discussed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/with-amazon-alexas-future-in-peril-fire-tvs-offer-a-glimmer-of-hope/">evolving Alexa</a> into a tool that can not only bring you to the right app for the show you want but that can also <em>recommend&nbsp;</em>specific shows based on prompts like the above. This has been one of the most promising potential futures for the voice assistant. But positioning the feature next to ads seems to prioritize advertisers over Fire TV customers.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Maines told StreamTV Insider that advertisers had been asking for a way to advertise against Fire TV searches. “It just makes sense to expand our existing sponsor tile offering to show advertisements on the search screen with no extra effort or cost for the advertiser,” she said.</p>
<p>Finally, Amazon is adding "contextual sponsored tiles" that use machine learning to show ads based on whatever content genre or search term the Fire TV user is browsing.</p>
<h2>“Persistent” ads</h2>
<p>Amazon Fire TV users will also start seeing banner ads on the device's home screen for things that have nothing to do with entertainment or media. This ad space was previously reserved for advertising media and entertainment, making the ads feel more relevant, at least. Amazon opening the ad space to more types of advertisers is similar to a move Google TV made <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1674633052">early this year</a>.</p>
<p>The company seems to be aware of how dominating these types of advertisements can be. Maines emphasized to StreamTV Insider how the native ads are "right at the top of the Fire TV's home screen" and take "up half the screen."</p>
<p>Maines continued, telling StreamTV Insider:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s persistent, so as a customer browses around the UI… they continue to see it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The banner ads will occupy the first slot in the rotating hero area, which Amazon believes is the first thing Fire TV users see. These users may have purchased a Fire TV primarily for streaming content from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/max-users-grandfathered-into-15-99-ad-free-plan-lose-4k-hdr-next-month/">ad-free subscriptions</a>, but Maines described how Fire TVs can still manage to force ads on these users.</p>
<p>StreamTV Insider reported:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maines explained how with on-device ads, even if viewers ultimately choose to watch something that’s not ad-supported, brand advertisers still have the opportunity to get their message in front of viewers and talk to them as they browse and decide what to watch.</p></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Friday, the metaphorical ink was still drying on a federal court order barring the NYPD from illegally telling people they can't film the police in the public parts of precinct stations, when SeanPaul Reyes, who had sued the police department after being arrested for doing just that, marched into the 75th Precinct station house in East New York, recording with his phone in one hand, a copy of the judge's order in the other hand.</p><p>"We the people did it," Reyes told his livestream audience in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYMUGQO9Sck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video broadcast</a> viewed more than 300,000 times so far. "We won." Sporting sunglasses, a neatly trimmed beard, and a baseball cap that read "We the People," Reyes held forth in the precinct lobby, celebrating the victory. A police employee poked her head into the lobby to find out what Reyes wanted. "I want to make a complaint against the NYPD as a whole," he told her. After several minutes, a police sergeant emerged and handed Reyes a complaint form. Reyes asked him for his name and badge number, then thanked him and the precinct for being in compliance with the federal injunction. "I appreciate you guys not being in contempt of court," he said. The sergeant dutifully nodded.</p><p>Reyes filed his lawsuit in July, after being arrested twice for filming in the public areas of NYPD precinct houses. An NYPD policy, announced in signage in every precinct in the city, forbids filming in station houses. To Reyes, who describes himself as a "First Amendment auditor," that rule was meant to be broken. "The police are there for accountability—if you do something wrong, they hold you accountable," Reyes told Hell Gate. "But how do the people hold the police accountable? There has to be some sort of transparency and accountability for how the police treat people on an everyday basis. That's why I record. I just want to show people how public employees treat people."</p><p>Reyes's <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.602637/gov.uscourts.nysd.602637.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit</a> argued that the NYPD's policy is improper for three reasons: It violates the First Amendment's protections of free speech; it violates a state law and a New York City law, both known as the <a href="https://www.pubadvocate.nyc.gov/press/nyc-council-passes-right-record-police-transparency-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Right to Record Act</a>, which explicitly guarantee the right to record the police, anywhere and any time, so long as the person filming isn't interfering with police work or otherwise breaking the law; and the NYPD instituted its policy without following the Citywide Administrative Procedure Act, which specifies the steps a City agency must take before it can put a new rule in place.</p><p>Judge Jessica Clarke, who ordered the injunction last week, ruled that while the First Amendment claim might be a little more complicated, it seems pretty clear that the NYPD violated the state and municipal Right to Record Acts with its policy. "The Right to Record Acts do not carve out police precinct lobbies as places where individuals are not allowed to record," she wrote in her order. Consequently, according to Clarke, Reyes was "likely to succeed on his claims under the Right to Record Acts."</p><p>Based on that likelihood, Clarke issued a temporary injunction barring the NYPD from enforcing its rule and directing it to take down the signs in every police station that forbid filming.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not the end of Reyes's lawsuit—he is seeking a permanent injunction. With this provisional win under their belts, his legal team will now begin to pursue discovery, gathering information about how the NYPD made its rule in the first place and testing whether there's any evidence to support the NYPD's claim that its policy is necessary to protect the privacy of confidential informants and vulnerable victims of crimes who might be discussing delicate matters in the public spaces of precinct houses.</p><p>The YouTube genre of First Amendment auditors is fairly rich, and encompasses everything from kids filming themselves sassing back during traffic stops to steely-eyed libertarians being coolly intransigent at Border Patrol checkpoints deep in the desert. Reyes was a fan of the genre before he was a practitioner. "My brother-in-law, and as well as myself, we used to watch First Amendment audits and police interaction videos," he said. "Traffic stops, going into government agencies and seeing how they really treat members of the public on a daily basis, things of that nature. It always fascinated me how law enforcement and government officials got so upset about somebody recording them, you know? You would think that they would appreciate the transparency."</p><p>When COVID hit, Reyes, a Long Island resident, was furloughed from his job as a logistics director for a manufacturing company, and he found himself with some time on his hands. "I was like, might as well just pick up the camera," Reyes said. "Nobody really is doing it here at Suffolk County." Suffolk County police officers initially reacted very aggressively to Reyes's efforts to film them, he said, "But to their credit, they learned very quickly how to adapt and retrain their officers to allow filming in public areas," Reyes said. "So I branched out."</p><p>That branching out took Reyes all over the country, as tipsters pointed him to departments that were treating people poorly. Reyes says he distinguishes himself from some other First Amendment auditors by being unfailingly polite. He carries himself in his videos with a sort of jovial formality, conscientiously thanking officers for their time. That manner has built him a following—his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LongIslandAudit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel </a>has more than 578,000 subscribers, and he says that across all his social media platforms, he has more than a quarter-billion views. Those views bring ad revenue, which Reyes now supports himself on, and he employs a team of colleagues as well. His manner has also earned him the respect of some police departments: He says he's been invited to give First Amendment trainings to departments in New Jersey and Ohio. Eventually, Reyes found his way to Brooklyn, where the NYPD's policy barring the public from recording how they are treated in police precincts seemed ripe for a challenge.</p><p>Reyes may be claiming victory against the NYPD, but—the meek welcome its officers offered Reyes on Friday notwithstanding—the department doesn't show any signs of giving up. It has filed notice that it is <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.602637/gov.uscourts.nysd.602637.30.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealing</a> the judge's order to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. A ruling on that appeal could take years. In the meantime, the NYPD is also seeking a stay of the temporary injunction, allowing the department to continue to bar filming in the meantime.</p><p>Reyes's lawyer, Andrew Case of LatinoJustice PRLDF, said that the NYPD's dogged commitment to the dubiously legal policy is characteristic of how the department has approached the entire case. "The NYPD appears to be very resolute about defending the rule and seems to be unwilling to consider other alternatives, that wouldn't run afoul of the Right to Record law," Case said. The NYPD declined to comment on the order, referring questions to the New York City Law Department.&nbsp;</p><p>"The NYPD is committed to protecting the privacy of victims and keeping New Yorkers safe, particularly inside the public areas in precincts," a Law Department spokesperson told Hell Gate in a statement. "While we are disappointed with the court's ruling, we are encouraged by the court's indication that NYPD's policy has a legitimate basis. We are evaluating the City's legal options."</p><p>The NYPD is also continuing to fight another lawsuit brought over its ban on filming in police stations. Patricia Rodney, a grandmother who was <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/grandmother-arrested-filming-police" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested and had her arm broken</a> by police who thought she was filming them in the outer vestibule of the 62nd Precinct station in Dyker Heights, also has an open lawsuit in federal court. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who wrote the New York City Right to Record Act, has <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nyc-public-advocate-the-nypd-broke-the-law-arrested-grandmother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed an amicus brief</a> in the case arguing that the NYPD's policy is illegal. The NYPD is seeking to dismiss that case, but the presiding judge has not yet ruled on that motion. The order in Reyes's case isn't binding precedent in Rodney's lawsuit, but it certainly doesn't bode well for the NYPD.&nbsp;</p><p>Back outside the 75th Precinct on Friday, Reyes was ebullient. "This is a major, major win for the people, ladies and gentlemen," he told the camera. "Make sure you guys are smashing that 'like' button and sharing this video so everyone in New York City can see this video and know what we the people can accomplish together. We can accomplish true change. This is just the battle that we won. We still have a war that we need to win."</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <div>
              
              


    <p>Sekos förbundsstyrelse (Service- och kommunikationsfacket) beslutade idag att varsla om sympatiåtgärder till stöd för IF Metalls konflikt med den globala biltillverkaren, Tesla. Skälet till konflikten är att Tesla och deras ägare Elon Musk vägrar att teckna kollektivtal och följa spelreglerna på den svenska arbetsmarknaden.</p>

              


              


    <div>
        <p>– IF Metalls kamp är även vår kamp. Genom att vägra förhålla sig till spelreglerna här i Sverige så försöker Tesla skaffa sig konkurrensfördelar genom att ge arbetarna sämre löner och villkor än de skulle haft med ett kollektivavtal. Det är givetvis helt oacceptabelt. Den strid som nu IF Metall tar är viktig för hela den svenska kollektivavtalsmodellen. Därför har vår förbundsstyrelse valt att lägga ett sympativarsel, säger Sekos förbundsordförande, Gabriella Lavecchia.</p>
<p>Sekos sympatiåtgärder innebär blockad mot utdelning, utlämning och avhämtning av försändelser, brev, paket och pall som görs av PostNord och CityMail till Teslas samtliga arbetsplatser på samtliga orter i Sverige. Detta innebär att exempelvis reservdelar och komponenter till verkstäderna inte kommer levereras av dessa logistikbolag. Blockaden innebär att sympatiåtgärderna kvarstår även om annat företag övertar blockerat arbete.</p>
<p>–&nbsp;Vi backar IF Metall till 100 procent i denna viktiga konflikt. Vi är inne i en viktig period för svensk fackföreningsrörelse och för den svenska modellen. Vi och våra medlemmar kommer att göra allt vi kan för att vi tillsammans ska gå segrande ur denna kamp för rättvisa villkor för Teslas anställda, säger Sekos avtalssekreterare, Ulrika Nilsson.</p>
<p>Sekos stridsåtgärder träder ikraft den <strong>20 november 2023 klockan 01:00</strong></p>
<p>Varsel om utvidgning av konfliktåtgärder kommer att vidtas för det fall åsidosättande av stridsåtgärderna förekommer.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en" data-v-324b68a8="" id="sec0" data-v-cbbc8d8e=""><h2>Abstract</h2>  <div><p>Scholars usually portray institutions as stable, inviting a status quo bias in their theories. Change, when it is theorized, is frequently attributed to exogenous factors. This paper, by contrast, proposes that institutional change can occur endogenously through population loss, as institutional losers become demotivated and leave, whereas institutional winners remain. This paper provides a detailed demonstration of how this form of endogenous change occurred on the English Wikipedia. A qualitative content analysis shows that Wikipedia transformed from a dubious source of information in its early years to an increasingly reliable one over time.

<h2> INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p> Institutions theorists seek to explain institutional stability and change. However, most accounts have a status quo bias, as institutions are portrayed as stable. When change is observed, it is typically through alterations of the formal rules of the institution. These changes are frequently attributed to easily observable exogenous factors, such as external crises, influxes of new ideas, or alterations in actors’ power. However, endogenous processes may also create change and their neglect biases our accounts of institutions.</p>
<p> This paper advances a theory of endogenous institutional change whereby members of an institution react differently to the outcomes of disputes within institutions. Losers (or those who disagree with the outcomes of the disputes) may become demotivated and disempowered, whereas the winners (or those who agree with the outcomes of the disputes) may become galvanized and empowered. If the winners and losers belong to coherent camps with divergent interests and ideas about the institution, disproportionate exits by the losers can cause drastic institutional changes over time. The contribution of this paper is to show theoretically and empirically that consequential change <em>can occur solely endogenously</em> and that population loss can be the mechanism behind such change.<a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p> The paper provides a detailed demonstration of this occurring on the English Wikipedia. Beneath the hood of this popular website exists a large community of volunteers (Wikipedia editors) who collaboratively write all Wikipedia content. This population of volunteers comes together in deliberative and democratic fora where they adjudicate what kind of content belongs on the encyclopedia. This paper shows that the English Wikipedia transformed its content over time through a gradual reinterpretation of its ambiguous Neutral Point of View (NPOV) guideline, the core rule regarding content on Wikipedia. This had meaningful consequences, turning an organization that used to lend credence and false balance to pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and extremism into a proactive debunker, fact-checker and identifier of fringe discourse. There are several steps to the transformation. First, Wikipedians disputed how to apply the NPOV rule in specific instances in various corners of the encyclopedia. Second, the earliest contentious disputes were resolved against Wikipedians who were more supportive of or lenient toward conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and conservatism, and in favor of Wikipedians whose understandings of the NPOV guideline were decisively anti-fringe. Third, the resolutions of these disputes enhanced the institutional power of the latter Wikipedians, whereas it led to the demobilization and exit of the pro-fringe Wikipedians. A power imbalance early on deepened over time due to disproportionate exits of demotivated, unsuccessful pro-fringe Wikipedia editors. Fourth, this meant that the remaining Wikipedia editor population, freed from pushback, increasingly interpreted and implemented the NPOV guideline in an anti-fringe manner. This endogenous process led to a gradual but highly consequential reinterpretation of the NPOV guideline throughout the encyclopedia.</p>
<p> The paper demonstrates these processes through qualitative content analysis, archival research, and process tracing. First, to document a transformation in Wikipedia’s content, a qualitative content analysis was conducted on a sample of 63 representative articles. Content on the pages was analyzed across time with a predetermined coding scheme (see Boreus and Bergström <a href="#r6"><span>Reference Boreus and Bergström</span>2017</a>; Elkins, Spitzer, and Tallberg <a href="#r11"><span>Reference Elkins, Spitzer and Tallberg</span>2021</a>; Herrera and Braumoeller <a href="#r17"><span>Reference Herrera and Braumoeller</span>2004</a>). The analysis shows that the content changed over time from lending credence to fringe views to delegitimizing the fringe views. Second, to explain why these content changes occurred, the paper uses process tracing on Wikipedia’s archives, analyzing article talk page discussions about rule interpretations, related discussions on general noticeboards, arbitration rulings, and editor sanctions proceedings, as well as the histories of individual Wikipedia editors. Analyses of debates regarding individual articles lend strong support for the theory of endogenous institutional change. Article-by-article evidence is supplemented by an analysis of a sample of referenda where editors are asked to express their views about the NPOV rule’s application to fringe topics. The analysis shows that the disproportionate population loss is systematic across the encyclopedia, as editors who hold the pro-fringe view exit Wikipedia at a higher rate than anti-fringe editors.</p>
<p> These changes occurred despite structural biases in favor of stability. Even though the rules and content on Wikipedia are constantly subject to change, the organization’s decision-making procedures are biased to a conservative status quo. All changes on Wikipedia must be approved through consensus and editors who act contrary to consensus are punished. Furthermore, the transformation was neither an inevitability nor likely outcome of the original design of the institution. A comparison to other versions of Wikipedia demonstrates the contingent nature of the English Wikipedia’s trajectory. For example, even though the Croatian and English Wikipedia share the same core rules, content on the two versions of Wikipedia looks drastically different, as the Croatian Wikipedia lends credence to anti-LGBT rhetoric and pseudohistory (Sampson <a href="#r29"><span>Reference Sampson</span>2013</a>). These outcomes were not intended by Wikipedia’s founders, as shown by their own delineation of the rules in the early years, and in the case of Wikipedia’s co-founder, a complete disavowal of Wikipedia’s transformation.</p>
<p> This paper uses the understudied politics of Wikipedia as a lens through which to examine institutional theories of change. It has two major contributions. One is theoretical, demonstrating how population loss can be an endogenous mechanism of institutional change. Losses in institutional clashes can be demoralizing and inhibiting for the losers, leading them to abandon the institution and leaving the institution in the hands of their adversaries. The winners subsequently have freer rein to push for changes in the institution. This form of change may potentially have explanatory value regarding the trajectories of bureaucracies, political movements, political parties, and professions, as discontented losers within those institutions opt to leave their institution rather than fight an uphill battle against empowered and emboldened winners.</p>
<p> The other contribution is empirical, as the paper provides a comprehensive study of the politics of Wikipedia, a highly consequential organization in the online political information ecosystem. The paper documents a heretofore undocumented transformation in Wikipedia’s content over its life span. While scholars and commentators have remarked in recent years on Wikipedia’s status as a beacon of information in an online space plagued by misinformation, there is no comprehensive analysis of a transformation over Wikipedia’s life span.<a href="#fn2"><span>Footnote </span>

<h2> INSTITUTIONS AND ENDOGENOUS CHANGE</h2>
<p> Most scholarly works on institutions have a status quo bias, as the focus is on accounting for the persistence of institutional arrangements over time. To explain change, scholars tend to look for exogenous factors. For rational choice institutionalists, institutions reflect equilibrium solutions to problems of cooperation between different actors.<a href="#fn3"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>3</sup></a> In most rationalist accounts of institutions, these equilibria do not become unstable unless the external circumstances change (e.g., through alterations in power), and the appearance of new problems that require new solutions. For sociological institutionalists, institutions reflect shared norms and understandings.<a href="#fn4"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>4</sup></a> Actors that compose the membership of an institution exist in a social environment where institutional practices become taken for granted. Individual actors have limited agency to alter the existing institutional arrangements. These shared norms do not get altered unless by powerful external sources or through the appearance of norm entrepreneurs. For historical institutionalists, institutions reflect decision-making made at critical junctures, temporal sequencing, and path dependency. Past decision-making has a persistent impact on institutions, contributing to stability over time, even if the existing arrangements are suboptimal. The sources of change tend to be external crises or changes in the broader environment that alter the functions and purpose of institutions.<a href="#fn5"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p> Recent comparative politics scholarship (particularly in the historical institutionalist tradition; see Bleich <a href="#r4"><span>Reference Bleich</span>2018</a>; Mahoney and Thelen <a href="#r25"><span>Reference Mahoney and Thelen</span>2009</a>; Streeck and Thelen <a href="#r34"><span>Reference Streeck and Thelen</span>2005</a>; Thelen <a href="#r35"><span>Reference Thelen</span>2004</a>) and international relations-oriented research on norm contestation (see Dietelhoff and Zimmermann <a href="#r10"><span>Reference Dietelhoff and Zimmermann</span>2020</a>; Sandholtz <a href="#r30"><span>Reference Sandholtz</span>2008</a>; Sandholtz and Stiles <a href="#r31"><span>Reference Sandholtz and Stiles</span>2009</a>; Wiener <a href="#r39"><span>Reference Wiener</span>2009</a>) have identified rule ambiguity and norm ambiguity, respectively, as promising plausible mechanisms for gradual endogenous change.<a href="#fn6"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>6</sup></a> The seeds of change lie in the intrinsic inability of rules to apply clearly and unambiguously to most situations that confront members of complex institutions. This permits actors to reinterpret rules and norms through their application in specific instances. However, while this literature points to the plausibility of endogenous institutional change through ambiguity in rule application, many cases are prompted by exogenous causes, such as (i) the involvement of new actors, (ii) environmentally driven changes in the balance of power between actors, and (iii) the appearance of new problems that need solving. While these may be gradual processes of change, the underlying causes are frequently exogenous.<a href="#fn7"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p> A prominent example of this kind of change in the comparative politics literature is Bleich’s (<a href="#r4"><span>Reference Bleich</span>2018</a>) study of the French High Court’s changing interpretation of hate crime laws over time. Bleich’s explanation for the shift in how the court applied the rules focuses on the entry and influence of new actors, as he delineates how activist organizations influenced how the French High Court interpreted hate crime laws. He also shows that the French High Court was influenced by the European Court of Human Rights. In the international relations literature, a prominent example of this kind of change is Sandholtz’s (<a href="#r30"><span>Reference Sandholtz</span>2008</a>) study on the rules regarding wartime plunder of artistic and cultural artifacts. In Sandholtz’s study, rules regarding wartime plunder were reinterpreted after major wars (the Napoleonic Wars and World War II), as the victims of large-scale plunder pressed to regain their property. In both cases, the rules in question (hate crime laws and rules of war) were broad and unspecified, allowing for different application of the rules in practice. In both Bleich (<a href="#r4"><span>Reference Bleich</span>2018</a>) and Sandholtz (<a href="#r30"><span>Reference Sandholtz</span>2008</a>), a lack of specificity in the wording of the rules permitted changes in application over time, but those changes were caused by exogenous factors (new actors or major wars).</p>
<p> My account of institutional change on Wikipedia contrasts with these other accounts in three ways. First, change was not caused by the entry of new actors, but rather the loss of actors. Whereas other approaches to the study of institutions tend to see the relevant population of an institution as being stable or increasing, my account shows that the loss of a particular population contributed to Wikipedia’s shift. Furthermore, other accounts see conflicts within institutions as resulting in winners and losers where the losers typically remain within the institution. As Conran and Thelen (<a href="#r8"><span>Reference Conran, Thelen, Fioretos, Falleti and Sheingate</span>2016</a>) note, losers remobilize and live to fight another day, which may lead them to change the institution in the future. However, the extent to which that is true depends on the nature of the institution, as well as the characteristics of the conflicts and the participants involved. Losses may entrench power advantages that entail feedback effects and are hard to rebalance, thus ensuring that losers cannot return the institution to the status quo. That was certainly the case on Wikipedia.</p>
<p> Second, power asymmetries are formed on Wikipedia. However, unlike many other studies of institutions, the power asymmetry was not due to broader environmental changes that altered the social or material sources of actors’ power. Rather, power asymmetries formed as actors gained power <em>within</em> the rubrics of the institution itself. In the case of Wikipedia, <em>experience</em> provided a potent source of power, which made victories in early disputes consequential. In other organizations, there may be other power dynamics that are made apparent and entrenched through wins and losses in institutional conflicts.</p>
<p> Third, reinterpretation of Wikipedia’s rules was not prompted by the appearance of new problems that required new solutions. Rather, the practical consequence of the rule reinterpretations on Wikipedia entailed fixing old problems (the presence of sources and content that legitimized fringe perspectives) that in large part stemmed from how the rules had been interpreted in the past.</p>
<p> In contrast to much of the existing literature, this paper argues that institutions which are otherwise portrayed as stable are in fact constantly subject to change from within. The change can occur entirely endogenously.<a href="#fn8"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>8</sup></a> There are four steps to such change. First, consistent with some of the historical institutionalist and norm scholarship, the seeds of change are located in the intrinsic inability of rules and norms to apply clearly and unambiguously to most situations that confront members of the institution. Second, rule ambiguity creates openings for members to impose new meanings on the rules at the micro level, as the rules are applied to specific situations. Since institutions are composed of actors that have different interests and diverse views, rule interpretations can be a potent source of conflict. Third, the conflicts may be resolved, resulting in winners and losers. The resolutions of these conflicts in favor of actors with certain rule interpretations can alter the balance of power within the institution, as the losers of past conflicts get demobilized, sanctioned, or lose status, whereas the winners get mobilized, elevated, and gain institutional power. Fourth, if actors with similar and overlapping viewpoints and interests (coherent camps) win early and frequent victories across an institution, they may shape how the overarching rules of the institution are understood to work in practice.</p>
<p> For the process to play out in this manner, <em>camps with coherent interests and views</em> must exist (A and B in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Otherwise, settlements in individual disputes lead to indeterminate long-term results. Additionally, for trajectories to form over time, victories must result in <em>power advantages.</em> In the absence of a meaningful power advantage, losers should be able to regroup and live to fight another day over the interpretation of the rules, with indeterminate long-term results. The relative ease with which actors can exit institutions affects the speed of change. Migrating from a country may entail considerable costs, whereas leaving a voluntary association may be relatively cost-free, which means that rapid change may be more likely in the latter case once a power asymmetry forms. Finally, for the process to play out in this specific manner, it presumes that <em>exogenous factors do not intervene with the process.</em> Both exogenous and endogenous factors can work in tandem, but the contribution of this paper is to show theoretically and empirically that consequential change <em>can occur solely endogenously.</em>

<p> The remainder of this paper provides a detailed demonstration of how this process of endogenous change plays on the English Wikipedia. The paper explains what Wikipedia is, justifies why Wikipedia is a worthy case of inquiry, documents how Wikipedia’s content has transformed over its life span, and explains how this transformation happened. The penultimate section of the paper examines various alternative explanations, showing that they fail to account for Wikipedia’s transformation.</p>

<h2> WIKIPEDIA AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE POLITICAL INFORMATION ECOSYSTEM</h2>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec4" id="sec4">
<h3> The Structure of Wikipedia</h3>
<p> Wikipedia is a nonprofit, multilingual, open-access online encyclopedia started by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001. The encyclopedia is user-generated. Anyone is free to edit it. By May 2021, there were more than 40&nbsp;million registered users, of whom nearly 140,000 were active editors. Wikipedians generally edit pseudonymously, but extant data indicate that Wikipedians are disproportionately white males from the Global North. One in four Wikipedians primarily edit the English language version of Wikipedia (see Hill and Shaw <a href="#r18"><span>Reference Hill and Shaw</span>2013</a>; Wikipedia <a href="#r44">2021b</a>; Yasseri, Sumi, and Kertesz <a href="#r45"><span>Reference Yasseri, Sumi and Kertesz</span>2012b</a>).</p>
<p> Editors must comply with three core Wikipedia content guidelines:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>1.</span>
<strong>Neutral point of view (WP:NPOV):</strong> “representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic” (Wikipedia <a href="#r40">2020a</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>2.</span>
<strong>No original research (WP:NOR):</strong> “you must be able to cite reliable, published sources that are directly related to the topic of the article, and directly support the material being presented” (Wikipedia <a href="#r41">2020b</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>3.</span>
<strong>Verifiability (WP:V):</strong> “verifiability means other people using the encyclopedia can check that the information comes from a reliable source… All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable” (Wikipedia <a href="#r42">2020c</a>).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>WP:NPOV is the guideline at the heart of most disputes on the encyclopedia. The NPOV guideline affects whether something should be covered, the weight of the coverage, and whether the cited sources are reliable. On subjects where there are diverse and incompatible views, “edit wars” frequently arise. These are situations when a change is made to an article (e.g., removal of text, addition of text, and rewording of text), and the change gets reverted, leading to an unstable cycle of additions and reverts of the same content (see Jemielniak <a href="#r20"><span>Reference Jemielniak</span>2014</a>; Tkacz <a href="#r36"><span>Reference Tkacz</span>2015</a>; Yasseri et al. <a href="#r46"><span>Reference Yasseri, Sumi, Rung, Kornai and Kertesz</span>2012</a>).</p>
<p> How does the encyclopedia deal with disputes like these? One might think that such disputes would lead to an inconsistent product where articles look drastically different from day to day, but Wikipedia produces a very stable and consistent product. This is because there are multilayered dispute settlement mechanisms and elaborate norms regarding editor behavior. Wikipedia’s community reaches decisions about rules and content through a combination of deliberative discussions and referenda. These democratic processes have the goal of determining whether content has “consensus.” If a proposed change does not have consensus, the article experiencing edit wars will be returned to the status quo.</p>
<p> A typical edit war will be resolved in the following manner: an editor makes changes to a page. Other editors disapprove of the change and revert the change. The status quo ante is established until a consensus for inclusion can be found on the talk page of the article. Editors may be able to work out mutually acceptable compromises. If they are not able to work out acceptable compromises among the small subset that are engaged with a single article, they can subject the dispute to input from the broader Wikipedia community. For example, if the editors who edit the Margaret Thatcher page are having a dispute that they cannot resolve among themselves, they may take the dispute to noticeboards that are frequented by large numbers of Wikipedians who do not frequent the Thatcher page.</p>
<p> However, these procedures are not always sufficient to establish stability on a page. This is particularly the case on large high-profile articles with stable and coherent camps of editors, frequent editing, and multiple controversial aspects. When articles experience extraordinary levels of edit-warring, editors may request dispute settlement before administrators on the “Administrators Noticeboard” or arbitrators on the “Arbitration Committee.” These bodies primarily adjudicate behavioral problems among Wikipedians rather than adjudicate content directly (that is something for Wikipedia’s deliberative democratic processes to resolve). The bodies tend to sanction the most active and raucous editors on the dysfunctional pages.</p>
<p> Administrators and arbitrators are elected by the Wikipedia userbase. To become an administrator, an editor goes through the “Request for Adminship” process, which is essentially an election on the suitability of an editor to become an administrator. Any experienced editor can make a request for a position as administrator.<a href="#fn10"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>10</sup></a> The request is unlikely to be granted unless they have a well-established history as a contributor on the encyclopedia and have demonstrated an ability to get along with other editors. The threshold to become an administrator is high, as editors generally require support by 75% of voters. Editors who are new and who behave in divisive ways are unlikely to get the support needed to become administrators.<a href="#fn11"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>11</sup></a> The English Wikipedia has approximately one thousand administrators.</p>
<p> The Arbitration Committee is vastly smaller, with membership oscillating between 13 and 18 members. Elections to the Arbitration Committee are more formal and eventful processes than the requests for adminship, as the elections occur annually, eligible registered editors are notified about the elections on their user talk page, and cast secret ballots.<a href="#fn12"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>12</sup></a> Experienced editors who are not divisive are better poised to garner the votes to become arbitrators.</p>

<h3> Case Selection Justification</h3>
<p> There are several motivating factors in choosing the English Wikipedia as a case to study institutional change: (i) it is an important case; (ii) it is an understudied case; (iii) it could be construed as a least-likely case for institutional change; and (iv) it has unique availability of data, which makes it possible to observe slow, gradual, endogenous processes that result in consequential drastic change over time.</p>
<p> First, Wikipedia is an important institution. One that is worthwhile to study in its own right. <em>Wikipedia.org</em> is one of the most popular websites in the world. The English Wikipedia is frequently at the top or near the top of Google searches for a known person or event in the English language (e.g., Vincent and Hecht <a href="#r37"><span>Reference Vincent and Hecht</span>2021</a>). Wikipedia is also widely perceived as a trustworthy and reliable source of information (e.g., Bruckman <a href="#r7"><span>Reference Bruckman</span>2022</a>), giving it considerable power in public discourse and ideational diffusion. Wikipedia’s influence is also boosted by the fact that Wikipedia pages, unlike other forms of content (such as news reports and scholarship), are often written in summary style and in layman’s terms, thus making the information in Wikipedia articles more accessible to readers. Furthermore, tech giants, such as YouTube, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, have incorporated Wikipedia into their own platforms.</p>
<p> Due to its popularity and perceived trustworthiness, Wikipedia has the power to legitimize and delegitimize subjects. This is a website that can declare whether something is a pseudoscience, a falsehood, a conspiracy theory, or bigotry. World leaders can be described as dictators, perpetrators of violence can be identified, and the effects of implementing certain public policies can be characterized as positive or negative. Additionally, in many cases, it seems clear that actors who are covered by Wikipedia believe that Wikipedia matters, as politicians have on many occasions been exposed as having edited their own Wikipedia pages, and authoritarian regimes have blocked Wikipedia in parts or in its entirety.</p>
<p> Wikipedia’s salience has increased over time, as scholars express concern over the intersection of the Internet and politics. The Internet has displaced traditional gatekeepers, and contributed to the wide diffusion of conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and extremist rhetoric. Whereas the other major online platforms have been criticized for their role in monetizing, inculcating, and diffusing extremism and misinformation, Wikipedia has often been hailed as an exception: a distinctly positive actor in the online political ecosystem,<a href="#fn13"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>13</sup></a> an actor that serves a proactive gatekeeping role where it outright debunks, fact-checks, and highlights the errors and fringe nature of the very same discourses popularized on the other platforms.</p>
<p> Second, Wikipedia is an understudied institution in an understudied organizational environment. Aside from its importance in politics, there are several things about Wikipedia as an organization that political scientists and organizational scholars should find intriguing. It is an enormous organization that is based on the open-source or commons-based peer production organizational model (e.g., Benkler <a href="#r2"><span>Reference Benkler</span>2002</a>; Reagle <a href="#r27"><span>Reference Reagle</span>2010</a>; Tkacz <a href="#r36"><span>Reference Tkacz</span>2015</a>). Unlike traditional organizations, such as firms and bureaucracies, Wikipedia is characterized by a lack of “formal hierarchy.” Editors on Wikipedia are not managed and instructed by “managers,” but rather self-assign tasks to do. Editors are not motivated by monetary rewards, unlike members of traditional organizations.</p>
<p> Decision-making on Wikipedia is deliberative and democratic. The rules of Wikipedia are always subject to change, which effectively makes all rules, norms, and content on Wikipedia subject to constant plebiscites. Consequently, Wikipedia both reflects and accentuates processes that are analogous to those in other organizations. Scholars have consequentially used Wikipedia to study collaboration, conflict, polarization, and partisanship, as well as politics and organizational dynamics more broadly (Greenstein, Gu, and Zhu <a href="#r14"><span>Reference Greenstein, Gu and Zhu</span>2021</a>; Heaberlin and DeDeo <a href="#r16"><span>Reference Heaberlin and DeDeo</span>2016</a>; Jemielniak <a href="#r20"><span>Reference Jemielniak</span>2014</a>; Konieczsny 2009; Lerner and Lomi <a href="#r24"><span>Reference Lerner and Lomi</span>2019</a>; Reagle <a href="#r27"><span>Reference Reagle</span>2010</a>; Shi et al. <a href="#r33"><span>Reference Shi, Teplitskiy, Duede and Evans</span>2019</a>; Tkacz <a href="#r36"><span>Reference Tkacz</span>2015</a>; Yasseri et al. <a href="#r46"><span>Reference Yasseri, Sumi, Rung, Kornai and Kertesz</span>2012</a>; Yasseri, Sumi, and Kertesz <a href="#r45"><span>Reference Yasseri, Sumi and Kertesz</span>2012</a>). While Wikipedia has been the subject of study by computer scientists, physicists, information scientists, and sociologists, it has been neglected by political scientists.</p>
<p> Third, Wikipedia could be construed as a least-likely case for institutional change and most-likely case for organizational stability, as the organization has several structural biases in favor of stability and the status quo. The requirement that there needs to be a “consensus” among editors in favor of both addition of content and rule changes should make it hard to enact substantial changes.<a href="#fn14"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>14</sup></a> In the event of disputes, the guiding rule is to retain the status quo unless a consensus can be established for any change. A minority of editors can therefore block controversial changes. Furthermore, the presence of a large and diverse userbase means that ideational changes among individuals and small groups should not result in frequent or sudden changes over time. Wikipedia also strongly enforces compliance with the rules, which means that large-scale rule violations will not be a likely source of change over time (see Piskorski and Gorbatai <a href="#r26"><span>Reference Piskorski and Gorbatai</span>2017</a>). The strong enforcement leads editors to edit within accepted boundaries and within consensuses. Given these institutional characteristics, one might expect Wikipedia to have a conservative status quo bias.<a href="#fn15"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p> Furthermore, the founders of Wikipedia have not intervened to cause new interpretations of the guidelines among the userbase. Sanger, who crafted the core NPOV rule, has condemned the interpretations of the guideline that emerged over time.<a href="#fn16"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>16</sup></a> Wales has held a more agnostic view of change on Wikipedia over time, saying in 2006, “One of the great things about NPOV is that it is a term of art and a community fills it with meaning over time” (Reason <a href="#r28">2006</a>).</p>
<p> Fourth, Wikipedia has a unique availability of data. A major problem in most case-specific accounts of institutional change is the inaccessibility of comprehensive data to evaluate causes and effects. Scholars must rely on a sliver of data that are available to piece together what the preferences of various actors might be, what actions these actors took, and how the preferences and actions of these actors led to institutional change or stability. What adds to the problem is that the publicly available data may fail to reflect the actual processes that led to change. For example, debates may take place in front of cameras and voting may be logged into records, but the meaningful negotiations occur behind closed doors.</p>
<p> In comparison with other institutions, Wikipedia has several advantages in terms of studying institutional change. In other largescale institutions, it is not feasible to identify and collect data on every participant, and to track the behavior of every participant over time. Scholars are often forced to fill gaps with theory or by making assumptions. There is a risk that unobserved variables have a significant impact on outcomes, which makes it hard to make robust claims about the causes of institutional change. On Wikipedia, on the other hand, virtually all edits and comments are logged and open to public viewing. This means that it is possible to trace each input in every debate, as well as to sift through the editing history of each Wikipedia editor. Thus, there is an enormity of relevant data on which to test, refine, and build theories of institutional change.</p>

<h2> RESEARCH DESIGN</h2>
<p> The research design of the paper has two components. First, the paper codes content in the lead of Wikipedia articles, showing a pro-to-anti-fringe shift in content. Second, the paper does process-tracing of trends within Wikipedia’s governance to show how this shift happened (George and Bennett <a href="#r12"><span>Reference George and Bennett</span>2005</a>). In terms of analyzing changes in the content of Wikipedia articles, the paper uses nonautomated qualitative content analysis to classify whether Wikipedia pages use language that legitimizes or delegitimizes fringe positions and entities. An advantage of qualitative content analysis is that it permits analysts to observe subtle, yet meaningful nuances in meaning.<a href="#fn17"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>17</sup></a> It entails human coding and interpretation of textual sources according to structured and systematic coding schemes (see Boreus and Bergström <a href="#r6"><span>Reference Boreus and Bergström</span>2017</a>; Elkins, Spitzer, and Tallberg <a href="#r11"><span>Reference Elkins, Spitzer and Tallberg</span>2021</a>; Herrera and Braumoeller <a href="#r17"><span>Reference Herrera and Braumoeller</span>2004</a>). More specifically, the paper systematically classified a sample of 63 article leads with a predetermined coding scheme.<a href="#fn18"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>18</sup></a> The 63 pages were chosen because they are representative of the population of relevant cases: all the pages are on topics that have been linked to pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, extremism, and fringe rhetoric in public discourse.</p>
<p> Within the relevant population, the chosen pages reflect diverse topic areas (health, climate, gender, sexuality, race, abortion, religion, politics, international relations, and history). The pages also vary in terms of the time of creation (some pages were created early and others later), and temporal prominence (the topics covered in the pages were more prominent during different time periods). The pages include biographies (which have more restrictive standards for inclusion of pejorative content) and nonbiographies.</p>
<p> The contents of the chosen Wikipedia pages were classified according to a five-category coding scheme. These categories reflect varying degrees of neutrality. On one end of the spectrum, the language lends credence and legitimacy to fringe views. On the other end, the language firmly delegitimizes the fringe views:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>1.</span>
<strong>Fringe normalization:</strong> The fringe position/entity is normalized and legitimized. There is an absence of criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>2.</span>
<strong>Teach the controversy:</strong> The fringe position/entity is presented as a matter of active scientific or political dispute (A says X, B says Y).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>3.</span>
<strong>False balance:</strong> The lead places emphasis on the expertise, credibility, evidence, and arguments of the anti-fringe side (e.g., “some scientists say,” “some medical organizations say”), but the pro-fringe side still gets space to rebut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>4.</span>
<strong>Identification of the fringe view:</strong> The lead places emphasis on the legitimacy and the overwhelming numbers that compose the anti-fringe side (e.g., “scientific consensus,” “the scientific community”), but space is still given to the pro-fringe side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>5.</span>
<strong>Proactive fringe-busting:</strong> Space is only given to the anti-fringe side whose position is stated as fact in Wikipedia’s own voice.<a href="#fn19"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>19</sup></a> The evidence that supports the anti-fringe position is presented, whereas the flaws of the pro-fringe perspective are outlined.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The paper uses a cross-temporal analysis of each article’s lead, thus tracking changes over time. A stable version of each article was analyzed at the end of each year. Articles were checked more frequently if the pages had frequent and erratic editing patterns. Changes on Wikipedia articles can be accessed through archives that show each change, thus making the study replicable. <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> and the Supplementary Material include examples of language from each article’s lead. Due to space constraints, changes in nine representative article leads are shown in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, whereas 54 additional articles are in the Supplementary Material.</p><div data-magellan-destination="tab1" id="tab1">

</span>
</p></div>
<p> Per the analysis (see <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> and the Supplementary Material), content on the English Wikipedia shows a clear trend from language that legitimizes fringe positions to language that delegitimizes fringe positions. Newer articles tend to adopt language from the anti-fringe categories at their creation, whereas older articles tend to adopt language that is more fringe-normalizing at their creation. None of the articles move in a direction where they become more fringe-normalizing.</p>
<p> The analysis shows that in its early years, the English Wikipedia adhered to a “strict” NPOV approach whereby Wikipedia content was open to a diversity of opinions and sources, and where Wikipedians could not state contested views as facts in Wikipedia’s own voice. Thus, a typical page on a subject related to pseudoscience and contested science would adopt a “Some say X, others say Y” style, even on topics where mainstream scientific opinion overwhelmingly favored X.</p>

<h2> ENDOGENOUS CHANGE ON WIKIPEDIA</h2>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec8" id="sec8">
<h3> Explaining the Findings</h3>
<p> The paper has demonstrated that English Wikipedia content changed over time. This section seeks to explain <em>why</em> the content changed. In doing so, the paper uses process tracing. The paper systematically analyzes the internal Wikipedia discussion forums where editors duked out content. More specially, the paper analyzes the archived talk pages of the 63 articles and relevant discussions about article content on general noticeboards.<a href="#fn20"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>20</sup></a> To classify editors into the Anti-Fringe camp (AF) and the Pro-Fringe camp (PF), the paper uses a variety of data sources: the viewpoints expressed by editors on the article talk pages themselves, the views expressed by editors brought up for sanctioning on the Administrators’ noticeboard or the “Requests for Enforcement” page before the Arbitration Committee, and lists of editors brought up in arbitration committee rulings.</p>
<p> These data sources provide article-by-article evidence about relevant individual editors on the pages in question. However, to assess systematically what happens to AF and PF editors across the English Wikipedia (not just the 63 articles), the paper uses a sample of referenda where editors are implicitly asked whether they support a pro- or anti-fringe interpretation of the NPOV guideline. The user histories of the participants in the referenda are then analyzed to uncover whether they are still active or whether they have voluntarily left Wikipedia, substantially reduced their number of contributions, been banned from the relevant topics, or blocked from Wikipedia in its entirety.</p>
<p> The evidence is broadly consistent with the observable implications of the paper’s theory of endogenous institutional change (the processes of the theory are outlined in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).<a href="#fn21"><span>Footnote </span>

<div><p><span>Figure 2.</span> How Did the NPOV Rule Change?</p>
</div></div>
<p> The key piece of evidence is that PF members disappear over time in the wake of losses, both voluntarily and involuntarily. PF members are those who vote affirmatively for policies that normalize or lend credence to fringe viewpoints, who edit such content into articles, and who vote to defend fellow members of PF when there are debates as to whether they engaged in wrongdoing. Members of AF do the opposite.</p>
<p> The causal mechanism for the gradual disappearance is that early losses demotivated members from PF or led to their sanctioning, whereas members of AF were empowered by early victories. As exits of PF members mount across the encyclopedia, the community increasingly adopts AF’s viewpoints as the way that the NPOV guideline should be understood.</p>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec9" id="sec9">
<h4> Step 1: Rule Ambiguity</h4>
<p> The NPOV rule of Wikipedia is ambiguous in its specific application. During the early period of Wikipedia, Wikipedia’s NPOV rule was understood as indicating a “describe-the-controversy” approach to disputes between sources: Wikipedia should not take sides on contested issues, and Wikipedia should be open to a diverse array of sources. Thus, the policy allowed for inclusion of lower-quality sources, so long as they were attributed. This meant that if sources disagreed in terms of how they covered the topic of homeopathy, the Wikipedia article on homeopathy would present both sides of the issue and avoid taking a firm stance. The Wikipedia page on homeopathy included text that effectively said “Advocates for homeopathy say…” and “Critics of homeopathy say…,” whereas it was frowned upon among early Wikipedians to state decisively in Wikipedia’s own voice that “Homeopathy is a pseudoscientific system of alternative medicine” (as the first line of the Wikipedia page stated in 2020). This was largely in line with Larry Sanger’s intentions when he crafted the NPOV rule (ArsTechnica <a href="#r1">2014</a>).</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec10" id="sec10">
<h4> Step 2: Clashes between Camps over Rule Interpretations</h4>
<p> On contentious topics (e.g., American politics, conspiracy theories, and pseudoscience), editors had vast differences in terms of how they understood the application of Wikipedia’s rules. Editors who were anti-conspiracy theories, anti-pseudoscience, and liberal (the AF camp) pushed understandings of NPOV that took a firm anti-conspiracy-theory and anti-pseudoscience stance. Thus, they argued for reliance on strong sources (such as studies and highly reputable mainstream news outlets), nonuse of lower-quality sources (such as partisan outlets and disreputable outlets), stating claims from strong sources in Wikipedia’s own voice (rather than attributing them as a source’s opinion), firmly stating that minority views are fringe, and stating that falsehoods are falsehoods.</p>
<p> Editors who were more supportive of conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and conservatism (the PF camp) argued for reliance on sources across a broad range of reliability (in part, because they perceived academics and newspapers of record to be biased), stating claims from sources as if they were always an attributed POV, and avoiding firm stances on the state of a controversy.</p>
<p> On the homeopathy page, this meant that PF members raised questions about relying on reporting by the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Washington Post</em>, insisted that studies skeptical of homeopathy’s efficacy be phrased as opinion, and sought to include rebuttals by pro-homeopathy organizations and pseudoscientists. AF members held the opposite view, as they sought to phrase skeptical content in Wikipedia’s own voice and strongly opposed content sourced to pro-homeopathy organizations.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec11" id="sec11">
<h4> Step 3: Formation of a Power Asymmetry</h4>
<p> Over the course of years, AF successfully shaped how to understand the practical application of Wikipedia’s NPOV guideline. These early victories gave AF an upper hand in editing disputes on pages related to conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and American politics. There was no single critical juncture. Rather, there were many gradual mutually reinforcing steps across several spheres of Wikipedia.</p>
<p> One type of change that was important early in Wikipedia’s development was intervention into content disputes by arbitrators on highly dysfunctional pages. Highly dysfunctional pages are those characterized by edit-warring among a multitude of editors to the point that the pages are unstable over extended periods of time, and editors cannot even agree on the status quo version of the pages.</p>
<p> Two particularly important early arbitration rulings in the early years were the arbitration committee cases on climate change (2005) and pseudoscience (2006), which largely reaffirmed some viewpoints held by AF in those specific disputes and led to sanctions that primarily targeted prolific PF editors (although some AF editors were also targeted) for behavioral wrongdoing. The disputes were at their core about edit-warring between different camps as to whether climate change articles should reflect the scientific consensus on climate change or lend weight to those who dispute the scientific consensus, and broadly about how pseudoscientific ideas and minority scientific perspectives should be framed.</p>
<p> A second type of important changes involve the writing of guidelines to supplement the existing NPOV guideline and clarify how the NPOV guideline should be applied. This includes the creation of the Reliable Sources guideline (2005), which introduced a basic framework for evaluating the reliability of sources, the Fringe Theory guideline (2007), which introduced a basic framework for evaluating minority views and fringe views, and the Reliable Sources (Medicine) guideline (2008), which set a higher quality threshold for sources on medicine-related topics out of a concern that poorly sourced content could cause harm to readers.</p>
<p> These guidelines were crafted by a relatively small set of experienced editors, including many from AF who were involved in active content disputes on topics that related to these rules. All editors can participate in processes to change rules and add supplements to rules. These changes must go through the normal Wikipedia consensus decision-making process. While these particular rules were not written to specifically address content in those disputes, the enactment of these rules as supplemental modifications to the NPOV guideline would prove useful in those disputes. Furthermore, discussions related to those rules showed that editors wanted to privilege science and academic expertise in terms of identifying what is fringe, but the Reliable Sources and Fringe Theory guidelines were broad enough in scope that they could also be used to identify fringe discourse and beliefs outside of science, such as with conspiracy theories and extremist rhetoric in politics.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec12" id="sec12">
<h4> Step 4: Reinterpretation of Wikipedia’s Rules</h4>
<p> The early victories and selective departures had positive feedback effects for three reasons: (i) they enhanced the value of experience, (ii) they created a numerical advantage, and (iii) they spurred a sourcing bias. Consequently, AF editors experienced greater success in editing, whereas PF editors did not, which led to lopsided exits over time. Together, these factors led AF to increasingly get what it wanted and sway the broader Wikipedia userbase to see one interpretation of the rules as the undisputed accurate interpretation of the rules.</p>
<p> First, experience matters a great deal on Wikipedia, which makes disproportionate exits early on highly consequential. Since Wikipedia is notoriously complicated for new editors to maneuver, experienced editors have a decisive advantage in content disputes (Jemielniak <a href="#r20"><span>Reference Jemielniak</span>2014</a>). Experience helps in understanding the rules, norms, and processes of Wikipedia. This leads to greater success in content disputes and edit wars, as well as makes experienced editors able to drive disruptive “newcomers” away from Wikipedia and instill in newcomers’ certain understandings of how rules should be interpreted. Experience also raises the likelihood of becoming an administrator, thereby gaining the power to enforce the rules and sanction editors.<a href="#fn22"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>22</sup></a> Additionally, experience increases the likelihood of participation in general noticeboard discussions where sanctions of individual editors and specific rule interpretations are discussed in detail. Experienced editors also become aware of administrator elections and arbitration committee elections, which are important levers of power on Wikipedia.</p>
<p> Second, there is power in numbers. It is easier for PF members to fall afoul of the rules if they are frequently at a numerical disadvantage in editing disputes. It makes them less likely to win content disputes (which are often determined by numbers), forces them to spend more time to advance their views, and makes them more likely to have to edit war (make frequent reverts of AF editors). Whereas multiple AF editors can share the burden of doing reverts of PF’s edits and not violate any edit-warring restrictions, a PF editor may be forced to do multiple reverts, thus risking sanction.</p>
<p> Third, the gradual development of a sourcing hierarchy—whereby some sources were deemed reliable, and others were deemed unreliable—created advantages for AF editors. The culmination of a long, gradual conflict over the use of sources on Wikipedia was the 2017 vote to deprecate (ban) the <em>Daily Mail</em>, a British tabloid, from being used as a source for statements of fact. Over the next 4&nbsp;years, 38 additional sources were deprecated.</p>
<p> The gradual development of the sourcing hierarchy reflects how the Wikipedia community shifted its understanding of reliability over time, facilitated by the experience and numerical advantage of AF. An examination of pages in the early years of Wikipedia shows that Wikipedians had very lax standards for sourcing. By the mid-2000s, momentum had formed to privilege scientific publications. This did not mean that other sources were unusable, but that priority and prominence should be afforded to scientific publications. During these early years, Wikipedians did not appear to distinguish between news sources in terms of reliability in any clear manner. Articles into the 2010s show considerable usage of sources that would ultimately by the mid-2010s be deemed unreliable, including sources that were deprecated from 2017 onward.<a href="#fn24"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>24</sup></a> Discussions about these sources in the previous years had not concluded with support to prohibit them, demonstrating a change in how the community looked at them. The key difference is that the ranks of PF editors who blocked previous attempts to ban sources had been thinned out considerably by 2017.</p>
<p> This hierarchy of sources has implications both for what kind of content can be added to Wikipedia and how it will be phrased. For example, if the <em>New York Times</em> (a source that Wikipedia editors came to recognize as highly reliable) describes something as a conspiracy theory, whereas the <em>New York Post</em> (a source that Wikipedia editors have determined to be unreliable) differs from that description, then Wikipedia content can be added that firmly states in Wikipedia’s voice that something is a conspiracy theory. Under a previous collective understanding of Wikipedia’s rules, Wikipedia’s content would not give a firm statement in Wikipedia’s voice but would rather attribute particular claims to the <em>Times</em> and attribute rebuttal claims to the <em>Post.</em> Thus, over time, Wikipedia has accepted the use of contested labels and taken sides on contested subjects, ultimately producing a type of content that is distinctly anti-pseudoscience and anti-conspiracy theories, and which has the perception of a liberal bent in U.S. politics.</p>
<p> Each shift in policy further weakened the position of PF in editing disputes and made the editing experience less rewarding for those editors because they ended up on the losing end of content disputes. Over time, PF editors responded in three ways<a href="#fn25"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>25</sup></a>:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>1.</span>
<strong>Fight back:</strong> By increasingly editing against consensus and in violation of new interpretations of Wikipedia policy. These editors were subsequently banned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>2.</span>
<strong>Withdraw:</strong> By leaving Wikipedia or reducing their contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>3.</span>
<strong>Acquiesce:</strong> By gradually adapting to the new interpretations of Wikipedia policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> Article-by-article evidence substantiates these patterns, with prominent PF editors getting banned, retiring, or adjusting to new interpretations of Wikipedia guidelines.<a href="#fn26"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>26</sup></a> In explaining their departure on their talk page, retired PF editors frequently decried what they perceived as Wikipedia’s increased bias, hostile editing environment, and the pointlessness of fighting against what they described as a cabal.<a href="#fn27"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>27</sup></a> This stands in contrast to the explanations offered by non-PF members for retiring. Some PF editors proved more flexible to Wikipedia’s changing environment, acquiescing to new interpretations of Wikipedia policy. For example, a PF editor might affirm the new standards in Wikipedia’s sourcing policy by insisting that content from a source like the <em>New York Times</em> should be stated in Wikipedia’s own voice when a <em>Times</em> story criticizes a left-leaning politician or left-leaning cause. However, in doing so, those PF editors help enshrine the emerging new interpretations of Wikipedia guidelines.</p>
<p> In addition to article-by-article evidence of departures of Wikipedia editors, the paper uses a sample of hotly contested referenda (where editors are asked to express their views about the NPOV rule’s application to fringe topics) to gage whether the disappearance of PF editors (measured by their support or opposition for a fringe position) is systemic across the encyclopedia. This is a unique and useful data source that shows that the relative disappearance of PF editors is systemic.</p>
<p> The raw numbers undersell the importance of those who have departed the encyclopedia. Many of the departees were highly prolific experienced editors from PF, whereas many of the editors who sided with AF and disappeared over time were not highly prolific editors in the first place. These disproportionate exits meant that over time, understandings in line with AF’s interpretation of Wikipedia policy become taken for granted as the way the rules should be interpreted, causing gradual institutional changes that amount to a drastic institutional change over a nearly 20-year period.</p>

<h2> ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS</h2>
<p> This paper has sought to explain why content on the English Wikipedia transformed drastically over time. The explanation hinges on endogenous factors related to early victories, feedback effects, and population loss. In this section, the paper examines two key alternative explanations, finding that they are inapplicable and generally inconsistent with the data (three additional alternative explanations are addressed in the Supplementary Material).<a href="#fn28"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>28</sup></a></p>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec14" id="sec14">
<h3> External Events and Processes</h3>
<p> One alternative hypothesis is that external events caused ideational change among Wikipedians. For example, Donald Trump’s 2016 election, the 2016 Brexit referendum, and the emergence of “fake news” websites may have caused Wikipedians to re-evaluate how they understand the rules of Wikipedia and the role of Wikipedia in society. However, as the paper documented, the transformation on Wikipedia has been gradual over time, preceding prominent shocks from 2016. Furthermore, the emergence of “fake news” websites does not fit neatly with Wikipedians’ decision to deprecate long-standing traditional news sources, such as the <em>Daily Mail.</em> The events of 2015 and 2016 did not bring source reliability to the fore in a new way on Wikipedia. Rather, Wikipedians had intensely debated the reliability of sources for nearly a decade prior. It took Wikipedians until 2017 to start deprecating sources because the editors that previously vetoed such attempts were no longer active on the encyclopedia.<a href="#fn29"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p> Another version of this hypothesis is that slow exogenous processes led Wikipedians to re-evaluate their own attitudes toward the guidelines. For example, Wikipedians may have increasingly come to hold more pro-LGBT views, stronger anti-racism views, and pro-science attitudes. While attitudinal change can certainly be documented among certain Wikipedians, they have remained very stable among many of those belonging to AF and PF, as they vote consistently for and against certain items in predictable ways over long time periods. If a disproportionate number of PF editors had not disappeared over time, they would have been able to block drastic changes.</p>
<p> A third version of this hypothesis is that the sources that Wikipedia relies on for content changed how they cover pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and extremism. In other words, the news media and the scientific community changed, not Wikipedia. While it is true that Wikipedia is necessarily a reflection of what sources say, it is not correct that news sources and studies have uniformly moved in the same direction on all the subject matters listed in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> and the Supplementary Material. Even on subject matters where coverage has changed, such as climate change, climate change denial sources have changed tactics in how they argue against climate change. Rather than deny that any warming has occurred, they dispute the precise role of human activity, emphasize how “alarmist” mainstream climate scientists are, and highlight events that purportedly contradict the scientific consensus. Rather than reflect these updates to climate change denialism in mainstream sources, Wikipedians have simply excluded or debunked climate change denial rhetoric in articles. Furthermore, the particular sources that continued to promote pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and extremism were over time ultimately deemed unreliable on Wikipedia.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec15" id="sec15">
<h3> Influx of New Editors</h3>
<p> Anyone can create a Wikipedia account and edit. It is therefore reasonable to query whether Wikipedia experienced an influx of new editors with new ideas, thus causing the transformation over time. This would mean that the old guard of Wikipedia editors were simply replaced or outmaneuvered by a new breed of editors. There are several reasons why this is unlikely to have caused the transformation. Wikipedia has a very rigid and complex structure of rules and norms. New editors that edit in ways that older editors disapprove of often find themselves in trouble. As highlighted above, experience is a source of power of Wikipedia that makes it easier for the old guard to shape the encyclopedia, both by sanctioning disruptive newcomers and by indoctrinating newcomers into a “correct” way of editing. Newcomers, therefore, find themselves forced to assimilate or be booted off the platform. It is also unlikely that the later generation of Wikipedia editors tended to be more likely to be experts and predisposed to mainstream science than the first movers on Wikipedia. Judging by self-described descriptions of themselves, many of the earliest Wikipedians were scientists or had advanced degrees, in particular among editors on pages related to pseudoscience.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec16" id="sec16">
<h2> CONCLUSION</h2>
<p> Since its inception in 2001, Wikipedia has transformed from an encyclopedia that adopted a strict “teach the controversy” approach (whereby a diversity of opinions and sources were reflected in articles) to one where Wikipedia takes firm sides on contested subjects. Whereas Wikipedia used to normalize and lend credence to pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and fringe rhetoric, it has over time become firmly anti-pseudoscience and anti-conspiracy theories.</p>
<p> This transformation occurred through endogenous processes that were ultimately rooted in rule ambiguity, early dispute outcomes, and population loss. The resolution of early disputes in several areas of the encyclopedia demobilized certain types of editors (while mobilizing others) and strengthened certain understandings of Wikipedia’s ambiguous rules (while weakening other understandings of Wikipedia rules). Change occurred endogenously and gradually, as shared meanings from within Wikipedia’s collective about the rules got altered through a combination of compulsory power (sanctioning of dissenters by elite actors) and productive power (collective delegitimization of certain rule interpretations).</p>
<p> This explanation for institutional change on Wikipedia can plausibly help to explain institutional change in other contexts. We might observe in other institutions that institutional change happens as losers become demotivated and sanctioned, and winners become motivated and rewarded. For example, career bureaucrats might leave public service when the bureaucracy shifts toward policies that they disagree with. The bureaucrats could stay in the bureaucracy and make it harder for opponents to transform the bureaucracy, but they might instead leave the bureaucracy because they find it demotivating to fight uphill against other bureaucrats. Rather than obstruct change, the population loss of dissident bureaucrats can propel change.</p>
<p> Within political movements and parties, we can also see how establishment figures who are out of step with newly dominant ideas choose voluntarily to retire rather than obstruct change within the movement. This can plausibly be seen in the Republican Party, as Trump critics have opted to retire rather than use their position to steer the movement in a direction that they find more palatable. Similarly, victories for one side within a movement may energize winners and encourage like-minded actors to jump on the bandwagon in support of that side. This may help to explain how the Tea Party cemented its control of the Republican Party (Blum <a href="#r5"><span>Reference Blum</span>2020</a>). It may also help to explain how the conservative legal movement gradually accepted the legal theory behind the unconstitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was considered fringe and weak in 2010, but grew in support as conservative justices in lower courts ruled the ACA unconstitutional, ultimately almost leading the Supreme Court to rule that the ACA was unconstitutional in 2012 (a narrow 5-4 decision upheld the law while hobbling aspects of it). It may also explain why certain police department cultures form, as some police are driven out of the organization, while others get boosted. It has also been posited that the stability and strength of illiberal regimes within the European Union have gradually been strengthened as dissatisfied citizens migrate from authoritarian states to liberal states (Kelemen <a href="#r22"><span>Reference Kelemen</span>2020</a>). However, more research is needed to assess the generalizability of this endogenous mechanism for institutional change.</p>

Join us on this historical tour and we'll show you.</p></div><p>Let's travel to Barcelona's old town: the Ciutat Vella district. These narrow streets were enclosed by a wall 🏰 until 1854.</p><div id="step" data-step="9"><p>The population density was high. It was believed that diseases🦠 were spread in the form of poisonous air through miasmas. This is how cholera was depicted in the 19th century 👇</p><p><img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/colera-imagen.jfif" width="100%"></p></div><p>Ildefons Cerdà wanted to demonstrate that the high population density was deadly. With his design of the Eixample, influenced by the hygienist movement, his proposed planning for the city lowered population density and regenerated the air.</p><p>Cerdà thought of open blocks with interior gardens🌳. Speculation truncated his plan. In the end, some areas of the Eixample became denser than the Ciutat Vella.</p><p>Today, Barcelona is one of the tallest and densest cities in the country. So are the municipalities on its periphery, such as L'Hospitalet or Santa Coloma, which grew from the 1950s onwards, as a result of the rural exodus👨🌾.</p><div id="step" data-step="13"><p>Data from the Spanish Cadastre (not includign Euskadi and Navarra) shows this relationship in most Spanish cities. <span>The taller</span> the constructions in the cities are, the higher its population density. In addition to the Barcelona metropolitan area, other urban areas such as Cádiz and Valencia are among the densest and tallest so far.</p><div id="contenedor-circulos-altura-municipios"><p>Comparison between population density and average height of cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants<img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/dedo.png" alt="scroll"></p><p>Source: Spanish Cadastre, INE (Spanish Statistical Office)</p></div></div><p>Between 1950 and 1975, thousands of Spaniards migrated from the countryside🚜to the city🌆. Franco's dictatorship Ministry of Housing promoted the construction of high-rise housing estates to accommodate them.</p><p>This is the "Antonio Rueda" housing group, consisting of 1,002 low-income social housing units. This type of development was influenced by the modern movement.</p><div id="step" data-step="16"><p>During the 60's and 70's more dwellings were built in Spain, and these were higher than ever. Thus, the first 'metropolitan crowns' were created, surrounding the historic nuclei and the 'ensanches' (widenings) of the beginning of the century. 👇</p><p>Buildings with 5 or more stories per decade</p><div><p><img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/grafico-evolucion-mas5plantas.svg" width="100%"></p><p>Source: Spanish Cadastre</p></div></div><div id="step" data-step="17"><p>Housing blocks built under Francoist developmentalism started with four stories because there was no money for elevators. Then came the H-shaped blocks, which incorporated an elevator and more stories so as to make it profitable. The distribution of dwellings in each city according to the number of floors in the building shows this phenomenon.</p><p>For example, most of the industrial belts within large cities concentrate their housing in 5-story buildings. Also developed in the 1970s, other industrial estates such as Fuenlabrada, Alcorcón and L'Hospitalet condense most of their housing in buildings with seven, eight or more floors.</p><div id="contenedor-alturas-grupos-viviendas"><p>Distribution of dwellings in each municipality according to the number of floors of the building<img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/dedo.png" alt="scroll"></p><p>Source: Spanish Cadastre</p></div></div><p>An example of these H-shaped polygon developments is in Móstoles, on the outskirts of Madrid.</p><p>From the 1980s onwards, the rural exodus slowed down. At the same time, the 'urban sprawl'🏡, inspired by American suburbs, arrived in Spain.</p><p>Municipalities such as Sant Cugat del Vallès (Barcelona), Godella (Valencia) or Pozuelo (Madrid) are good examples of urban sprawl.</p><p>The housing is single-family🏠. The population density is very low, which increases the cost of public services.</p><p>But such real estate is a luxury and does not reach many people. Urban sprawl would continue in the form of townhouses🏘️, especially during the 1990s, and housing blocks.</p><p>In Santa Marta de Tormes, in the metropolitan area of Salamanca, there are several developments of townhouses, also called 'pearl necklaces'.</p><div id="step" data-step="24"><p>This change is clearly shown in the evolution of housing built in each decade in Spain. While buildings of five or more floors were in the majority during the first development boom in the 1960s and 1970s, during the real-estate bubble mainly low-rise dwellings were built.</p><div id="contenedor-alturas-evolucion-decadas"><p>Evolution of the number of dwellings built in each decade, according to the number of floors of the building<img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/dedo.png" alt="scroll"></p><p>Source: Spanish Cadastre</p></div></div><p>Parallel to the townhouse fever, and after the polygons and H-blocks, came the next generation of housing blocks: the perimeter block, which would predominate from the 1990s until the bursting of the real-estate bubble and after the recovery.</p><p>Parque Venecia, a neighborhood in Zaragoza, is a prime example of a new neighborhood with perimeter blocks. It was planned in the middle of the bubble and its urbanization began in 2008. Its 7,000 residents, young families with children, <span><a href="https://www.heraldo.es/noticias/aragon/zaragoza/2021/06/27/parque-venecia-cumple-diez-anos-con-el-80-de-los-pisos-ejecutados-y-a-la-espera-de-mas-servicios-en-zaragoza-1502452.html" target="_blank">have denounced the lack of public services. </a></span>.</p><p>These new 'ensanches' offer more affordable housing than the consolidated city and attract the middle classes. They tend to be sparse and disconnected from the city.</p><div id="step" data-step="28"><p>City centers rised in value before the outbreak of COVID-19. After the pandemic, the demand for single-family homes and apartments in the metropolitan areas has increased.</p><p>Evolution of the percentage (%) of single-family home sales and purchases</p><div><p><img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/grafico-evolucion-unifamiliares.svg" width="100%"></p><p>Source: Bank of Spain</p></div></div><p>But contemporary urban planning trends point in another direction: compact, complex and cohesive cities.</p><p>What is the appropriate height for a city? And what is the appropiate density? Where is Spanish urban planning heading and where should it be heading?</p></article></div>]]></description>

    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Importance:
        </strong>
      
      Time-restricted eating (TRE) has become increasingly popular, yet longer-term randomized clinical trials have not evaluated its efficacy and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Objective:
        </strong>
      
      To determine whether TRE is more effective for weight reduction and glycemic control than daily calorie restriction (CR) or a control condition in adults with T2D.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Design, setting, and participants:
        </strong>
      
      This 6-month, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial was performed between January 25, 2022, and April 1, 2023, at the University of Illinois Chicago. Participants were aged 18 to 80 years with obesity and T2D. Data analysis was based on intention to treat.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Interventions:
        </strong>
      
      Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 8-hour TRE (eating 12 to 8 pm only, without calorie counting), CR (25% energy restriction daily), or control.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Main outcomes and measures:
        </strong>
      
      The primary outcome measure was change in body weight by month 6. Secondary outcomes included changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and metabolic risk factors.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Results:
        </strong>
      
      Seventy-five participants were enrolled with a mean (SD) age of 55 (12) years. The mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 39 (7) and the mean (SD) HbA1c level was 8.1% (1.6%). A total of 53 participants (71%) were women. One participant (1%) was Asian, 30 (40%) were Hispanic White, 40 (53%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 4 (5%) were non-Hispanic White. Participants in the TRE group were adherent with their eating window on a mean (SD) of 6.1 (0.8) days per week, and 17 (68%) in the CR group were adherent with their prescribed calorie goals over 6 months. The mean (SD) reduction in energy intake was -313 (509) kcal/d for TRE, -197 (426) kcal/d for CR, and -16 (439) kcal/d for controls. By month 6, body weight decreased significantly in the TRE group (-3.56% [95% CI, -5.92% to -1.20%]; P = .004) but not the CR group (-1.78% [95% CI, -3.67% to 0.11%]; P = .06), relative to controls. Levels of HbA1c decreased in the TRE (-0.91% [95% CI, -1.61% to -0.20%]) and CR (-0.94% [95% CI, -1.59% to -0.30%]) groups, relative to controls, with no differences between the TRE and CR groups. Time in euglycemic range, medication effect score, blood pressure, and plasma lipid levels did not differ among groups. No serious adverse events were reported.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Conclusions and relevance:
        </strong>
      
      This randomized clinical trial found that a TRE diet strategy without calorie counting was effective for weight loss and lowering of HbA1c levels compared with daily calorie counting in a sample of adults with T2D. These findings will need to be confirmed by larger RCTs with longer follow-up.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-banning-end-to-end-encryption-is-stupid" dir="auto"><a href="#banning-end-to-end-encryption-is-stupid">Banning End-to-End Encryption is Stupid</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Various lawmakers in different countries are proposing to require messaging services to provide a mechanism for law enforcement to decrypt end-to-end encrypted messages.
This kind of legislation fundamentally misunderstands how easy it is for bad people to build their own end-to-end encryption layers on top of other messaging systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">Requiring Signal, WhatsApp, and so on to introduce vulnerabilities into their products does not make life much harder for criminals.
Criminals can easily build or buy an extra layer of encryption on top and exchange messages that can't be decrypted.</p>
<p dir="auto">It does make everyone else less safe.
If a backdoor exists and is usable by authorised people, it will eventually be exploited and used by malicious people.</p>
<p dir="auto">This repository contains a trivial demonstration of this.
It builds a simple tool that allows sending end-to-end encrypted messages over any messaging service, including plain old SMS (though message-length limits may cause problems there).
It is 186 lines of code (and depends on a load of off-the-shelf open-source libraries) and took about an hour to write.</p>
<p dir="auto">Imagine that Alice wants to send a message to Bob, as she often does in cryptography texts.
She needs a secret passphrase, which will be used to derive some keys:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cat pass 
Alice has a totally secret passphrase."><pre><code>$ cat pass 
Alice has a totally secret passphrase.
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is the only thing that we need to keep secret to be able to build end-to-end encrypted messaging.
Don't worry about how it's used, just remember that this is some secret that no one should be able to guess.</p>
<p dir="auto">She then runs the following command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ banning-e2ee-is-stupid -k pass -u bob"><pre><code>$ banning-e2ee-is-stupid -k pass -u bob
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The program notices that this is the first time that Alice has sent a message to Bob and so asks for his public key and asks Alice to send Bob her public key.
These are written out as a set of English words:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="You have not exchanged keys with this user.  You must send them your public key:
celan fiona tasmanian bloomer terminological elca glamis fenceposts troilus ramapo premeditation meth chairpersons addictiveness bergman beauregard 
Please enter their key:"><pre><code>You have not exchanged keys with this user.  You must send them your public key:
celan fiona tasmanian bloomer terminological elca glamis fenceposts troilus ramapo premeditation meth chairpersons addictiveness bergman beauregard 
Please enter their key:
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">At the same time, Bob is preparing to receive his first message from Alice and so ensures that he has a completely unguessable key phrase and runs the tool to decrypt a message:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cat pass 
Bob also has a completely unguessable passphrase
$ ../banning-e2ee-is-stupid -k pass -u alice -d
You have not exchanged keys with this user.  You must send them your public key:
luxuriantly hensel soper chinny kilts esai downpours dissimulation adroitly widmann striven breastbone clonmel forecastle abascal barstools 
Please enter their key:"><pre><code>$ cat pass 
Bob also has a completely unguessable passphrase
$ ../banning-e2ee-is-stupid -k pass -u alice -d
You have not exchanged keys with this user.  You must send them your public key:
luxuriantly hensel soper chinny kilts esai downpours dissimulation adroitly widmann striven breastbone clonmel forecastle abascal barstools 
Please enter their key:
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alice and Bob must now send each other their public keys.
The easiest way to do this is to send it as a text message or email and then have a phone call where they read it out.
This isn't secret: it doesn't matter if someone else reads the key (you can put it on your website, Facebook profile, whatever), only if they are able to tamper with it.</p>
<p dir="auto">This key-exchange process is handled by apps like Signal automatically.
Doing it well is the hard part of building an end-to-end encrypted messaging app.
Once Alice and Bob have both pasted each others' public key, they can start exchanging messages.
They won't be asked for keys again.
Alice now sees something like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Please enter the message to encrypt:
Hi Bob!

Send the following message to the other person:
anomaly forceful amongst ralphie gia ponds scandalous movies ungracious candidate absolution honan lima lambent cutaways embroider locos computers disqualify boehm naik brimming schrieber glebe "><pre><code>Please enter the message to encrypt:
Hi Bob!

Send the following message to the other person:
anomaly forceful amongst ralphie gia ponds scandalous movies ungracious candidate absolution honan lima lambent cutaways embroider locos computers disqualify boehm naik brimming schrieber glebe 
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This message is now encrypted in such a way that Bob (and only Bob) can decrypt it.
Alice can now send this message in email, or in her favourite messaging program.
She can even paste it into something public like a GitHub Gist or a Pastebin.
No one else can decrypt it and Bob can detect if it's tampered with.
In fact, Alice can paste a load of random messages in different places and Bob can try decrypting them all to find the one that's intended for him.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bob just needs to paste the message from Alice into the program:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Please enter the message to decrypt:
anomaly forceful amongst ralphie gia ponds scandalous movies ungracious candidate absolution honan lima lambent cutaways embroider locos computers disqualify boehm naik brimming schrieber glebe

Decrypted message:
Hi Bob! "><pre><code>Please enter the message to decrypt:
anomaly forceful amongst ralphie gia ponds scandalous movies ungracious candidate absolution honan lima lambent cutaways embroider locos computers disqualify boehm naik brimming schrieber glebe

Decrypted message:
Hi Bob! 
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will report 'Decryption failed' if the message has been tampered with, was not from Alice, or was not intended for Bob (these three conditions are indistinguishable).</p>
<p dir="auto">With this simple program (remember, about an hour's quick coding), it is possible for Alice and Bob to exchange messages over any insecure channel.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is intended as a toy demonstration of how simple it is to build encrypted messaging over an unencrypted messaging service.
Over a decade ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextSecure" rel="nofollow">TextSecure</a> built a product that did this (using much more clever crypto!) that gave a polished user interface.
Even before this, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-record_messaging" rel="nofollow">OTR</a> provided plugins for third-party clients for various unencrypted IM networks that allowed end-to-end encryption (again, with stronger security properties than this demo).
These were polished clients that provided secure end-to-end encrypted messaging used an existing messaging network as an insecure transport.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-frequently-asked-questions" dir="auto"><a href="#frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><em>How do I build this thing?</em></p>
<p dir="auto">You probably shouldn't (see disclaimers below).
If you really want to, run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -G Ninja
$ ninja"><pre><code>$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -G Ninja
$ ninja
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will give you a program called <code>banning-e2ee-is-stupid</code>.
This will store public keys in a database in the directory that you run it from.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Isn't this too complex for end users to use?  It requires using a command line and stuff.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">I wrote this in about an hour, much of which was spent learning how to use libraries.
It is absolutely not a polished end-user product.
Something with a half decent UI, better key storage, and so on, would probably be a whole afternoon's effort.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>What happens if someone intercepts the key-exchange messages?</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Nothing bad.
Each message is encrypted using both the sender's secret key and the receiver's public key.
Decrypting it requires the sender's public key and the receiver's secret key.

<p dir="auto">They get your messages.
Sorry.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Isn't it easy to spot messages like "aggarwal ashwell kalter stephenville compounders carleton somatic bks sanada airspaces brees lamb's fossilization wadsworth composit downey's arkansans advanta diffferent hewlitt henne rowed airlifts corba fortune's"?</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Yes.
This doesn't apply any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography" rel="nofollow">Steganography</a> to the output and so traffic analysis (including scanning in the client device) would probably find it easily.
That said, if your heuristic is 'words used in strange ways' then you will get false positives from all teenagers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Where do all of these words come from?</em></p>
<p dir="auto">The encrypted message is pile of binary data.
A lot of messaging apps will be unhappy if you try to send raw binary data and break it in annoying ways.
This program uses one of <a href="https://www.keithv.com/software/wlist/" rel="nofollow">Keith Vertanen's big word lists</a>, truncated to 2^16 entries.
This means that for every two bytes of binary data, we have one word.
The words are all in the top 84K most commonly used English words and so totally indistinguishable from the kind of piffle that might be generated by the kind of politician that thinks banning encryption is remotely feasible.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>What does this use?</em></p>
<p dir="auto">This uses libsodium for all of the cryptography.
The passhprase hashed using Argon2id, which is intended to be slow (this is where the startup pause comes from) for a brute force attacker.
The encryption uses libsodium's crypto box construction, which uses X25519, XSalsa20, and Poly1305.
If you know what these are, you understand enough about cryptography to not need to read this page.
If you do not know what these are, you should not be voting on legislation about cryptography without talking to an expert.</p>

<p dir="auto">This code is intended to show that it's easy to write something that does end-to-end encryption without the cooperation of the underlying messaging service.
As such, it is intentionally brief.
It does not follow best practices for encryption, in a number of ways:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It does not try to make the pass phrase storage secure.
Good code would use the operating system's key storage APIs.</li>
<li>It does not provide a mechanism for rolling over keys.
A good system would periodically re-key to handle cases where the key is leaked.</li>
<li>It does not provide forward security.
If your key is leaked, an attacker can impersonate you and can read all messages that you've received.</li>
<li>It does not protect keys in memory.
Keys may show up in core dumps, swap, and so on.</li>
<li>No one has reviewed the use of crypto.
I am not a cryptographer, I probably did something stupid.</li>
<li>It uses random dependencies.
The SQLite and libsodium wrappers were chosen because they were the first results in a DuckDuckGo search.
This is not how you do supply-chain security.</li>

				<h3>
					Coding opens up a wealth of possibilities for exploring<br>new kinds of musical structures and ideas<br>
				</h3>
				<p>
					OMN is designed as a scripting language for musical events. It’s not about sounds themselves, it is about their control and organisation in a musical composition. As a linear script rather than a graphic stave, musical events can be transformed, extended, reorganised by powerful computer algorithms. Some sequencers and score writers provide basic algorithms, but they do not represent the way composers now think about the process of music composition. Composing has become such a multi-faceted process and takes ideas about structure and content from many disciplines: mathematics, astronomy, literature, the visual arts. As such it requires extensive mental resources and experience from the composer. Much of this is still done by hand and eye and brain because although computer systems do exist to help the process along they don’t provide what has become known as the composing continuum.

					Microtonality
				</h2>
				<p>
					Microtonal music or microtonality is the use in music of microtones—intervals smaller than a semitone, also called "microintervals". It may also be extended to include any music using intervals not found in the customary Western tuning of twelve equal intervals per octave. In other words, a microtone may be thought of as a note that falls between the keys of a piano tuned in equal temperament.

					Micropolyphony

				<p>
					Micropolyphony is a polyphonic musical texture developed by György Ligeti which consists of many lines of dense canons moving at different tempos or rhythms, thus resulting in tone clusters vertically. According to David Cope, "micropolyphony resembles cluster chords, but differs in its use of moving rather than static lines"; it is "a simultaneity of different lines, rhythms, and timbres".<br>

					Making 2-D visualisations of musical parameters offer a new way of conceptualisation. Opusmodus graphical tools can plot pitch, rhythms, duration, dynamics and orchestration and there's a host of different display paradigms available. The composer can now view the interaction of multiple streams of parametric data, a perfect way to take in complex algorithmically-generated material. Composers often use such visualisations in the early stages of a project before precise pitches or rhythms are decided upon.<br>

					This is the first volume of a series of publications specifically dedicated to composition and analysis of music using the Opusmodus system. This volume focuses on the basic elements of the system and on the “fundamental" strategies in defining symbolic expressions in a text-code i.e. generation and transformation of musical material to create a score. In this book, a few pages were dedicated to the history of musical theory, with particular reference to the relationship between numbers and music in the second half of the 20th century. The purpose of the book is therefore to demonstrate that the use of Opusmodus system is simple, linear, easy to learn and within the reach of every musician, and is by no means part of a universe reserved only for the few.</p><p>ISBN 9791280270078</p></div><p><a href="https://diastemastudiericerche.org/product/marco-giommoni-janusz-podrazik-fundamentals-of-composition-with-opusmodus-book-1/" target="_blank">More Info</a>

<p>You can even find the <a href="https://www.tuvsud.com/de-de/dienstleistungen/produktpruefung-und-produktzertifizierung/zertifikatsdatenbank?q=Z10+123030+0001+Rev.+00" target="_blank">certificate in TÜV SÜDs certificate
database</a>.</p>

<p>This means we achieved qualification for the open source Ferrocene toolchain.
Ferrocene 23.06.0, based on Rust 1.68, is now fully usable in safety critical
environments.</p>

<p>Early last month, Ferrocene’s source code <a href="https://github.com/ferrocene/ferrocene">was open sourced on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>After going through a couple rounds of dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,
TÜV SÜD officially sent over the certification on Monday October 29. This is
the first qualification of a Rust compiler.</p>

<p>With these qualifications, Rust can now be used to develop software for
electronic systems in series production road vehicles. We’ve qualified
Ferrocene for use in systems up to ASIL D – the highest classification of
initial hazard as defined by this standard. This standard provides automakers
with guidelines that make the software being used to develop, produce, operate
and service the automotive sectors safe to use.</p>

<p>Beyond the automotive, Ferrocene can also be used in electronic programmable
systems in the industrial sector. Here the focus is on developing products or
applications that carry out safety functions. Like the automotive
certification, we’ve also gone for the highest level of risk reduction and
qualified it at SIL4.</p>

<p>“Ferrocene is a major achievement both for Rust and safety in automotive,” says
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/floriangilcher/" target="_blank">Florian</a>. “It shows that Rust software can
be used in all critical environments. The process was challenging but matched
what we’ve come to expect from Rust: It enables building correct software at a
much lower cost.”</p>

<p>With this step, we can start rolling out the sales process on Ferrocene.  Our
initial availability is limited to a minimum order of 10 license seats for 12
months, starting at €2.400,00 (€240 each) for the quality managed licenses.</p>

<p>We’ve also got an overview of the reasons for Ferrocene on our YouTube
channel:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i06djj0KvB8?si=1OK9W85yFUkLqEIh&amp;start=218" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>And if your organization is interested in purchasing licenses, then <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/contact#ferrocene">reach out
to us</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll be rolling out an individual purchase option at €25 per seat per month or
€240 per seat per year in early 2024.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>Last weekend I had a chance to talk with some students who just got their degree. They are pursuing their first software engineer job. In conversation with them, I learned that they have a pretty wrong perception of this job.</p><p>This is because the reality for these new kids is so skewed. They only see good pay, remote work, team building, and pizza parties. </p><p>These are all good perks, but no one is talking to them about the real things that we do in this job. </p><p>As someone who spent a lot of years in this industry, I gave them a slap of reality in the face. I told them good things but also some hard-to-swallow truths. </p><p>After reading this article, some people will say I am talking overly negatively about it. but my opinion is that these things go together with the job and you have to accept it.</p><h2 id="1-college-will-not-prepare-you-for-the-job">1) College will not prepare you for the job</h2><p>This is the first thing I explained to these guys. </p><p>To precisely describe how college will prepare you for the job imagine that you are learning how to swim. </p><p>Your instructor spends a huge amount of time to describe you all the moves you need to make. He makes you recite all those moves, asks you questions about it and you have exams about it. But you never touch the water.</p><p>After 5 years, you get a piece of paper that proves your swimming skills. Then the day comes, and you have to swim now. The guys in the swimming place just kick you into the water.</p><p>You have a hard time breathing, you fight for your life. Maybe you will drown, maybe you will manage to swim.</p><p>That's what the first 6 months look like for a freshly graduated student in a software engineer job.</p><p>The college will prepare you for some basics, but what most of the colleges teach is so far away from day-to-day jobs. Most of the professors who teach at universities are not good software engineers. </p><p>Only a small percentage of them even worked as software engineers. Also, the university curriculums are heavily outdated. They trot years behind the software development market needs.</p><p>You have to put in extra work while you are in college. Code more projects besides homework and seminars. Do some volunteering. Learn about business domains to prepare for the job that awaits you. </p><p>Most of the students don't do that. They wait until they get their diploma to start working on their portfolio.</p><h2 id="2-you-will-rarely-get-greenfield-projects">2) You will rarely get greenfield projects</h2><p>In college or boot camps, you get a lot of smaller assignments that you write from scratch. Total freedom to express yourself. You can implement all the fancy stuff you learn, like algorithms or design patterns. </p><p>The time you spend on those assignments is at most a few weeks, but mostly a couple of days of work. Typically those assignments contain at most 500 lines of code.</p><p>In day to day job you are working with projects that contain multiple layers and thousands of lines of code. Multiple people work at the same time on those projects. You have limited freedom, you have to adapt to the project. The time you spend on projects is usually half a year to a couple of years.</p><p>Sometimes you spend a whole week fixing the nasty bug. The fix is just a couple of lines of code. You talk with your colleagues. You exchange information about the project. You collaborate with them to get approval for your solution.</p><p>New projects are rare, and most of the time you work on existing projects. You can consider yourself lucky if you get the normal project and not some old legacy project.</p><figure><img src="https://www.mensurdurakovic.com/content/images/2023/10/image-2-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="768" height="6088" srcset="https://www.mensurdurakovic.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-2-1.png 600w, https://www.mensurdurakovic.com/content/images/2023/10/image-2-1.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="3-nobody-gives-a-f-about-your-clean-code">3) Nobody gives a f*** about your clean code</h2><p>You can forget that your boss will tell you: "Congratulations on writing this elegant and clean code, I am gonna give you a raise!". Quite the opposite, nobody cares about your clean code. </p><p>Don't get me wrong, people will expect you to write good and clean code. Still, you will rarely get any praise for it. Except sometimes from your colleagues who will review your code.</p><p>This may be a shock for some new folks, but it makes perfect sense. As a software engineer, your primary task is to generate value for users. Writing code is just a step that accomplishes that goal. </p><p>You can think of it as the following cycle:</p><ul><li>software engineer writes code</li><li>users get new features</li><li>more users use your products</li><li>company profits from products</li></ul><p>So code is just a tool to get profit. </p><p>I have seen so many graveyards of projects, with horrible legacy codebases. Still, these projects are successful as they have fancy landing pages and solve user's problems. So users are happy to pay for using them.</p><p>The user doesn't know how the codebase looks. The user just sees what features that product is offering. So don't get overly attached to your clean and elegant code. Focus on shipping the feature on time and bug-free.</p><h2 id="4-you-will-sometimes-work-with-incompetent-people">4) You will sometimes work with incompetent people</h2><p>People have prejudices that only smart and competent people work in the IT industry. Especially the software development branch. But this is far from the truth. </p><p>As in every job, you will sometimes have incompetent people in your environment. Working with them is very frustrating. They waste so much time and create a toxic environment. On top of that, they are extremely unproductive. All this reflects on deadlines and produces delays. This costs companies money and resources.</p><p>Unfortunately, I also had experience working with those kinds of people. I have to say, they tested my nerves so well that I spent a good amount of time thinking of ways to get around their incompetence.  </p><p>Here are some advice:</p><ul><li>try to be efficient and productive as much as you can, focus on yourself and not on them</li><li>try other options/solutions that don't involve that person in the process</li><li>document everything you do. If things go wrong, you will have proof of their incompetence</li><li>if you have a blocker because that person didn't do their job, try to ask someone else to unblock you  (if it's possible)</li><li>talk directly to them, be professional but not mean, and tell them what and how they can improve</li></ul><p>Remember that there is no need to be a jerk to them. </p><p>Sometimes you don't know the whole story. I have seen some cases where a person just can't do their job properly. They are burdened with tons of tasks and doing work for 2 people.</p><h2 id="5-get-used-to-being-in-meetings-for-hours">5) Get used to being in meetings for hours </h2><p>Meetings are an important part of the software development job. Some of them are good, but some of them are just time wasters. </p><p>There are recurring meetings scheduled on a daily or weekly basis. Most of these are not productive. The majority of them are forced by a person who is organizing them because that's the only "work" that that person is doing. </p><p>It's just an empty protocol to prove their purpose of existence in the company.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDpKWVuBNQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="Meeting | MonkeyUser 5SP Animation"></iframe></figure><p>On the other hand, there are productive meetings. Those meetings ensure information exchange between team members or different teams. </p><p>The majority of software engineers hate meetings. But remember that your job is also to communicate about things openly and proactively. </p><p>Sharing information is crucial for projects to move forward. When you share information it can help other teams to better understand what you are doing and the opposite. </p><h2 id="6-they-will-ask-you-for-estimates-a-lot-of-times">6) They will ask you for estimates a lot of times</h2><p>Business revolves around numbers. Every project has its cost, and to calculate the cost, management needs to estimate how long it will take to build a certain feature.</p><p>Then, it goes down to software engineers to estimate their work. Usually, estimates are time-based, but sometimes they also ask for complexity estimates. </p><p>In a lot of situations, you will have no clue how long it will take to build something. You read requirements, do some research and you give a number. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mensurdurakovic.com/content/images/2023/10/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="987" srcset="https://www.mensurdurakovic.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-6.png 600w, https://www.mensurdurakovic.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image-6.png 1000w, https://www.mensurdurakovic.com/content/images/2023/10/image-6.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Later, when you start to work on that feature, you encounter many problems that you weren't aware of when you gave time estimates. Then you need to compensate for the wasted and hope not to break the deadline.</p><p>That's why it's always good to underpromise but overdeliver. </p><p>For example, when your project manager asks you to implement feature X by Friday, you won't say "Oh, I can finish it by Tuesday". Instead, you will say: "Sure, no problem". </p><p>Why?</p><p>Because if you promise to deliver it by Tuesday and you run into some problems, you won't be able to fulfill the promise. Instead, if you accept Friday as a deadline, and you finish it by Wednesday, you can deliver it 2 days earlier. </p><p>There are a lot of formulas on how to do estimates, and everyone has their own rules. I also have my own rules. </p><p>If I need to deliver some feature, and I think it will take 2 days, I add roughly 40% more time to it, just to be safe. So, in this case, the estimate will be 3 days. Later, if I am done in 2 days, I can just deliver it earlier.</p><h2 id="7-bugs-will-be-your-arch-enemy-for-life">7) Bugs will be your arch-enemy for life</h2><p>The more you code, the more you are aware that bugs in the code are everywhere. When you are just starting with programming, you think you will code something, it will work fine and it's the end of the story.</p><p>But in reality, it's a different story. There are countless things that can produce bugs:</p><ul><li>your own code - humans make mistakes, and you should not trust that code is working perfectly. You can write tests, but bugs can occur after that due to various reasons that you aren't even aware of.</li><li>3rd party libraries - those libraries are also written by software engineers like you and me. Always watch for activity and how frequently those libraries are updated.</li><li>hardware failure - software relies on hardware. Mark Hanna explained what your software is without hardware in his quote: "It's fugayzi, fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust. It doesn't exist. It's never landed. It is no matter. It's not on the elemental chart. It's not f***ing real."</li></ul><figure><img src="https://media.tenor.com/Zbfjs-GE8p0AAAAC/rookie-numbers.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="498" height="289"></figure><ul><li>electricity - yep, hardware needs electric power to run, without it, it's useless. I worked on one project with Raspberry Pi. The client had constant problems with the device turning off at random times. After days of investigation, we finally found out the issue. He used a different power supply than the original one provided. Because of that device was turning off at random times.</li></ul><p>So the truth is you should assume that everything has bugs. That's why experienced devs never trust their code if it runs successfully on the first try. Even if the QA engineer reports a bug, assume that the bug ticket has a "bug" and check for everything.</p><h2 id="8-uncertainty-will-be-your-toxic-friend">8) Uncertainty will be your toxic friend</h2><p>In this job, you will feel uncertainty almost all the time. </p><p>I already explained the estimates example above. That's just one example where you feel uncertainty. You give your best shot but you are not 100% sure you can finish the work in that estimate.</p><p>Besides that, there are countless other things that are uncertain. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>implementing something in your project you never worked with, eg. 3rd party API - how are you going to implement something you aren't familiar with</li><li>transfer to a new project, with new technologies - you will think about how you are going to be efficient and productive with something you need to learn</li><li>move to a new company - you are unsure how you are going to settle in and vibe with new people</li><li>bug report on the day you need to finish the work - you fear that you are gonna break the deadline</li><li>job security - economic situations, pandemics, wars, and other factors heavily affect this industry which results in layoffs</li><li>the evolution of technology - you are never sure if tomorrow you are gonna be replaced by some new technologies like AI</li></ul><p>The good thing about uncertainty is that drives you to be a better software engineer. It demands improvements and learning if you want to stay in the game.</p><h2 id="9-it-will-be-almost-impossible-to-disconnect-from-your-job">9) It will be almost impossible to disconnect from your job</h2><p>From time to time, I catch myself thinking about my job, problems, and bugs. Or things I have to do tomorrow when I should relax and chill. </p><p>Sometimes, cold water in the shower wakes me up from my thinking about how I am gonna fix the nasty bug I worked on yesterday. I had countless squabbles with my girlfriend about why I am on Slack when we are on the beach. </p><p>So I publicly admit, that I have a hard time disconnecting from work. </p><p>It's especially hard to disconnect when you are working from home. If your laptop is on, you can always check emails or Slack messages.</p><p>So to avoid all this:</p><ul><li>I turn off my laptop after I am done with the work,</li><li>I put quiet hours on my mobile phone for my business emails</li><li>I pause Slack notifications after working hours. I disable them on weekends.</li><li>When my mind gets into this "think about work" loop, I try to immediately cut it out. I remind myself that rest and relaxation are important to be productive. </li><li>I take long walks after work. On some days I do sports like padel or football. </li><li>I try to engage socially as much as I can, avoiding screen time after work.</li></ul><p>Still, with all these steps I do every day, I fail a lot of times.</p><h2 id="10-you-will-profit-more-from-good-soft-skills-than-from-good-technical-skills">10) You will profit more from good soft skills than from good technical skills</h2><p>Technical skills are the ones you can learn easily. With different projects, you can understand a particular programming language. You can learn its syntax, pros and cons. It's just a matter of practice.</p><p>On the other hand, soft skills are much harder to improve. Improvement takes a lot of mental strength. You must do things you are not comfortable with. </p><p>You have to put yourself in situations where you can improve or practice particular soft skills.</p><p>For example, communication is one soft skill that people always talk about. Let's say you suck at public speaking. You have to force yourself into situations where you can practice some public speaking.</p><p>It's very hard to intentionally put yourself into situations where you know you will suck at. Your mind will do everything to avoid those situations. It will bring hundreds of excuses and it's easy to give up.</p><p>Besides communication, there are other <a href="https://www.mensurdurakovic.com/boost-your-career-with-top-ten-soft-skills/" rel="noreferrer">soft skills</a>:</p><ul><li>teamwork</li><li>learning mindset</li><li>organization/time management</li><li>emotional intelligence/empathy</li><li>approachability</li><li>persistence/patience</li><li>confidence</li></ul><p>I have met a lot of folks who are good with technical skills but awful to work with.</p><p>For example, one colleague would ask me for help a lot of times. I helped him a couple of times. Then, I noticed after we fixed his problems, he would come back to me and blame me for messing up other things on the project. Then I had to spend more time with him fixing stuff I wasn't even aware of. And because he was blaming me with such a bad tone, I stopped helping him. I would say that I have a lot on my plate to do, so I can help him tomorrow. </p><p>Another example, I was the new guy on the project. A colleague (let's call him George) was assigned to help me with anything I needed. I set up the project pretty much by myself, but there was one error I was getting when I tried to run the project. I asked George for help. He spent maybe 2 minutes with me in total to solve a problem and said that he didn't know the solution. I thanked him anyway, tried to solve the error on my own but finally succeded with the help of colleague Michael. On daily standup, George said that he spent his whole day supporting me. I never asked George for help, after that. </p><p>One more example, there was one colleague who was the main man on the project. Still, the whole team hated him (other devs, project managers, QA, designers, etc). He was a good software engineer, but a real jerk. Extremely rude in communication with everyone. He never wanted to admit he was wrong or accept constructive criticism of his code. Management tolerated him as he was always the loudest one in the room. When he finally resigned, the whole team was celebrating. </p><p>With good soft skills, people will like you more and you have a better chance of getting a raise or promotion. If you are technically gifted but hard to work with, your chances are slightly reduced.</p><p>Also, with good soft skills, people who know you will spread a good word behind your back. They can recommend you for the job, without even you knowing about it.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Software development is not a dream job. </p><p>Working in software engineering often means long working hours. Most of the time, you are glued to a computer screen, with little work-life balance. </p><p>The job demands an online presence, sometimes even after work hours. This often leads to stress and limited personal time. </p><p>Additionally, job satisfaction is frequently hindered by tedious tasks. Depending on the situation you have limited career growth prospects. There is also potential isolation in remote work.  And there is always a threat of job insecurity due to rapidly evolving technology.</p><p>But, there is also positive stuff.</p><p>Software development nurtures continuous innovation. Software engineers can create attractive applications and solve interesting problems.</p><p>The global demand for software solutions across diverse industries is big. This means there is always a demand for good software engineers. Software development careers provide flexibility with remote work options. </p><p>It's one big blessing to work from any location. Flexibility allows you to sleep in the morning without an alarm. You can work from your home in comfy pajamas. Also, you don't waste your precious time and money on commuting.</p>

<p>Chamberlain Group—the owner of <a href="https://www.lakewoodgaragedoor.biz/blog/the-history-of-garage-door-openers">most</a> of the garage door opener brands like LiftMaster, Chamberlain, Merlin, and Grifco—would like its customers to stop doing smart home things with its "myQ" smart garage door openers. The company recently issued a <a href="https://chamberlaingroup.com/press/a-message-about-our-decision-to-prevent-unauthorized-usage-of-myq">statement</a> decrying "unauthorized usage" of its smart garage door openers. That's "unauthorized usage" by <em>the people who bought the garage door opener</em>, by the way. Basically, Chamberlain's customers want to trigger the garage door and see its status through third-party smart home apps, and Chamberlain doesn't want that.</p>
<p>Here's the statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chamberlain Group recently made the decision to prevent unauthorized usage of our myQ ecosystem through third-party apps.</p>
<p>This decision was made so that we can continue to provide the best possible experience for our 10 million+ users, as well as our authorized partners who put their trust in us. We understand that this impacts a small percentage of users, but ultimately this will improve the performance and reliability of myQ, benefiting all of our users.</p>
<p>We encourage those who were impacted to check out our authorized partners here: <a href="https://www.myq.com/works-with-myq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.myq.com/works-with-myq</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>We caught wind of this statement through the Home Assistant blog, a popular open source smart home platform. The myQ integration is being stripped from the project because it doesn't work anymore. Allegedly, Chamberlain has been sabotaging Home Assistant support for a while now, with the integration maintainer, Lash-L, telling the Home Assistant blog, "We are playing a game of cat and mouse with MyQ and right now it looks like the cat is winning."</p>
<p>Our immediate question is <em>why</em> would any garage opener company care about customers using its garage door opener. You sell garage door openers—isn't usage the goal? A quick perusal through the app store reviews reveals what's going on. The iOS app is sitting pretty at 4.8 stars, but the Android app has suffered a wave of one-star reviews starting in October.</p>
<p>"Sadly, this app now displays advertisement at the very top and I cannot find a way to disable it," writes one Play Store reviewer (Google doesn't provide links to reviews). "This is very disturbing and on top of it, it moves my garage opening button out of the visible part of the screen. So to use it I now have to first look at the ads, then scroll down and hope to find my button." Another user writes, "I don't want ads in an app that I have already paid for the companion product." Other one-star reviews mention things like, "I clicked door open/close event and it popped up the video storage subscription dialog to ask me to subscribe," and, "Most of the app is dedicated to trying to upsell you on services and devices you don't need."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p><em>Ah</em>, now it makes sense. Your garage door opener app isn't here only to open your garage door; it's here to display ads and upsell you on services. Using third-party apps would get around Chamberlain's hardware-app-as-ad-platform strategy, so they are now banned. Another part of this is probably the plug at the end of Chamberlain's statement to "check out our authorized partners," which includes companies like Amazon and Alarm.com.</p>
<figure><img alt="The logo of the Chamberlain Group, which owns over 60 percent of the garage door market." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Chamberlain_Group_Logo.jpg" width="800" height="243"><figcaption><p>The logo of the Chamberlain Group, which owns over 60 percent of the garage door market.</p><p>Chamberlain Group</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Presumably, these "authorized partners" are paying a fee to work with garage door openers that have already been sold to customers. Home Assistant's founder, Paulus Schoutsen, writes that while Chamberlain Group has never responded to Home Assistant's requests to work together, the open source project "cannot pay a partnership fee. Not only is this financially not viable, it also goes against our values." The integration is being removed in next month's release, though Schoutsen says, "We would happily welcome this integration back if Chamberlain Group would work with us for the good of their customers."</p>
<p>For users stuck with a Chamberlain garage door opener, Home Assistant recommends a little circuit board called a "<a href="https://paulwieland.github.io/ratgdo/">ratgdo</a>," which is specifically meant to hack into Chamberlain/LiftMaster garage door openers. This connects the garage door button wires to your Wi-Fi—something Chamberlain presumably can't break on purpose—and freely communicates with everything. It can even "report back the actual status of the door (closed, opening, open, closing)" somehow.</p>
<p>We'll leave you with some consumer advocacy from Schoutsen and the Home Assistant team: "Once a company decides to be hostile to its customers, the only way we can win is by not playing their game at all. Do not buy products or services from companies that treat their customers this way. Tell your friends not to deal with companies that treat their customers this way. Buy products that work locally and won’t stop functioning when management wants an additional revenue stream."</p>

<p>One of the most common accessibility issues I find (and fix) <a href="https://gomakethings.com/consulting">on client projects</a> is dynamically disabled form buttons when a form is being submitted.</p>

<p>Today I want to talk about why developers do it, why it’s bad, and what you can do instead. Let’s dig in!</p>

<h2 id="why-developers-disable-buttons">Why developers disable buttons</h2>

<p>Typically, I see the pattern used to prevent a form from being submitted a second time while waiting for the form is processed.</p>

<p>Often, you’re waiting for an API response that may take a few moments, and you don’t want the user to submit the form again until the original response is processed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>form</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'submit'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>// Don't let the form reload the page
</span><span></span>	<span>event</span><span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>();</span>

	<span>// Get the submit button and disable it
</span><span></span>	<span>let</span> <span>btn</span> <span>=</span> <span>form</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>);</span>
	<span>btn</span><span>.</span><span>addAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'disabled'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>);</span>

	<span>// Do more form stuff...
</span><span></span>
	<span>// re-enable the button after the API responds
</span><span></span>	<span>btn</span><span>.</span><span>removeAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'disabled'</span><span>);</span>

<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With the <code>button</code> disabled, it cannot be clicked again.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-pattern-is-bad">Why this pattern is bad</h2>

<p>For starters, it doesn’t really do what you want it to.</p>

<p>Just because the <code>button</code> is <code>disabled</code> doesn’t mean the form can’t be submitted. Someone could focus on one of the form fields, then press the <code>enter</code> or <code>return</code> key, and the form would submit.</p>

<p>But it’s also horrible for accessibility.</p>

<p>Elements with the <code>disabled</code> attribute cannot receive focus, which creates confusing situations for screen reader users and people who <a href="https://gomakethings.com/navigating-the-web-with-a-keyboard/">navigate the web with a keyboard</a>.</p>

<p>If the <code>button</code> is the current item in focus when you add the <code>disabled</code> attribute (for example, if someone just pressed it to submit the form), the element actually loses focus, which shifts to the <code>document</code> element.</p>

<p>For a screen reader user, this is particularly jarring, as now you’re in a totally different place on the page.</p>

<p>So to recap, it doesn’t do what you actually want it to <em>and</em> it breaks your application for a segment of your users.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-way">A better way</h2>

<p>So, what should you do instead?</p>

<p>I personally prefer to add an attribute to the <code>form</code> as its being submitted, and remove it after all of the form actions are done. Whenever a <code>submit</code> event happens, I check for that attribute first. If it exists, I end the event handler early to prevent multiple form submissions.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>form</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'submit'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>// Don't let the form reload the page
</span><span></span>	<span>event</span><span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>();</span>

	<span>// If the form is already submitting, do nothing
</span><span></span>	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>form</span><span>.</span><span>hasAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'data-submitting'</span><span>))</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>

	<span>// Add the [data-submitting] attribute to stop multiple submissions
</span><span></span>	<span>form</span><span>.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'data-submitting'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>);</span>

	<span>// Do more form stuff...
</span><span></span>
	<span>// Remove the [data-submitting] attribute
</span><span></span>	<span>form</span><span>.</span><span>removeAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'data-submitting'</span><span>);</span>

<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This preserves focus on your form elements and avoids any weird accessibility issues, prevents duplication form submissions, and also prevents keyboard actions on other form fields from submitting the form.</p>

<p>You can also style form elements to “appear” disabled using the <code>[data-submitting]</code> CSS selector…</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>[</span><span>data-submitting</span><span>]</span> <span>button</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>opacity</span><span>:</span> <span>0.8</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Don’t forget to also include <a href="https://gomakethings.com/how-and-why-to-use-aria-live/">an ARIA live region</a> and display form status messages throughout the process.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The MyQ integration will be removed from Home Assistant in release 2023.12 on December 6, 2023. Chamberlain Group, the owners of MyQ, have released a public statement saying they will continue blocking access to third-party apps, like the MyQ integration. For current MyQ users we recommend <a href="https://paulwieland.github.io/ratgdo/" rel="external nofollow">ratgdo</a>, a device that physically connects to your MyQ garage door opener and allows you to control it locally.</p>
<p>If you own a garage door opener from Chamberlain or Liftmaster, you are probably familiar with MyQ. It’s a cloud-based smart home brand owned by Chamberlain Group, best known for its smart garage devices. MyQ is also currently one of the most problematic integrations for Home Assistant users. The MyQ garage door opener integration has, for the past months, been in a state of <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/the-current-state-of-myq-from-the-codeowner/630623">constant repair</a> as the integration breaks, is fixed, and then breaks again. This is a direct result of actions taken by MyQ to block access from third parties.</p>
<a name="read-more"></a>
<p>Last month, Chamberlain Group put out a <a href="https://chamberlaingroup.com/press/a-message-about-our-decision-to-prevent-unauthorized-usage-of-myq" rel="external nofollow">statement</a> by their CTO, Dan Phillips, on this matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chamberlain Group recently made the decision to prevent unauthorized usage of our myQ ecosystem through third-party apps. This decision was made so that we can continue to provide the best possible experience for our 10 million+ users, as well as our authorized partners who put their trust in us. We understand that this impacts a small percentage of users, but ultimately this will improve the performance and reliability of myQ, benefiting all of our users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <em>‘unauthorized usage’</em> appears to refer to the MyQ integration for Home Assistant which was added to Home Assistant in February, 2017. We have reached out to Chamberlain Group in several ways to see if we can come to an understanding, but we have not received an official response. We can only assume that this means Chamberlain Group has made its decision and will force customers to use only the MyQ app or those of their authorized partners.</p>
<p>You may wonder if Home Assistant could become an authorized partner. In their partner program, the partner companies pay Chamberlain Group for the privilege of letting MyQ owners control their own garage doors. We are open to working together with Chamberlain Group, but as Home Assistant is an open-source project, we cannot pay a partnership fee. Not only is this financially not viable, it also goes against our values. MyQ users should be able to access the devices they paid for and the data they own in any way they want, without a third party having to pay an additional fee.</p>
<p>So, to quote the maintainer of the MyQ integration, <a href="https://github.com/Lash-L" rel="external nofollow">Lash-L</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are playing a game of cat and mouse with MyQ and right now it looks like the cat is winning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once a company decides to be hostile to its customers, the only way we can win is by not playing their game at all. Do not buy products or services from companies that treat their customers this way. Tell your friends not to deal with companies that treat their customers this way. Buy products that work locally and won’t stop functioning when management wants an additional revenue stream.</p>
<p>Because we cannot continue to work around Chamberlain Group if they keep blocking access to third parties, the MyQ integration will be removed from Home Assistant in the upcoming 2023.12 release on December 6, 2023. We are very disappointed that it has come to this and sincerely hope that Chamberlain Group is willing to reconsider its position. We would happily welcome this integration back if Chamberlain Group would work with us for the good of their customers.</p>
<p>For now, if you are a MyQ owner, we’re afraid you are in the ‘small percentage of users’ Chamberlain Group refuses to serve. We recommend buying <a href="https://paulwieland.github.io/ratgdo/" rel="external nofollow">ratgdo</a>.</p>
<p>Ratgdo is a fully local, ESPHome-based, solution that is compatible with MyQ’s security+ protocol and can be installed on an existing MyQ system by connecting three wires. It offers the same garage door controls that MyQ does and even adds features that MyQ does not have, like motion events, controlling the light, and locking out wired remotes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Artists do some of the most important work in video games, as it's artists who define the look of the worlds we inhabit and the characters we fall in love with. One of my greatest pleasures working around video games is getting to <em>see </em>that work, and one of the greatest injustices is the way we rarely get to see--and artists rarely get to show--that much of it.</p><p>We see <em>some</em>, of course. Publishers tease games with a piece or two of uncredited key art, they might release some wallpaper during development, then afterwards dump a gallery on Artstation and sell a hardcover art book and some prints. But there's so much more that goes into a game's development than the polished pieces we see after it's already done, and there are countless artists whose portfolios have giant holes in them because of the strict rules governing the crediting and ownership of the works they create.</p><p>While <em>some </em>of the commercial reasons for keeping game art under wraps make sense, many artists working in the video game industry say they're subject to a power imbalance, even in full-time studio positions, that sees the bulk of their work locked away in vaults, where not only can fans never see them but where artists can't share them either, not even in professional settings like job applications or portfolios.</p><p>It's a situation that calls into question what ideas like creation and ownership even mean in an industry like this, and is an intersection at the junction of "what is right?" and "well, this is how it's always been done" that, as a long-time concept/development art freak, has always fascinated me. In an effort to better understand this alleged imbalance, then, I spoke with a number of working video game artists, some at big AAA studios, others working the indie freelance beat (and many in between) to understand what's keeping their work locked away, and what they'd like to see changed in the future.</p><p>It's important to note here that these artists are all what you would <em>broadly </em>consider "concept artists". The folks painting landscapes and designing outfits and drawing weapon sketches. They're not animators or 3D artists or texture artists or lighting specialists, whose own challenges and issues in the modern workplace would require their own separate features. </p><p>Let's meet them! These aren't their real names, of course; given the NDA-breaking subject matter at hand I've protected their identities. <strong>Frank </strong>has worked for over 15 years across multiple console generations, AAA and indie. <strong>Heidi</strong> has primarily worked as a contractor for various indie games studios. <strong>Brian </strong>has AAA experience at some of the world's biggest publishers, and has done some Hollywood movie work as well. After working eight years in studios, <strong>Sally</strong> has since gone freelance, working on everything from mobile to indie to AAA. And <strong>Daisy </strong>is a AAA veteran who has since moved into independent development.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett</strong>: <em>What do the rules around sharing your artwork currently look like? How strict is the average NDA you're asked to sign in 2023?</em></p><p><strong>Brian</strong>: Typically you are not allowed to share work until you’ve received permission from your boss at a studio. They are also not always on the same page about this. I have shared work that I was told was okay only to get an upset email from another higher-level employee that wasn't aware I got permission.</p><p>Most studio work I’ve done has NDAs that are effective in perpetuity. This is not typically something I agree to these days unless the company has a good track record of letting artists share their work eventually.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: Working with a small indie team I have a lot of freedom. In the past at big studios, having started my career in the early 2000's, there was zero expectation I had any personal freedom to share my work outside of a folio once a title had shipped.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years there was more of a pushback on that though, particularly as more opportunities to share emerged online and interest in the art tended to grow beyond those of us making it. Stuff like art dumps meant there was more of a desire for our art to be showcased on a personal level, but that was still only for shipped games, not cancelled ones.</p><p>Contracting I have found to be very studio-dependent, with smaller teams pretty willing to let you negotiate. Many smaller projects tend to be very open about development, from announcement onwards, so lots of work-in-progress stuff is encouraged as a form of promo.</p><p><strong>Heidi</strong>: When I was in a studio it was pretty strict. Everything we made was under tight lock and key, and with my work as a 2D artist doing concept art, if we wanted to show anything it had to be approved first, and had to be done through official channels. The studio was often credited rather than myself. Game development is a team sport, so being credited as a team doesn't necessarily bother me, and when it's studio work there's an understanding that it's for the studio 'brand' rather than me the artist. But it is a strange situation, especially when the murky waters of 'who did what' start happening. I was credited explicitly only when it could be seen that me, as a very online developer and artists, could be publicly and positively associated with the project. This isn't the case for everyone or at all studios though.</p><p>No two NDA's I've signed are the same. I wish they were, it'd make my life SO MUCH EASIER. Some are TREMENDOUSLY strict, and others really do not care when and how you show the work. Some are very okay with me sharing whatever work whenever as a means of guerrilla marketing (I don't necessarily recommend this approach as you can find yourself in weird 'manage players expectations' territory). Others don't want me to share or acknowledge I've been working on a project until it is announced or has even been released, and even then I often have to check in with management to make sure it aligns with brand messaging. In most cases once the project is released I'm able to share approved or publicly-available pieces I've created on my website. The biggest common thread I can think of is that you can only show explicit work of stuff that made it into the finished game, there are exceptions to this of course, but generally, so you don't accidentally wake up to a million clickbait 'INSERT GAME HERE&nbsp; was going to have FEATURE I CONCEPTED AND LIKED HOW IT LOOKED SO I CHUCKED IT ON MY WEBSITE' articles. I also find that there is an unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule of 'ask before you post stuff'. Additionally, marketing sometimes has a plan for certain pieces and you don't want to disrupt stuff like that.</p><p><strong>Daisy</strong>: Being an employee at a game studio - contract fulltime, freelance or fulltime - means waiting until the studio gives the greenlight at an unspecified time, usually a few to several months, after the release of a game. Sometimes this waiting period <a href="https://magazine.artstation.com/category/inspiration/art-blast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revolves around artblasts on Artstation</a>, artbook releases and other PR-related things on social media. With film and animation, waiting around for the studio greenlight could take several years and they are far more judicious with people who break NDA (if they are caught). The general point of this level of scrutiny is to prevent leaks.</p><p>Being a contractor depends if the job is onsite or remote. NDAs are still generally pretty strict on both. Updating public-facing portfolios with project materials even after a product has been made public knowledge is still implicitly a no without studio approval, this information is often done through department heads or relayed through an outsource manager or agency contact. Not all contracts are made equal, some last around a month or three while others are renewed yearly. Because remote freelancers in particular are always in a state of feast or famine, some prefer to upload NDA materials on their portfolio through a password-protected page, or have private pdfs, or have said materials ready only during interviews so long as they're not being recorded.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...the implicit expectation is that a studio will own the work you make forever. One particularly hostile contract stated they would own my work in perpetuity for the rest of my life, or my children's lives. Not sure if that one will hold up in court.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>How much work have you been able to share publicly over the course of your career?</em></p><p><strong>Brian</strong>: In the last five years I’d say I’ve only been allowed to show maybe 5% of my professional output. I have had an unfortunate string of projects get cancelled and the work just gets locked away forever after that.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: Over my career I have worked on 12 projects but shipped only four titles and two pieces of DLC.</p><p>Those cancelled projects tend to not get as far in development, so not as much final art, but there at least tend to be art bibles and vertical slice examples at a minimum. Some get pretty far along though.&nbsp;</p><p>Only one cancelled project have I been able to publicly show, and that was because it was developed internally at a big studio, but based on our creative director's personal pitch and development was agreed only on the condition that if it didn't continue development the IP was still owned by the creative director, so he granted us permission.</p><p><strong>Heidi</strong>: Every weekday, 9-5 I am drawing for games, so naturally loads of art ends up on the cutting floor. There's also the pre-production stuff you do where you're figuring out ideas that will never make it into games. For every piece of art I've made for games, there's at least six or more thumbnails (or four or more dirty nasty sketches) I've done just to figure things out. I also try and write documents for stuff so that clients have a paper-trail for my work process with their in-house art teams (or if it's just me, it's for me so I don't lose my marbles trying to remember why I spent two hours researching something). Games are also just funny beasts when they're in development, I've concepted out whole features only for them to be scratched, sometimes a library of icons you've built is no longer relevant because a feature iterates, things are constantly changing, and sometimes the nature of the beast means that we kill the darlings.</p><p>I will also take this question to clear up a big bugbear of mine (sorry it's soapbox time): most concept art never leaves the studio. It's used to communicate ideas and well, concepts, to other team members and stakeholders. Because of it's very nature this means that it's often not the sexiest looking thing and is done in a small amount of time. Concept art is VERY RARELY that big beautiful gorgeous splash art we trot out for marketing purposes. I really wish as an industry we would learn to manage expectations there, because it's damaging junior artists. Because that stunning splash art marketing departments call 'concept art' is often art that's done after tons of concept art work and is created as key art, or it is art that has been created for marketing purposes. This isn't to say that actual concept art isn't stunning and incredible to look at, it just means that my producer is probably gonna be really mad at me if I take 3 weeks to paint key art to communicate one idea to the rest of the team, rather than work efficiently in the time we have to communicate several ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>TLDR: Most things get left on the cutting floor, I'd say about 65-75% depending on the project and what stage of development we are in.</p><p><strong>Sally</strong>: With the exception of work I lost due to a hard drive failure on my end, my studio work is all public at this point. I’ve been a freelancer since the end of 2018 and that contains a lot more locked away NDA stuff, mostly due to the projects I was contracted on being pitches which aren’t necessarily projects which make it to full development or funding. Overall I’ve been weirdly lucky, I’ve had a game I’ve worked on release for almost every year of my career and the amount stuck behind NDA is not much more than a couple of year's worth of work – but a couple of years when I already have the skills and experience for that not to be too much of a sting.</p><p><strong>Daisy</strong>: Over 90% of the studio work I've made over my career is locked away forever, through studio closures, liquidating assets after acquisitions, extremely nosy IT guys who don't like people using USB ports, and just really binding NDA clauses. This is why personal work tends to show up more in some portfolios and public-facing artist profiles.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2023/11/archives2.gif"><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNN2LFe_iD8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tate</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>There seem to be lots of written (and unwritten) rules around when and how much work an artist can share from a project they worked on. Is there, like, a statute of limitations regarding this stuff? A point where you just think, you know what, fuck it, I'll just post this art and see if I get asked to take it down or not?</em></p><p><strong>Brian</strong>: God I wish. This is not a typical thing to ever get in a contract from a bigger client and those that do usually have to fight for it.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: &nbsp;I have never had timeframes in a contract for this stuff. There tends to be a bit of an understanding that maybe a console generation later or if the project isn't being developed in another fashion or the original studio is dead, then risk of showing stuff is low if you were able to smuggle it out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Heidi</strong>: Yes. I have mixed feelings about it. But I've had some contracts where the wait time is AGES but others where it's 'mate, just wait until it's out and then let us know when you're posting'. This is for many reasons, one that I hear a lot from non-artist people (CEO's, lawyers, marketing, etc.) is that 'if we post too early it could have people steal our IP'. For some studios, the reason relates to marketing, and for others that use contractors to supplement in-house teams, it's about letting that art team having their moment in the sun first. Some only ever let you show work if it's behind a password-protected part of your portfolio, and others NEVER consent to contractors showing stuff.</p><p><strong>Sally</strong>: I’ve not seen anything on paper that stood out – I tend to just wait until the game has released and then ask if it’s OK to post things. If the game has been out for three years I’ll just…post things anyways to be honest, I’m not a big name artist so me dropping some development concepts for a project onto my personal portfolio website isn’t going to make the front page of Kotaku, but I know larger artists don’t have that freedom.</p><p><strong>Daisy</strong>: There is never an official statue of limitations because the implicit expectation is a studio will own the work you make forever. One particularly hostile contract stated they would own my work in perpetuity for the rest of my life, or my children's lives. Not sure if that one will hold up in court.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>How do you personally feel about all this? The restrictions, the vaults, the contracts?</em></p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: &nbsp;I started this job expecting it was all a secret sealed vault, I guess I expected fewer cancellations though.</p><p>I understand certain aspects of secrecy as it can be important for the marketing process and wider businesses of a studio but I would like clearer request options or ways for studios to kind of let ex-employees know they can show stuff, though that doesn't help much if you don't have access to the media.&nbsp;</p><p>It also is harder for some departments, concept can just grab stills but props, animation, etc need to take time out to do renders or specifically showcase their work, which often you just don't get a chance to do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Heidi</strong>: I accept it as part of the job. When i crack open a cold one with the boys* (*I sit at my desk and open Affinity and Procreate before listening to history podcasts while I draw), I'm no longer 'Heidi the artist', but instead I'm 'Heidi the artist who is creating work for X'. I have been hired for my talent, skills, and taste and how I apply that to this client or studio's IP, NOT so I can draw what I want for me. This is the trade-off you make being a professional artist, you're collaborating and making visual loveliness for others, not necessarily yourself.&nbsp; You're contributing to a commercial project, not creating your own art.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this attitude, I accept from the get-go that a bunch of my stuff will never leave the workplace. What I do take issue with is that studios often like to try and restrict what artists can show after the project is done and the artist leaves a studio. All artists should be able to show work from a project once it's released as part of a folio and resume. Not letting an artist do so hinders their employment opportunities and disrespects their time on a project. When you give years or months to a project, it can be a real sucker punch when all of a sudden people tell you that you must never share that you worked on the project and never share your work. Be nice to your artists. Let them share stuff after a period of time so they can get more work and you get more publicity, it's a win-win.</p><p><strong>Sally</strong>: I find it slightly&nbsp; frustrating that I can’t show some of my pitch concept work, as it represents work that I don’t have time to replicate in my own time. But I’m not bitter about it, it is how it is.</p><p>Ultimately I’m here to work on cool projects with a team not like...be a rockstar, so the idea of having people on social media not see a thing I made doesn’t bother me so much.&nbsp; The idea of potential future employers not see something I’ve made that might align with a project they’re hiring for is more of a sting, you can put things behind a password wall or whatever, but an art director browsing Artstation isn’t going to know to ask for that.</p><p><strong>Daisy</strong>: This had and still does bother me, and it makes me wary about sharing my best ideas on a project. I accept it as part of my job, since clients don't always choose the more interesting ideas anyway, and it would be fantastic if artists as a whole were given far more leeway.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I think its brazenly immoral to revoke portfolio usage rights from the artist for all time. Like yeah you can own the pictures, man, but you shouldn't be allowed to keep us from using our labor to secure future jobs.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>What are your thoughts on the ownership of your work? You're getting paid to create things for a company, by a company, but also...you still created them. </em></p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: Ownership of work produced at a studio is theirs, which for me has been fine and makes sense.&nbsp;</p><p>Some studios have extended that to anything you make during employment, but I think that is seen as a huge overreach now, so it's less common, or at least potential to negotiate out of a contract.&nbsp;</p><p>Even the big AAA studios tend to have declarations for personal projects or work that exists outside of your job that are yours, you just can't commercialize it during your employment.&nbsp;</p><p>At least in indie I see some audio folk retaining all rights though, and they're able to profit from those soundtracks, and frankly I would appreciate similar opportunities for visual artists to have potential future revenue through official print sales or merch, but it does get complicated when it may overlap with a studio's core business.</p><p><strong>Heidi</strong>: Yes and no. As a freelancer I have to pop on my lawyer hat sometimes and read my contracts to make sure that nobody tries to be sneaky and own ALL THE WORK I produce during my time on a project. I've had some people try (intentionally and unintentionally), but usually once you point out that work that I'm doing in my spare time is unrelated to <em>work</em>, and cannot be owned by the company, they change things pretty quickly. Work that I do for clients and studios though belongs to them. I'm working on someone's IP, and even if I am helping them create that IP, it belongs to the company and not to me. It's the reality of how the sausage gets made, which is something that can frustrate artists. It comes back to that 'not creating for myself, but creating for a big team-wide project and IP' separation of church and state.</p><p>I would like to see parts of this change however, I'd love to see a residuals or royalties situation (that much more intelligent people than me can create) come into affect for artists who do, say, create a beloved IP staple character for a franchise.&nbsp; Ultimately at the end of the day, the artist has created one of the most marketable (if not THE most marketable) aspects of the character and should be compensated fairly for that work and the success it brought the studio. But I have no idea if this could actually happen (once again, smarter folks than I could probably tell you, I went to art school for a reason).</p><p>When working in a commercial video games setting, it can also be a nightmare to show people the really rough parts of the visual journey. Art Literacy is so garbage in the games industry, and nowhere is this more frustrating and apparent than when you're pitching to stakeholders, legal, etc. If you show the messy development work (eg. the post-it's i've scrawled nonsense on, initial sketches, thumbnails, etc.) it can lead to bogged-down discussions and unhelpful feedback, because we don't teach folks how to look at and appreciate art and develop those literacy skills. It can also be really difficult to manage expectations of people with low art literacy who don't value diverse art styles. If I show someone something that looks rough and explain where it's going, they can draw an incorrect conclusion. You can be the best communicator in the room and this can still happen if the other party doesn't grasp the visualization AND doesn't have strong art literacy skills.</p><p>Because of those two factors it does mean that things like my aforementioned nasty post-its, sketchbooks, writings, sketches, and other stuff, doesn't get released. You have to break through the hurdle of 'this is disposable and ugly' and corporate overlords giving you approval to share, and that tends to mean that it doesn't get shared to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>This is also before I even touch the idea of 'sharing rough art from a cut feature'. That doesn't get shared in my experience because the headache of dealing with 200 Twitter or Reddit commentators saying that 'GAME WAS GONNA HAVE THIS AND IT GOT CUT!!', and then blaming anything and everything, when in reality it was because we just didn't have time or it didn't work with the project the way we thought, is incredibly draining.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brian</strong>: The general terms for artists from bigger clients grant all rights to them. I think it's brazenly immoral to revoke portfolio usage rights from the artist for all time. Like yeah you can own the pictures, man, but you shouldn't be allowed to keep us from using our labor to secure future jobs.</p><p><strong>Daisy</strong>: Artists in videogames, film or animation have no rights to the work we make for clients or studios. Unless we have a more friendly contract and/or specific details are negotiated before the work begins, and that might count against some artists being hired again for new projects because they are perceived as being "difficult". With clients this depends on our professional relationship being amiable enough to navigate some leniencies.&nbsp; Our agency is often stripped from us in the name of realizing someone else's vision, to be diplomatic. The studio or the client still have the power to do whatever they want to the work after the fact and sometimes they make some unfortunate, undesirable choices. It's one thing if it's just one project, but over time it gets seriously depressing.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>:<em> OK, we've talked about how things are, but how would you like things to be? In a hypothetically perfect world for games artists, what would control and crediting and ownership over the things you've created look like?</em></p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: In the ideal world I would still understand, and want control over the work-in-progress pieces released on a game. Thinking of it as a creative director or lead, we all have suffered one time or another with the very first in-progress screenshot being used in articles to promote the game five years later, and you certainly want to clear early art.&nbsp;</p><p>Later in production, or for shipped titles, having at least public folios of the work should be standard. It does get complicated if projects are still being developed though, and you could negatively impact the project for those remaining on a team. Though I will also say I have seen plenty of NDA-breaking work in folios as people tend to take the risk on stuff they deem safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Definitely my biggest regrets about old art on projects was just not capturing or taking as much of my work during development, with my focus being on shipping the game.&nbsp;It has been funny recently hearing lots of stories of publishers reaching out to devs hoping they 'stole' development work for use in HD remasters when the publisher lost all of the original development data.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...the artist has created one of the most marketable (if not THE most marketable) aspects of the character and should be compensated fairly for that work and the success it brought the studio.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Brian</strong>: I am staunchly in favor of NDA term limits for work done. There is no world where it feels just to legally restrict artists from showing their work five years removed from doing it. If your project still isn't done in five years, that is a failure of management, not the artists.</p><p>I think all artists on a project should be allowed to show work done on the project two weeks after release. Should a project get cancelled publicly, artists should be allowed to post art done for the project immediately following that announcement. If it gets cancelled privately, artists should be allowed to show that work no later than one year after cancellation. In a perfect world at least. Rules like this would force corporations to be much more careful in their project development. They often don’t want cancelled artwork out there because of the idea that they may use it down the line, but they never do.</p><p><strong>Sally</strong>: Just between us, I just show things anyways; ask forgiveness, not permission. I know I'm not the only one who does that, I was encouraged to do it by other artists.</p><p>I don't have a moral problem not showing things from projects from smaller indues, there's an urge not to screw the little guy over, you know? But if I worked on a big IP,  and publishers can be weird about that, I'm putting the work in my portfolio anyways and being vague about where it's from if I have to.</p><p>Cancelled projects I think should be fair game, we should be able to show that. Another factor going on here is that as a concept artist my work is literally made to be disposable, you make a lot of options and the ones that don't make it get thrown in the bin, it's just part of the process. I would perhaps feel differently about a polished asset I spent three months on never seeing the light of day.</p><p>I'm not sure what rules I'd want in an ideal world, because I find that it depends on the client and the project. I can't yet show any work from the project I'm currently on, that I've been on for two years, but I also wouldn't WANT to, not until the project is done. It kinda makes you feel like a secret agent when the project is huge, and even if it means I've not been able to show any of the work for two years, I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.</p><p><strong>Daisy</strong>: I think ideally every artist deserves credit on what they've contributed to the project, and should never be denied being able to show off what they've made after a few months - or eight - of a product's launch. I even think they should be allowed to sell 2D renders of their work within a limited amount and profit ceiling. The recession is rough out here, and laying off people in the cold with no way to market themselves and their talent is horrible. </p><p>With acquisitions, if and when things fall like with Embracer, people who've worked on materials and technology to support projects should get them back hassle-free so when they <em>do </em>try to start over, they're not doing it from scratch. I hope companies are far more vigilant about protecting their IP from exploitative technologies like generative AI, and their employees as well. And one final thing, I wish companies were far better at organizing and archiving their projects, because it seriously sucks to see gigs and terabytes worth of work go down the drain because no one bothered with proper backups and decent storage.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="fhbody-172173040"><p>
			
		 	
				It happened a quarter of a century ago.   The <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/11/biztech/articles/03memo.html"> <em>New York Times</em> wrote</a> that "An <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/halloween1.html">internal memorandum</a> reflecting the views of some of Microsoft's top executives and software development managers reveals deep concern about the threat of free software and proposes a number of strategies for competing against free programs that have recently been gaining in popularity."

<i> The memo warns that the quality of free software can meet or exceed that of commercial programs and describes it as a potentially serious threat to Microsoft.   The document was sent anonymously last week to Eric Raymond, a key figure in a loosely knit group of software developers who collaboratively create and distribute free programs ranging from operating systems to Web browsers.   Microsoft executives acknowledged that the document was authentic...<p> 

In addition to acknowledging that free programs can compete with commercial software in terms of quality, the memorandum calls the free software movement a "long-term credible" threat and warns that employing a traditional Microsoft marketing strategy known as "FUD," an acronym for "fear, uncertainty and doubt," will not succeed against the developers of free software.   The memorandum also voices concern that Linux is rapidly becoming the dominant version of Unix for computers powered by Intel microprocessors. </p><p> 
 The competitive issues, the note warns, go beyond the fact that the software is free. It is also part of the open-source software, or O.S.S., movement, which encourages widespread, rapid development efforts by making the source code — that is, the original lines of code written by programmers — readily available to anyone. This enables programmers the world over to continually write or suggest improvements or to warn of bugs that need to be fixed.  The memorandum notes that open software presents a threat because of its ability to mobilize thousands of programmers.  "The ability of the O.S.S. process to collect and harness the collective I.Q. of thousands of individuals across the Internet is simply amazing," the memo states. "More importantly, O.S.S. evangelization scales with the size of the Internet much faster than our own evangelization efforts appear to scale."</p></i> <br>


Back in 1998, Slashdot's CmdrTaco <a href="https://slashdot.org/story/98/11/07/1259212/ms-ponders-fighting-linux-with-the-law">covered the whole brouhaha</a> — including <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/06/linux.threat.idg/">this CNN article</a>:

<i>A second internal Microsoft memo on the threat Linux poses to Windows NT calls the operating system "a best-of-breed Unix" and wonders aloud if the open-source operating system's momentum could be slowed in the courts.<p> 

 As with the first "Halloween Document," the memo — written by product manager Vinod Valloppillil and another Microsoft employee, Josh Cohen — was obtained by Linux developer Eric Raymond and posted on the Internet. In it, Cohen and Valloppillil, who also authored the first "Halloween Document," appear to suggest that Microsoft could slow the open-source development of Linux with legal battles.  "The effect of patents and copyright in combating Linux remains to be investigated," the duo wrote.</p></i> <br>

Microsoft's slogain in 1998 was "Where do you want to go today?"  So Eric Raymond published the documents on his web site under the headline  "Where will Microsoft try to drag you today? Do you really want to go there?" </p><p> 

25 years later, and it's all still up there and preserved for posterity on Raymond's web page — a collection of <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/index.html">leaked Microsoft documents and related materials</a> known collectively as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents">the Halloween documents</a>." And Raymond made a point of thanking the writers of the documents, "for authoring such remarkable and effective testimonials to the excellence of Linux and open-source software in general."</p><p> 
<em>Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader <a href="https://www.slashdot.org/~mtaht">mtaht</a> for remembering the documents' 25th anniversary...</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The bash book to rule them all</p><hr>


<p>
I <span>♥</span> to <code>/bin/bash</code> and last week I came around the one bash <a href="https://amzn.to/3u7kM8L">book</a> to rule them all.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/bash/book.webp" width="2305" height="1658"><span><i><small>Efficient Linux at the Command Line by Daniel J. Barrett.</small></i></span>

<p>Why it is good</p><hr><p>"I learned a lot" does not help since you don't know where I started from anyway. So here is a curated list of questions you can ask yourself to decide if this book is for you.</p>

<p>You want to understand why <code>cd</code> is not an executable but a builtin?</p>

<p>You want a pretty book with a beautiful Saker falcon illustration on the cover?</p>

<p>You want to know why this redirect does not work?</p>
<pre><b>$</b> sudo echo "New log file" &gt; /var/log/custom.log
<span>bash: /var/log/custom.log: Permission denied</span></pre>

<p>You want to demystify the fallacy of "global variables" and understand what <code>export</code> means?</p>

<p>You want to understand how job control works, and how it is all a shell construct?</p>

<p>You want to know what this error message means and how to avoid it?</p>
<pre><b>$</b> rm *.txt
<span>-bash: /bin/rm: Argument list too long</span></pre>

<p>You want to learn tricks that will spare your fingers like using <code>|&amp;</code> instead of <code>2&gt;&amp;1 |</code>?</p>

<p>You want to be reminded of the treasure of tools available such as <code>wc</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>ssh</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>seq</code>, <code>yes</code>, <code>xargs</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>awk</code>,<code>tac</code>, <code>paste</code>, <code>diff</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>rev</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>wget</code>, <code>man</code>, <code>rsync</code>, <code>tee</code>, <code>less</code>, and <code>more</code>?</p>

<p>You want to finally understand the differences between <code>.bashrc</code> and <code>.bash_profile</code>?</p>

<p>You want to learn eleven (11!) ways to run a command?</p>

<p>You want to know the difference between using <code>"</code> and <code>'</code>?</p>

<p>You want to understand the differences between a child shell and a sub-shell?</p>

<p>Happy Reading!</p><hr><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/bash/marks.webp" width="2287" height="764"> <hr>

<p>Has this ever happened to you?</p>
<p>You’ve just received a massive JSON file that looks like it was designed to confuse you. Or maybe you entered a command, and you got so much JSON that it looks incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The data you need is buried inside, and you’re dreading the hours it’ll take to extract and clean it up.</p>
<p>I’ve been there. I’ve <code>grep</code>ped my way through JSON and written ad-hoc Python scripts to process it for me.</p>
<p>But things don’t have to be like this.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><code>jq</code> is one of the best-kept secrets in the data processing world.</p>
<p>Here are some scenarios where <code>jq</code> could swoop in to save your day (and saves mine regularly):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Integrating with APIs in shell scripts often means handling JSON responses, requiring data extraction and manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data from different sources may need to be converted to or from JSON format for compatibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing software configuration files in JSON format can be a regular task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extracting data from websites often results in dealing with JSON data that requires parsing and filtering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server logs and monitoring data often use JSON, necessitating parsing and analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infra as Code tools like Ansible and Terraform use JSON-like configurations, requiring management. JSON is a subset of YAML, so every valid JSON file is also a valid YAML file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All examples are <em>✨fully interactive✨</em>, so I encourage you to play around!<br>
In fact, I’ll be downright heartbroken if you don’t, because I put a lot of effort into it. You can edit both the input JSON data, and the jq program as well.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in! We’ll start off easy, and get slowly deeper into the weeds.</p>
<h2 id="basic-operations">Basic Operations</h2>
<h3 id="selecting-values">Selecting values</h3>
<p>Everything in <code>jq</code> is a filter. The dot <code>.</code> is used to select the current object or element, and we can put the property name after it to access a key from an object:</p>


<h3 id="filtering-arrays">Filtering Arrays</h3>
<p>The <code>.[]</code> notation is used to iterate over the elements of an array in a JSON document. It allows you to access each element of an array and perform operations on them.</p>
<p>The <code>select()</code> function is used to filter JSON data based on a specified condition or criteria. It is a powerful tool for extracting specific elements from a JSON document that meet certain conditions.</p>
<p>Similiar to shell scripting, <code>jq</code> works on a pipes-and-filters manner. We use the <code>|</code> to send the data from one filter to the next.
<jq-view name="example2"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="mapping-arrays">Mapping Arrays</h3>
<p>We can use the <code>map</code> function to run any operation on every element of the array and return a new array containing the outputs of that operation:
<jq-view name="example3"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="combining-filters">Combining Filters</h3>
<p>The pipe operator <code>|</code> can be used to chain as many filters or functions as we want:
<jq-view name="example4"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="splitting-strings">Splitting Strings</h3>
<p>We can use the <code>split()</code> function to a split a string on a particular separator character. <br>
Note also the usage of <code>.[0]</code> to select the first index from the split array.</p>


<h3 id="conditional-logic">Conditional Logic</h3>
<p>We can use <code>if</code> to create expressions
<jq-view name="example6"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="handling-null-values">Handling Null Values</h3>
<p>Null values can often mess up logic in our scripts, so we can filter them all out using <code>map</code> and <code>select</code>
<jq-view name="example17"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="formatting-output">Formatting Output</h3>
<p>Sometimes we don’t want JSON output. We want it in a particular string format.<br>
Note the use of the <code>-r</code> flag, it makes the output raw. Without it, it would be displayed with quote marks around it.
<jq-view name="example10"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="multiple-outputs">Multiple Outputs</h3>
<p>Curly braces create a new object, which we can use for multiple outputs:
<jq-view name="example5"></jq-view></p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-nested-items">Dealing with Nested Items</h2>

<p>JSON is very commonly used to store nested objects, and we often need to traverse or manipulate such structures. <code>jq</code> gives us all the tools we need to make it easy:</p>
<h3 id="recursive-descent">Recursive Descent</h3>
<p>We can use <code>..</code> to recursively descend through a tree of an object.</p>


<h3 id="filtering-nested-arrays">Filtering Nested Arrays</h3>


<h3 id="flattening-nested-json-objects">Flattening Nested JSON Objects</h3>
<p>Often, we just want all the key-values, and flattening the object may be the most convenient way to go:</p>


<h3 id="recursive-object-manipulation">Recursive Object Manipulation</h3>
<p>We can use the <code>recurse</code> as well, to traverse a tree.
<jq-view name="example18"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="complex-object-transformation">Complex Object Transformation</h3>


<h3 id="walk-through-object-and-apply-a-transformation-conditionally">Walk through object and apply a transformation conditionally</h3>
<p>The <code>walk()</code> function provides a convenient way to traverse a nested object and apply some transformation to it.
<jq-view name="example24"></jq-view></p>

<h2 id="statistical-operations">Statistical Operations</h2>
<p><img src="https://ishan.page/blog/2023-11-06-jq-by-example/stats.jpg" width="6016" height="4016" srcset="https://ishan.page/blog/2023-11-06-jq-by-example/stats_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_2144012_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w, https://ishan.page/blog/2023-11-06-jq-by-example/stats_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_2144012_1024x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1024w" loading="lazy" data-flex-grow="149" data-flex-basis="359px"></p>

<p><code>jq</code> is incredibly handy for doing quick and dirty statistical analysis in the field. Here’s most of the common operations related to that</p>
<h3 id="sorting-arrays">Sorting Arrays</h3>
<p>Sorting an array is a basic operation that is useful for many things in statistics.
<jq-view name="example7"></jq-view></p>


<p>Extracting unique values from an array is another fairly basic operation that we need for many things.
<jq-view name="example12"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="calculating-averages">Calculating Averages</h3>
<p>Calculating the mean or average of a dataset is a common statistical operation we may often need to do
<jq-view name="example20"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="grouping-and-aggregating">Grouping and Aggregating</h3>
<p>We can group an array of objects by a particular key and get an aggregated value of the other keys fairly easily:
<jq-view name="example11"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="filtering-after-aggregation">Filtering after Aggregation</h3>


<h3 id="custom-aggregation-with-reduce">Custom Aggregation with reduce</h3>
<p>We can also use <code>reduce</code> to perform a single-output aggregation from an array
<jq-view name="example23"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="calculating-histogram-bins">Calculating Histogram Bins</h3>
<p>We may want to calculate a histogram from an array of data.
<jq-view name="example22"></jq-view></p>

<h2 id="other-common-operations">Other Common Operations</h2>
<p>These are some other common operations I frequently find myself doing every day, but I couldn’t think of a better way to categorize them.</p>

<p>We can combine multiple conditions in a <code>select</code> call. The <code>test()</code> function is used to check if the passed string contains one of the substrings or not.
<jq-view name="example15"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="formatting-unix-timestamps">Formatting Unix Timestamps</h3>
<p>Various tools emit Unix Timestamps, and we can use the handy <code>strftime</code> function to format it so it’s easier to understand at a glace.
<jq-view name="example16"></jq-view></p>

<h3 id="enumerating-by-top-level-key-and-value">Enumerating by Top Level Key and Value</h3>


<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Whew! That’s been a long article 😅 If you’re still here, then I appreciate you staying till the very end.</p>
<p>I hope you’ve learned something new, and that you’ll be able to quickly identify use cases for <code>jq</code> in your current workflow and apply your learnings there.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-this-article-work">How Does This Article Work?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have used web components to create a custom component <code>&lt;jq-view&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>There is some Javascript in this page which renders all the <code>&lt;jq-view&gt;</code>s when the page is loaded.</li>
<li>The WebAssembly build of <code>jq</code>, as well as all the code for calling out to it is provided by BioWasm.</li>
<li>I have used AlpineJs to make the examples interactive. When the button is clicked, it sends an event to a listener, which makes it run <code>jq</code> and then update the output.</li>
<li>Since I am not good at front-end, this was a substantial learning experience for me.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="get-in-touch">Get In Touch</h3>
<p>If you have any suggestions on how this may be improved, errors that I might have made, or you just want to discuss any other topic, please feel free to <a href="mailto:ishan.dassharma1@gmail.com">email me</a>. I always love to hear from you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Demand for Microsoft's AI services is apparently so great – or Redmond's resources so tight – that the software giant plans to offload some of the machine-learning models used by Bing Search to Oracle's GPU supercluster as part of a multi-year agreement announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Our collaboration with Oracle and use of Oracle Cloud infrastructure along with our Microsoft Azure AI infrastructure, will expand access to customers and improve the speed of many of our search results," Divya Kumar, who heads up Microsoft's Search and AI marketing team, explained in a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/apac/news/announcement/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-utilized-by-microsoft-for-bing-conversational-search-2023-11-07/" rel="nofollow">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The partnership essentially boils down to: Microsoft needs more compute resources to keep up with the alleged "explosive growth" of its AI services, and Oracle just happens to have tens of thousands of Nvidia A100s and H100 GPUs available for rent. Far be it from us to suggest the Larry-Ellison-founded database giant doesn't have enough cloud customers to consume its stocks of silicon.</p>

    

<p>Microsoft was among the first to integrate a generative AI chatbot into its search engine with the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/07/microsoft_bing_ai/">launch</a> of Bing Chat back in February. You all know the drill by now: you can feed prompts, requests, or queries into Bing Chat, and it will try to look up information, write bad poetry, generate pictures and other content, and so on.</p>

        


        

<p>The large language models that underpin the service not only require massive clusters of GPUs to train, but for inferencing – the process of putting a model to work – to run at scale. It's Oracle's stack of GPUs that will help with this inference work.</p>
<p>The two cloud providers' latest collaboration takes advantage of the Oracle Interconnect for Microsoft Azure, which allows services running in Azure to interact with resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The two super-corps have <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/20/oracle_microsoft_multi_cloud_database/">previously</a> used the service to allow customers to connect workloads running in Azure back to OCI databases.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/05/biden_ai_reporting_thresholds/">Developing AI models or giant GPU clusters? Uncle Sam would like a word</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/03/microsoft_365_copilot/">Microsoft 365 Copilot 'generally available' – if you can afford 300 seats</a></li>

</ul>
<p>In this case, Microsoft is using the system alongside its Azure Kubernetes Service to orchestrate Oracle's GPU nodes to keep up with what's said to be demand for Bing's AI features.</p>
<p>According to StatCounter, for October 2023, Bing had a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">3.1 percent</a> global web search market share for all platforms – that's compared to Google's 91.6 percent, but up from 3 percent the month before. On desktop, Bing climbed to 9.1 percent, and 4.6 percent for tablets.</p>

        

<p>Maybe StatCounter is wrong; maybe Microsoft's chatty search engine isn't as staggeringly popular as we're led to believe. Maybe Microsoft just wants to make Bing look like it's in high demand; maybe Redmond really does need the extra compute.</p>
<p>Oracle claims its cloud super-clusters, which presumably Bing will use, can each scale to 32,768 Nvidia A100s or 16,384 H100 GPUs using a ultra-low latency Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) network. This is supported by petabytes of high-performance cluster file storage designed to support highly parallel applications.</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn't said just how many of Oracle's GPU nodes it needs for its AI services and apps, and won't say. A spokesperson told us: “Those aren’t details we are sharing as part of this announcement.” We've asked Oracle too for more information and we'll let you know if we hear anything back.</p>

        

<p>This isn't the first time the frenemies have leaned on each other for help. Back in September Oracle <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/15/oracle_database_at_azure/">announced</a> it would colocate its database systems in Microsoft Azure datacenters. In that case, the collaboration was intended to reduce the latency associated with connecting Oracle databases running in OCI to workloads in Azure. ®</p>

 </article><p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06774-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06774-2" data-track-category="body text link">text of the retraction notice</a> states that it was requested by eight co-authors. “They have expressed the view as researchers who contributed to the work that the published paper does not accurately reflect the provenance of the investigated materials, the experimental measurements undertaken and the data-processing protocols applied,” it says, adding that these co-authors “have concluded that these issues undermine the integrity of the published paper”. (The <i>Nature</i> news team is independent from its journals team.)</p><p>It is the third high-profile retraction of a paper by the two lead authors, physicists Ranga Dias at the University of Rochester in New York and Ashkan Salamat at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). <i>Nature</i> withdrew a separate paper last year<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> and <i>Physical Review Letters</i> retracted one this August<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>. It spells more trouble in particular for Dias, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/plagiarism-allegations-pursue-physicist-behind-stunning-superconductivity-claims" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.science.org/content/article/plagiarism-allegations-pursue-physicist-behind-stunning-superconductivity-claims" data-track-category="body text link">whom some researchers allege plagiarized portions of his PhD thesis</a>. Dias has objected to the first two retractions and not responded regarding the latest. Salamat approved the two this year.</p><p>“It is at this point hardly surprising that the team of Dias and Salamat has a third high-profile paper being retracted,” says Paul Canfield, a physicist at Iowa State University in Ames and at Ames National Laboratory. Many physicists had seen the <i>Nature</i> retraction as inevitable after the other two — and especially since <a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/room-temperature-superconductor-retract-journal-nature-e554536a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.wsj.com/science/room-temperature-superconductor-retract-journal-nature-e554536a" data-track-category="body text link"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/another-retraction-looms-embattled-physicist-behind-blockbuster-superconductivity" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.science.org/content/article/another-retraction-looms-embattled-physicist-behind-blockbuster-superconductivity" data-track-category="body text link"><i>Science</i></a> reported in September that 8 of the 11 authors of the paper — including Salamat — had requested it in a letter to the journal.</p><p>Dias and Salamat did not respond to a request for comment by <i>Nature</i>’s news team. The retraction states that he and two other co-authors — Nugzari Khalvashi-Sutter and Sasanka Munasinghe, both at Rochester — "have not stated whether they agree or disagree with this retraction".</p><h2>Early scepticism</h2><p>This year’s report by Dias and Salamat is the second significant claim of superconductivity to crash and burn in 2023. In July, a separate team at a start-up company in Seoul described<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup> a crystalline purple material dubbed LK-99 — made of copper, lead, phosphorus and oxygen — that they said showed superconductivity at normal pressures and at temperatures up to at least 127 °C (400 kelvin). There was much online excitement and many attempts to reproduce the results, but researchers quickly reached a consensus that the material <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02585-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02585-7" data-track-category="body text link">was not a superconductor at all</a>.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Superconductors are important in many applications, from magnetic resonance imaging machines to particle colliders, but their use has been limited by the need to keep them at extremely low temperatures. For decades, researchers have been developing new materials with the dream of finding one that exhibits superconductivity without any refrigeration.</p><p>Specialists in the field have been sceptical since this year’s Dias and Salamat paper was published, says Lilia Boeri, a physicist at the Sapienza University of Rome. This, she says, is in part because of controversies swirling around the team and in part because the latest paper was not written to what she considers a high standard.</p><p>“Virtually every serious condensed-matter physicist I know saw right away that there were serious problems with the work,” says Peter Armitage, an experimental physicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. In particular, members of the community took issue with measurements of the material’s electrical resistance, saying it was not clear whether the property truly dropped to zero, or whether Dias and Salamat had subtracted a background signal from a key plot of resistance to create the appearance that it did. Critics say that it should not be necessary to remove background from this type of measurement. In today's text, the journal stated, "An investigation by the journal and post-publication review have concluded that these concerns are credible, substantial and remain unresolved."</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Armitage adds that the publication of the paper also raises questions about the editorial review process at <i>Nature</i>, and why reviewers didn’t catch the issues.</p><p>“The highly qualified expert reviewers we selected raised a number of questions about the original submission, which were largely resolved in later revisions,“ says Karl Ziemelis, chief physical sciences editor at <i>Nature</i>. “What the peer-review process cannot detect is whether the paper as written accurately reflects the research as it was undertaken.”</p><p>“Decisions about what to accept for publication are not always easy to make,” Ziemelis continues. “And there may be conflicts, but we strive to take an unbiased position and to ensure the interests of the community always drive our deliberations.”</p><h2>Audible clamour</h2><p><i>Nature</i> published the now-retracted paper on 8 March. That week, Dias himself presented the results to a standing-room-only audience at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Las Vegas. Over the audible clamour of the crowd assembled outside the room’s doors — where conference staff limited entry to avoid violating fire regulations — Dias briefly described a compound made of hydrogen, lutetium and small amounts of nitrogen that was a superconductor at temperatures up to 21 °C (294 kelvin) when kept at a pressure of around 1 gigapascal (10,000 times atmospheric pressure).</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Many teams had already created and experimented with similar hydrogen-rich materials, called hydrides, after a milestone discovery in 2015. A group led by physicist Mikhail Eremets at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, reported<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup> superconductivity in a hydrogen–sulfur compound at −70 °C (203 kelvin); at the time, this was a record-high operating temperature for a superconductor. But Eremets’s material required a much higher pressure of 145 gigapascals (1.4 million times atmospheric pressure) — comparable to the crushing conditions at the centre of Earth.</p><p>Since then, researchers have made hydride superconductors that push closer and closer to operating at room temperature, but all of them work only under extreme pressures. When Dias and Salamat published their paper in <i>Nature</i> in March, they <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02733-z#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02733-z#ref-CR10" data-track-category="body text link">seemed to have made a significant step</a> towards a material that could find practical applications.</p><p>But some specialists were already wary because of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03066-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03066-z" data-track-category="body text link">the first <i>Nature</i> retraction</a>. And some say they immediately found the fresh claims to be improbable. For instance, the material described in the paper was supposed to have around three hydrogen atoms for every lutetium atom. But if so, the lutetium would tend to donate an electron to each hydrogen, resulting in a kind of salt, says Artem Oganov, a materials scientist at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Moscow. “You get either an insulator or an extremely poor metal,” he says — not a superconductor.</p><p>One lab says it has partially reproduced Dias and Salamat’s results using a sample provided by the Rochester team<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup>. But many others, which tried creating their own samples and running tests, could not. And in the meantime, other causes for concern have arisen. An investigation launched by <i>Physical Review Letters</i> before it retracted its paper by Dias and Salamat found “apparent data fabrication”, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02401-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02401-2" data-track-category="body text link">as <i>Nature</i>’s news team reported in July</a>. And an investigation launched by <i>Nature</i>’s journals team after it received an anonymous critique of data in this year’s paper found that “the credibility of the published results are in question”, according to <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/another-retraction-looms-embattled-physicist-behind-blockbuster-superconductivity" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.science.org/content/article/another-retraction-looms-embattled-physicist-behind-blockbuster-superconductivity" data-track-category="body text link">September’s news story in <i>Science</i></a>.</p><h2>Credibility concerns</h2><p>Armitage does not think that Dias and Salamat will be able to keep doing research, pointing to the investigation findings and allegations of plagiarism in Dias’s PhD thesis. The University of Rochester has confirmed to <i>Nature</i> that it has launched an investigation into the integrity of Dias’s work, which is being conducted now by external experts. The university’s spokesperson did not answer questions about whether the institution has yet disciplined Dias. UNLV did not answer <i>Nature</i>’s queries about whether Salamat is being investigated, saying that “UNLV does not publicly discuss personnel matters”, but that it “is committed to maintaining the highest standards for research integrity campus wide”.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Canfield says that the Dias–Salamat collaboration has spread a “foul vapour” over the field, which “is scaring young researchers and funding agencies away”.</p><p>“I have some colleagues who simply are afraid that this case of Dias puts a shadow of doubt on the credibility of our field in general,” Eremets says.</p><p>Ho-Kwang Mao, director of the Center for High Pressure Science and Technology Advanced Research in Beijing, is more sanguine. “I do not think it will affect the funding for superconductivity research other than more careful reviews, which is not necessarily bad,” he says.</p><p>Hai-Hu Wen, director of the Center for Superconducting Physics and Materials at Nanjing University in China, agrees. “Actually, it seems more easy to get funding for the research of superconductivity since some government officials seem to be influenced by the expectation of a room-temperature superconductor,” he says.</p><p>But Boeri says she has heard researchers complain that the controversies — the allegations of PhD thesis plagiarism and the findings of apparent data fabrication — have made it harder to recruit students to work on superconductors. “We face a serious communication problem, to make people understand that the field is healthy — that although there may be some bad apples, the community’s standards are much higher,” she says.</p><p>“Serious people continue to do amazing and interesting work,” Armitage says. “Sure, they can be disheartened by this nonsense, but it won’t stop the science.”</p>

<p>
Hello, my name is Virgil Dupras, author of <a href="http://collapseos.org/">Collapse OS</a> and <a href="http://duskos.org/">Dusk OS</a> and I'm starting a series of articles that
aims to hand-hold my former self, a regular web developer, into the rabbit hole
leading to the wonderful world of low level programming. Hopefully, I can
hand-hold you too.
</p>

<p>
The general goal is to broaden your perspectives on the subject of computing. I
intend do to that through story arcs leading, step by step, to some nice and
shiny objective. I also intend to work into a gimmick where in each episode, I
get to tell one corny joke.
</p>

<p>
The target reader is a person who knows their way around programming, but is
inexperienced in the area of low level programming. If you're the target reader
but find some parts of this content difficult to understand, this is not
intentional. In this case, or if you have any question or comment, reach out to
me at hsoft@hardcoded.net.
</p>

<h2>Story arcs</h2>

<h3>Buckle up, Dorothy</h3>

<p>
In my <a href="http://tumbleforth.hardcoded.net/01-duskcc/01-buckleup.html">“pilot” story arc</a>, we peek in
disgust in the abyss of modern software complexity and escape this dystopia by
tumbling down the rabbit hole of low level development.
</p>
<p>
Starting from bare metal on the PC platform, we build a Forth from scratch, then
switch to <a href="http://duskos.org/">Dusk OS</a> and then build a partial C
compiler (just enough to compile our example code), again from scratch.

            <h3>Efficient and fast</h3>
            <p>WasmFX provides a general and flexible instruction set
            for fast stack switching, paving the way for efficient
            implementations of various non-local control flow
            abstractions, which would otherwise have to be implemented
            using whole-program transformations such as continuation
            passing style. WasmFX is carefully designed to enable Wasm
            to maintain backwards-compatible performance for legacy
            programs.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Modular and composable</h3>
            <p>WasmFX provides a modular and composable basis for
            implementing non-local control flow abstractions via
            delimited control, as the design draws heavily
            on <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdp/publications/Effect_Handlers.pdf">Plotkin
            and Pretnar's handlers for algebraic effects</a>. As such
            the design is based on strong and well-understood
            theoretical foundations; at the same time it also
            incorporates the practical lessons learnt during the
            previous 30 years of research on delimited control.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h3>Debuggable and profilable </h3>
            <p>WasmFX is designed to preserve the debugging and
            profiling experience of WebAssembly. The structure of
            WasmFX stacks offers excellent compatibility with popular
            formats such as <a href="https://dwarfstd.org/">DWARF
            stack unwind tables</a>, enabling WebAssembly
            implementations to maintain compatibility with standard
            debugging and profiling tools.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Minimal and compatible</h3>
            <p>WasmFX is designed as a minimal and compatible
            extension to WebAssembly for structured non-local control
            flow. The extension is minimal in the sense that it
            leverages WebAssembly's existing instruction set and type
            system. It extends the instruction set with six new
            instructions and the type system with a new reference
            type.</p>

      <p>
        Running on the battle-tested Erlang virtual machine that powers
        planet-scale systems such as WhatsApp and Ericsson, Gleam is ready for
        workloads of any size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to a multi-core actor based concurrency system that can run
        millions of concurrent tasks, fast immutable data structures, and a
        concurrent garbage collector that never stops the world, your service can
        scale and stay lightning fast with ease.

      <h2>Ready when you are</h2>
      <p>
        Gleam comes with compiler, build tool, formatter, editor integrations,
        and package manager all built in, so creating a Gleam project is just
        running <code>gleam new</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the wider BEAM ecosystem, Gleam programs can use thousands
        of published packages, whether they are written in Gleam, Erlang, or
        Elixir.

  <section>
    <div>
      <h2>Multilingual</h2>
      <p>
        Gleam makes it easy to use code written in other BEAM languages such
        as Erlang and Elixir, so there's a rich ecosystem of thousands of open
        source libraries for Gleam users to make use of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gleam can additionally compile to JavaScript, enabling you to use your
        code in the browser, or anywhere else JavaScript can run. It also
        generates TypeScript definitions, so you can interact with your Gleam
        code confidently, even from the outside.

<article>

<section>
<div>
<p>Almost 2 years on from the last time I wrote about QWACs, I'm sadly not here to tell you that things have gone well since then. In fact, I'm actually here to tell you that things are not going well at all...</p><h4 id="qwac">QWAC</h4><p>Back in Jan 2022, I wrote a blog post that went into details on what a QWAC, or Qualified Website Authentication Certificate, actually is: <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/looks-like-a-duck-swims-like-a-duck-qwacs-like-a-duck-probably-an-ev-certifiacate/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and QWACs like a duck, then it's probably an EV Certificate</a></p><p>TLDR; It's an EV Certificate all over again 🤷‍♂️</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2023/11/facepalm-crowd.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="498" height="274"></figure><p>In all seriousness though, that's actually quite a long and detailed post about the shortcomings of a QWAC and why they're just a terrible, terrible idea. They're only being pushed by organisations that would make $$$ selling them (funny that) and it's like the entire mess of EV has been conveniently forgotten. I'm not here to re-tread the same ground, though, I'm here to talk about something even more concerning. You might think "ok, so we have a new type of pointless certificate available", and if that were the case, I wouldn't be writing about it again and we could all just not buy them. The problem is that there's something bigger lurking that really concerns me.</p><h4 id="my-concerns">My Concerns</h4><p>This isn't all just talk for me, having dedicated a huge portion of my life to working in this industry and being so passionate about it, this worries me. It worries me enough that I've signed multiple open letters speaking out against this, with the most recent <a href="https://last-chance-for-eidas.org/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">just a few days ago</a>, and I've even travelled to Brussels to sit alongside Member of European Parliament Karen Melchior, and other industry representatives, to <a href="https://securityriskahead.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Press-release-event-on-cybersecurity-risks-within-the-eIDAS-revision.pdf?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">speak against this</a>. I have absolutely no skin in this game, one way or another, but I've seen something that I believe is just fundamentally wrong, and I feel compelled to speak out against it.</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2023/11/image-17.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="643" height="382" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/image-17.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2023/11/image-17.png 643w"></figure><h4 id="eidas-article-45latest-recitals">eIDAS Article 45 - latest recitals</h4><p>As we come towards the end of the legal process, we're closing in on the final revisions and final draft of some new regulation coming to the EU called <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">eIDAS</a>. This new regulation contains many things, and it's only one small part of it that I fundamentally oppose, but it will have Global impact, far beyond the borders of any member state of the EU.</p><p>Alongside introducing the concept of a QWAC, discussed in my previous blog post, eIDAS is also going to introduce some very concerning requirements that affect the Internet PKI. At the top of my list of concerns is that browser and client vendors (Root Store Operators) will have a legal obligation to add Government mandated Root Certificate Authorities to their Root Stores, bypassing existing approval mechanisms. </p><p>Yep, you read that right. Government mandated Root Certificate Authorities...</p><p>I could end this blog post right here because anyone reading this will understand the significance of such a statement, and just how much of a catastrophically bad idea that is, but it gets worse. There will also be restrictions placed on Root Store Operators around handling incidents at those Root CAs and possibly removing trust in them for wrongdoing. I cannot stress this enough so I'm going to say it again, this is a terrible idea.</p><h4 id="how-it-works-now">How it works now</h4><p>The system that we have now is not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination, but it has been improved so much over the years with tireless work from the industry, that where we are now, finally, is a good place.</p><p>A browser or device vendor like Apple has a collection of Trusted Root Certificate Authorities that their devices will trust, and in turn, those devices will trust any certificates issued by those Trusted Root CAs. If you want to join this collection of Trusted Root CAs, you have to apply to join the <a href="https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ca_program.html?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">Apple Root Certificate Program</a> and pass some very strict requirements. Of course, this makes sense, because being a Trusted Root CA is a massive responsibility that gives you an enormous amount of power, and Apple want to make sure that their customers aren't going to come to any harm because of your actions. The same goes for all such Root Store Operators like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/program-requirements?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft</a> and many others that operate Trusted Root Programs for their own devices or software. It is in the interest of the software/device vendor to make sure that a Root CA is capable of operating properly because if not, all of that vendor's customers are at serious risk of having their traffic intercepted and decrypted. So, for Apple, their concern is that if a Root CA makes a mistake, the potential outcome is that everyone using an iPhone could have the security of all of their traffic compromised! That's a serious risk, and it's why organisations like Apple take the process of approving Trusted Root CAs so damn seriously.</p><p>This is the existing approval mechanism that will be bypassed by this new legislation and the Root Store Operators will be required to accept these European Root CAs without the ability to scrutinise them, or, reject their inclusion.</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2023/11/CABForum_logo.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="426" height="93"></figure><h4 id="how-its-going-to-work">How it's going to work</h4><p>I have access to the near-final text of the regulation, which is not yet public, but was leaked to me by a confidential source. I've been looking through the proposed changes and I still see all of the things that have concerned me throughout this entire process. Here are a few snippets from the hundreds of pages that I've read through that still demonstrate my concerns. These snippets outline the definition of a QWAC and that they must be held against the standards set out in the legislation:</p><blockquote>‘qualified certificate for website authentication’ means a certificate for website authentication, which is issued by a qualified trust service provider and meets the requirements laid down in Annex IV;</blockquote><blockquote>Qualified certificates for website authentication shall meet the requirements laid down in Annex IV.</blockquote><blockquote>Evaluation of compliance with those requirements shall be carried out in accordance with the standards and the specifications referred to in paragraph 3.</blockquote><p>But if that isn't clear enough for you, the legislation goes on to say:</p><blockquote>Qualified certificates for website authentication issued in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be recognised by web-browsers. Web-browsers shall ensure that the identity data attested in the certificate and additional attested attributes are displayed in a user-friendly manner. Web-browsers shall ensure support and interoperability with qualified certificates for website authentication referred to in paragraph 1</blockquote><p>That's pretty clear, and we can still see the same concerns I raised previously about the legislation controlling not only support for, and use of, the Government Mandated Root CAs, but even control over the UI of the browser itself. It goes on:</p><blockquote>National trusted lists should confirm the qualified status of website authentication services and of their trust service providers, including their full compliance with the requirements of this Regulation with regards to the issuance of qualified certificates for website authentication. Recognition of QWACs means that the providers of web-browsers should not deny the authenticity of qualified certificates for website authentication attesting the link between the website domain name and the natural or legal person to whom the certificate is issued and confirming the identity of that person. Providers of web-browsers should display in a user-friendly manner the certified identity data and the other attested attributes to the end-user, in the browser environment, by relying on technical implementations of their choice. To that end, providers of web-browsers should ensure support and interoperability with qualified certificates for website authentication issued in full compliance with the requirement of this Regulation.</blockquote><p>Again, pressing this idea of a list of Trusted Root CAs that the client vendors must accept and "should not deny the authenticity of". Then, with regards to limiting the ability of a Root Store Operator to audit the behaviour of a Trusted Root CA on an ongoing basis:</p><blockquote>In order to contribute to the online security of end-users, providers of web-browsers should be able to take measures, in exceptional circumstances, that are both necessary and proportionate in reaction to substantiated concerns on breaches of security or loss of integrity of an identified certificate or set of certificates. In this case, while taking any such precautionary measures, web browsers should notify without undue delay the national supervisory body and the Commission, the entity to whom the certificate was issued and the qualified trust service provider that issued that certificate or set of certificates of any such concern of a security breach as well as the measures taken relating to a single certificate or a set of certificates. These measures, should be without prejudice to the obligation of the browsers to recognize qualified website authentication certificates in accordance with the national trusted lists.</blockquote><p>Then, just to make sure we don't have any tremendously beneficial technologies like <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/tag/certificate-transparency/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">Certificate Transparency</a> protecting us, it is clarified that:</p><blockquote>Qualified certificates for website authentication shall not be subject to any mandatory requirements other than the requirements laid down in paragraph 1.</blockquote><p>Paragraph 1, of course, does not make any mention of Certificate Transparency. All of these points are then summarised in a newly added section with the title "Cybersecurity precautionary measures": </p><blockquote>1. Web-browsers shall not take any measures contrary to their obligations set out in Art 45, notably the requirement to recognise Qualified Certificates for Web Authentication, and to display the identity data provided in a user friendly manner.</blockquote><blockquote>2. By way of derogation to paragraph 1 and only in case of substantiated concerns related to breaches of security or loss of integrity of an identified certificate or set of certificates, web-browsers may take precautionary measures in relation to that certificate or set of certificates</blockquote><blockquote>3. Where measures are taken, web-browsers shall notify their concerns in writing without undue delay, jointly with a description of the measures taken to mitigate those concerns, to the Commission, the competent supervisory authority, the entity to whom the certificate was issued and to the qualified trust service provider that issued that certificate or set of certificates. Upon receipt of such a notification, the competent supervisory authority shall issue an acknowledgement of receipt to the web-browser in question.</blockquote><blockquote>4. The competent supervisory authority shall consider the issues raised in the notification in accordance with Article 17(3)(c). When the outcome of that investigation does not result in the withdrawal of the qualified status of the certificate(s), the supervisory authority shall inform the web-browser accordingly and request it to put an end to the precautionary measures referred to in paragraph 2.</blockquote><h4 id="the-industry-speaks-out">The industry speaks out</h4><p>It's not just me that thinks this is a bad idea though, of course, I'm just adding my voice to the chorus of other voices from across industry.</p><ol><li>Mozilla set up the <a href="https://securityriskahead.eu/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">Security Risk Ahead</a> website with lots of details.</li><li>The Chrome Security Team has called for change in <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/11/qualified-certificates-with-qualified.html?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">Qualified certificates with qualified risks</a>.</li><li>You can head over to <a href="https://last-chance-for-eidas.org/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk">https://last-chance-for-eidas.org/</a> to read more about the risks.</li><li>You can read our latest open letter with 400+ signatures so far. <a href="https://eidas-open-letter.org/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk">https://eidas-open-letter.org/</a></li></ol><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2023/11/zU7C5hOn_400x400.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="400"></figure><p>The thing that it will always come down to for me, and the thing that you can use to guide your decisions, is to look at the interests of the parties involved. I've long been critical of many CAs for shitty marketing and shady practises, and it seems that's continuing. The organisations and voices speaking out in support of QWACs and Article 45 are those that are going to be able to sell them for $$$ once this comes to pass. The organisations and voices speaking out against QWACs and Article 45 are those with an interest in preserving and improving the security of the ecosystem we've worked so hard to build.

At the center of it all, instead of their customary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arri_Alexa">Arri Alexa</a> (a digital cinema camera costing $35–150K before you even add a lens, used to shoot everything from <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> to <em>Barbie),</em> was an off-the-shelf iPhone 15 Pro Max, gripped into truckloads of professional support gear.</p></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;thumbnailUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V3dbG9pAi8I/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:854,&quot;height&quot;:480,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<iframe class=\&quot;embedly-embed\&quot; src=\&quot;//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FV3dbG9pAi8I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV3dbG9pAi8I&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FV3dbG9pAi8I%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=61d05c9d54e8455ea7a9677c366be814&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\&quot; width=\&quot;854\&quot; height=\&quot;480\&quot; scrolling=\&quot;no\&quot; title=\&quot;YouTube embed\&quot; frameborder=\&quot;0\&quot; allow=\&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;\&quot; allowfullscreen=\&quot;true\&quot;></iframe>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/V3dbG9pAi8I&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;YouTube&quot;,&quot;customThumbEnabled&quot;:false}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1699312008488_9068"><p>

</p></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1699312008488_9121"><p>At this point, some folks felt differently about what was implied by “Shot on iPhone.” There have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/31/23940060/apple-event-shot-on-iphone-behind-the-scenes">bad takes</a> on this, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/downplaying-shot-on-iphone">good</a><a href="https://joe-steel.com/2023-11-01-Videography-For-Dummies.html">takes</a> on those bad takes.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows the tiniest bit about video production knows that the camera is a small, but important, but <em>small,</em> part of the overall production picture. “Shot on iPhone” doesn’t promise “and you can do it too” any more than Stanley Kubrick lighting <em>Barry Lyndon</em> with <a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5059-kubrick-s-candle-tricks-in-barry-lyndon">candlelight</a> means anyone with candles can make <em>Barry Lyndon.</em></p>
<p>But when the camera is the least expensive piece of gear on the set after clothespins and coffee, it does feel strange. I’ve been on a lot of productions like this, having played an active role in the DV filmmaking revolution of the late ’90s-to-early-2000s. It was an odd feeling to scrounge for the adapter plates required to mount a $3,000 DV camcorder purchased at Circuit City to a Fisher dolly that literally has no purchase price.</p>
<p>Apple, of course, has no burden of best-practices logic for their decision to shoot their “Scary Fast” event on iPhone — it’s a marketing ploy, a cool stunt, and a massive flex. A thing to do for its own sake. In the filmmaking community, it was the mic drop of the year. We greedily soaked up all the details in the behind-the-scenes video, and made a hundred tiny calculations about which aspects of this lavish production actually mattered to the question of the iPhone 15’s validity as a professional camera, and which did not.</p>
<p>With all that gear and production support, which aspects of the event really matter to you, the iPhone-curious filmmaker? What can you learn, and which aspects can you safely ignore?</p>
<p>Let’s take it one at a time:</p>
<h2 id="that-they-did-it-does-matter">That They Did It: Does Matter</h2>
<p>As camera features have played a larger and larger role in Apple’s marketing for new iPhones over the years, you might have begun to feel a bit of cognitive dissonance. Apple tells you about how great, and even “pro,” these new iPhone cameras are — but would never have dreamt of using them to shoot their own videos or product stills. Apple was effectively saying “pro enough for you, but not for us.” Valid, but a bit dissatisfying.</p>

    </div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1699312008488_19960"><p>Apple has set the aesthetic bar impossibly high with these pre-recorded events. They’re not just executives teleprompting in front of Keynote slides — they feature “slice of life” moments shot on huge sets and real locations. Elaborate visual effects transition between locations and settings that might be partially virtual. These videos have looked great ever since Covid pushed Apple to find an alternative to executives-on-stage-in-front-of-slides, and even as Apple is now once again able to welcome guests to in-person product launches, these lavishly-produced videos are the new gold standard in pitching the world on a new iThing.</p>
<p>With “Scary Fast,” Apple repeated their now well-established high-production-value playbook, but yoinked out the professional cameras and lenses, and dropped in a commodity consumer telephone in their place.</p>
<p>And crucially, <em>none of us noticed.</em></p>
<p>It’s a big deal.</p>
<h2 id="they-shot-prores-log-matters-so-much-it-would-be-impossible-without-it">They Shot ProRes Log: Matters So Much It Would Be Impossible Without It</h2>
<p>There is one single feature of the iPhone 15 Pro that made this stunt possible: Log. As I detailed <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">here in words and video</a>, the “iPhone video look” is designed to win consumer popularity contests, not mimic Apple's own marketing videos, nor plug into professional workflows.</p>
<p>It may be hard to imagine that a slightly different bit of signal processing when recording a video file from a tiny sensor can make the difference between consumer birthday-cam and professional viability, bit that is exactly the power of log. Apple Log has catapulted the iPhone into filmmaking legitimacy.</p>

<h2 id="they-used-big-lights-does-matter-with-an-asterisk">They Used Big Lights: Does Matter, With An Asterisk</h2>
<p>Apple’s event was set at night, with a dark, Halloween-inspired look. It takes a lot of professional lighting gear to illuminate a wide shot of Apple’s campus, and professional skill to balance this lighting with the practical sources on the building itself.</p>

<p>Photos are nothing but light — it’s literally all they are made of. Timmy’s birthday and Sally’s wedding are reduced to nothing but photons before they become photographs. So getting the light right is more meaningful to a photo than anything else.</p>
</blockquote><p>Should you look at the giant lights in Apple’s video and feel dejected that your own productions will never afford this level of illumination? I say no, because a) you’re probably not lighting up the whole side of an architectural marvel, and b) you’re probably not designing your production around one of the world’s highest-paid CEOs.</p><p>For Tim Cook’s appearance, Apple’s production had their giant LED light panels on camera dollies, which is not typical. The two reasons I can image they did this are to be low-impact on the campus itself (rubber wheels instead of metal stands), and to be able to adjust the lighting quickly out of respect for Cook’s valuable time. It makes the lighting rigs seem more complex than they really are.</p><p>What they really are is big, bright, and soft. And rather spare — mostly key, a bit of fill.</p><p>Big, soft LED lighting is actually quite affordable these days. I have two <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1560654-REG/aputure_light_storm_ls_60x.html/BI/4778/KBID/5292">medium-power bi-color lights from Aputure</a>, and together they cost less than my iPhone 15 Pro Max.

<p>You do not need any of this stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, every filmmaker <em>needs</em> a crane shot — but this is why small cameras are so empowering: everything is a crane when your camera weighs less than a Panavision lens cap!</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/OnS5sLclqqY">this video</a> from filmmaker Brandon Li. He uses a gimbal on a hand-held pole to create a perfect crane shot for the opening of his action short. Toward the end, he achieves a nifty top-down shot by... standing on a railing. All with a camera substantially more cumbersome than a phone.</p>

As Tyler Stalman points out in his <a href="https://youtu.be/lDqQ_C5BkY4">excellent breakdown video</a>, some of what’s bolted to the iPhones is simply a metal counterweight so that a gimbal head, designed for a much larger camera, can be properly balanced.</p>
<p>You can plug an external drive into the USB-C slot on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, or you can plug in an HDMI adapter for a clean client feed. If you want to do both, you need a USB-C hub, which at that point requires power. So now you’ve got an Anton-Bauer battery pack mounted to this tangle of gear.</p>
<p>When you don’t have clients, you can skip all that and just shoot. This means you can replace most of the gear you see here with a <a href="https://amzn.to/3stXw46">cheap consumer gimbal</a> — or a tripod.</p>
<p>And here’s the key takeaway for this point: Apple achieved optimal image quality from the iPhone in a number of ways, and one, I’m betting, was by turning off image stabilization — which is only advisable when this tiny camera is physically stabilized.</p>
<p>So you don’t need all the stuff Apple used, but if you want comparable results, you need a way to mount your iPhone to something solid. Maybe not a whole powered cage, but certainly a simple tripod mount. Then you can eek out that last bit of extra image quality by turning off image stabilization — which brings us to our next point:</p>

</div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1699314604996_101663"><p>One slick feature of the Blackmagic Camera App is that you can choose to express the shutter speed in degrees, like a cinema camera, rather than fractions of a second, which is more typical in stills. A 180º shutter — where the shutter is open for half the duration of a single frame, e.g. 1/60th of a second at 30 fps — is important for a pro look. Anything slower and you get smeary blur and a camcorder look. Anything faster and your footage looks like you shot it on a phone, because 99% of the time our iPhones are using insanely fast shutter speeds to handle typical daylight. Look at any of your own daytime iPhone video — I’d be surprised if you see any motion blur at all.</p></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;blockAnimation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;caption-below&quot;,&quot;overlay&quot;:false,&quot;description&quot;:{&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p class=\&quot;\&quot; style=\&quot;white-space:pre-wrap;\&quot;>Compare Apple\u2019s motion blur to mine. 180\u00BA shutter vs. probably something more like 1\u00BA.</p>&quot;},&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;isOldBlock&quot;:false,&quot;settings&quot;:{&quot;muted&quot;:true,&quot;autoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;loop&quot;:true,&quot;controls&quot;:&quot;none&quot;},&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;native&quot;,&quot;nativeVideo&quot;:&quot;6549811d14cf17486eb7fe30&quot;}" data-block-type="32" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1699314604996_106232"><p>Compare Apple’s motion blur to mine. 180º shutter vs. probably something more like 1º.</p></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1699314604996_106282"><p>Relatedly:</p>
<h2 id="they-shot-at-iso-55-matters-to-apple-s-goal-of-maximum-image-quality">They Shot at ISO 55: Matters to Apple’s Goal of Maximum Image Quality</h2>
<p>Here’s where the level of professional control over the lighting starts to really matter: If Apple decided that they must shoot at ISO 55 (the lowest, although possibly not the <em>native</em> ISO of the 1x camera) for the highest image quality, and with a 180º shutter for the most pro-camera look, that means they have no other control over exposure. The iPhone 15 Pro 1x lens does not have a variable aperture, so shutter speed and ISO are your only exposure controls.</p>
<p>When shooting in uncontrolled environments, the typical method of limiting the amount of light entering the lens is via ND filters, sometimes <em>variable</em> ND filters. I don’t see any evidence that Apple used filters on this shoot, which would fit with their overall prioritization of image quality over all else. So this goes back to lighting — Apple’s team controlled that lighting perfectly, because they opted out of any exposure control they might have had in-camera.</p>
<p>I'm curious to learn more about this setting though. YouTubers Gerald Undone and Patrick Tomasso <a href="https://youtu.be/RNd74wyVtKw">did some tests</a> and found that the best dynamic range from the iPhone 15 Pro came from ISO 1100–1450, with 1250 being their recommended sweet spot. Did Apple prioritize low noise over dynamic range?</p>
<h2 id="they-shot-30p-doesn-t-matter">They shot 30p: Doesn’t Matter</h2>
<p>Apple has used 30 frames-per-second for these pre-recorded keynotes since they started in September of 2020. They’re not trying to be “cinematic,” they’re trying to make a nice, clean video that can take the place of a live event. 30p is a choice, and a fine one for an on-stage presentation. You might choose 24 or 25 fps for a more narrative look, and that’s great too.</p>
<p>Note that Apple’s native Camera app offers 30.0 and 24.0 fps, but the Blackmagic Camera app adds support for 29.97 and 23.976 fps, which are the actual broadcast frame rates Apple uses for their productions.</p>
<h2 id="they-focused-manually-doesn-t-matter">They Focused Manually: Doesn’t Matter</h2>
<p>The Blackmagic Camera app truly has a dizzying set of features, some seemingly part of an attempt to win some kind of bizarre bet. Like support for wireless external follow-focus controls? I mean, wow, but also, really?</p>
<p>Sure makes for a cool behind-the-scenes shot, but I bet you can live without this.</p>

Did Apple <em>really</em> edit in Premiere?</p>
<p>I have a feeling that Stefan Sonnenfeld’s interview was also staged at Apple’s campus rather than filmed on-location at Company 3, to keep the production close to home for cost, control, and secrecy reasons. So let’s assume Apple really did cut in Premiere. This means next to nothing. All editing software does the same job, and it’s unlikely Apple would impose a workflow on the production company they hired to both shoot and post-produce the video.</p>
<p>Other than of course to ensure that it be cut on a Mac. It’s interesting to note that Apple’s Pro Workflows Group, representatives from which are interviewed in the behind-the-scenes video, are a part of the hardware division at Apple. Their charter is to promote and support professional use of Apple <em>devices,</em> regardless of which software they’re running.</p>
<p>Should FCPX users be <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/02/tobin-bts-scary-fast">nervous</a> that Apple might send it to live on a farm with Shake and Aperture? It’s hard to regain our trust here, but Apple did just release a very nice version for iPad a few months ago, and <a href="https://www.polarpro.com/products/iphone-15-case?variant=iPhone15ProForest">substantial updates</a> to that and the Mac version just yesterday.</p>
<p>So there’s really nothing to see here. Move along.</p>
<h2 id="they-colored-in-resolve-doesn-t-matter">They Colored in Resolve: Doesn’t Matter</h2>
<p>Apple hired <a href="https://www.company3.com/">Company 3</a> to produce this video. Company 3 is best-known as a color house. In my VFX and commercial directing career. I’ve worked with several amazing colorists there, from Dave Hussey to Siggy Ferstl to their CEO, Stefan Sonnenfeld, who is prominently featured in the behind-the-scenes. Stephan is one of the most prolific, talented, and well-known colorists working today. I modeled half the presets in Magic Bullet Looks after his famous grades on films like <em>Transformers, 300, John Wick, Man on Fire,</em> and hundreds more.</p>

<p>Whether you use Resolve, Magic Bullet, or whatever else, what matters here is that shooting log means color grading is not just possible, but essential, and great care was taken with this part of the process.</p>
<h2 id="this-all-makes-sense-why-do-i-still-feel-weird-about-it-">This All Makes Sense. Why Do I Still Feel Weird About it?</h2>
<p>As much as I might disagree with an accusation that Apple was disingenuous to say “Shot on iPhone” about a massive production with seemingly unlimited resources, I understand where this feeling comes from. “Shot on iPhone” carries with it the implication of accessibility. We are meant to be inspired by this phrase to use a tool that we already carry with us every day to capture videos that might transcend mere records of our life’s moments, and become part of our artistic pursuits.</p>
<p>And we should absolutely feel that way about the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.</p>
<p>The reason we feel slightly disconnected from Apple’s impressive exercise is not that they were dishonest — it's that their priorities were different from ours. Apple wants to sell iPhones, and to accomplish this, they spared no expense to put the very highest image quality on the screen.</p>
<h4 id="as-a-filmmaker-you-care-about-image-quality-but-you-care-about-other-things-too-probably-more-">As a filmmaker, you care about image quality, but you care about other things too — probably more.</h4>
<p>Sticking to the 1x lens gives the best image quality, sure, but choosing the right lens for the story you’re telling might matter more to a filmmaker. You’ll probably use all the focal lengths Apple supplied.</p>
<p>As much as you might value the clean image that comes from shooting at ISO 55, you might get more production value for your budget by using smaller lights (or available light!) and accepting some noise at higher ISOs.</p>
<p>You might truly appreciate the value of a 180º shutter, and simply not always have a camera case/cage that allows you to mount a variable ND filter to your telephone. I ordered one from <a href="https://proloststore.com/products/applelog">PolarPro</a> the day the iPhone 15 was released and it still hasn’t shipped, so I’ve shot next to no 180º shutter footage so far.</p>
<p>You might well understand that turning off image stabilization will improve your image — unless your shot is now wobbly, because you’re shooting handheld out the window of a moving car. So maybe you’ll leave stabilization on, and be a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZaekQujG3T/">human crane</a>, or gimbal, or dolly, or all of the above.</p>

<li>Use lights. Not crazy lights, but some.</li>

<p>
Ever since I was a teenager I wanted to create my own systems programming
language. Such a programming language would certainly
have to be compiled to native code, which meant I'd have to write a compiler.
</p><p>
Even though I managed to write several half-working parsers, I'd always
fail at the stage of generating assembly code, as the task turned too complex.
</p><p>
In this blog I intend to show my teenage self how writing a code generator is, in fact, not
complex at all, and it can be fully done in a couple of weekends. (As long as we
make some simplifying assumptions)
</p>
 <blockquote>I will that assume you already know that <a href="https://sebmestre.blogspot.com/2023/11/en-representing-programs-within.html">representing programs within a
   program is surprisingly easy</a>
</blockquote>
<h2>Where do we even start?</h2>
<p>
The goal today is to translate a high level language to x86-64 machine code. Our
high-level language will have integer literals, variables, negation, and
addition.
</p><p>
To make our job simpler, we will translate the high level code to x86-64
assembly code, and use a pre-existing assembler (like the one inside GCC) to
translate that to machine code.
</p><p>
Let's get started. Here is how we will represent integer literals:
</p>
<pre>struct int_literal {
	int value;
};
</pre>
<p>
Compiling them is straightforward:
</p>
<pre>void compile_int_literal(struct int_literal* e) {
	printf("mov $%d, %%rax\n", e-&gt;value);
}
</pre>

<blockquote><code>printf</code> uses the <code>%</code> character to denote formatting commands, so a double <code>%%</code> is used to print the character verbatim.</blockquote>
<p>
Here I used the x86-64 <code>mov</code> instruction. This instruction moves data from one
place to another. In the notation used in this blog, the flow of data is
  left-to-right (i.e. the instruction is works as <code>mov source, destination</code>)
</p><p>
In this case we are moving an immediate value (a numeric constant written
directly in the code, notated with a <code>$</code> preceding it) into the "a" register (a
little space of data that lives directly inside the CPU, written as <code>%rax</code>)
</p>
<p>
The x86-64 <code>mov</code> instruction can be used in several ways ("addressing modes"):
immediate-to-register (the one we just used), register-to-memory, memory-to-register,
register-to-register, etc. We will see some of these later on.
</p><p>
I want to note that, at this point, many design decisions have already been made.
Most notably:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our compiler will output AT&amp;T-style assembly code to <code>stdout</code>, using <code>printf</code></li>
<li>The result of compiling an expression will be assembly code that computes and
  stores the value of that expression in <code>%rax</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
The last point is in no small part responsible for making the compiler so
simple, but it also means that the code we'll generate is not very efficient.
</p><p>
For the initiated, some obvious things that we could add to mitigate this are a
peephole optimizer and a register allocator. But these would force us to
implement some intermediate representation and make our compiler a lot more
complicated, so we are not going to.
</p><p>
Let's move on.
</p>
<h2>How can we implement variables?</h2>
<p>
The way we will represent variables in our compiler is with an integer. Yes, not
with a string that corresponds to the name of the variable, but an index that
represents where that variable will live in memory. Indeed, all variables will
be stored in our computer's main memory. In particular, they will live in a
  place called <i>the stack</i>.
</p>

<p>
The stack is a wonderful mechanism that allows us to quickly store some values
in memory and safely discard them once we don't need them. In memory, it is
simply laid out like an array of 64 bit integers.
</p><p>
The way it works is extremely simple: the CPU has a register -- known as the
stack pointer <code>%rsp</code> -- that always tells us the first slot in the stack that is
available to be used. Every slot after will be free, and every slot before will
be occupied. As with everything low-level, this doesn't happen magically, and we
will be responsible for keeping that register up to date.
</p><p>
We are going to be a bit naughty and not update the stack pointer for now. This
is mostly okay as long as our code does not perform any function calls.
</p><p>
With this in mind, we can represent variables using an index that tells us how
many slots *after* the first available slot the variable is stored.
</p>

<pre>struct variable {
	int slot;
};
</pre>

<blockquote>In a more complete compiler there would be a previous step that takes care of
  assigning a stack slot to each declared variable, and translating variable names to stack
  slots. We wouldn't expect the language user to type in the slots by hand.</blockquote>
<p>
Compiling them is simple enough, but we do need to learn some more x86-64
assembly to fully grasp it.
</p>
<pre>void compile_variable(struct variable* e) {
	int slot = e-&gt;slot;
	printf("mov %d(%%rsp), %%rax\n", -8 * (slot + 1));
}
</pre>
<p>
Here we use a different version of the <code>mov</code> instruction. This one looks like
<code>mov number(register1), register2</code>, and it means "take the value at address
<code>number+register1</code>, and store it in <code>register2</code>". (mem-to-reg mode)
</p><p>
This is how we implement access into the stack. The stack pointer holds the
address of the first free slot, and we add an offset to to access the slot that
holds the desired variable.
</p><p>
Besides that, there is a funny looking bit of math up there. There are two
things to know about the stack:
</p>
<ul>
<li>each slot holds a 64-bit value. This equals 8 bytes, which is why we multiply
  by 8</li>
<li>the stack grows downwards. This means that the occupied slots are at higher
  addresses than the free slots. This explains why the 8 is negative instead of
  positive</li>
<li>there is a +1 in there because I lied. The stack pointer actually points at the last
  occupied slot, instead of the first free slot.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Negation</h2>
<p>
The representation of negation is similarly straightforward, and should be
apparent to those who read the previous blog.
</p>
<pre>struct negation {
	struct expression* target;
};
</pre>

<blockquote>I will omit the definition of <code>struct expression</code> for now, as it would
distract from the main points of this section.</blockquote>
<p>
To compile negations we will take advantage of the fact that compiling an
expression will produce code that stores its result in <code>%rax</code>. This means that
if we emit some code that negates <code>%rax</code> right after the code that computes the
value to be negated, we will have succesfully computed the desired negation.
</p><p>
Luckily, x86-64 has an instruction that does just this.
</p>
<pre>void compile_negation(struct negation* e) {
	compile_expression(e-&gt;target);
	printf("neg %%rax\n");
}
</pre>
<p>
But just to get used to the kind of puzzles we have to solve to compile some
more complicated operations, let's avoid using <code>neg</code>. x86-64 has a <code>sub</code>
instruction that subtracts one operand from another. Let's try using that.
</p><p>
In particular, let's:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>compute the target expression (leaving the result in <code>%rax</code>)</li>
  <li>put a zero into <code>%rcx</code></li>
  <li>substract <code>%rax</code> from <code>%rcx</code> (leaving the negated result in <code>%rcx</code>)</li>
  <li>put the negated result in <code>%rax</code></li>
</ul>
<pre>void compile_negation(struct negation* e) {
	compile_expression(e-&gt;target);
	printf("mov $0, %%rcx\n");
	printf("sub %%rax, %%rcx\n");
	printf("mov %%rcx, %%rax\n");
}
</pre>
<blockquote><p>
We use <code>%rcx</code> instead of <code>%rbx</code> because <code>%rbx</code> is a callee-saved register in
x86-64, meaning we are not allowed to use it without first storing its old
content in the stack, and later restoring its value. This is mandated by the x86-64 calling conventions.
</p><p>
This is too cumbersome, so we just use the nearest non-callee-saved register.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
While not too complicated, this ilustrates the kind of hoops we will sometimes
have to jump through in order to compile more advanced operations. I don't think
this makes compiling hard, but it can get pretty tedious.
</p>
<blockquote>Also, note the use of the reg-to-reg addressing mode</blockquote>

<h2>Addition</h2>
<p>
Like in the previous blog, we will represent additions as follows:
</p>
<pre>struct addition {
	struct expression* left_term;
	struct expression* right_term;
};
</pre>
<p>
The general idea here will be to first compile the left term, then the right
term, then emit an <code>add</code> instruction that adds their results. The main problem
that arises is that the result of the the left term will be lost while we
compute the right term.
</p><p>
A simple fix might be to move the result to a different register, like this:
</p>
<pre>void compile_addition(struct addition* e) {
	compile_expression(e-&gt;left_term);
	printf("mov %%rax, %%rcx\n");
	compile_expression(e-&gt;right_term);
	printf("add %%%rcx, %%rax\n");
}
</pre>


  
<p>
Unfortunately, this will not work when the right term also stores something in
<code>%rcx</code> in an intermediate step. Instead, we will get some help from to our good
friend, the stack.
</p><p>
We will store that intermediate value in the stack, and read it back after the
right term is done computing. If we take care that the code we generate for the
right term doesn't write into the same stack slot, then we can be sure that the
value will be preserved.
</p><p>
The mechanism to prevent re-using the same stack slot is a simple counter. Since
we also store variables in the stack, its value must be greater than any slot
that's been assigned to a variable. For now let's just initialize it with some
large number, like 10.
</p>
<pre>int temp_counter = 10;
void compile_addition(struct addition* e) {
	compile_expression(e-&gt;left_term);
	int slot = temp_counter++; // allocate a new slot
	printf("mov %%rax, %d(%%rsp)\n", -8 * (slot + 1));
	compile_expression(e-&gt;right_term);
	printf("add %d(%%rsp), %%rax\n", -8 * (slot + 1));
	temp_counter--; // restore the counter
}
</pre>

<blockquote>Here we finally see a <code>mov</code> that uses reg-to-mem addressing mode. Also, note that <code>add</code>
can also use mem-to-reg mode.
</blockquote>
<h2>Putting it All Together</h2>
<p>
The final piece of the puzzle, for now, is the <code>struct expression</code> data type,
and its corresponding <code>compile_expression</code> function. These are pretty much
trivial given what we've seen so far, but I'll type them out for completeness'
sake.
</p>
<pre>enum expression_tag {
	EXPRESSION_INT_LITERAL,
	EXPRESSION_VARIABLE,
	EXPRESSION_NEGATION,
	EXPRESSION_ADDITION,
};
struct expression {
	enum expression_tag tag;
	union {
		struct int_literal as_int_literal;
		struct variable as_variable;
		struct negation as_negation;
		struct addition as_addition;
	};
};

void compile_expression(struct expression* e) {
	switch (e-&gt;tag) {
	case EXPRESSION_INT_LITERAL:
		compile_int_literal(&amp;e-&gt;as_int_literal);
		break;
	case EXPRESSION_VARIABLE:
		compile_variable(&amp;e-&gt;as_variable);
		break;
	case EXPRESSION_NEGATION:
		compile_negation(&amp;e-&gt;as_negation);
		break;
	case EXPRESSION_ADDITION:
		compile_addition(&amp;e-&gt;as_addition);
		break;
	}
}
</pre>

<h2>Testing it out</h2>
<p>
At this point, we are capable of compiling simple arithmetic expressions. To
test this out, we can write a small program like this one:
</p>
<pre>int main() {
	// var0 + (-var1 + 42)
	struct expression* e =
		addition(
			variable(0),
			addition(
				negation(variable(1)),
				int_literal(42)));
	compile_expression(e);
}
</pre>

<blockquote><code>int_literal</code>, <code>variable</code>, <code>negation</code> and <code>addition</code> are some helpers that
build up the corresponding expressions.</blockquote>
<p>
Which produces the following output:
</p>
<pre>mov -8(%rsp), %rax
mov %rax, -88(%rsp)
mov -16(%rsp), %rax
neg %rax
mov %rax, -96(%rsp)
mov $42, %rax
add -96(%rsp), %rax
add -88(%rsp), %rax
</pre>

<p>
Then, to be able to run it, we can just add some assembly that will take two
arguments and store them in stack slots 0 and 1, and return after executing the
code.
</p>
<pre>.global foo
foo:
	mov %rdi, -8(%rsp)
	mov %rsi, -16(%rsp)

	mov -8(%rsp), %rax
	mov %rax, -88(%rsp)
	mov -16(%rsp), %rax
	neg %rax
	mov %rax, -96(%rsp)
	mov $42, %rax
	add -96(%rsp), %rax
	add -88(%rsp), %rax

	ret
</pre>

<p>
Finally, we hook into this code from C, and check that it returns the right thing:
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
int64_t foo(int64_t a, int64_t b);
int main() {
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
		for (int j = 0; j &lt; 10; ++j) {
			printf("expected: %d, got: %ld\n", i-j+42, foo(i, j));
		}
	}
}
</pre>

<p>
To do this we compile using GCC and run it in a terminal:
</p>
<pre>$ gcc main.c foo.s -o main
$ ./main
expected: 42, got: 42
expected: 41, got: 41
expected: 40, got: 40
... and so on ...
</pre>

<h2> Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Writing a compiler is not as hard as it seems if we are willing to keep it
simple. If we avoid introducing complexity ourselves, its main source is
understanding the target architecture, and not the compilation process itself.
</p><p>
In the next parts we will look at how to compile classic control flow constructs
such as <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>, as well as function calls and pointers.
