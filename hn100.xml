     It has been my privilege to chair this committee of distinguished subject-matter experts in its investigation
and final probable cause determination of one of the most publicized and baffling failures of the modern era. It
became clear shortly after the Arecibo Telescopeâs collapse that the zinc used to anchor the steel supporting cable
wires into their sockets had allowed the failed cables to slip out of their sockets, known as spelter sockets. The
sockets slowly lost their grip on a critical number of the cable wires via slow zinc âcreep,â a process where the
zinc deformed slowly at a load below half the socketâs nominal strength. Although the committee agrees with
the conclusions from other forensic reports regarding zinc creep at the connection being the failure mechanism,
the baffling question was, âWhy was there excessive zinc creep at such loading?â Such a failure had never been
reported previously in over a century of widespread zinc spelter socket successful use.
     Fortunately, the committee had the benefit of the detailed analysis and well-documented reports from NASA;
Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.; and Thornton Tomasetti, Inc., without which it could not have completed its
task. Building on their work, the committee presents a clear and plausible explanation of why the telescopeâs sockets
failed when no such sockets have ever been reported to have failed before. Unfortunately, there was not enough
data available to prove our explanation. It is simply the most plausible hypothesis based on the data we do have.
     Without the depth and breadth of expertise on the committee, its task would remain uncompleted. I think I
speak for everyone on the committee when I say that none of us could have done this alone. I want to thank my
colleagues for their unwavering dedication to the task. Their professionalism and competence made my job an
enjoyable one.

                                                                                     Roger L. McCarthy, Chair
                                                        Committee on Analysis of Causes of Failure and Collapse
                                                          of the 305-Meter Telescope at the Arecibo Observatory

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Age-related brain atrophy, the gradual loss of neurons and shrinkage of brain tissue, is a natural part of aging, which can lead to cognitive decline and other neurological issues. While so far aging cannot be prevented, recent research from an 18-month dietary intervention offers hope that lifestyle and dietary changes can slow brain aging. A new international study, led by Ben-Gurion University of the Negev as part of the DIRECT PLUS Brain MRI trial, has brought to light how blood sugar control can significantly impact brain health.</p><p>Brain age, as evaluated by MRI measurements of the hippocampus and lateral ventricles, reflects the biological aging of the brain, which can differ from a person's chronological age. Chronological age is the number of years lived, while brain age indicates the brain's actual health. Typically, as we age, the hippocampus shrinks and the lateral ventricles expand, serving as markers of brain aging. Some individuals have a brain age younger or older than their chronological age. A younger brain age suggests better cognitive health, while an older brain age may indicate accelerated aging and increased risk of cognitive decline.</p><p>The study, which was published recently in <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916524007457" target="_blank"><em>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2024</em></a>, was conducted by an international team of brain and nutrition experts, including researchers from Ben-Gurion University, Harvard University, Leipzig University, and more. The research was primarily carried out by PhD student Dafna Pachter and overseen by Prof. Iris Shai, along with several international collaborators.</p><p>A previous study published two years ago (<a rel="noopener" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35021194/" target="_blank"><em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2022 </em></a><em>)</em>, reported that Mediterranean (MED) and green-MED diets significantly attenuated age-related brain atrophy by ∼50% within 18 months.</p><p>In the current study, the researchers aimed to understand the mechanism by which the slowing of brain atrophy occurs.</p><p>The study found that a decline in HbA1c, and key markers of long-term blood sugar levels, are associated with significant positive changes in specific brain regions commonly affected by age-related atrophy. Brain MRI results showed that lower HbA1c levels corresponded to greater deviations in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum – areas crucial for cognitive function, motor control, and sensory processing. The study suggests that improved blood sugar control could be one of the most important factors in slowing down age-related brain changes.</p><p><strong>The Green Mediterranean Diet Shows Promise</strong></p><p>Earlier research has highlighted the benefits of the Green Mediterranean (Green-Med) diet, including better blood sugar control. The Green-Med diet is rich in polyphenols from plant-based sources like Mankai (a high-protein aquatic plant) and green tea, while being low in red and processed meats. The current study further strengthens this connection by suggesting that the Green-Med diet may not only support metabolic health but also exert protective effects on brain structure and function.</p><p><strong>DIRECT PLUS Trial – One of the Largest Brain MRI intervention Studies in the World</strong></p><p>The DIRECT PLUS trial, one of the longest and largest brain MRI studies conducted to date, involved approximately 300 participants who were divided into three dietary groups. Whole-brain MRI measurements were taken before and after the 18-month trial to track changes in brain health. The researchers used Hippocampal Occupancy (HOC), as a proxy for brain age which predicts future risk of dementia. HOC typically decreases with age. Interestingly, some participants exhibited a brain age either younger or older than their chronological age.</p><p>Using NeuroQuant, an FDA-authorized fully automated tool, the research team quantified and segmented the brain MRI-derived data. The study aimed to examine whether improved glycemic control and specific dietary components could slow down brain aging. The results indicated that participants who managed to improve their blood sugar levels and achieve normal glucose status experienced a more pronounced attenuation of brain aging. Notably, those who consumed higher amounts of green tea and Mankai duckweed shakes demonstrated the most significant improvements in both blood sugar levels and brain health.</p><figure><img src="https://www.bgu.ac.il/media/raeewflp/iris_shai_ip.jpg" alt="" data-caption="Prof. Iris Shai | Photo: Dani Machlis"><figcaption>Prof. Iris Shai | Photo: Dani Machlis</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Glycemic Control and Polyphenols: The Key to a</strong><strong> Younger Brain Age?</strong></p><p>The study’s lead researcher, Prof. Iris Shai, from Ben-Gurion University, an adjunct professor at Harvard University, and an Honorary Professor at Leipzig University, explains, “Maintaining low blood sugar levels, even within the normal range, shows promise for preserving a younger brain, especially when combined with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Specifically, polyphenols found in plant-based foods may cross the blood-brain barrier and help reduce brain inflammation, which is crucial for memory”.</p><figure><img src="https://www.bgu.ac.il/media/jkiddbja/dafna-pachter-ip.jpg" alt="" data-caption="Dafna Pachter | Photo: Courtesy"><figcaption>Dafna Pachter | Photo: Courtesy</figcaption></figure><p>Dafna Pachter, a PhD student and the first author of the paper, adds, "This trial offers a safe approach to potentially slow down our brain aging—by adopting the components of a green-Mediterranean diet."</p><p><strong>A Pathway to Reducing Age-Related Cognitive Decline</strong></p><p>This study is one of the first large-scale trials to directly link dietary changes, particularly those associated with the Green-Med diet, to improved glycemic control and slower brain aging. While further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms at play, these results suggest a potential avenue for reducing the risk of age-related cognitive decline through relatively simple dietary adjustments.</p><p>The DIRECT PLUS trial was funded by grants from the German Research Foundation (DFG), Israel Ministry of Health, Israel Ministry of Science and Technology, and the California Walnuts Commission. None of the funding providers were involved in any stage of the design, conduct, or analysis of the study, nor did they have access to the study results before publication.</p><p>The researchers: Dafna&nbsp;Pachter,&nbsp;Alon&nbsp;Kaplan,&nbsp;Gal&nbsp;Tsaban,&nbsp;Hila&nbsp;Zelicha,&nbsp;Anat Yaskolka&nbsp;Meir,&nbsp;Ehud&nbsp;Rinott,&nbsp;Gidon&nbsp;Levakov,&nbsp;Moti&nbsp;Salti,&nbsp;Yoram&nbsp;Yovell,&nbsp;Sebastian&nbsp;Huhn,&nbsp;Frauke&nbsp;Beyer,&nbsp;Veronica&nbsp;Witte,&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Kovacs,&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;von Bergen,&nbsp;Uta&nbsp;Ceglarek,&nbsp;Matthias&nbsp;Blüher,&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Stumvoll,&nbsp;Frank B.&nbsp;Hu,&nbsp;Meir J.&nbsp;Stampfer,&nbsp;Alon&nbsp;Friedman,&nbsp;Ilan&nbsp;Shelef,&nbsp;Galia&nbsp;Avidan,&nbsp;and Iris&nbsp;Shai.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/programmer-in-berlin-culture/">https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/programmer-in-berlin-culture/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42049180">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <div> <p>This is part 4 of a <a href="https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/programmer-in-berlin/">5-part series</a> detailing what I wish I had known as an
American programmer moving to Berlin. This page details cultural differences and things I wasn’t aware of until I stumbled on them.</p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>One thing about Germany, and Europe in general, is that it’s relatively left-wing when
compared to the US. This is a
place where universal healthcare is so commonly accepted that no party – not even the
super-racist party! – is talking about removing it. The aforementioned super-racist
party has effectively the same political platform as the mainstream
Republican party in the US (minus the healthcare thing). Politics in Europe certainly has
its own problems, but at least in Germany there is a flourishing multi-party system that
allows for people to have some kind of choice when voting. There is even a fun website
called the “<a href="https://www.wahl-o-mat.de/"><em>Wahl-o-Mat</em></a>” (“Vote-o-Matic”) that tells you which party to vote
for after
answering a series of questions. There’s also none of the Electoral College
silliness, which I won’t get into here.</p>
<p>I think one weird aspect of living in Europe, or at least Germany, is that all the stuff
that US politicians told me were “too expensive” apparently aren’t!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gas prices are double or even triple what they are in the US. It’s ok, the economy isn’t
collapsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Universal healthcare with an individual mandate apparently works. It’s ok, the economy
isn’t collapsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trains, despite all the ineptness of Deutsche Bahn, are generally pretty good! For
many short-haul flights, such as Berlin to Munich, it’s actually quicker to go by
train than fly. It’s ok, the economy isn’t collapsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Germany you get significant paid maternity and paternity leave<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
It’s ok, the economy isn’t collapsing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, some cultural things that are deemed a “slippery slope” in
the US aren’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Promoting Nazism is banned. It’s not a slippery slope, and the country hasn’t devolved into
authoritarian groupthink. You just can’t publicly support Nazism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no right to firearms in the way there is in the US. You don’t really have
school shootings out here, and society seems to be ok? Nobody seems to want to band
together to make a militia. Nobody in Germany is like, “we need more guns to prevent
government overreach.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not saying it’s perfect, and there’s plenty of criticism to be given to German
politicians and the EU as a whole, but I personally think it’s a more fair way of
governance.</p>
<h2 id="the-eu">The EU</h2>
<p>What is ironic about the general left-leaningness of Europe is that the EU’s structure
is similar to
what the “states rights!” people want – a coalition of states with relatively strong
political power and identities, working inside a relatively weak federal framework to
handle cooperation and disagreement. There is no EU military and only partially-dominant
EU money, but there is a
common justice framework, freedom of movement and a single market. To my limited
understanding, the EU is like if the US had no federal military but every state had its
own strong military, and Oklahoma spoke a different language and had different money than
everyone else<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I am not qualified to give a good assessment of the EU as a political organization, other
than I am very glad they gave me a visa and I wish they would streamline visa application
and acceptance for more people. What I can comment on, however, is my impressions of
Europeans’ relationship with the EU itself.</p>
<p>I would say that most Americans identify as “American” in some way, while most Europeans
identify with a country inside the EU. A friend once commented that they didn’t “feel
European” (as opposed to the country they were from) and didn’t know what “typical
European stuff” would be (top on the list, as enumerated by Americans: cheese, bread, and
trains). I think this speaks to a relationship with the EU somewhere between how Americans
view the US government and how the Americans view the UN. Nobody says “I’m from the UN” or
“I’m from one of the United Nations” when asked where they’re from, and Americans view the
UN as an organization to be navigated and negotiated with as opposed to something they are
inherently
part of. The EU certainly has more influence over Europeans’ daily lives than the UN does,
but it’s not part of the daily conversation as much as the US government is to Americans.</p>
<p>Digging into that relationship a bit deeper, there is also a bit more skepticism of the EU
than I expected when moving here. Brexit made this pretty clear from the right-wing side,
but some on the left view the EU as some kind of banker’s club where Germany and France
get to tell smaller countries what to do. You can see this in the “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lexit">Lexit</a>” (crowd,
people
who wanted the UK to leave the EU so it could enact more socialist policies without being
hindered by the EU’s neoliberal slant. Another example is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis#Germany's_role_in_Greece">animosity countries had toward Germany after the eurozone crisis</a> – their
bailouts came attached with harsh
austerity requirements that were criticized as exploitative.</p>
<p>I personally think the EU is cool and wish it would remain a strong uniting force, but I
also can see how its incredible bureaucracy could be streamlined.</p>
<h2 id="crime">Crime</h2>
<p>I can’t speak to general crime rates, but in general Europe <em>feels</em> safer. The relative
lack of guns is refreshing, and (at least in Berlin) the crime centers around break-ins
and bike theft. I recall being in Copenhagen once, before I moved to Europe, and seeing a
woman walking by herself at 3 am. My first thought was concern for her safety, followed by
incredible shame in myself and my country – why did I think this was dangerous in the
first place? Of course, bad things happen all the time and I don’t want to claim Europe is
some kind of crime-free paradise, but it is striking how different it is compared to the
US.</p>
<h2 id="units">Units</h2>
<p>One small adjustment will be getting used to the metric system for everything. I recommend
not trying to do any conversions in your head and just see/feel the units themselves, but
occasionally having a reference point is useful.</p>
<p>Temperature: 0°C is water’s freezing point, 100°C is its boiling point. 37°C is a nominal
human body temperature. 16°C is light sweater weather, 20-22°C is a nice indoor
temperature depending on your preference, anything over 25°C is unpleasantly warm.</p>
<p>Weight: An average supermarket pineapple weighs roughly 1 kilogram! If you take away only
one fact from this article, let it be this one.</p>
<p>Distance: Meters are just yards, so that’s really easy. <em>Centimeters</em>, on the other hand,
are quite hard and I still don’t have a good feel for them. A kitchen planner once
laughed at me when I tried to mark 10 centimeters with my fingers. It’s a little
more than the
width of a credit card I guess? Around 4 inches? I also don’t have a good feel for
kilometers and can’t give many tips, sorry. A nice thing about miles is that people
roughly drive 60 miles per
hour over long distances, meaning a distance in miles roughly corresponds to how many minutes it will take to
drive there. Luckily people roughly drive 100km/h over long distances, meaning you can divide any distance
in kilometers by 100 and that’s roughly the number of hours it’ll take to drive there.</p>
<p>Volume: A cup is roughly 240mL, or 1/4L if you’re in a pinch. A gallon is roughly 4
liters. A liter is about half of a two-liter bottle<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, or roughly one quart.</p>
<p>A fun fact: one mL of water weighs one gram, which means one liter weighs one
kilogram. Pretty cool!</p>
<h2 id="washing">Washing</h2>
<p>Washing machines in Europe electrically heat their water, which means there is far more
precise temperature control than water taken from the building’s hot water supply. Instead
of “cold,” “warm” and “hot” you have 30°C, 40°C, and 60°C. Luckily clothing sold in Europe
tells you what temperature to wash it at on the tag.</p>
<p>Dryers are relatively uncommon in Germany, and most people hang their wash on a line to dry.
You can do this inside or outside, if the weather allows. Since fully soaked clothes would
take forever to dry, most people have front-loading washers which spin the water out
at the end of a cycle. The higher the RPM, the more water is taken out, but higher RPMs
also add more wear to your clothes. At 1400rpm, cotton and synthetic clothes usually dry
overnight, if not sooner. At 800rpm, it can take a day for things to dry.</p>
<p>I first got annoyed that dryers weren’t common, but I quickly adjusted and stopped caring.
Dryers use immense energy and wear down your clothes, and the added convenience isn’t
worth it unless you’re washing a LOT of clothes (which explains why it’s mostly families
who buy dryers). If you do get a dryer, get a heat pump dryer – they use roughly a third
of the energy of the standard dryers you find in the US (but you do have to empty the
water out afterward).</p>
<p>I disagree with this <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2011/04/on-the-superiority-of-american-domestic-appliances.html">Slate article</a>’s general premise and feel that
European appliances are generally of equal or better quality, but definitely appreciate the
hatred of inscrutable symbols on the appliances here. Devices from Bosch-Siemens are
especially bad in this regard:
I have a washing machine
that has <em>Pflegeleicht</em> (“easy care” or “permanent press”) and <em>Pflegeleicht Plus</em> modes.
The
manual has no explanation of what <em>Pflegeleicht Plus</em> means<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and I
only found out via a
Youtube comment on a video showing it in operation<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. On the other
hand, the manual for my dryer has an entire section telling me what clothes I should dry
on low heat, but doesn’t tell me how to actually do that – I’ve been assuming this entire
time that it’s also <em>Pflegeleicht</em>, but that’s never actually explained. Sometimes you’ll
have a symbol pop up on the display that doesn’t appear in the manual at all, and you have
to scour the internet to figure it out what it means.</p>
<h2 id="weather">Weather</h2>
<p>People in Berlin like to complain about the perpetual gray weather and they’re completely
right. Seasonal affective disorder is very real, and it might be a good idea to look into
Vitamin D and light therapy lamps. One note: a lot of people buy cool-colored light bulbs
or a SAD lamp and use it like a regular light. To get the real effects of these
lamps, you need to get a real one and use it very close to your face for a long time! I
went with the complete nerd option: <a href="https://myluminette.com/">Luminette</a> lamp glasses, which I use
right as I wake up. You look like a <em>total idiot</em> wearing them, but I like them a
lot. I don’t have much beyond anecdotal evidence to show that they work, but it’s worth
looking at the instructions of any SAD lamp you might buy to see if you can follow its
recommended regiment. As an added bonus, they’re good for late sleepers who need to wake
up early and can help you
adjust to new time zones. There are other companies that make similar devices if you’re
interested. Take winters in Berlin seriously!</p>
<p>The real solution is to book a trip to Spain in February, but that isn’t an option for
everyone.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-expat-bubble">Avoiding the “expat bubble”</h2>
<p>Moving to a different country raises a lot of questions about integration, maintaining
your identity, and what community you decide to cultivate. One thing that can be difficult
is keeping ties to your previous community without locking yourself into it. Delving into
the language is one way to prevent this. I think it’s also worthwhile to try and rely on
“expat services” sparingly. They’re great when starting out, but over time they reinforce
the lock-in you’ll have. Language goes a long way here, but it can also help to expand
your social network to people from the country you’re in.</p>
<p>Something you may also want to be aware of is what I call the  “expat tax,” where
companies specialize
in providing English-speaking services or advice but charge more for the service. It can
be hard to discern if you’re getting specialized advice tailored to your needs, or getting
fleeced. Most of the time it’s not a big deal, but occasionally it can end up being
quite costly. I know of a mortgage broker specializing in English-speaking clients who, at
least in one case, gave a worse deal than a German-speaking mortgage broker. Admittedly,
several factors could have caused that, but a slightly worse deal on a mortgage can add
up to a big amount in the long run. Don’t feel too bad if you rely on such services, or
expat groups or whatever – I’m just saying that accepting a reasonable amount of
discomfort at the beginning can yield benefits in the long run.</p>
<p>It’s also worth getting involved on a civic level where possible. Reading local news can
help as is watching/reading <em>Tagesschau</em>, the publicly funded German news organization.
I find it also helps to go on
tours and learn about the history of the place you’re in, not just because it’s
interesting but also to help better relate to the people around you.</p>
<h2 id="customer-service">Customer service</h2>
<p>A lot of people moving to Germany (and especially Berlin) experience shock when
interacting with the famous German concept of customer service. While usually written off
as “rude,” I think there’s a deeper cultural norm powering this. An <a href="https://text.npr.org/482443233">NPR story</a> on opening
the first McDonald’s in Russia sheds light on what is going on here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SPIEGEL: At that time in Russia, the relationship between customers and service providers
like cashiers or waiters was basically the opposite of the relationship set up in America.</p>
<p>CHEKALIN: Waiters were kind of above us. They were not serving us. We were kind of, like,
bothering them.</p>
<p>SPIEGEL: In Russia, the role of the customer was to please the waiter, not the other way
around. To understand this, you need to remember that in the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, Russia
was a state-run economy plagued by severe shortages. There were shortages of bread, of
meat, toilet paper. And so anyone who had access to stuff - to goods or food - had a
tremendous amount of power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, customer service in Germany (especially eastern Germany) follows the rule that
<em>the person doesn’t really have to help you</em> and <em>you are being served at their behest.</em>
I’m not saying that this is pleasant or right, but it does explain a lot of what’s going
on. It also explains why “is there a manager I can talk to” isn’t really a move you can
pull. In the States it’s usually a dick move anyway but people do it assuming that the
customer service person will be afraid of repercussions. In Germany it doesn’t work very
well because there are few repercussions, and you aren’t respecting their authority.</p>
<p>A side-effect of a highly bureaucratic society is that exceptions can be extensively
documented and handled if the bureaucrat wants to do so. This means that front-line
customer service people often have the ability to break through the system a bit, assuming
they want to and that they know they can do it. It sucks that there is a lot of personal
discretion involved, but sometimes repeatedly mentioning or reminding someone that they
have the power to document an exception can go a long way.</p>
<h2 id="tipping">Tipping</h2>
<p>There are probably huge articles online explaining how to handle the much more relaxed
tipping rules in Germany. The nice thing to note is that there is no
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipped_wage">tipped wage</a> system like in the US and waitstaff must be paid at least
minimum wage regardless of tips. This means they’re not as dependent on tips to get by,
and conversely tipping isn’t as compulsory as it is in the States. The card payment
terminals which always prompt for a tip are a very recent introduction and make everyone
uncomfortable.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h2>
<p>Nearly everyone in Europe uses WhatsApp, to the point that you might be lightly socially
ostracized if you don’t. Telekom, which <em>runs its own SMS communication network</em>,
allows you to contact their support via WhatsApp because it is so dominant. This has been
a great boon to Facebook and its group of aggressive PMs who want to make sure all your
contact data is harvested.</p>
<p>When I first moved here, you could use WhatsApp without giving access to your contact
list: you could type in a number and directly chat with a person. Then an update came and
the app refused to run unless you gave access. After a while it worked again
without having to give access (I conspiratorially think that Apple
forced them via app store policy), but a strange bug would occur: you could type
in a number directly and try to text them, but they “weren’t on WhatsApp.” Give the app
full access to all your contacts, and suddenly you could text that person. “Weird.”</p>
<p>I am perennially pissed off about this and I hope everyone involved feels bad about
themselves.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/technology/apple-social-apps-contacts-change.html?unlocked_article_code=1.UE4.fNpw.42cXdoBmoRc-&amp;smid=url-share">hahahahahahahahaha</a>.</p>
<h2 id="buying-stuff-on-sundays">Buying stuff on Sundays</h2>
<p>One thing you might get frustrated about is the lack of supermarkets that are open on
Sundays. This is a cultural thing that is supposedly not based on religion, but come on,
of course it is. There are a few gray areas: in Berlin there are some corner stores which are
open on Sundays and
some which aren’t. I’ve heard there is an informal agreement between corner stores who want to
stay open, and they simply don’t report each other so the compliance office doesn’t
investigate. In any case, there are some businesses which are allowed to legally operate on Sundays:
supermarkets can stay open as long as they’re in a train station and are targeted towards
travelers, and florists can sell cut flowers but not flowers in a pot. For everything else,
you have to hope your local corner store bends the rules a bit.</p>
<p>I don’t have any specific guidelines on how to get used to it, other than to adopt the
northern European tradition of <em>preparing for winter</em>. In the old days, you had to make
sure you stored enough potatoes in your cellar to last the winter, otherwise your family
would starve. Germans have somehow kept this mentality into modern times, and you can
sense the panic when someone realizes they don’t have enough groceries to last into
Sunday. Plan ahead, make sure you always have enough potatoes on hand, and be thankful for
what I can imagine is the only advantage of this system: extremely quiet Sunday streets.</p>
<h2 id="smoking">Smoking</h2>
<p>One thing I found unusual was how many people regularly smoked in Europe. Due to a variety
of factors, smoking dropped precipitously in my generation in the US (only to have vaping
take hold in the subsequent generation). This didn’t seem to translate over to here, and
people of all ages smoke in a variety of contexts. I don’t think I’ll forget the time
where I was eating lunch at the office and a coworker was having a conversation with
me, maintaining eye contact, while simultaneously rolling a cigarette. You don’t see that
often in the US!</p>
<p>Supposedly smoking has been legislated out of most public spaces in most of Germany, but
the Berlin nightlife industry fought hard against the regulations when they were being
crafted. Many bars in Berlin are smoking bars, and some restaurants even have a designated
smoking section walled off from the rest of the tables. I guess that’s one of the few
downsides of universal healthcare.</p>
<h2 id="testde--verbraucherzentrale">test.de / Verbraucherzentrale</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a Consumer Reports or Wirecutter-like site in Germany, I can
recommend <a href="https://www.test.de/">test.de</a> or the
<a href="https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/"><em>Verbraucherzentrale</em> (“consumer center”)</a>. In addition to product
reviews, they also
have good explanations and overviews of common insurances, guides for planning major life
events, etc. You do, however, have to have a decent German reading level to take advantage
of it.</p>
<h2 id="writing-letters--buying-a-printer">Writing letters / Buying a printer</h2>
<p>This is slowly changing, but Germany is absolutely a paper-based society. Until very
recently, the only guaranteed easy way to cancel subscriptions (gym memberships,
newspapers,
etc) was to mail a letter to terminate the contract. While you might be able to get away
with printing stuff at work or at a local copy shop, it can often be worth it to get a
home printer. I have a cheap black and white laser printer which has performed beautifully
and hasn’t needed a lot of toner. You might also want to look into getting a scanner to
scan and send copies of signed documents, although there are many apps that use your
phone’s camera to do this. It will make your life way easier if you can scan multiple
pages and combine them into a single PDF, reducing image quality to an acceptable file
size along the way. The iOS Files app and MacOS Finder/Preview can do this natively, but
the process can be annoying and can result in extremely high-resolution files that may be
difficult to transfer. Adobe has a scanning app that requires you to upload to their
cloud-based service. Microsoft Lens seems to be a good sweet spot: local storage, can
easily make PDFs of a normal size, and free.</p>
<h3 id="printing-envelopes">Printing Envelopes</h3>
<p>It’s not immediately obvious, but most printers have variable-width paper trays and will
happily print on DL envelopes (<em>DIN-Lang</em>, the standard envelope size for folded A4
paper). This is
great for people with bad handwriting, but it
is also super nice when combined with prepaid postage.</p>
<p>Google Docs doesn’t have envelope sizes natively, but you can install extensions to do
this. I’ve been using Apple Pages to make letters. The key is to select “Envelope,” and
make sure that the page size is set to ‘Envelope DL’. I’m sure Microsoft Word has a
similar thing.</p>
<p>If you’ve bought postage online, just drop it into the word processor and print the
address, return address, and postage all in one go.</p>
<p>I always kept loading the envelopes into the printer the wrong way, so I ended up
writing a little reminder on a label and sticking it near the printer tray so I
wouldn’t mess up again.</p>
<h2 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Germany really locks you into yearlong subscriptions, so watch out. Gym memberships, cell
phone contracts, newspaper subscriptions, etc often have a minimum subscription amount
(usually a year or two years) and make it difficult to cancel. The government has passed
a law to require
simple cancellation online, but if that doesn’t work you’re often best off writing a
letter stating you’d like to cancel. There are many templates for this you can find
on the internet, but note that if you cancel in the middle of the initial period you’ll
likely have to pay until the period ends. Thankfully the law has now changed and you
should be able to cancel on a monthly basis after the initial period.</p>
<h2 id="dating">Dating</h2>
<p>In general, dating works similar to how it does in the US, with a few exceptions. One is
that dating apps can have a different connotation than what you’re used to. Tinder in the
US morphed from a hook-up app to a general dating service, but Germany was behind a few
years on that. For years I avoided Bumble as “a thing only Americans used,” only to
discover
that a much broader section of the Berlin population used it. Just be open to differences
from what you’re used to.</p>
<p>One thing that is a bit weird is everyone having profiles in English. I’ve heard of
stories where two Germans with English profiles figure out they’re German and switch
mid-chat. I think this mainly speaks to Berlin having a lot of non-German speakers (and
certainly a lot of non-German speaking tourists), so English is sometimes easier to start
off with. All I’m saying is don’t worry too much about your own profile being in English,
and don’t read too much into it if someone texts you in English.</p>
<p>Pro-tip: mention your test.de subscription in your profile and watch the matches come in
like crazy.</p>
<h2 id="following-the-rules">Following “The Rules”</h2>
<p>A particularly cheesy joke I once heard goes “do you know why crime is so low in Germany?
Because it’s illegal.” The extent to which rules and signs are just <em>followed</em> here can be
startling to someone accustomed to a more relaxed culture. It’s like the concept of a
“victimless crime” doesn’t exist here: even if you jaywalk at night when there are no cars
in sight, you’re still breaking the rules and that is, in itself, an offense. There are
two effects here.</p>
<p>One is that everyone trusts that everyone else follows the rules. When I was learning to
drive here, my driving instructor chastised me for looking left too much when turning
right at a T intersection. I was worried about people coming from the left who couldn’t
see me or wouldn’t let me turn. My teacher’s response: due to the “right before left”
rule (explained later in the “Driving” section), they would have to stop for me and I
should just trust that. Apparently it’s not
enough to follow the rules, you’re also expected to trust that everyone else is as well.</p>
<p>Two is that “the rules” can take precedence over communication and relationships. Noise
complaints from neighbors are a good example here. If I hear someone making a lot of noise
in an apartment, I use that as a starting point for a conversation with them. Maybe they
didn’t know the noise carried that much, or maybe we can work out an agreement where most
of the noise can happen when I’m not home. Unfortunately, what often happens is some
variant of “is it before 7pm? Then I’m allowed to do whatever I want!” It’s also limiting
for the people who are used to that environment – maybe something is against the rules,
but the neighbors don’t care. Instead of asking, they simply state that it’s against the
rules and automatically assume rejection – again, there is no “victimless crime.”</p>
<p>This is usually one of the more negative aspects of German culture that people cite, and
I can’t say I disagree. I don’t have much advice on how to navigate it except to notice
what gets people really freaked out and try to avoid those offenses. These usually
fall under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Noise during designated quiet hours</li>
<li>Improperly disposing of trash (including not folding boxes in the recycling bin)</li>
<li>Blocking cars (blocking pedestrians or bicycles doesn’t receive the same outrage)</li>
<li>Not lining up properly (I also get mad at this)</li>
<li>Not staying far enough to the right in a bike lane, even if it’s really narrow and no normal person would want to pass you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-shit-they-dont-want-you-to-know-about">Real shit “they” don’t want you to know about</h2>
<h3 id="worker-rep-on-the-board-_betriebsrat_">Worker rep on the board (<em>Betriebsrat</em>)</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betriebsrat"><em>Betriebsrat</em></a> is an elected “works council” made up of employees that must be consulted by
management on certain issues. Once a company gets large enough it must accommodate a works
council by law, so some see it as a way toward organized labor in a company.
A <em>Betriebsrat</em> doesn’t have the same power as a union, so it’s worth looking into what they
can and can’t do.</p>
<h3 id="_bildungsurlaub_"><em>Bildungsurlaub</em></h3>
<p>In most German states, you have the right to a “<em>Bildungsurlaub</em>.” This is paid vacation
you’re
allowed to take in conjunction with some kind of job or political training. It differs by
state, but in Berlin you get 5 working days each year which can also roll over,
allowing you take 10 days every two years.</p>
<p>You do have to pay for the class itself and any transportation or lodging.
There are almost always German classes available for this, and you’re
allowed to go anywhere there is a course available. I know a German who went to Vancouver
for two weeks to improve his English, and several of my English-speaking colleagues have
spent time in different parts of Germany improving their German. Of course, there’s
nothing preventing you from taking a German class in your city of residence, but sometimes
it’s nice to have a change of scenery.</p>
<h3 id="properly-opening-a-ritter-sport">Properly opening a Ritter Sport</h3>
<p>I opened Ritter Sports for years without knowing that you’re supposed to open them by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SaFuKPX03U">“snapping” them at the seam</a>. This opens them in a way such that the seam can be
resealed, to save the rest for later.</p>
<h2 id="transport">Transport</h2>
<h3 id="public-transit">Public Transit</h3>
<p>Of all the lifestyle upgrades I can think of, universal healthcare and pervasive public
transit are the two huge benefits of moving to Europe. Sure, there are plenty of cars
on the streets, but it’s far easier to take a bus, tram, subway, or commuter rail to your
destination than it is in virtually all of the US. It’s not perfect, but in general the
BVG (the Berlin public transit operator) will generally get you to where you need to go,
at a relatively quick pace. Not all areas of the city have a good connection, though.</p>
<p>However be careful about the ticket system: you have to buy your ticket <em>before</em> you get
on the train. Plainclothes ticket checkers (who are not fondly looked upon)
will spring into action once the doors close, and I’ve known people who have gotten fines
for not buying their tickets quick enough. If this happens, make sure to ask for a receipt
– ticket checkers have been known to scare tourists into paying cash on the spot and
pocketing the money.</p>
<p>Some, but not all, employers offer a discounted monthly transit ticket called a
<em>Jobticket</em> which is probably
worth it if offered. See the <em>Deutschlandticket</em> section for more details.</p>
<p>Google and Apple maps generally have decent transit directions. The BVG and VBB (the
transit operator for the greater Berlin and Brandenburg area) apps also have pretty good
routing. Transit and Citymapper are useful here, but aren’t often used.</p>
<p>One peculiar annoyance of the transit system here is that it can often be difficult to
know what station you’re at. The S-Bahn is particularly egregious here, as the signage
inside the train is often broken and the signage at stations is unlit and very difficult
to see (even more so at night, when the glare on
the windows makes it impossible to look outside). The newer S-Bahn trains make it even
worse – when the doors are about to close and the beeping starts, the screens in the
train switch to
what train it is instead of the current station. This makes it impossible to know where
you are without looking outside. For people like me who read articles on the train and
only react
to the beeps, it can be very stressful to look up and not know if you’ve missed your
stop or not. Oftentimes, the quickest way to tell which S-Bahn stop you’re at is to pull
out your phone and see where you are on Maps.</p>
<h3 id="bicycle">Bicycle</h3>
<p>Berlin’s cycling infrastructure is getting better over time<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. In addition
to all the pop-up
bike lanes that appeared during the pandemic (which are being converted to permanent bike
lanes over time), the city is building a bike autobahn (bikeobahn?) to connect major parts
of the city. Cycling in Berlin is semi-accepted. It’s not as nice as Amsterdam or
Copenhagen, but it’s not as bad as anywhere in the US.</p>
<p>Certain areas of the city have relatively good infrastructure (Prenzlauer Berg, in
particular), while others don’t (Neukölln, Potsdamer Platz). When the infrastructure isn’t
good, cyclists are often crammed in with aggressive cars and the result isn’t pretty. I
don’t have good advice here other than to avoid the areas where possible. When it’s not
possible, I urge you to heed the words of a bike shop owner when I asked him how to turn
left on one of Berlin’s major thoroughfares: “do you want to assert your rights or do you
want to stay alive?” Getting a ticket for riding on the sidewalk (slowly, don’t be a jerk
and blow past pedestrians) isn’t so bad compared to dying, nor is it worth it to rush or
bend traffic laws on the road.</p>
<p>Speaking of traffic laws, you may want to read up on the <em>rechts vor links</em>
(“right before left”) rule which described in the driving section. It will
help explain why cars act strangely at 4-way intersections.</p>
<p>Regardless of how well built the cycling infrastructure in your neighborhood is, you will
always
encounter cycling’s second natural enemy behind cars: cobblestones (<em>Kopfsteinpflaster</em>).
These are purpose-built to ruin your day as a cyclist<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. In addition to causing
extreme vibration while riding, enough to kick you off your bike if you’re going at anything
resembling a normal speed,
they can be spaced just wide enough to catch your wheel and send you flying. I’d like to
give a special shoutout to the bike lanes which are interrupted by driveways that use
cobblestones <em>just for the bike lane</em> – a special treat for everyone who wants to get
flipped off of their bike. For some reason they seem to be specially chosen and laid to
maximize the chances of catching your wheel.</p>
<p>You can fight cobblestones with a two-pronged approach: avoidance and acceptance. To avoid
them, I recommend the Beeline app. You should probably buy a <a href="https://beeline.co/">Beeline</a> anyway
since it’s a
great device, but I think you can use the app without purchasing the device and it works
as a great cycling navigation aid throughout Berlin. While it doesn’t know about
cobblestones specifically, it does let users rate streets and the routing takes that into
account. For those who want more detailed information, the “Berlin by Bike” website and
app use exact street data to minimize cobblestones as much as possible. Unfortunately I
find both interfaces effectively unusable, so I never end up using these. Google Maps can
route for cyclists but it has no concept of cobblestones and minimal understanding of
bike lanes, so it <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/fahrradtour-als-google-maps-mich-mehrfach-fast-umgebracht-haette-2209-168001.html">often puts cyclists in unpleasant or outright dangerous situations</a>. To
accept cobblestones, you can get a bike with wide tires or underinflate your tires to
absorb the impact (but not too much, or you’ll get a pinch flat). Getting springy grip
tape or wearing cycling gloves can help your wrists too.</p>
<p>Bike theft is definitely a concern around here, but not as much as I recall in SF. I
always followed the advice to bring two U-locks, one for the front wheel and one for the
back wheel/frame. Virtually nobody here seems to do that, and the foldy “D-locks” are
quite common around here. While practical, they offer less security. I’d say the general
consensus is to have a less valuable bike + less effective locking instead of valuable
bike + more effective locking. Another thing to be aware of: some of the bike racks are
too wide or too weirdly designed to be able to lock your rear wheel and frame together
with one U-lock. It might be worthwhile to invest in locking wheel skewers instead of
quick releases so you can care a little less when only one lock fits.</p>
<p>For some reason, despite Berlin’s reputation as a laid-back city (nobody is really in a
rush here), everyone is super aggressive in cars and on bikes. In addition, you also have
people who buzz past you at
especially dangerous times (intersections when the light just turns green, right when a
huge truck is passing centimeters away instead of just waiting a few seconds, the insanely
narrow bike “lane” on the bridge at Warschauer Straße), and otherwise general weird
behavior.</p>
<p>I don’t want to seem too negative here: cycling in Berlin is a great way to get around,
it’s free once you buy the bike and is great for your health. In addition to daily travel,
cycling out to Brandenburg for a long weekend can be a great experience. In summer, it’s
very popular to bike out to one of Berlin or Brandenburg’s many lakes and chill out for
the day. <a href="https://www.komoot.com/">Komoot</a> is a nice way to plan out one of these trips if you don’t know
anyone who knows the way. Enjoy it!</p>
<p>Finally, while you may not be able to vote, you can help your city become a more
bike-friendly place. I’d recommend joining your local ADFC chapter (that would be
<a href="https://berlin.adfc.de/">ADFC-Berlin</a> for the Berliners), who petition for better bike lanes, better
protection of
cyclists, and overall encourage a more bike-friendly city. In Berlin they also organize
the ADFC <em>Sternfahrt</em> (“rally”), for those who want a tamer Critical Mass experience.</p>
<h3 id="regional-and-long-distance-trains">Regional and Long-distance Trains</h3>
<p>Germans love to complain about the Deutsche Bahn, and there’s plenty to complain about –
the general opinion is that it’s a corrupt organization that was affected by the same
privatization spree that created the Deutsche Post. Recent
<a href="https://www.zugfinder.net/en/stationboard-Berlin">dismal on-time performance</a> has
not helped this impression, and trying to understand exactly <em>why</em> DB has such structural
problems is a hobby in and of itself.</p>
<p>However, overall <em>there are trains</em> and <em>the trains actually run</em>. You can reasonably
traverse the country by train, and if you don’t mind paying a bit extra for a high-speed
train you can get from any big city to another in maybe 7 hours tops.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bahn has some confusing pricing for the uninitiated, so I’ll try to explain it
below.</p>
<h4 id="second-class-_flexpreis_">Second-class <em>Flexpreis</em></h4>
<p>The basic ticket is the second-class <em>Flexpreis</em> (“flexible-ticket price”) ticket. This kind
of ticket works like a
public-transit ticket: just like a subway or bus ticket, with a <em>Flexpreis</em> ticket you can
take any train that day to your destination. Also like a subway or bus ticket, there is no
seat reservation: it’s a free-for-all and you may get lucky or not depending on demand.
This also means that DB can’t fundamentally do capacity control for second class. They
try to predict demand and tell you on the website, but there’s nothing stopping 200 people
showing up to ride the same train and filling up all possible space in the car.</p>
<p>The flexibility makes this kind of ticket most useful for commuters who don’t know the
exact time they’ll take a train and don’t mind if they don’t get a seat, since it won’t be
that long of a ride anyway. Reserved seats can be purchased afterward if you settle on a
particular train and think it might be busy.</p>
<h4 id="second-class-_sparpreis_">Second-class <em>Sparpreis</em></h4>
<p>The second-class <em>Sparpreis</em> (“savings price”) ticket is exactly like the <em>Flexpreis</em> ticket
except you have to pick a specific train to ride on. This changes the ticket from a
public-transit style ticket (“take any train going that direction”) to something more like
flying: you have a specific train to catch and can’t substitute it with another one. The
upside is that <em>Sparpreis</em> tickets are usually much cheaper, depending on how busy the train
is and how far out in advance you buy it. A funny consequence of this pricing model is
that the <em>Sparpreis</em> starts cheap and rises to eventually match the cost of the_Flexpreis_
ticket – at which point you can just buy a <em>Flexpreis</em> ticket, since that lets you ride on
any train that day anyway.</p>
<p>Like <em>Flexpreis</em> tickets, second-class <em>Sparpreis</em> tickets also do not come with a seat
reservation. Unlike <em>Flexpreis</em> tickets, most people buying <em>Sparpreis</em> tickets are buying for
some kind of long-distance vacation or business trip. For some routes and times of day
it’s not worth reserving a seat since it will almost certainly be empty, but if you’re
wrong you’ll be standing in the aisle for 5 hours straight. Another annoyance is that the
seat you pick may be reserved for part of your journey, meaning you’ll have to shuffle
around and find another one. Finally, there are the “<em>ggf. freigeben</em>” seats.
<em>Ggf. freigeben</em> (German for “lol, you thought this would be easy?”) means that the
seat may or may not be reserved, and they don’t know due to technical reasons. If you sit
there, you’ll have to wait the entire ride to see if someone actually did reserve it or not.</p>
<p>After getting burned a few times, I’ve just committed to paying the extra few Euro to
always get a reserved seat. If you plan to save the cash, just be prepared to stand in the
aisle/vestibule or shift seats a lot.</p>
<h4 id="first-class">First-class</h4>
<p>First-class on a DB train isn’t like first-class on a plane: you get slightly more
legroom, and occasionally someone will take your food or drink
order so you don’t have to go to the dining car yourself. It used to be a better deal on
emptier trains since you used to get a free seat reservation included, which often made
a first-class ticket only a few more Euro than a second-class ticket with seat
reservation. Sadly seat reservations
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230613062354/https://www.bahn.de/info/kleiner-fahrplanwechsel-juni-23">are no longer included with first-class tickets anymore</a>.</p>
<h4 id="bahncard">BahnCard</h4>
<p>If you plan to do any regular traveling with DB, I highly recommend getting a BahnCard. A BahnCard
25 can rapidly pay for itself after a few trips. These are prepaid discount cards that
come in six major flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>First- and second- class BahnCard 25</li>
<li>First- and second- class BahnCard 50</li>
<li>First- and second- class BahnCard 100</li>
</ul>
<p>The BahnCard 25 is what applies to most people – you get 25% off of the various kinds of
<em>Sparpreise</em>, sometimes including train travel outside of Germany. The first-class BahnCard
also gives you the 25% benefit on second-class tickets, but not the other way around, so
it only makes sense to have one and not both.</p>
<p>The BahnCard 50 makes the most sense for commuters who need the flexibility of a <em>Flexpreis</em>
ticket, it gives you 50% off of <em>Flexpreise</em> as well as 25% off of <em>Sparpreise</em>.</p>
<p>The BahnCard 100 is for high-rollers. It lets you ride <em>any</em> train on the system, although
you only get a certain number of free seat reservations to go along with it. I only know
of people who get BahnCard 100s through their work, similar to having a company car.</p>
<h4 id="49-euro-ticket--_deutschlandticket_">49 Euro Ticket / <em>Deutschlandticket</em></h4>
<p>This is a relatively new offering that was originally introduced in 2022 during the
outbreak of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to reduce German’s reliance on fossil fuels.
Its success led to the current version with a higher price but more sustainable funding
from the government. The <em>Deutschlandticket</em> allows you to ride any regional, non-high-speed
train, as well as public transit in any city, in all of Germany for €49 a month. This
means you can ride from your apartment to the train station in Berlin using Berlin public
transit, a regional train from Berlin to Hamburg, and Hamburg public transit to your
hotel, all on the same ticket, which costs €49 a month. This is not only a great deal, but
an impressive achievement that they managed to unify the transit networks of every city in Germany. As you
can imagine, many people now opt for the <em>Deutschlandticket</em> instead of single-city subscriptions. You buy it through your local transit
agency, and there are even <em>Jobticket</em> variants you get through your employer that cost a little less.</p>
<p>A small caveat: the <em>Deutschlandticket</em> counts as a second-class ticket on regional trains,
and can’t be combined with a first-class “upgrade” ticket. If you want to ride first-class
on a regional train, you need to pay the full price. Additionally, there are no refunds if
a train gets canceled or delayed. If you are planning on using the <em>Deutschlandticket</em> to
catch a <em>Sparpreis</em> express train somewhere else, it’s probably better to buy a ticket for the whole
journey so you can be rerouted or reimbursed if something goes wrong.</p>
<h4 id="booking">Booking</h4>
<p>Booking trains within Germany is pretty easy – just go to the DB website. Booking trains
to neighboring countries through DB is also generally pretty good. Unfortunately, there is
no unified European train search and booking system, and the accuracy and bookability of
train search falls off steeply as you go further away from Germany. <a href="https://www.omio.com/">Omio</a> provides a
Europe-wide train search in theory, but it’s not as good as Google Flights, Kayak, etc.
Seems like a great opportunity for a scrappy startup to build something!</p>
<p>Sometimes you might get cheaper prices or different conditions if you book trips through
the Austrian rail line (<em>ÖBB</em>) instead of DB.</p>
<p>For longer-distance trips, <a href="https://www.rome2rio.com/">Rome2Rio</a> can provide some good connections that you might not
otherwise think about. There is also <a href="https://www.blablacar.com/">BlaBlaCar</a> which helps you organize long-distance
carpools, but I haven’t used it.</p>
<h3 id="driving">Driving</h3>
<p>I recently got my German driver’s license after converting it from a California one.
Unfortunately California doesn’t offer an exchange with Germany, so I had to go through
almost the whole driving school process here. Exchanging my license meant I needed fewer
required driving hours, didn’t have to do any “special” driving hours (like night driving
or Autobahn driving), and it meant that I could skip any theory classes as long as I
tested ok. Note that the exchanged license only has to be valid when you make the initial
application – if your license expires between the application and when you pass your
exams, everything should still be ok as long as the application itself is valid. If you’re
thinking about exchanging your license, do it while you still can.</p>
<p>An exchanged California license, assuming you don’t need too many practice driving hours,
will cost you roughly €1500 - €2000. That’s the school fees, the fees to use their
“learning platform” (an app to go through all the theoretical exam questions), some
administrative fees they charge whenever they talk to the license office or sign you up for a test,
and the practice driving hours. To help you estimate, I needed about 11 practice hours
in total, at a rate of about €80/hr. The schools aggressively hide their fees online, but
usually if you ask or sign up they have a published fee sheet somewhere.</p>
<p>I went to the license office to directly apply for the exchange, but I think that was really
the wrong order. I had to supply a driving school and test location, so I think the proper
order would have been to sign up with a driving school first. From what I understand, most
if not all schools will handle all the license office paperwork themselves (with an implied fee, of
course).</p>
<p>I had to take the theoretical and practical exam, as if I had never driven before. The
practical was relatively straightforward, but I recommend reading up on Reddit to avoid
common pitfalls. I found practicing for the theoretical exam way harder. The wording of
all the questions is quite tricky, so even if your German is passable it might be better
to take the exam in English, even though the translations aren’t great.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two things I’d want to stress when learning to drive: right-before-left
and where the speed limit signs are.</p>
<h4 id="right-before-left">Right before left</h4>
<p>This is a rule that, as far as I can tell, only exists in Germany and the Netherlands. In the US, there is the
concept of a 4-way stop sign at an intersection. Germany doesn’t have that. At a 4-way
intersection without a traffic light, the <em>rechts vor links</em> (“right before left”) rule applies: you have to
yield to everyone to the right of you. Before you go “oh yeah, that makes sense” I almost
assure you that you don’t understand it. There is no cycling of cars as people take turns,
literally everyone to the right of you goes ahead while you wait, and only when the right
is clear do you go (the people left of you are waiting on you). Imagine that every
intersection had a default sign that said “yield to all cars on the right.”</p>
<p>This rule applies basically everywhere there aren’t traffic signs, not just at 4-way
stops. If there is a road to the
right of you, you have to slow down to see if anyone is coming and yield if anyone is
there. The only exceptions are if it’s a “road with a curb” (meaning a driveway), a
lesser class of road (a dirt road when you’re on a paved one), or if you have a street
sign telling you have right of way or are on a “priority road” (the most common being a
yellow diamond inside a white diamond). This means that in a parking lot, if someone is
arriving to the right of you, you have to yield.</p>
<p>It’s complicated enough driving through the city trying to figure out if the road to the
right of you is a real road or a driveway, but there’s another curveball thrown into the
mix: the sign that tells you that the priority road curves right or left. Usually in these
scenarios I stop my car and write a Prolog program to solve the logic puzzle of
what to do, especially if you want to turn left into oncoming traffic. One nice
shortcut: if you’re on a priority road that curves left, you always have right-of-way no
matter what you’re doing.</p>
<h4 id="where-the-speed-limit-signs-are">Where the speed limit signs are</h4>
<p>This seems trivial, but I found it very frustrating while driving around town. In Germany,
the speed limit signs are posted directly <em>at</em> the intersection, and not after.
Additionally, there is a default speed limit if you <em>don’t</em> see any sign (50km/h within
cities, 100km/h outside). Since I’m usually looking at pedestrians and other cars when
turning at an intersection, I kept missing traffic signs when I was first learning to
drive here. While you’re walking on the street (meaning, in a non-stressful situation),
keep an eye out for them to see where they should be.</p>
<p>Be sure to note the change in default speed limit I mentioned above. Make a mental note
that <em>every</em> time you see a “welcome to X city” sign, you slow down to 50km/h.</p>
<p>Finally, speed limit signs on some roads can be on the <em>left</em> side of the road as well
as on the right – these can be more difficult to see on wider streets, so try to
keep an eye out for them.</p>
<h2 id="medical">Medical</h2>
<p>The medical system in Germany is good, regardless of whether you have public or private
health insurance. In general it helps to know German to navigate the system, but a few
tips can make it a bit easier.</p>
<h3 id="emergencies">Emergencies</h3>
<p>If you have a medical emergency, dial 112 and get an ambulance – make sure to state the
street address first, so if the call gets cut off they still know where to go. The number
to call the police in emergencies is 110. I struggled for a while to remember which was
which – 110 or 112 – until I saw a cheesy poster for a fire brigade’s recreational
rowing team: “We give 112 percent!” It took me a second, like “oh god, 110% isn’t good
enough?” followed by “oohhhhhh.”</p>
<h3 id="getting-an-appointment">Getting an appointment</h3>
<p>With public insurance, it can be hard to find an appointment for your doctor. Some of them
only make appointments by phone, but a growing number schedule patients online via
companies like Doctolib,
Jameda, or Samedi. For specialists it may not be a big deal, but I really recommend
finding a <em>Hausarzt</em> (“primary care physician”) that reliably schedules appointments
online. Some health insurances
offer appointment-making services (Techniker Krankenkassse, for example, has an English
language appointment
hotline), but I don’t have much experience with that.</p>
<p>One bright spot is that you often don’t have to make an appointment to refill a
prescription – usually you can call the doctor’s office, ask for a refill, and you can
pick the prescription up when convenient. Sometimes they’ll even mail it to you!</p>
<h3 id="krankschriebung">Krankschriebung</h3>
<p>With most non-freelancer jobs, if you get sick you’re allowed to take off work for a few
days, but on the third day you’re required to go to a <em>Hausarzt</em> and get
<em>krankgeschrieben</em> (“written off sick”). That process
itself is kind of annoying – most practices won’t give them out over the phone, so you
usually have to go in person while having a cold, just to get a piece of paper saying you
have a cold. At least it’s better than being forced to work while sick. There is
no concept of a fixed amount of “sick days” here and Germans are appalled at the concept.</p>
<h3 id="_überweisungen_"><em>Überweisungen</em></h3>
<p>In the German healthcare system, the <em>Hausarzt</em> is the
gatekeeper for basically all your medical needs. Unless it’s an emergency, you usually
have to see the <em>Hausarzt</em> first before seeing any kind of specialist. The magical
document you need to see a specialist is the <em>Überweisung</em> (“referral”). This is why I
recommended in the previous section that you should really try to find a <em>Hausarzt</em> that’s
easy to book appointments with.</p>
<p>The setup can get a little frustrating at times, since you’re just making an appointment
to get permission to make a different appointment with someone else. It’s also a little
weird because, in theory, you can go to any <em>Hausarzt</em> to do this, not just your main one
(although you may get funny looks if you show up to a new practice with an unusual
request).</p>
<h3 id="rezepte">Rezepte</h3>
<p>A more familiar concept is that most medicine requires a <em>Rezept</em> (“prescription”)
from a doctor in order to pick it up at an <em>Apotheke</em> (“pharmacy”). Despite all the talk of
digitized patient records and “<em>E-Rezepte</em>,” Germany is still a very paper-based society
and you’re likely going to have to bring a stupid piece of paper with you every time you
need to pick up medication. Occasionally you can ask the doctor’s office to send it
directly to the <em>Apotheke</em> if it’s one nearby or you have their fax number handy.</p>
<h3 id="apotheke--over-the-counter">Apotheke / Over the counter</h3>
<p>What’s weird about the <em>Apotheken</em> is that they’re weird amalgams of prescription
medication depots, advisors for over-the-counter medication, and beauty product stores.
You can’t just <em>buy</em> NyQuil here, you have to go up to a person, do a little song and
dance, and hope that you’ve convinced them enough that you get the product that you want.
This goes a little smoother when you <em>don’t</em> know what product you want, as the
pharmacists are usually pretty well trained to help you find what you need. A word of
caution, however – Germans are very medication-averse, so don’t be surprised to get
“herbal” treatments when you expected the real stuff. Sometimes you can explicitly ask for
a medically proven active ingredient, but sometimes you may walk away empty-handed.</p>
<p>I am still astonished that homeopathic “treatments” are not only offered in pharmacies
here, but sometimes <em>actively recommended</em> by pharmacists and doctors! It may sound
like a perverse application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law">Godwin’s law</a>, but you can literally
<a href="https://quackwatch.org/hx/nazis/">blame the Nazis</a> for this one.</p>
<h3 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h3>
<p>One big failure in the German health system is how mental health is handled. Finding a
German-speaking therapist or psychiatrist is difficult enough, let alone an
English-speaking one.
Supposedly the problem is that the calculation for the number of practitioners
approved in an area by statutory insurance was set in the 90s and was never updated.
If you have statutory insurance and don’t want to wait a year to see a practitioner
(this is not an exaggeration), you’ll often have to just pay the full price out-of-pocket.</p>
<p>Private insurance has a much better track record in this regard, but that means mental
health services are in some ways reserved for the rich.</p>
<p>There is a process to get statutory
insurance to reimburse you for a private practitioner if you can prove that everybody in
your area is full. It’s a complicated process, but some practitioners might be able to
help you navigate it. You will have to pay out-of-pocket to get started, though.</p>
<p><em>The Berliner</em> has a good <a href="https://www.the-berliner.com/berlin/how-to-get-therapy-in-berlin-germany-mental-health/">overview of the whole situation</a> and how to
deal with it.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>The food system in Europe is in some ways pretty awesome, and in other ways quite
limiting.</p>
<h3 id="bread">Bread</h3>
<p>European bread is on another level. For my entire life, “bread” lasted for weeks in the
cupboard. It turns out, that’s what makes Wonderbread <em>wonder</em> bread – it has
preservatives in it to make it last far longer. Normal bread only keeps for a few days!</p>
<p>The demand for fresh bread has created a whole supply chain and distribution network
for fresh baked goods that easily outclasses that in the US. Gas stations and train
stations don’t have shrink-wrapped cheese danishes with year-long shelf lives. They have
pastries baked daily, and often freshly made little sandwiches with meat and cheese.
Cities themselves are dotted with bakeries, and often you’ll be within walking distance
of several of them.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that there are variations in quality – you can definitely taste the
difference between an industrially baked croissant and one made locally at the bakery
itself – but the average quality is much higher and the variance much lower.</p>
<p>What you gain in quality you pay for in choice – often you’ll only find the same
variation of the same few pastries or bread types. You’ll occasionally find a fun thing,
but a step into an American supermarket will remind you of the shocking emphasis they have
on having 10 different brands of peanut butter.</p>
<h3 id="cheese--dairy">Cheese / Dairy</h3>
<p>Like bread, cheese is one of Europe’s core competencies. The average supermarket will have
an intimidating cheese selection, both from pasteurized and unpasteurized milks of
various mammals.</p>
<p>If you’re a cheese eater it’s definitely worth trying out some random ones, being open to
the fact that some of them taste or smell downright terrible. I can’t stomach camembert or
brunost but there are a lot of good cheeses I’ve discovered while I’ve been here. Note
that unpasteurized cheese can come with some health risks, but if you’re not
immunocompromised or pregnant it’s usually ok.</p>
<p>What may be a bit unsettling is seeing unrefrigerated milk and eggs. Eggs are not
washed in Europe like they are in the States, which leaves on a protective coating that
lets them last at room temperature much longer. Refrigerating them just extends this
longer, and a close read of the label will show two expiration dates depending on if
they’re refrigerated or not. Similarly, ultrapasteurized milk is milk that stays good for
months at room temperature, but needs to be refrigerated once open.</p>
<h3 id="meat">Meat</h3>
<p>Meat in Europe is generally handled similarly to meat in the US, with a big exception:
pork is better handled here, and (with proper preparation) can be eaten undercooked or
even raw. I’ve eaten <em>Mett</em> (“pork tartare”) and lived to tell the tale, but it took some courage to do it.
It’s common to have cured but not cooked bacon for breakfast. Everyone keeps saying it’s
safe, but it takes a lot to undo an entire lifetime of avoiding uncooked pork.</p>
<h3 id="coffee">Coffee</h3>
<p>Coffee, as in the States, serves a dual purpose as “concentration fuel” and gourmet
experience. However, the latter is emphasized far more than the former. This means that
filter coffee from a carafe is readily available at gas stations and other places where
you’re just trying to get from point A to B, but quite rare to get at a restaurant.
Sometimes you’ll get lucky and a <em>Milchkaffee</em> (“milk coffee”) will be filter coffee with cream, but often
the only way to get anything approaching filter coffee is to admit defeat and order an
americano. I’ve adapted by ordering cappuccinos all the time.</p>
<p>The concept of unlimited filter coffee is foreign here, to the point that when a (sadly
now closed) American diner in Berlin offered it, it was a point of conversation for both
Americans and non-Americans alike. Living abroad means excitedly saying things like “they
had the coffee carafes, like from Denny’s, and the waiter just walks around filling up
your mug!”</p>
<h3 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h3>
<p>Yes, you really can drink beer on the street! The European attitude toward alcohol is far
more relaxed, and in my opinion more healthy. Because it’s everywhere and not strictly
controlled and locked down, people binge drink less. That’s not to say that people don’t
binge drink (how else could you explain the existence of Schlager music?) but it’s far
more acceptable to socially drink in small quantities. I think the stronger public transit
options and weaker Puritan influences drive the shocking (to Americans) attitude toward alcohol here.</p>
<p>Fun fact: the drinking age is 21 in the US because the National Highway Board found
that drunk driving accidents fall off sharply after 21 years of age, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act">therefore states
don’t get federal highway funding</a> if their legal drinking age is under 21. Sucks if you don’t drive, I guess.</p>
<h4 id="wine">Wine</h4>
<p>I’m not a knowledgeable wine drinker, but wine is both cheaper and of higher quality in
Europe than what I’ve seen in the US. Enjoy!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>The physical copies of <a href="https://book.webtypography.net/">my book on Web Typography</a> sold out quickly. I self-published, and print runs are expensive when you’re funding them yourself, so numbers were limited. However it was always my plan to publish an ebook at the same time, and that has out-sold the hard copy by an order of magnitude.</p>

<p>I set myself some pretty stiff criteria for the ebook – it needed to replicate the design of print edition as far as possible, adapting to the medium when required. To this day I’m proud of the result. I completely hand-coded the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/">ePub</a> (meaning it’s mostly <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr> under the hood), and I believe the effort paid off. If you’ll forgive the rather un-British boasting, I still think it’s one of the more advanced ebooks out there: with embedded fonts, <abbr>SVG</abbr> images, alt text, bold typographic heirarchy, Javascript-driven syntax highlighting and what I hope is a nuanced, highly readable overall design. Not bad for an ebook anyway, although I’ll grant you the bar is not set high (notable exceptions include <a href="https://abookapart.com/">A Book Apart</a> publications).</p>

<p>All hubris aside, I am still frequently embarrassed by how the ebook renders, particularly in Apple Books. Like a well structured webpage, my book uses a lot of headings and subheadings – I wrote it to be referenced as much as to be read, so this helps the scanability of the text. However Apple Books, and other WebKit, Gecko, or old Blink-powered ebook readers will happily do this to headings:</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://clagnut.com/images/2426/ebook-widows.png" alt="Screen shot of Apple Books rendering an ePub"></figure>

<p>Notice the orphaned heading “Lean on six centuries of typesetting&nbsp;experience” with its following paragraph out of sight on the next page. This is a typographic no-no, and has been for – um – six centuries. Far better for the reader to have the heading attached to its paragraph on the next page, even if that means leaving some redundant whitespace in its place.</p>

<p>Since 1997(!) and the early drafts of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-CSS2-971104/page.html#h-12.2">CSS2</a>, there has been an easy way to tell browsers not insert a page break directly after, or in the middle of, a heading:</p>

<figure><div data-element="code-block"><pre><code>h2 {
    page-break-after: avoid;
    page-break-inside: avoid;
}
</code></pre></div></figure>



<figure><div data-element="code-block"><pre><code>h2 {
    break-after: avoid;
    break-inside: avoid;
}
</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>However 26 years later, <code>break-after:avoid</code> is still not supported by either Safari or Firefox, and was only <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=223068#c54">introduced to Chrome 108</a> in December 2022. I’ve put together a <a href="https://codepen.io/clagnut/pen/MWZRBaM">test for support of <code>break-after</code> and <code>break-inside</code></a> in multi-column layout. Have a play with it in Chrome – try removing <code>break-inside:avoid</code> and then <code>break-after:avoid</code> from the <code>h2</code> rule in the <abbr>CSS</abbr> and you should see how the subheadings end up at the bottom of a column, or worse still, split over two columns.</p>

<p>Browser support for <abbr>CSS</abbr> properties tends to follow demand from web developers. Unlike in 1997 – or indeed 2017 – there is now an annual Interop arrangement between browser rendering engine makers in which they agree a common list of priorities for <abbr>CSS</abbr> and other web technologies. Interop 2024 has just closed for new proposals. Unfortunately I didn’t manage to submit a request in time for breaking controls to be universally implemented. Thankfully Scott Kellum of <a href="https://typetura.com/">Typetura</a> did put in a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/web-platform-tests/projects/3/views/1?pane=issue&amp;itemId=40510069">proposal for advanced multi-column layouts</a> to be improved, and this included support for <code>break-</code> properties. Sadly there’s little to no clamour for it from other developers – the blog post you’re reading probably doubles the published demand, and that’s just for within columns.</p>

<p><ins><strong>Update:</strong> Annoyingly the proposal <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/issues/520#issuecomment-1921897115">was not selected</a> for Interop 2024.  I'll just have to keep prodding the bug reports and keep my fingers crossed they are fixed soon – <strong>these bugs are older than some of my colleagues!</strong></ins></p>

<p>Paged media is very much a forgotten aspect, and it’s probably true that web pages are rarely printed in the grand scheme of things, however ebooks are definitely a popular form of paged media and deserve attention. I’d certainly like to read ebooks without failed typographic fundamentals.</p></section></div>]]></description>

                <div id="art-body-desc">
                        <p>Last week, the US Forest Service announced it would stop prescribed burning in California “<a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1994972/forest-service-halts-prescribed-burns-california-worth-risk">for the foreseeable future,</a>” stating that the decision was made as a precautionary measure to ensure the availability of staff and equipment in case of potential wildfires. But temps are falling across California, and state, tribal authorities, and prescribed burn associations have commenced with their prescribed burns. If the federal agency doesn’t hold up its end of the work, all that mitigation work can be undone.</p>
<p>To grasp the impact of the Forest Service’s decision on California, it’s essential to understand the history of the state and the intricate mosaic of private, state, and federal land that constitutes the forests. Over the past 100 years, the state and federal governments relied on a “<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/tending-the-wild/paper">paramilitary-like program</a>” that focused on fire suppression by rapidly mobilizing firefighters and equipment. Very little was done regarding fire prevention besides creating the famous Smokey Bear ad campaign. One of the problems was that colonialist attitudes of fire officials constantly disregarded the valuable knowledge of forest management practices held by California’s Indigenous communities. One such practice is prescribed burning, which involves intentionally setting controlled fires to remove dry vegetation that could serve as “ladder fuel,” allowing wildfires to spread to taller vegetation. Without this mitigation work, the buildup of vegetation and increasing average global temperatures has created the conditions for the mega-wildfires we see in the West today.</p>
<p>These destructive fires have over time shifted state and federal policies toward wildfire mitigation. California’s recently enacted 2024-25 budget includes <a href="https://ebudget.ca.gov/2024-25/pdf/Enacted/BudgetSummary/NaturalResourcesandEnvironmentalProtection.pdf">$4.2 billion and 12,512 positions</a> for CAL FIRE, which provides resource management and fire protection services across 31 million acres of state forests. However, California relies on the federal government to maintain areas outside state and local control, mainly the 20 million acres of National Forests managed by the Forest Service. The Forest Service, like many other federal agencies, lacks stable long-term funding because the continuing resolution process constantly threatens its programs. In the past, these issues have had dire consequences for Californians.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Caldor Fire started in the El Dorado National Forest, and the Forest Service knew this region was at risk. The agency had created a model two decades before the fire predicting the danger and proposed the Trestle Project in 2013 to manage federal land near the town of Grizzly Flats. The project was expected to be completed by 2020. However, an <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/08/16/how-we-measured-us-forest-service-wildfire-prevention-work/">investigation</a> by CapRadio and the California Newsroom discovered only 2,137 acres of the planned 15,000, or 14 percent of the project, had been completed before August 14, 2021. That was the day the Caldor Fire started, and 48 hours later, the fire had leveled Grizzly Flats.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/26/1125172945/forest-service-fell-short-of-executing-plan-to-protect-town-from-fire-probe-find"> NPR</a>, the Trestle Project faced “staffing shortages, pushback from environmental groups, too many days when prescribed burns would be dangerous due to hotter, drier conditions caused by climate change,” and, most importantly, a lack of funding. Unfortunately, the Trestle Project’s setbacks left Grizzly Flats and other El Dorado County communities vulnerable to the scenario the Forest Service had modeled.&nbsp; Tellingly, as the fire moved east toward Lake Tahoe, the community of Kirkwood was <a href="https://snowbrains.com/kirkwood-mountain-resort-no-fire-damage-caldor/">spared</a> thanks to an <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd741953.pdf">escaped prescribed burn</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>This scenario shows what happens when Congress is less committed than California to tackling forest management. With wildfire management funding constantly tied up in unpredictable budget debates, the current state-federal partnership is fragile and based on the whims of the legislative and executive branches, which can withhold funding based on which political party is currently in power. The Forest Service’s latest decision is the consequence of these issues.</p>
<p>Congress must commit to forest management by providing stable and reliable funding for wildfire prevention. Forest management is not a partisan issue – it is a matter of public safety, environmental protection, and economic sustainability. It’s well past time to put politics aside and cooperate with California and other fire-prone states to ensure that we provide the resources needed to manage forests, reduce the danger of wildfires, and safeguard communities.</p>
<p>EDIT: The original version of this article referred to Smokey Bear as Smokey the Bear. Officially, the mascot is named Smokey Bear. In popular culture, the “the” was added by a song in 1952 by Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins and stuck with the general public.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>One of the best parts of antitrust trials is how much information comes into the public domain about corporations that usually keep details about their industry private. The Kroger-Albertsons supermarket merger case is no different. One interesting nugget is that supermarket executives sees rural markets as particularly easy to monopolize, because there is often just one store. They even have a name, “no-comp[etition] or low-comp[etition] zones,” according to one executive on the stand.</p><p>Of course that makes sense, we’d expect firms to maximize profits where they can. One might be tempted to say, well, there are some towns that can’t support more than one store. And that might be true, except that there are several examples of supermarket chains using tactics in such towns to thwart the opening of competition. How? Well, they find a way to dominate the existing plots of land and building suitable for such a store.</p><p><span>In June, for instance, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who is also litigating against the merger, </span><a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/legislation-regulatory-news/albertsons-lifts-land-use-restriction-in-washington" rel="">fined</a><span> Albertsons $25,000 for imposing a land use restriction on a store it sold in 2018 in a low-income section of Bellingham, Washington. As part of the sale, the supermarket giant put a requirement on the deed that no grocery store could open there until 2038. Ferguson found this provision was a violation of the state antitrust law.</span></p><p>These kinds of land use restrictions are likely common. A few months ago, I got an email from an economist explaining how Albertsons abuses its monopoly power in a small skiing town in rural California using a similar strategy. </p><blockquote><p>I’m in Mammoth, CA. The town needs more grocery, but they’re limited on land. There’s a vacant Kmart that is desirable, BUT the local Vons grocery (which is owned by Albertsons) is leasing the old Kmart of keep it vacant (to the tune of $750k annually). The community is outraged, but feels they cant do anything…</p><p>It’s so apparent walking in the Vons in that region that customer service is dismissed. Workers aren’t happy, store shelves aren’t stocked, and the general messiness is simply undignified.”</p></blockquote><p><span>In Mammoth Lakes, there are two old K-Mart lots that could easily welcome competitive grocery stores, but both are foreclosed by Albertsons. According to </span><a href="https://www.easternsierranow.com/whats-bugging-you-eastern-sierra-oh-tenants-where-art-thou/" rel="">the mayor</a><span>, there are deed restrictions that “deter big box retailers such as Target/Walmart, and basically completely block grocery retailers.” According to a different media outlet, the prohibition is not in the deed, but is a direct leasing arrangement. Vons </span><a href="https://thesheetnews.com/2019/11/15/bishop-kmart-to-close/" rel="">started</a><span> leasing one plot in 2019 when K-Mart went under, “holding the space hostage.” It now leases the other as well. It doesn’t actually matter which strategy is involved, both are intended to restrict new grocery stores so there’s no competition.</span></p><p>And it looks as if Albertson’s monopolization strategy has worked. Here are the first several Google reviews about the local Vons, along with pictures.</p><blockquote><p>“The most expensive Vons in California is also in the worst physical condition,” wrote one reviewer. “Worn and missing floor tiles, empty shelves, rude employees etc…”</p><p>“This is effectively the only grocery store in town and seems to have a hard time keeping items in stock…”</p><p>“There were a lot of bare shelves and the vegetables looked well picked over. Got the 6 items that I wanted and tried to pay. Self check-out counters were all closed. There was only one cash register light on and NOBODY was there…”</p><p>“Definitely the worst and dirtiest Vons I've ever seen… It's clear the owners operate on the "only game in town" ethos. Losers...”</p><p>“Always a terrible experience at this store. Limited selection of items and saying the older female checker is surly is an understatement. She doesn't understand Vons and Safeway are the same, yelled at me for adding items to our order, refused to honor the digital coupon prices and told us to shop at Grocery Outlet…”</p><p>“Consensus among locals is that everything purchased here basically rots within a day or so of purchase…”</p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank"

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For adults in midlife, difficulty getting to sleep and waking up too early may accelerate brain atrophy that is associated with dementia.</p>

<p>The brain naturally begins to atrophy beginning in one’s 30s and 40s. But this can become much more pronounced with dementia and disorders like traumatic brain injury, stroke and, in some cases, multiple sclerosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if the cause of dementia is unrelated to sleep, it’s possible that poor sleep may advance or exacerbate cognitive symptoms.”</p>


</blockquote>

<p>To estimate the effects of sleep quality on the brain, the researchers surveyed approximately 600 adults on how well they slept. The participants were asked the same questions five years later and underwent brain scans 10 years after this.</p>

<p>The researchers used machine learning, leveraging data from the scans, to estimate the brain age of each participant based on the actual degree of brain shrinkage. They found that even after adjusting for age, sex, education, health and lifestyle factors, the brains of those participants who slept poorly were more atrophied than those who slept well.</p>

<p>Compared to the 70% of the sample who reported having little trouble sleeping, those with moderate difficulty (22%) had brains that were 1.6 years older, while those with the most difficulty (8%) had brains that were 2.6 years older.</p>

<p>The study publishes in <em><a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209988">Neurology</a></em> on Oct. 23.</p>

<p>“While we can’t say that poor sleep causes dementia, earlier research has established an association,” said first author <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/clemence.cavailles">Clémence Cavaillès</a>, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. “Even if the cause of dementia is unrelated to sleep, it’s possible that poor sleep may advance or exacerbate cognitive symptoms.”</p>

<p>The participants, who were 40 years old on average when they enrolled, were part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, which investigates the factors that influence cardiovascular disease, as well as how they may relate to dementia. They were asked about short sleep duration, poor quality of sleep, difficulty getting to sleep, difficulty staying asleep, early morning awakening and daytime sleepiness.</p>

<h2>Lack of sleep not a factor … or is it?</h2>

<p>Surprisingly, lack of sleep was not one of the characteristics relating to brain aging. “Sleep problems frequently emerge in midlife,” said Cavaillès. “They’re likely due to work stress, family caregiving and menopause,” she said. “Although the study found inadequate sleep duration was not an issue in brain atrophy in this study, we cannot say there is no association,” she said, noting that a previous CARDIA study showed that shorter sleep was associated with worse white matter integrity, indicating lower cognitive functioning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Future research should investigate the life-course effect of sleep on brain health in young populations.”</p>


</blockquote>

<p>Poor sleep that persisted over five years, especially when it related to difficulty getting to sleep and early morning awakening, was found to be highly relevant to brain aging.</p>

<p>“The study shows that poor sleep could be a target for early interventions to prevent possible cognitive decline,” said senior author <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/kristine.yaffe">Kristine Yaffe</a>, MD, of the UCSF departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Neurology, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics.</p>

<p>“Public health initiatives could include emphasizing sleep quality over quantity in midlife – and recognizing the long-term impact of poor sleep quality on the brain,” added Yaffe, who is a member of the first team of experts to determine that 30% of dementia risk is preventable. “Future research should investigate the life-course effect of sleep on brain health in young populations.”</p>

My research and practice was not centered enough on “AI” and “emerging technology” to fit within the institution; they wanted someone with more of an explicit emphasis on tech. My work in publishing, writing, web-design—and even my reproductive state—couldn’t possibly be separated from these things, but, more than any other effects AI may have on humanity in the future, this is one of the main effects now: people feel compelled to talk about it, and it’s a good way for sclerotic institutions to feel like they’re keeping up with the times. I smiled, thanked him, and left with an M&amp;M cookie.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Earlier this month, at the recommendation of a colleague, I registered to attend a Zoom seminar that boasted a discussion on “the future of design education and academia.” As the Zoom window expanded, I was met with a looping Pornhub threesome montage next to a side-screen grid of six or so designers front-facing the camera. The hosts clicked around, grunting and gasping as the camera cut to new angles and positions. I opened my department group chat and texted my colleagues </span><em>OH NO. DO NOT JOIN THE CALL.</em><span> The colleague who recommended the talk echoed me: </span><em>DO NOT LOG IN! SOMEONE Hacked their Zoom.</em></p><p>The hosts spoke to each other saying things like:</p><p><em>I think it’s you.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Wait. Oh wait. No.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>This type of thing happened all the time during Covid. So annoying.</em></p><p><em>Who is *bot-generated-username*?&nbsp;</em></p><p>It was a long two minutes before someone finally had the sense to end the call.&nbsp;</p><p><span>A few hours later, a nearby university, who employs one of the guest speakers, posted a carousel of screenshots on their Instagram page from the talk, which had apparently reconvened. The description read </span><em>Thanks to our Program Director ************** for an amazing panel discussion on the future of design education &amp; academia today!</em><span> 🚀</span></p><p>I tried to follow up with the panel about what happened, and received no reply.&nbsp;</p><p>The way this talk was handled reminded me that technology, for all its promise of connection and innovation, can have real and tangible repercussions if we’re not careful—it illuminates our fundamental responsibility to one another.</p><p><span>In “A Rant about Technology,” Ursula K. Le Guin says that technology is </span><em>how a society copes with physical reality</em><span>. That it </span><em>is the active human interface with the material world.</em><span> Technology is also a spoon. Technology is also language. Yet, I am shocked when AI does not stop Outlook Messenger from bursting confetti across my desktop in response to the </span><em>Congratulations</em><span> reply I receive when HR misreads my email about both adding and removing our late son from my health insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>As a 6th grader in a Dallas suburb, I attended a school assembly where a traveling speaker talked to us about sex. He said that sex was like fire. It was a life force. The discovery of fire sparked a massive advance of civilization. He told us that if we were not careful with fire, if we did not watch it closely and respect the power that it held, we could burn down a whole village. He told us to start a fire someday, but only with someone who you trusted to tend to it while you slept. I believe now that this same sort of diligence must also be extended to our use of technology.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This year I experienced many technological interventions to my body, as many do when they become pregnant. Of all the new ways to be measured and monitored, my favorite was when my sister-in-law, due just a few weeks before me, guessed my midsection's exact circumference with a piece of string. My least favorite was the transvaginal ultrasound. My OB in Virginia had a sort of nonchalance and slapstick humor to him that initially made me feel comfortable in his office. The temperature changed during my nine week appointment when he, quite unexpectedly, shook the ultrasound wand inside of me (with vigor!) in an attempt to wake the baby for the pictures. He mutter-yelled </span><em>Move little bugger. Move! </em><span>I looked to the nurse witness, who looked forward at the door. We received a letter in December that his practice would be closing in April. We received another at the end of summer telling us that he had died.</span></p><p><span>During this same pregnancy, another doctor does imaging on me, externally. With the wand in his hand in the almost pitch black room he tells us that there are two small and one moderate-sized holes in our son’s heart and that he will need to be rushed to surgery as soon as he is born. I am still fully reclined and covered in gel. He tells us to come back in two weeks. On his walk out of the room he hands us an information pamphlet where he drew on the back two versions of the human heart—one </span><em>normal</em><span>, one </span><em>our situation</em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Because of this experience, we transfer care to Massachusetts, where my husband’s family lives and works in the medical field. We navigate this with someone who is known as “The worldwide head of second opinion.” At the new hospital the gel is cleared off my belly each time. I cry in the ultrasound room as the video of the baby in my belly is labeled “practice breathing.” The sonographer walks us to a conference room where we’re met with cardiac specialists, social workers and obstetrics. Our meetings are prefaced with </span><em>This is going to be a hard conversation</em><span> and when we stand up to leave the room, we are encouraged to take the entire box of tissues with us. Someone even goes to the cupboard to get us a new box, of superior quality and softness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We are told that we may not get to meet him, but we do. The windowless OR looks perfectly encapsulated in pure even daylight. We have a team of thirty people and everyone knows the choreography. The anesthesiologist tells me that I may feel a shock of sorts before she administers a liquid into my spine. I am beaming. I feel strong and I wait for the shock. I squeal. The staff echos my laughter when I tell them that it feels like I sat on a firecracker. They had not heard that one before. The team yells out </span><em>Happy Birthday Henry!</em><span> as he is lifted from my abdominal cavity, screaming and alive. The anesthesiologist tells us with urgency to touch him and she guides our hands to meet his head through the dividing screen. I keep my fingers at the place he fogged the plastic as he is carried away to receive care.&nbsp;</span></p><p>While my layers are being stitched up, my husband notices that the TVs near the ceiling are screening the surgery from above. When a nurse sees him watching, they switch off the monitors. The birth was photographed by our social worker, who printed and laminated the images. A whole stack is waiting for us in our room on the meal tray when we return.</p><p>When I see him next, there is a whole room dedicated to beating his heart. I am wheeled to his side and told not to worry about the beeping, it is just an indication of a new switch to flip. That it is not as time sensitive as it sounds. Henry wraps his hand around my finger, then around the beak of his woodpecker Jellycat. He is on a high platform and adorned in wires and tubing like some sort of cybernetic king. One part of the room-machine spins constantly. It whirls and re-oxygenates the donor blood that has exited him in a slightly less vibrant shade of red than what entered.&nbsp;</p><p>He fights for two days. On his third, when he chooses peace, it is the quietest room I have ever endured. The cardiologist encloses us with the curtain and lets us stay as long as we can.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have a mass in Henry’s name. Afterward, family comes over. They bring food and two new pink babies. I hold my niece and keep checking that my hair does not wrap around her fingers. Our dog screams in the face of the two-year-old cousin, who seems completely unaffected. He says “dog” and pats him. He points to the angel on the mantle and says “Amen.” We set up a small box in the living room with photographs printed out from the hospital. As his mother, I feel protective of his image. I do not want people to look at him on their phones. I want to be in control of how he is seen in his corporeal form. I want people to sit on the couch and hold him, looking together at the same time and passing him around as they would any other baby. I become upset when I log in to Facebook for the first time in years, to sell a lamp, and see that some of our pictures from the hospital were posted to the family’s facebook group. I stew on this for a while, then release it when my husband reminds me about when they were posted, his first good day on the ECMO machine. We were two proud normal parents. They were asking the family for prayers.&nbsp;</p><p>During the next three months, I look at his pictures for fifteen minutes every three hours to trigger a milk letdown. I imagine kissing his head and can still taste his baptismal holy water on my lips. Smell the perfumed oil. I nurse a small machine all summer and a refrigerated car comes by to pick up the milk that will be processed, divided, and sent off to babies I will never know. My husband wakes up in the middle of the night to wash the flanges, label the bags, and place them in the freezer. At home, we keep a white noise machine of the ocean waves playing in the bedroom at all times. We have done this for years, but I only just now am paying attention to it. When my dog unplugs it, I notice its absence.</p><p>Earlier this spring my department chair threw me a baby shower. My students ate cupcakes and giggled as we failed to answer baby related pop-culture trivia from the 80’s. At the end of summer I send them a sad email to thank them for their patience last year and I ask for it again. This fall I sit in class with them, smiling as laughter bubbles from the corners of their mouths in response to the recording I play of Richard Brautigan reciting this poem:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><p><label contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label></p><pre><em>I like to think (and
the sooner the better!)
of a cybernetic meadow
where mammals and computers
live together in mutually
programming harmony
like pure water
touching clear sky.

I like to think
(right now, please!)
of a cybernetic forest
filled with pines and electronics
where deer stroll peacefully
past computers
as if they were flowers
with spinning blossoms.

I like to think
(it has to be!)
of a cybernetic ecology
where we are free of our labors
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace.</em></pre></div><p>I took part in another Zoom call this week. Henry’s cord blood was collected for research and after five months, the results came back. They were able to find the exact single gene mutation that caused his condition, and explained everything. They assured us that it was not our well water, or the time I had a fever for 15 minutes, or leptospirosis from cat-sitting, or that I ate an underdone yolk. The doctors said that with the variation he had, they were surprised that he was able to make it to two days old. My friend Mary texted me a message her late father used to say about heaven.&nbsp;</p><p><em>We are there before we’re born and God asks us if we want to come down to Earth even though it will be painful and hard. Seems Henry wanted badly to be yours and to meet you if only for a single shining day.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Neither my husband nor I carry this gene. And the doctors tell us that the same thing is unlikely to repeat. They clear us to try again this year.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Lately, my husband and I have been watching a lot of TV together. Football when we’re grading so we don’t have to see the Patriots lose. And movies at night. There is a scene in the film </span><em>Magnolia</em><span> by Paul Thomas Anderson where frogs begin falling from the sky. They drop to the pavement violently, cars crash, and there is a little boy sitting in a library at a desk looking out the window cracking a half smile in wonder. Shadows of amphibious bodies cast on the wall behind him as he says out loud </span><em>This happens. This is something that happens.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
		
<article>
	<p>Writing is one of the most powerful forms of communication, and it’s useful in a multitude of roles and contexts. As a <a href="https://rmoff.net/">blog-writing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Adocs+author%3Armoff+">documentation-authoring</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1587382202781913089">twitter-shitposting</a> DevEx engineer I spend a lot of my time writing. Recently, someone paid me a very nice compliment about a blog I’d written and asked how they could learn to write like me and what resources I’d recommend.</p>
<p>Never one to miss a chance to write and share something, here’s my response to this :)</p>
<p>To begin with I want to cover briefly the motivations behind writing.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-write">Why Do <strong>I</strong> Write?&nbsp;<a href="#why-do-i-write">🔗</a> </h2>
<p>Firstly, I like <strong>to share information</strong>. That could be a new <a href="https://rmoff.net/2021/03/04/quick-profiling-of-data-in-apache-kafka-using-kafkacat-and-visidata/">tool</a> or <a href="https://lakefs.io/blog/data-engineering-patterns-write-audit-publish/">technique</a> that I’ve learnt, <a href="https://rmoff.net/2020/09/30/setting-key-value-when-piping-from-jq-to-kafkacat/">a clever trick</a> I’ve discovered, or sometimes away from the technical and into the realms of <a href="https://rmoff.net/2019/02/09/travelling-for-work-with-kids-at-home/">life pondering</a> and <a href="https://rmoff.net/2023/05/23/what-does-this-devex-engineer-do/">navel gazing</a>. In the case of this very blog, it’s to share my thoughts on something that interests me. I could have written some notes and sent them directly back to the person who asked the original question, but if it was useful to them it’s hopefully useful to others—so therefore it’s worth writing up and publishing.</p>
<p>The second reason that I’ll write is <strong>to learn about something</strong>. It’s one thing to hand-wave one’s way through a presentation. It’s another to commit pen to paper (well, bytes to disk) and <a href="https://rmoff.net/2018/08/02/kafka-listeners-explained/">explain something</a>. Quite often I’ll realise that there’s a gap—or gaps—in my knowledge that I need to explore first before I can properly write about something, and that’s the very reason that I do it.</p>
<p>There are several pleasant side-effects from writing too. Anything in the public domain (such as your blog, but also open-source project documentation, etc) helps establish your credibility in an area and awareness by others of you. We may never reach the stratospheric heights of someone such as Kelsey Hightower, who has wowed a generation of developers with their <a href="https://youtu.be/HlAXp0-M6SY?t=718">Tetris-playing skills</a>, but being known as <em>that guy</em> who wrote a really useful blog that helped others is still a really nice feeling :)</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-write-for-developers">HOW do I Write for Developers?&nbsp;<a href="#how-do-i-write-for-developers">🔗</a> </h2>
<h3 id="-stop-watch-this-first-">🛑 STOP! Watch This First 🎥&nbsp;<a href="#-stop-watch-this-first-">🔗</a> </h3>
<p>Go and watch this excellent lecture called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM">The Craft of Writing Effectively</a>. It’s given by Larry McEnerney who is the Director of the University of Chicago’s Writing Program and knows a thing or two about writing. There are direct parallels between his observations on how and why academics communicate, and communication between developers.</p>
<p>👉🏻 I’ve seen it recommended several times but to my embarrassment, the length put me off—but I wish it hadn’t as it’s superb.</p>
<p><em>If you’d rather listen instead of watch you can use <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp"><code>yt-dlp</code></a> to download it as audio (<code>--extract-audio --audio-format mp3</code>).</em></p>
<h3 id="so-how-do-i-write-for-developers">So, how do I write for developers?&nbsp;<a href="#so-how-do-i-write-for-developers">🔗</a> </h3>
<p>Each writer will have their own approach to writing, and it will vary based on the audience and purpose too. A report for publication in an academic journey will have a different structure to a shitpost on Twitter. A blog aimed at developers will read very differently from the documentation from the depths of a product manual. Each medium and audience is valid; the knack is making sure that your writing lines up with it.</p>
<p>When I write I try to write for myself—a developer, interested in a thing. That could be a new technology, an in-depth explanation, a random musing on life, or anything else. Would I like to read the thing I’ve read? Does it avoid the pitfalls that plague the soulless bland crap that some companies churn out, stick an emoji on, and call developer marketing?</p>
<p>There are three key dimensions that it’s useful to consider here:</p>
<ul>
<li>clarity</li>
<li>personality (also called voice)</li>
<li>uniformity of content.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can roughly overlay these dimensions across the range of written materials that we might write:</p>
<img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/01.svg" width="600/">
<p>Things aren’t always so simple, and for some platforms in particular there’s quite a range:</p>
<img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/02.svg" width="600/">
<p>What do these different dimensions mean in practice? Let’s explore that.</p>
<h4 id="clarity-is-key">Clarity is Key&nbsp;<a href="#clarity-is-key">🔗</a> </h4>
<p>The first of these dimensions is pretty straightforward and shouldn’t really vary. Whatever you write, for whomever you write it, <strong>it has to be clear</strong>. Writing clearly means everything from sentence construction and paragraph breaks through to the structure of your article. It can be surprisingly hard to do but is crucial if you want to write material that people will <em>want</em> to read.</p>
<p>One neat trick when it comes to clarity is to remember that <em>what you leave out</em> is as important as what you leave in. This is going to be very context-specific. Documentation, by definition, should be comprehensive. A blog, on the other hand, might want to get to the point sooner and just provide a link to background material for the reader should they want it. Less is often more, as they say.</p>
<p>Some types of writing are going to have greater scope for individuality than others, but all have the potential to at least be accessible and clear. For example, just because you’re writing documentation doesn’t give you a pass to copy and paste the requirements doc in all its generic and obscure complexity. Write documentation that you as a developer would like to read. It can be complex and precise, yet still accessible.</p>
<h4 id="personality-and-voice">Personality and Voice&nbsp;<a href="#personality-and-voice">🔗</a> </h4>
<p>Should the ‘voice’ of the author be allowed to come through in the writing?</p>
<p>This is very much a sliding scale. I’ve jotted down <em>some</em> of the characteristics you might associate with either extreme of the scale. This is not to say that by definition you’d put cuss words into a blog so as to convey your voice—but as an example of something that you might see at that end of the spectrum and definitely not at the other.</p>
<img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/03.svg" height="300/">
<p>How you decide where to pitch your voice on this scale will come down to your preference, audience, and general area and discipline. If you spend much time on Twitter you’ll notice that InfoSec Twitter is different from DevOps Twitter, which is different again from DataEng Twitter. Each has its own cliques and customs, and also a varying range to which an author’s voice shines through in published writing.</p>
<p>You’ll generally find that generally writing mediums such as a project report to stakeholders or product documentation requires a neutral voice. That’s not to say <em>boring</em>, but it is to say that a certain uniformity is required. In the case of a project report, the message mustn’t be obscured by colloquialisms and the such. And can you imagine the cognitive dissonance if a set of documentation were written by multiple writers each looking to stamp their personality on the pages?</p>
<p>When we get to things like blogs and other types of writing we <em>deliberately</em> want to include some personality. How much is up to you to calibrate with your audience and yourself. There is a “Goldilocks” zone here—enough personality and genuine voice coming through to convince the reader that they are reading something that was written by someone who is actually interested and informed on the matter, but not so much that it gets in the way of the content.</p>
<h4 id="uniformity-and-standardisation">Uniformity and Standardisation&nbsp;<a href="#uniformity-and-standardisation">🔗</a> </h4>
<p>This has a strong relationship with personality and voice but relates a lot more to the structure and content of the material</p>
<img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/04.svg" height="300/">
<p>Using the example of blogs, you’ll find that blogs for a company or project are going to have a strong focus on the consistency of messaging and structure. There’ll be an introduction, there’ll be context; it’ll be comprehensive.</p>
<p>Compare that to a personal blog that may sometimes be not much more than the gutterings of a developer wanting to log an error message and solution for future Googlers. They <em>might</em> flesh it out into a longer article, but that’s not necessary for it still to have value.</p>
<h4 id="a-holistic-view">A Holistic View&nbsp;<a href="#a-holistic-view">🔗</a> </h4>
<p>It may seem like there’s going to be a linear relationship between the two dimensions. As we decrease the amount of personality coming through in an author’s writings, we’re also going to move towards a much more standardised set of writing.</p>
<p>I’d suggest that it’s not always the case.</p>
<p>A startup may value personality much more over standardisation, perhaps only really dropping the voice when it comes to something like documentation (and even then, perhaps not entirely).</p>
<img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/05.svg" height="300/">
<p>At the other end of the scale, some companies—usually large corporations—have the habit of squeezing the last inch of life out of any kind of writing, making the relationship a much different one.</p>
<p>Here there’s little voice even where you might hope to find it, and that rapidly drops off into nothing very soon after:</p>

<p>The wildcard within this is the social media teams of large companies who <em>are</em> given the remit to be <code>Funny</code> and <code>Engaging</code>, but this is usually outside the scope of developer writing and more into the field of <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/sassiest-responses-from-companies">condiments and fast food chains</a></p>
<h2 id="structuring-your-blog-writing">Structuring your Blog Writing&nbsp;<a href="#structuring-your-blog-writing">🔗</a> </h2>
<p>Like a favourite pair of jeans that’s well-worn, comfy, and slightly saggy round the arse, I have a go-to structure for writing. Come to think of it, I use it for lots of conference talks too. It looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell them what you’re going to tell them</li>
<li>Tell them</li>
<li>Tell them what you told them</li>
</ol>
<p>What this looks like in practice is something along these lines:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>An intro</strong></p>
<p>What is this thing, and why should the reader <del>give af</del> be interested?</p>
<p>This could be a brief explanation of why I am interested in it, or why you would want to read my take on it. The key thing is you’re relating to your audience here. Not everyone wants to read everything you write, and that’s ok.</p>
<p>Let people self-select out (or in, hopefully) at this stage, but make it nice and easy. For example, if you’re writing about data engineering, make it clear to the appdev crowd that they should move on as there’s nothing to see here (or stick around and learn something new, but as a visitor, not the target audience).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The article itself</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A recap</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you don’t just finish your article with a figurative mic drop—tie up it nicely with a bow (a 🙇🏻 or a 🎀, either works).</p>
<p>This is where marketing would like to introduce you to the acronym CTA (Call To Action) 😉. As an author you can decide how or if to weave that into your narrative.</p>
<p>Either way, you’re going to summarise what you just did and give people something to <em>do</em> with it next. Are there code samples they can go and run or inspect? A new service to sign up for? A video to watch? Or just a general life reflection upon which to ponder.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-the-physical-act-of-writing-jfdi--">✍🏻 The Physical Act of Writing: JFDI ;-)&nbsp;<a href="#-the-physical-act-of-writing-jfdi--">🔗</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/07.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At the risk of repeating the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl">owl meme</a> I would give the following advice: just start writing!</p>
<p>I don’t mean just go write an article. I mean start writing <strong>something</strong>, <strong><em>anything.</em></strong></p>
<p>Some notes, some snippets, some whole paragraphs. It might even look like this</p>
<p><img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/08.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The point is you now have <em>something</em>. The sections and threads of a story start to fall out as you write more. What starts as one section perhaps becomes two as you realise there are individual elements to tease out.</p>
<p>Iterate, iterate, and then iterate some more.</p>
<p>That random link you made a note of, where does it fit in what you want to say? Is it pushing the need for a new section or tangent, or is it actually not so relevant and you can park it? Not sure? Well just leave it there and think about it again on the next pass round.</p>
<p>I’ve recently found that using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro timer</a> is an effective way of getting me to focus, and to take a break. Instead of staring at a screen, descending into a pit of despair at the stagnation of an article, you spend a chunk of time and then step away. Perhaps you come back to it after the break or maybe wait longer. Like many problems in life, things resolve themselves given time to marinade in the recesses of one’s brain. That paragraph that just wouldn’t write itself will come spilling out of your eager fingers onto the keyboard. The section you thought you’d <em>nailed</em>—turns out you didn’t and it needs a rewrite. But all these things come with time and iteration through the text.</p>
<h2 id="find-a-really-good-reviewer-and-copyeditor">Find a really good reviewer and copyeditor&nbsp;<a href="#find-a-really-good-reviewer-and-copyeditor">🔗</a> </h2>
<p>You might think you’re good at writing. You’re probably not <em>that</em> good at writing that the eye of an excellent copyeditor won’t improve it, nor the tactful input of a good reviewer enhance it.</p>
<p>Good copyeditors will respect the voice that’s present in your writing and work to preserve it whilst improving the clarity and grammatical accuracy of what you’ve written.</p>
<p>Good reviewers will grok what you’re saying and help distil and mould it into a better shape.</p>

</ul>

<p><em>We’ve covered the why and the how - but what about the what?</em></p>
<p>What to write will often come from the “Why” above, but let’s imagine that the creative juices aren’t flowing and you still really want to get a blog written.</p>
<p>A really excellent place for ideas is the community around the thing you want to write about. Go and lurk (or even better, join in) at StackOverflow, Twitter, Slack, Discord…wherever the community is:</p>
<ul>
<li>What questions do people repeatedly ask?</li>
<li>What are the anti-patterns and misunderstandings that you see?</li>
<li>What are the new trends?</li>
<li>What cool things can you do with <code>$THING</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, if it would be interesting to me then I would write about it.</p>
<p>Make sure to also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM">this lecture</a> in which the concept of <em>value</em> and <em>ideas</em> is discussed. tl;dr if you aren’t writing about something interesting to the reader, it has no value, regardless of its value to you.</p>
<h3 id="what-not-to-write">What Not to Write?&nbsp;<a href="#what-not-to-write">🔗</a> </h3>
<p>This is a <em>very</em> personal preference. I’m not keen at all on growth-driven blogging styles. You know the sort: listicles, SEO bait, etc. It’s low-grade, developers see through it, and it tarnishes the blogger’s image IMHO. That said, if you write a good blog, there’s no reason not to structure it such (“<em>Top Five Tips for Successful Developer Writing</em>”) but put the horse before the cart, not the other way around.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="recap">Recap&nbsp;<a href="#recap">🔗</a> </h2>
<p>To summarise this whole article, bear in mind that these two statements are not mutually exclusive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write for yourself. Work out what <em>you</em> would like to read, and write it.</li>
<li>Think of the reader and what value you’re providing to them in your writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s because as a developer writing for developers, you <strong>are</strong> the reader.</p>
<p>Oh, and did you watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM">Larry McEnerney’s lecture</a> yet? 😊</p>

<p>Contemporary high-level programming languages and advanced compilers greatly simplify software development and lower its costs. However, this way of programming can hide the performance capabilities of modern hardware, partly due to inefficiencies of application programming interfaces (APIs). Apparently, a good old assembly code path can improve performance by between three and 94 times, depending on the workload, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/FFmpeg/status/1852542388851601913" data-url="https://x.com/FFmpeg/status/1852542388851601913" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">FFmpeg</a>. The hardware this multiplied performance was achieved on was not disclosed.</p><p>FFmpeg is an open-source video decoding project developed by volunteers who contribute to its codebase, fix bugs, and add new features. The project is led by a small group of core developers and maintainers who oversee its direction and ensure that contributions meet certain standards. They coordinate the project's development and release cycles, merging contributions from other developers. This group of developers tried to implement a handwritten AVX512 assembly code path, something that has rarely been done before, at least not in the video industry.</p><p>The developers have created an optimized code path using the AVX-512 instruction set to accelerate specific functions within the FFmpeg multimedia processing library. By leveraging AVX-512, they were able to achieve significant performance improvements — from three to 94 times faster — compared to standard implementations. AVX-512 enables processing large chunks of data in parallel using 512-bit registers, which can handle up to 16 single-precision FLOPS or 8 double-precision FLOPS in one operation. This optimization is ideal for compute-heavy tasks in general, but in the case of video and image processing in particular.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark">benchmarking</a> results show that the new handwritten AVX-512 code path performs considerably faster than other implementations, including baseline C code and lower SIMD instruction sets like AVX2 and SSSE3. In some cases, the revamped AVX-512 codepath achieves a speedup of nearly 94 times over the baseline, highlighting the efficiency of hand-optimized assembly code for AVX-512.</p><p>This development is particularly valuable for users running on high-performance, AVX-512-capable hardware, enabling them to process media content far more efficiently. There is an issue, though: Intel disabled AVX-512 for its Core 12th, 13th, and 14th Generations of Core processors, leaving owners of these CPUs without them. On the other hand, AMD's Ryzen 9000-series CPUs feature a fully-enabled AVX-512 FPU so the owners of these processors can take advantage of the FFmpeg achievement.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the complexity and specialized nature of AVX-512, such optimizations are typically reserved for performance-critical applications and require expertise in low-level programming and processor microarchitecture.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SDpvGFrC3qiFsDcJ94h8pj"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>
