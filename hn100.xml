<p>                    An operating system is the most personal part of a "personal" computer, and it used to be that as a Windows user I didn't feel like I was renting my computer from Microsoft, but in recent years that feeling has all but evaporated. To me, Windows feels cheaper and more commercial than ever, and that's not a recipe for a good user experience.

                        The Offline Glory Days of Windows
               </h2>
<p>                    The first version of Windows I ever used, coming from MS-DOS, was Windows 3.1. While Windows 3.1 might look incredibly primitive today, it's hard to explain just how big of a leap this was for a kid who had to memorize the Command Line instructions just to play some games. Things didn't really kick off for me until Windows 95 and our first taste of the internet, but even then, 99% of my Windows time up until Windows 7 was spent disconnected from the net.

<p>                    In retrospect, this was actually a good thing in some ways, because it meant that Microsoft couldn't remotely mess with my Windows installation. Patches and updates came in the form of Windows service packs, and those were on actual physical floppy disks or CD-ROMs. If my computer worked yesterday, and I didn't change anything myself, it would almost certainly keep working until I inadvertently broke it myself.
    </p>

    
<p>                    Now that Windows is almost always online, my "personal" computer experience is feeling quite a bit less personal.

                                    <p>Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek</p>
                        </div>

<p>                    If you bought a laptop or a pre-built computer you probably didn't think much about the price of Windows, but the fact is that Windows has never been an inexpensive operating system. As someone who has almost always built their own computer, I'm keenly aware that this software cost a significant amount of money. Which is why I and many other people were a little irked when Windows started introducing <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/windows-11-start-menu-ads-how-to-turn-them-off/">advertising</a> and writing guides on <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-disable-microsofts-ads-and-recommendations-in-windows-11/">how to turn off advertising in Windows</a> became a popular new pastime for us tech bloggers.
    </p>

    
<p>                    Basically, it now feels like Windows is partly subsidized by advertising, and regular users can't just have the operating system they paid for without being sold more software and services. It's not (yet) the most egregious way to go about it, but for someone who prefers absolute minimilism in their computer interfaces, it's not working for my feng shui.

    <h2 id="updates-breaking-my-pc">
                        Updates Breaking My PC
               </h2>
<p>                    At this point, I have lost count of the number of times that I've left my perfectly working Windows computer at the end of my work day, only to return to a completely broken computer that won't boot the next morning. We have numerous articles at How-To Geek on how to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/">stop Windows from updating</a>, and the mere fact that readers are searching for this information should tell you something.
    </p>

    
<p>                    Forced, automatic Windows updates seem inevitable now, and with every workaround people come up with, the loopholes are closed. Updates can be delayed, but not deferred. Resistance is futile. Which is why I find it hard to even trust Windows to run a Plex server or a NAS, because inevitably it will reboot the computer without asking me first.

                        Leave My Settings Alone, Microsoft
               </h2>
<p>                    When I have my computer set up a certain way, I'd like it to stay that way permanently. Yet search the forums on sites like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/n1hoz0/windows_please_stop_changing_my_settings_with/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> or Microsoft's own <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-updates-keeps-changing-my-settings/1870494e-b7be-41a8-84e6-d2e7e55c88d5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">community forums</a>, and you'll find numerous complaints about settings changing after updates. It can be innocuous stuff or more serious or impactful things, such as privacy settings. If anyone is going to flip the switches on my computer to control how it behaves and what's allowed, it should be me.

<p>                    My constant technical issues with Windows 10 updates eventually led me to switch to macOS back in 2019, and the difference in user experience is stark. You won't find bright garish ads for games or apps anywhere except for the actual App Store, which is where they belong. Intrusive "notifications" that are <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/windows-has-a-new-annoying-popup-for-microsoft-edge/">really just advertising</a>? I haven't encountered that on macOS yet!
    </p>

    
<p>                    Honestly, it might sound weird, but macOS feels like the offline Windows experience of old to me. In fact, the operating system tends to stay classy and out of my way as far as possible. I've been thinking that the common complaint that Macs cost too much for the hardware you get misses the fact that you are <em>also </em>paying for the software. You get macOS and several other full-fat apps, such as the iWork suite, Garageband, and iMovie included in the price of entry. You pay more now, and don't have annoying monetization efforts later.
    </p>

    
<p>                    When I use my Windows 11 laptop (which was more expensive than my Mac, mind you), it feels like those Amazon Kindles that are subsidized by ad money. Except, at least Amazon gave us the choice.
    </p>

    <h2 id="linux-respects-its-users">
                        Linux Respects Its Users
               </h2>
<p>                    The other major player here is of course Linux in all its varied distributions. Here you are literally getting the operating system for free. The closest that a distro of Linux has come to punting ads was when plugs for software showed up in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/hfs4v9/ubuntu_is_putting_ads_in_their_motd_now/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ubuntu Message of the Day</a> and more recently a sort-of "ad" for <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/10/ubuntu-pro-terminal-ad" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ubuntu Pro</a> in the terminal. If anyone knows of other examples of native ads in a Linux distro, I'd love to hear about it in the comments.
    </p>

    
<p>                    I've had an on-again-off-again relationship with Linux over the years, and daily drove it during seven years of university, and never did I feel that I was being exploited or not in control. In fact, I was probably in too much control, which is why you can break Linux in so many creative ways just by being a dummy.

                        Can Windows Make a Comeback?
               </h2>
<p>                    More and more, I feel like Windows is just becoming a loss-leading front-end for Microsoft to sell its many software-as-a-service products. They don't even do anything if you <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-get-windows-11-free/">don't activate Windows</a> other than block wallpaper changes and put a tiny watermark in the corner. You can be sure you can still subscribe to their services even if you didn't pay for Windows!
    </p>

    <hr>
<p>                    I really hope there will be some way in the future to get a version of Windows (that's not for enterprise users) which gives you the choice to have Microsoft butt out of the daily running, appearance, and settings of your computer. I hate to even suggest it, but I might even be willing to pay for an "ad-free" or "hands-off" version of the OS. Will this happen, or will Windows continue to slowly turn into a twisted Black Mirror version of itself? As someone who actually likes Windows, I sure hope it can turn that corner.

<p>As a result <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/publishers-beat-internet-archive-as-judge-rules-e-book-lending-violates-copyright/">of book publishers successfully suing the Internet Archive</a> (IA) last year, the free online library that strives to keep growing online access to books recently shrank by about 500,000 titles.</p>
<p>IA <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/06/17/let-readers-read/">reported</a> in a blog post this month that publishers abruptly forcing these takedowns triggered a "devastating loss" for readers who depend on IA to access books that are otherwise impossible or difficult to access.</p>
<p>To restore access, IA is now appealing, hoping to reverse the prior court's decision by convincing the US Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit that IA's <a href="https://archive.org/details/controlled-digital-lending-explained">controlled digital lending</a> of its physical books should be considered fair use under copyright law. An April <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.60988/gov.uscourts.ca2.60988.259.0.pdf">court filing</a> shows that IA intends to argue that the publishers have no evidence that the e-book market has been harmed by the open library's lending, and copyright law is better served by allowing IA's lending than by preventing it.</p>
<p>"We use industry-standard technology to prevent our books from being downloaded and redistributed—the same technology used by corporate publishers," Chris Freeland, IA's director of library services, wrote in the blog. "But the publishers suing our library say we shouldn’t be allowed to lend the books we own. They have forced us to remove more than half a million books from our library, and that’s why we are appealing."</p>
<p>IA will have an opportunity to defend its practices when oral arguments start in its appeal on June 28.</p>
<p>"Our position is straightforward; we just want to let our library patrons borrow and read the books we own, like any other library," Freeland wrote, while arguing that the "potential repercussions of this lawsuit extend far beyond the Internet Archive" and publishers should just "let readers read."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"This is a fight for the preservation of all libraries and the fundamental right to access information, a cornerstone of any democratic society," Freeland wrote. "We believe in the right of authors to benefit from their work; and we believe that libraries must be permitted to fulfill their mission of providing access to knowledge, regardless of whether it takes physical or digital form. Doing so upholds the principle that knowledge should be equally and equitably accessible to everyone, regardless of where they live or where they learn."</p>
<h2>Internet Archive fans beg publishers to end takedowns</h2>
<p>After publishers won an injunction stopping IA's digital lending, which "limits what we can do with our digitized books," IA's <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/why-are-so-many-books-listed-as-borrow-unavailable-at-the-internet-archive/">help page</a> said, the open library started shrinking. While "removed books are still available to patrons with print disabilities," everyone else has been cut off, causing many books in IA's collection to show up as "Borrow Unavailable."</p>
<p>Ever since, IA has been "inundated" with inquiries from readers all over the world searching for the removed books, Freeland said. And "we get tagged in social media every day where people are like, 'why are there so many books gone from our library'?" Freeland told Ars.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/let-readers-read-an-open-letter-to-the-publishers-in-hachette-v-internet-archive">open letter</a> to publishers signed by nearly 19,000 supporters, IA fans begged publishers to reconsider forcing takedowns and quickly restore access to the lost books.</p>
<p>Among the "far-reaching implications" of the takedowns, IA fans counted the negative educational impact of academics, students, and educators—"particularly in underserved communities where access is limited—who were suddenly cut off from "research materials and literature that support their learning and academic growth."</p>
<p>They also argued that the takedowns dealt "a serious blow to lower-income families, people with disabilities, rural communities, and LGBTQ+ people, among many others," who may not have access to a local library or feel "safe accessing the information they need in public."</p>
<p>"Your removal of these books impedes academic progress and innovation, as well as imperiling the preservation of our cultural and historical knowledge," the letter said.</p>
<p>"This isn't happening in the abstract," Freeland told Ars. "This is real. People no longer have access to a half a million books."</p>

<p><strong>BARCELONA’S city council has announced it will revoke all licenses for tourist apartments in the urban area by 2028.</strong></p>
<p>In a major win for anti-tourist activists, Barcelona’s socialist mayor Jaume Collboni announced on Friday that licenses for 10,101 tourist apartments in the city will automatically end in November 2028.</p>
<p>The move represents a crushing blow for Airbnb, Booking.com and other tenants and a triumph for locals who have protested about over-tourism and rising house prices for years.</p>
<p>Announcing the move, Collboni said the rising cost of property in the city – rental and purchase prices have risen by 70% and 40% respectively in the last decade – had forced him to take drastic action.</p>
<p>He said: “We cannot allow it that most young people who leave home are forced to leave Barcelona. The measures we have taken will not change the situation in one day. These things take time. But with these measures we are reaching a turning point”.</p>

<p>The deputy mayor for Urban Planning, Laia Bonet, hailed the move as the ‘equivalent of building 10,000 new flats’ which can be used by locals for residential use.</p>
<p>Local officials say that tenants will not be compensated because the move, which will have to be passed with political support, has de-facto compensation by giving owners a four-year window before licences expire. </p>
<p>Alongside the revoking of tourist flat licenses, Collboni announced that new legislation would force building constructors to allocate at least 30% of new homes to social housing.</p>
<p>The measures are designed to alleviate pressure on a housing market which has seen sharp price rises in recent years, forcing many residents to leave the urban area for the suburbs and beyond.</p>
<p>Speaking to the <em>Olive Press </em>at an anti-tourist rally on Tuesday, one Barcelona resident, who gave his name as Alex, said locals were angry at the ‘massification of tourism’ with ‘the cost of living and housing forcing many young people to emigrate from the city centre to the suburbs and nearby towns’.</p>
<p>He added: “The people of Barcelona, like any city in the UK and elsewhere, have the right to live peacefully in their own city. What we need is a better quality of life, decent wages and, above all, an affordable city to live in”. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Aster shootdown over Sydney in 1955"><div><p>FOR more than three hours on a fine, calm August morning in 1955, the eyes of Sydney’s suburbia were fixed skyward, anxiously watching the flight of a pilotless Auster aeroplane as it circled above and headed from Bankstown to the City, pursued by Service aircraft.</p>
<p>It was school holiday time, the alert had gone out over the radio, and the mums had herded in their children, police patrolled areas by car, cycle and foot, firemen stood by their tenders, ambulance men remained on the alert and firefloats stood in readiness in the harbour . . . all eyes still looked up . . . no one knew when or where the plane might suddenly come hurtling down.</p>
<p>The end came – thankfully five miles off the coast – when two Navy Sea Furies opened fire on the Auster. which levelled out pouring smoke, then started down in a slow spiral. The two Navy pilots followed it down, firing two or three more short bursts on the way and with a splash, the errant aircraft, still in one piece, hit the water at 1142 and disappeared. It was all over!</p>
<p>The media had a field day . . with such newspaper headings as “Possible disaster in flight”, and “Thousands watch air drama of flyaway plane”, reaching the overseas press. Politicians asked embarassing questions and crit-icism of the Services followed as did a Department of Civil Aviation enquiry … but how, when and why did it happen?</p>
<p>On the morning of August 30, 1955. Mr Anthony Thrower, aged 30, of Granville, Sydney, rented an Auster from Kingsford Smith Aviation School He had completed only one circuit of his planned one hour practice when the engine failed 10 feet from the ground. Landing the plane in the middle of the strip he climbed out, swung the propellor by hand (there was no self-starter) and the engine immediately roared into life. In a million-to-one chance the brake failed to hold and although pilot Thrower grabbed a wing strut to check the plane he was quickly forced to jump clear, just avoiding the tail. Aided by a favourable south-east wind with well trimmed controls, the pilotless plane sped across the strip and became airborne. It then narrowly missed the control tower, which was subsequently evacuated, and other airport buildings then slowly circled the aerodrome at low altitude After continuing right hand circuits of Bankstown for a further 15 minutes the Auster steadily gained height and began drifting towards the city.</p>
<p>Bankstown Aerodrome officials alerted control personnel at Mascot who broadcast a general alarm to all aircraft as well as the police and other Government organisations. One report stated that a schoolboy might be at the controls. The police radio station at Bourke Street broadcast at almost one minute intervals the plane’s last known whereabouts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Commander J. R. W. Groves, RAN, was returning to Schofields aerodrome from exercises, with three other personnel onboard. At 0850 the Navy Auster was alerted by Mascot of the runaway plane. Nearing Bankstown they saw it at 1500ft and climbing in tight circles. Approaching to within 50 yards it was noted to be unoccupied and that the controls were fixed in the one position. The Navy lightplane continued to pursue the unmanned aircraft as it gained height passing over the Sydney suburbs of Punchbowl, Bexley, Hurstville, Rockdale, Mascot, Alexandria, Redfern and finally arriving above the centre of the city about 9.30 am.</p>
<p>In the meantime anxious mothers in suburbs where the plane passed over herded children, who were on school holidays, into their homes. Police patrolled areas by car, cycle and foot. Firemen stood by their trucks and ambulance officers remained on the alert, and firefloats stood in readiness in the harbour. No one knew when or where the plane might suddenly come hurtling down.</p>
<p>By 0953 the Auster was over Vaucluse at 5000 feet. RAAF Wirraway A20-728 departed Richmond at 1010 to join the chase. Onboard was Wing Commander D.R. Beattie and Squadron Leader Tom James. The target was contacted at 1020, 2½ miles offshore and now at an altitude of 7000 ft. Instructions were then received that they were not to open fire until the Auster was five miles offshore and there were no fishing or coastal boats below. The runaway plane continued climbing in tight orbit to 10,300ft and at 1045 hours reached a point estimated at five miles from the coast.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/Wirraway-300x156.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="156" srcset="https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/Wirraway-300x156.jpg 300w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/Wirraway-150x78.jpg 150w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/Wirraway-120x62.jpg 120w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/Wirraway.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Two firing passes were then made with the hand held Bren gun from the rear cockpit without any noticeable effect. Before departing the Wirraway rear canopy and fairing had been removed and Squadron Leader James was so cold, it was minus five degrees celcius – that he was unable to change the magazine and his hands were sticking to the gum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a RAAF Meteor had arrived from Williamtown near Newcastle and after directing it to the target the Wirraway broke off the attack and returned to Richmond. The Navy Auster, which had now been airborne some 3¼ hours, headed for its base at Schofields at about the same time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/20200914raaf8622332_07-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/20200914raaf8622332_07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/20200914raaf8622332_07-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/20200914raaf8622332_07-150x100.jpg 150w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/20200914raaf8622332_07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/20200914raaf8622332_07-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/20200914raaf8622332_07-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/20200914raaf8622332_07-120x80.jpg 120w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/20200914raaf8622332_07-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>But luck was not with the RAAF that day. Firstly a Meteor piloted by Squadron Leader Holdsworth, had been delayed some 13 minutes on departure when a Sabre preceding his departure, had burst a tyre on landing and obstructed the runway. Then after arriving in the target area, and in the Meteor’s initial firing pass from the rear, both cannons jammed after only a few rounds had been fired. Some strikes were observed on the starboard plane of the Auster.</p>
<p>Squadron Leader Holdsworth then requested that two more Meteors be sent and the reply was received that they were on the way in addition to two Sea Furies from the Naval Air Station at Nowra. While awaiting their arrival A77-80 made four passes directly below the runaway Auster and pulled up sharply in an attempt to dislodge it from its flight path and into a dive. However, the jet wash was not sufficient and the plane continued in the same determined fashion.</p>
<p>Sea Furies from 805 Squadron Nowra appeared on the scene at 1135 and were piloted by Lieutenants J.R. Bluett and Peter McNay (both aged 26), of the Royal Navy, who were on exchange duty in Australia. LEUT McNay lowered his flaps to slow down and approached to within 100 yards of the target to again confirm it was unoccupied. Then, pulling up astern he gave it a short burst from his four cannons. LEUT Bluett followed this with a beam-on attack and after about 15 rounds. a great sheet of flame rose from the cockpit. From the first strikes on the Auster until the time it hit the sea was 1½ minutes.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/Astershootdown.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="506" srcset="https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/Astershootdown.jpg 356w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/Astershootdown-211x300.jpg 211w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/Astershootdown-106x150.jpg 106w, https://navyhistory.au/wp-content/uploads/Astershootdown-120x171.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px"></p>
<p>At 1145 a police broadcast announced “the Auster has been shot down. It’s all over.” The barrage of calls from anxious enquirers gradually subsided at the police, newspaper and radio station switchboards throughout Sydney.</p>
<p>When the Navy Sea Furies returned to Nowra, enthusiastic groundstaff quickly painted a small yellow silhouette representing an Auster on the fuselage of LEUT Bluett’s plane. This 26-year-old British pilot had seen eight months’ action in the Korean war from HMS GLORY on ground attack. LEUT McNay had only been in Australia eight months after completing his training in England.</p>
<p>The incident did not quickly subside here. Embarrassing questions were directed in Federal Parliament to. the Government of the day by both Mr C Chambers (Member for Adelaide) and Mr F Daly (Grayndler) during the Budget debate the following month. They asked why was so much money being spent on defence to an Air Force and Navy that took over two hours to shoot down an unarmed light aircraft?</p>
<p>Aviation authorities stated that nearly “dead calm” weather had probably prevented a major disaster as the Auster could have crashed anywhere on its route had it been a windy day. The then Department of Civil Aviation held an enquiry.</p>
<p>The harsh criticism against the Services was unfounded though and despite some initial bad luck the Navy and Air Force had performed creditably on a difficult and elusive “ENEMY”. In addition they were provided with an exciting Tuesday morning over and around Sydney with a free but stubborn target to practise on.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Battery research is focusing on lithium chemistries so much that one could imagine that the battery future lies solely in lithium. There are good reasons to be optimistic as lithium-ion is, in many ways, superior to other chemistries. Applications are growing and are encroaching into markets that previously were solidly held by lead acid, such as standby and load leveling. Many satellites are also powered by Li-ion.</p>
<p>Lithium-ion has not yet fully matured and is still improving. Notable advancements have been made in longevity and safety while the capacity is increasing incrementally. Today, Li-ion meets the expectations of most consumer devices but applications for the EV need further development before this power source will become the accepted norm. <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-104c-the-octagon-battery-what-makes-a-battery-a-battery">BU-104c: The Octagon Battery</a> – What makes a Battery a Battery, describes the stringent requirements a battery must meet.</p>

<h3><strong>What Causes Lithium-ion to Age?</strong></h3>
<p>The lithium-ion battery works on ion movement between the positive and negative electrodes. In theory such a mechanism should work forever, but cycling, elevated temperature and aging decrease the performance over time. Manufacturers take a conservative approach and specify the life of Li-ion in most consumer products as being between 300 and 500 discharge/charge cycles.</p>
<p>In 2020, small wearable batteries deliver about 300 cycles whereas modern smartphones have a cycle life requirement is 800 cycles and more. The largest advancements are made in <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-1003-electric-vehicle-ev">EV batteries</a> with talk about the one-million-mile battery representing 5,000 cycles.</p>
<p>Evaluating battery life on counting cycles is not conclusive because a discharge may vary in depth and there are no clearly defined standards of what constitutes a cycle(See <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-501-basics-about-discharging">BU-501: Basics About Discharging</a>). In lieu of cycle count, some device manufacturers suggest battery replacement on a date stamp, but this method does not take usage into account. A battery may fail within the allotted time due to heavy use or unfavorable temperature conditions; however, most packs last considerably longer than what the stamp indicates.</p>
<p>The performance of a battery is measured in capacity, a leading health indicator. Internal resistance and self-discharge also play roles, but these are less significant in predicting the end of battery life with modern Li-ion.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong><strong>igure 1</strong> illustrates the capacity drop of 11 Li-polymer batteries that have been cycled at a Cadex laboratory. The 1,500mAh pouch cells for mobile phones were first charged at a current of 1,500mA (1C) to 4.20V/cell and then allowed to saturate to 0.05C (75mA) as part of the full charge saturation. The batteries were then discharged at 1,500mA to 3.0V/cell, and the cycle was repeated. The expected capacity loss of Li-ion batteries was uniform over the delivered 250 cycles and the batteries performed as expected.<strong><br></strong></p>
<figure><strong><img src="https://batteryuniversity.com/img/content/lithium1.jpg" alt="Capacity drop as part of cycling"></strong><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Capacity drop as part of cycling <sup>[1]</sup></strong></figcaption></figure>
<p>Eleven new Li-ion were tested on a Cadex C7400 battery analyzer. All packs started at a capacity of 88–94% and decreased to 73–84% after 250 full discharge cycles. The 1500mAh pouch packs are used in mobile phones.</p>
<p>Although a battery should deliver 100 percent capacity during the first year of service, it is common to see lower than specified capacities, and shelf life may contribute to this loss. In addition, manufacturers tend to overrate their batteries, knowing that very few users will do spot-checks and complain if low. Not having to match single cells in mobile phones and tablets, as is required in multi-cell packs, opens the floodgates for a much broader performance acceptance. Cells with lower capacities may slip through cracks without the consumer knowing.</p>
<p>Similar to a mechanical device that wears out faster with heavy use, the depth of discharge (DoD) determines the cycle count of the battery. The smaller the discharge (low DoD), the longer the battery will last. If at all possible, avoid full discharges and charge the battery more often between uses. Partial discharge on Li-ion is fine. There is no memory and the battery does not need periodic full discharge cycles to prolong life. The exception may be a periodic calibration of the fuel gauge on a smart battery or intelligent device(See <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-603-how-to-calibrate-a-smart-battery">BU-603: How to Calibrate a “Smart” Battery</a>)</p>

<p>Lithium-ion suffers from stress when exposed to heat, so does keeping a cell at a high charge voltage. A battery dwelling above 30°C (86°F) is considered <em>elevated temperature</em> and for most Li-ion a voltage above 4.10V/cell is deemed as <em>high voltage</em>. Exposing the battery to high temperature and dwelling in a full state-of-charge for an extended time can be more stressful than cycling. <strong>Table 3</strong> demonstrates capacity loss as a function of temperature and SoC.<br></p>

<figcaption><strong>Table 3: Estimated recoverable capacity when storing Li-ion for one year at various temperatures</strong><br>Elevated temperature hastens permanent capacity loss. Not all Li-ion systems behave the same.</figcaption>
<p> Most Li-ions charge to 4.20V/cell, and every reduction in peak charge voltage of 0.10V/cell is said to double the cycle life. For example, a lithium-ion cell charged to 4.20V/cell typically delivers 300–500 cycles. If charged to only 4.10V/cell, the life can be prolonged to 600–1,000 cycles; 4.0V/cell should deliver 1,200–2,000 and 3.90V/cell should provide 2,400–4,000 cycles.</p>
<p>On the negative side, a lower peak charge voltage reduces the capacity the battery stores. As a simple guideline, every 70mV reduction in charge voltage lowers the overall capacity by 10 percent. Applying the peak charge voltage on a subsequent charge will restore the full capacity.</p>
<p>In terms of longevity, the optimal charge voltage is 3.92V/cell. Battery experts believe that this threshold eliminates all voltage-related stresses; going lower may not gain further benefits but induce other symptoms(See <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808b-what-causes-li-ion-to-die">BU-808b: What causes Li-ion to die?</a>) <strong>Table 4</strong> summarizes the capacity as a function of charge levels.

<figcaption><strong>Table 4: Discharge cycles and capacity as a function of charge voltage limit</strong><br></figcaption>
<p>Every 0.10V drop below 4.20V/cell doubles the cycle but holds less capacity. Raising the voltage above 4.20V/cell would shorten the life. The readings reflect regular Li-ion charging to 4.20V/cell.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline:</strong> Every 70mV drop in charge voltage lowers the usable capacity by about 10%.<br><strong>Note: </strong>Partial charging negates the benefit of Li-ion in terms of high specific energy.</p>
<p><em><em><strong>*</strong> Similar life cycles apply for batteries with different voltage levels on full charge.</em><strong><br>**</strong> Based on a new battery with 100% capacity when charged to the full voltage.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Experiment:</strong> Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, reports that using a reduced charge level of 50% SOC increases the lifetime expectancy of the vehicle Li-ion battery by 44–130%.</em></p>
<p><br>Most chargers for mobile phones, laptops, tablets and digital cameras charge Li-ion to 4.20V/cell. This allows maximum capacity, because the consumer wants nothing less than optimal runtime. Industry, on the other hand, is more concerned about longevity and may choose lower voltage thresholds. Satellites and electric vehicles are such examples.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, many lithium-ions cannot exceed 4.20V/cell. (Some NMC are the exception.) While a higher voltage boosts capacity, exceeding the voltage shortens service life and compromises safety. <strong>Figure 5</strong> demonstrates cycle count as a function of charge voltage. At 4.35V, the cycle count of a regular Li-ion is cut in half.<strong><br></strong></p>
<figure><strong><img src="https://batteryuniversity.com/img/content/lithium2.jpg" alt="Effects on cycle life at elevated charge voltages"></strong><figcaption><strong>Figure 5: Effects on cycle life at elevated charge voltages <sup>[2]</sup></strong><br>Higher charge voltages boost capacity but lowers cycle life and compromises safety.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides selecting the best-suited voltage thresholds for a given application, a regular Li-ion should not remain at the high-voltage ceiling of 4.20V/cell for an extended time. The Li-ion charger turns off the charge current and the battery voltage reverts to a more natural level. This is like relaxing the muscles after a strenuous exercise(See <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/charging-lithium-ion-batteries">BU-409: Charging Lithium-ion</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6</strong> illustrates dynamic stress tests (DST) reflecting capacity loss when cycling Li-ion at various charge and discharge bandwidths. The largest capacity loss occurs when discharging a fully charged Li-ion to 25 percent SoC (black); the loss would be higher if fully discharged. Cycling between 85 and 25 percent (green) provides a longer service life than charging to 100 percent and discharging to 50 percent (dark blue). The smallest capacity loss is attained by charging Li-ion to 75 percent and discharging to 65 percent. This, however, does not fully utilize the battery. High voltages and exposure to elevated temperature is said to degrade the battery quicker than cycling under normal condition. (<a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808b-what-causes-li-ion-to-die">Nissan Leaf case</a>)<br></p>

<p><em><span><strong>* </strong></span>Discrepancies exist between <strong>Table 2</strong> and <strong>Figure 6 </strong>on cycle count. No clear explanations are available other than assuming differences in battery quality and test methods. Variances between low-cost consumer and durable industrial grades may also play a role. Capacity retention will decline more rapidly at elevated temperatures than at 20ºC.</em><br></p>
<p>Only a full cycle provides the specified energy of a battery. With a modern <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/discharge-characteristics-li">Energy Cell</a>, this is about 250Wh/kg, but the cycle life will be compromised. All being linear, the life-prolonging mid-range of 85-25 percent reduces the energy to 60 percent and this equates to moderating the specific energy density from 250Wh/kg to 150Wh/kg. Mobile phones are consumer goods that utilize the full energy of a battery. Industrial devices, such as the EV, typically limit the charge to 85% and discharge to 25%, or 60 percent energy usability, to prolong battery life(See <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/why-mobile-phone-batteries-do-not-last-as-long-as-an-ev-battery">Why Mobile Phone Batteries do not last as long as an EV Battery</a>)</p>
<p>Increasing the cycle depth also raises the internal resistance of the Li-ion cell. <strong>Figure 7 </strong>illustrates a sharp rise at a cycle depth of 61 percent measured with the DC resistance method(See also <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/rising-internal-resistance">BU-802a: How does Rising Internal Resistance affect Performance?</a>) The resistance increase is permanent.</p>
<figure><strong><img src="https://batteryuniversity.com/img/content/equivalent_full_cycles.jpg" alt="Sharp rise in internal resistance by increasing cycle depth of Li-ion"></strong><figcaption><strong>Figure 7: Sharp rise in internal resistance by increasing cycle depth of Li-ion <sup>[4]</sup></strong></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> DC method delivers different internal resistance readings than with the AC method (green frame). For best results, use the DC method to calculate loading.<br></p>
<p><strong>Figure 8</strong> extrapolates the data from<strong> Figure 6</strong> to expand the predicted cycle life of Li-ion by using an extrapolation program that assumes linear decay of battery capacity with progressive cycling. If this were true, then a Li-ion battery cycled within 75%–25% SoC (blue) would fade to 74% capacity after 14,000 cycles. If this battery were charged to 85% with same depth-of-discharge (green), the capacity would drop to 64% at 14,000 cycles, and with a 100% charge with same DoD (black), the capacity would drop to 48%. For unknown reasons, real-life expectancy tends to be lower than in simulated modeling(See <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/battery-performance-as-a-function-of-cycling">BU-208: Cycling Performance</a>)<strong><br></strong></p>
<figure><strong><img src="https://batteryuniversity.com/img/content/capacity-retention3.jpg" alt="Predictive modeling of battery life by extrapolation"></strong><figcaption><strong>Figure 8: Predictive modeling of battery life by extrapolation <sup>[5]</sup></strong></figcaption></figure>
<p>Li-ion batteries are charged to three different SoC levels and the cycle life modelled. Limiting the charge range prolongs battery life but decreases energy delivered. This reflects in increased weight and higher initial cost.</p>
<p>Battery manufacturers often specify the cycle life of a battery with an 80 DoD. This is practical because batteries should retain some reserve before charge under normal use(See <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/discharge-methods">BU-501: Basics about Discharging</a>, “What Constitutes a Discharge Cycle”) The cycle count on DST (dynamic stress test) differs with battery type, charge time, loading protocol and operating temperature. Lab tests often get numbers that are not attainable in the field. </p>

<h3><strong>What Can the User Do?</strong></h3>
<p>Environmental conditions, not cycling alone, govern the longevity of lithium-ion batteries. The worst situation is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures. Battery packs do not die suddenly, but the runtime gradually shortens as the capacity fades.</p>
<p>Lower charge voltages prolong battery life and electric vehicles and satellites take advantage of this. Similar provisions could also be made for consumer devices, but these are seldom offered; planned obsolescence takes care of this.</p>
<p>A laptop battery could be prolonged by lowering the charge voltage when connected to the AC grid. To make this feature user-friendly, a device should feature a “Long Life” mode that keeps the battery at 4.05V/cell and offers a SoC of about 80 percent. One hour before traveling, the user requests the “Full Capacity” mode to bring the charge to 4.20V/cell.</p>
<p>The question is asked, “Should I disconnect my laptop from the power grid when not in use?” Under normal circumstances this should not be necessary because charging stops when the Li-ion battery is full. A topping charge is only applied when the battery voltage drops to a certain level. Most users do not remove the AC power, and this practice is safe.</p>
<p>Modern laptops run cooler than older models and reported fires are fewer. Always keep the airflow unobstructed when running electric devices with air-cooling on a bed or pillow. A cool laptop extends battery life and safeguards the internal components. Energy Cells, which most consumer products have, should be charged at 1C or less. Avoid so-called <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/ultra-fast-chargers">ultra-fast chargers</a> that claim to fully charge Li-ion in less than one hour.<br></p>

      <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><em>TLDR: We test LLMs to figure out how helpful they are for designing a circuit board. We focus on utility of frontier models (GPT4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5) across a set of design tasks, to find where they are and are not useful. They look pretty good for building skills, writing code, and getting useful data out of datasheets.</em></p>

<p><br><em>TLDRN'T: We do not explore any proprietary copilots, or how to apply a things like a diffusion model to the place and route problem.</em></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div><p>Can an AI-powered chatbot help with a task as precise as circuit board design? These LLMs (Large Language Models) are famous for hallucinating details, and missing a *single* important detail can sink a design. Determinism is hard but super important for electronics design!&nbsp;</p><p>Today, several shallow product offerings are making AI for electronics design look mostly like hype. But I think there is real utility to be found here, if we can take a better approach.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, we set LLMs to unfair tasks that expert human circuit board designers handle day to day. We're not looking for basic help, rather pushing on what it takes to help an expert do their job better.</p><p>It would be ridiculous (today) to expect great performance from these general purpose AIs on this expert task, especially because it is probably not well represented in the training data.</p><p>To test performance on difficult design tasks, we work with three of today's leading models:<br>- <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/" rel="noopener">Gemini 1.5 Pro</a>&nbsp;from Google<br>- <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/" rel="noopener">GPT-4o</a> from OpenAI<br>- <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family" rel="noopener">Claude 3 Opus</a> from Anthropic</p><p>And explore prompting strategies to get the best performance out of all the models on each task. As part of the prompt, we also look for opportunities to improve the performance by asking the LLMs to write code to design circuit boards where possible.</p><p>The best results are reported for each model and for each task. Let's dig in!</p></div>
<h2><span>Asking stupid questions</span></h2>
<p><span>There is a lot to know in circuit board design, and nobody has mastered every relevant domain. Asking an LLM stupid questions is a great way to learn.<p>For example an RF engineer will know their own specialty quite well, but might not be a master of supply chain, power supply design, or how to shape copper reliefs to get high yields at the factory.</p><p>( Some RF engineers will scoff at this, but realistically the world contains people trying to learn things.)</p><p>To simulate someone new to a domain, I avoid prompt engineering, and use of precise expert vocabulary. I asked the LLMs a simple question: </p></span><span><em><span>What is the delay per unit length of a trace on a circuit board?</span></em><p>Claude 3 Opus was the clear winner here. Notice that it brought in the relevant concepts (microstrip, stripline, dielectric), got the answer right, and pointed out critical gotchas:</p></span></p>

<p><span>Notice the gotchas here! The speed of a signal changes based on which layer of a circuit board you route it on, and what the materials are.<p>You would never know that looking at a most PCB CAD tools, (e.g. Kicad, Altium) because all of their delay matching is in units of length. e.g. 'both these traces have to be 50 mm long' is a constraint you enter with a GUI. But that's not correct if you want your board to work - delay depends on which layer they are routed on, and what materials are in your board.</p><p>Getting that right: A+ answer for Claude here.&nbsp;</p><p>Google Gemini 1.5 performed the worst on this question. Maybe because it brought in a bunch of sources from the internet, and most of the writing in this discipline is dreck generated by SEO content mills. Incorporating AI summarization of lower quality writing seems to make the answers consistently worse.</p></span></p>
<h2><span>Finding Parts</span></h2>
<div><p>One of the superpowers of an experienced engineer is knowing things like: "A DAC + DSP system good enough for this audio pipeline should be about this big, and cost $1.40 in production". They'll then go do some turbo googling and find it.</p><p>How well can an AI that's been fed the entire internet do?</p><p>For this example I chose find parts for something cool: a robot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EER4pdKw2s4" rel="noopener">motor driver linked by optical ethernet</a> (instead of the usual <a href="https://youtu.be/gsOPZltbvgM" rel="noopener">CAN setups</a>). I want smaller cables, hundreds of possible devices, and compact cables that can survive IRL twisting and jostling.</p></div>
<p>You can see a communication layer like this as the daisy-chained black cabling in this picture from <a href="http://www.hebirobotics.com/" rel="noopener">HEBI</a>:</p>

<div><p>Time to use AI to find the parts should I use for the ethernet switch, and the optical transceivers.</p><p>Here's the prompt:</p></div>
<p>I want to design a daisy-chained communications layer for a motor driver, using 100M optical Ethernet. Each motor controller will have a microcontroller that interfaces to the Ethernet network over RGMII. It needs to be compact, robust to mechanical vibration and shock, and handle temperatures up to 60 degrees Celsius. Please help me choose parts for the optical connectors, transceivers, and Ethernet networking device.&nbsp;<br>1. Think step by step as an expert electrical engineer.&nbsp;<br>2. Carefully consider how component choices relate to the requirements.&nbsp;<br>3. I'll give you a digital cookie if you get the answer correct.</p>
<div><p>Here I'm pulling more prompt engineering tricks to boost the performance of the model, and being careful in detailed specifications to really get this to work.</p><p>My initial guess for these parts would be:<br>- Use a small three port ethernet switch to for the daisy chain, hopefully something from Micrel (now Microchip) like the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ksz8863" rel="noopener">KSZ8863MLL</a>.<br>- For the optical connector/transceiver I would go with the <a href="https://www.firecomms.com/optolock/" rel="noopener">OptoLock part</a> on the example system from Hebi. Very small and robust choice.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be amazing to get new suggestions for parts and architectures here. Something going beyond superficial advice into something practical would have huge impact!</p></div>
<div><p>Instead, performance across all models was uniformly bad and no amount of prompting or follow ups could fix it. It felt a lot like trying to get AI to solve a variant of the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67a305cf-dc5f-45a2-a496-0886116f4659" rel="noopener">wolf, sheep, cabbage problem</a>. It's got the answer locked in, and it's hard to get out of that basin.</p><p>Here's a representative conclusion from Gemini 1.5:</p></div>
<div><p><span>&nbsp;Example Part Selection</span><br><span>- Optical Connectors: LC Duplex connectors (Amphenol or similar)</span><br><span>&nbsp;- Optical Transceivers: 100Base-FX SFP transceivers (Finisar, Cisco, or other reputable brands) with industrial temperature ratings</span><br><span>- Ethernet Networking Device: Microchip LAN8742A or Texas Instruments DP83848</span></p><p><span>Digital Cookie Time! 🍪</span></p><p><span>I hope this detailed breakdown helps you choose the right parts for your daisy-chained motor control system. Please let me know if you have any other questions.</span></p></div>
<p>Grading this:</p>
<p>- All models missed that to get the daisy chain you need a three port ethernet switch. They instead recommend an Ethernet Phy, which isn't going to do it.<br>- All models recommend using a huge SFP transceiver. These are usually found on big datacenter boards, and are not known for being shoved into tiny spaces in a robot joint, and then getting kicked around by Boston Dynamics employees.</p>
<div><p>Overall the generative models don't demonstrate a solid grasp on what the motor controller communication network is, or what application-specific considerations need to be made.&nbsp;</p><p>Without that the part selections are way off. This is a consistent experience. The LLMs will always suggest something, but it will be the 'average' application and miss a lot of the important subtlety. i.e. fiber optic ethernet happens in the mostly in the datacenter, so an average application for fiber optic means a datacenter device.</p><p>Trying to get them to choose an ADC, or sensor, or connector, shows similar 'average' results.</p><p>Maybe this speaks to the difficulty of the domain. If you're not within 10% or so of the global optimal performance in EE, your suggestions have near-zero value.</p></div>
<h2><span>Parsing datasheets</span></h2>
<p><span>Sadly, most of the data you need to design a circuit board is baked away in PDF datasheets, instead of being available via APIs. Directly trying to parse PDFs with python tends to not go well, but LLMs should be pretty good at pulling data from these human-structured documents.<p>I tested three different way of pulling information out:<br>- Copy/paste from the PDF, stuff it into a prompt.<br>- Capture a portion as an image, have the LLM interpret the image<br>- Upload the entire PDF</p></span></p>
<p><span>I'll be using the data available for the <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ps_nrf5340/page/keyfeatures_html5.html" rel="noopener">Nordic nRF5340 WLCSP</a> for the experiment. A little 4.0 x 4.4 mm Bluetooth chip, with an 820 page datasheet.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Observations on this part: &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>This is by no means the largest datasheet for a electrical component but has many typical features including pin tables, mechanical drawings, application specific notes, graphs, etc</li>
<li>This datasheet has significantly more content than you might expects for simpler components - like OpAmps or digital logic gates. If the LLMs are useful here, they will likely be useful for smaller cases.</li>
<li>This datasheet is about 570k tokens, a little more than half the huge context window available from Gemini.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Make a symbol and footprint</h3>
<div><p>First step is a to make a linked symbol and footprint (landpattern) for our component.&nbsp;</p><p>The most effective method here was to load the entire datasheet into the LLM via the chat file upload mechanism, and then query it interactively to get the details right. Gemini 1.5 was the most reliable for this task.</p><p>Here's the prompt to get the pin table (after uploading the datasheet):</p></div>
<p>Please write the the pin table for the wlcsp version of the nRF5340 as code using the following format:&nbsp;<br>1. One line for each pin&nbsp;<br>2. Each line structured as " [ pin-name | pad-number | direction | bank ]", where pin-name is the name of a pin e.g. GND, pad-number is the number of the pad that maps to that pin, e.g, 28, direction is Left is the pin is an input, and Right otherwise, bank indicates the function, e.g. gpio.&nbsp;<br>3. Wrap numbers following letters in square brackets, e.g. K3 becomes K[3], C1 becomes C[1], F10 becomes F[10]&nbsp;<br>4. Replace periods with square brackets, e.g. P0.20 becomes P0[20]</p>
<p>The AI then returns a block of text with our pin list in a usable format:</p>
<p><code>[ XC1 | A1 | Left | analog_input ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ XC2 | A2 | Left | analog_input ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ VDD | A3 | Right | power ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ VSS | A5 | Left | power ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ DECD | A7 | Right | power ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ DCCD | A9 | Right | power ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ D-| A11 | Left | usb ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ D+ | A12 | Left | usb ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ DECRF | B1 | Right | power ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ VSS | B2 | Left | power ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ DECR | B4 | Right | power ]&nbsp;</code><br><code>[ DECN | B5 | Right | power ]</code><br><code>... (continued)</code></p>
<div><p>It got this list exactly correct, impressive for 95 rows of data buried in an 820 page datasheet. Usually I have to get a model to write a little code to reach that level of accuracy, but that was unnecessary here.</p><p>Next I gave it some example code for a BGA footprint and had it generate a new version based on the datasheet information. Here's the resulting code:</p></div>

<div><p>I really like the combination of code and scraped data here because of precision and flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>I would much rather trust a hand-coded BGA footprint generator for the details, and have the LLM tell me which pads to omit. The backstop of the LLM generating the list of pins <em>and the missing pins</em>, then forcing them both to line up to line up in the code is a nice touch. I can also dig in and edit parameters directly if I want to customize.</p><p>Past the standard component model with a symbol and footprint, the LLM can also pull most of the useful data from the PDF. e.g. here is a generated parameterization for the IO pin levels for checking correctness of connections in a design:</p></div>
<p><code>property(P0[0].digital_io) = DigitalIO(CMOSOutput(VSS + 0.4, VDD - 0.4), 0.3*VDD, 0.7*VDD, "VDD", "VSS", 0)</code></p>
<p>If you don't have the AI return an answer as code, it tends to spread the data you want across multiple paragraphs, and it is easier to get the answer you want by just reading the datasheet instead.</p>
<p>It can even read a bit of the reference schematic and turn it into a netlist:</p>

<div><p>It hallucinated this task a little bit, inventing resistors here and there.&nbsp;</p><p>Using LLMs to pull data from challenging sources and turn it into useful code was a helpful automation technique (and personally the one I use most). Accuracy can be boosted further by using extraction techniques to cross-reference the data.</p></div>
<h2><span>Designing circuits</span></h2>
<p><span>We've seen that LLMs can understand an image of a schematic well enough to (mostly) turn it into a netlist. Can they take on a much more challenging task and design the circuit itself?<p>As shown earlier, LLMs generated kinda-right, but actually very wrong suggestions for key components. To avoid that dependency, we tested our AIs on an analog circuit design task. This test is more about doing some math, and correctly arranging resistors and capacitors.</p><p>The task is to design an pre-amplifier for an electret microphone -- boosting and filtering an audio signal for sampling by an ADC. We start with a basic architecture exploration. Here's the prompt:</p></span></p>
<p><span>I want to design a microphone pre-amp where I need to bias the electret microphone and create a single-ended signal out to drive the ADC of a microcontroller. Include a bandpass filter with a gain of 20dB, corner frequencies at 100Hz and 20kHz. Help me select an architecture for this amplifier. Propose different filter architectures and describe their pros and cons for this application.&nbsp;<br>1. Think step by step as an expert electrical engineer&nbsp;<br>2. Carefully consider the requirements&nbsp;<br>3. If you get the answer right you get a digital cookie.</span></p>
<p><span>Claude 3 Opus came back with the best answer of the three contenders. I'll analyze it piece by piece.</span></p>
<p><span>Okay, let's think through this step-by-step as an expert electrical engineer:<br>1. Microphone biasing: Electret microphones typically require a DC bias voltage, usually between 1.5V to 10V, applied through a bias resistor. The value of this resistor impacts the microphone's output impedance and noise. A common range is 2.2kΩ to 10kΩ. We'll need to check the microphone's datasheet for specifics.<br>2. Amplifier architecture: For a single-ended output to drive an ADC, we can use a single-supply op-amp configuration. Some good options are:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a) Non-inverting amplifier: Simple, high input impedance which is good for the high-impedance mic signal. Gain is set by the feedback resistor ratio.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; b) Inverting amplifier: Also simple, but lower input impedance. Gain is also set by resistor ratio.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; c) Push-pull: Combines inverting and non-inverting amps for more output current drive, but more complex. For simplicity and good mic interfacing, a non-inverting amp seems best here.</span></p>
<div><p>Claude did a good job calling out the need to bias the microphone, nice to have that called out explicitly.</p><p>The proposals for non-inverting, and inverting amplifiers are reasonable. The proposal for push-pull configurations is nonsense. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93pull_output" rel="noopener">Push-Pull configuration</a> describes the transistors inside the op-amp at the output stage. It doesn't have anything to do with the architecture of the op amp circuit.</p><p>Moving on to the filter suggestions:</p></div>
<p><span>3. Bandpass filter: We need a 100Hz to 20kHz passband with 20dB gain. Some filter options:&nbsp;</span><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a) Passive RC: Simple, but requires large component values for low frequencies, and loading affects cutoff frequencies. Gain must come from amp.&nbsp;</span><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b) Active 1st-order: Sallen-Key or Multiple-Feedback topologies. Each is 1st-order, so we'd cascade a low-pass and high-pass for the bandpass response. Easy to integrate gain. Cutoff frequencies affected by component tolerance.&nbsp;</span><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c) Active 2nd-order: Single stage 2nd-order bandpass like a Dual-Amplifier Bandpass (DABP). More complex, but more efficient than cascaded 1st-order. More stable cutoff frequencies.&nbsp;</span><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d) Switched-capacitor: Uses a clock to set cutoff frequencies. Very stable, but requires a clock signal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The comments on the Passive RC filter are reasonable.&nbsp;<p>The Sallen-Key analysis is wrong - Sallen-Key is a <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sboa231/sboa231.pdf?ts=1718092808060&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F" rel="noopener">second order filter</a>&nbsp;and can be unstable with this much gain.</p><p>The suggestion for the <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/tutorials/MT-209.pdf" rel="noopener">DABP</a> isn't wrong per se, but it is missing some nuance. It doesn't allow for very high gain (limit of 2.0). The complexity of a DABP justified when you need to handle higher frequencies and higher Q levels. This application doesn't require that, so it's a weird choice.</p><p>A switched capacitor filter would be bonkers -- complex, noise-sensitive, and requiring exotic components.</p></span></p>
<p><span>Moving on:</span></p>
<div><p><span>For this application, an active 2nd-order filter like a DABP seems a good balance of simplicity, stability, and easy gain integration. &nbsp;</span><br><span>1. Amplifier gain: The filter will have 20dB gain, which is a factor of 10. We can implement this with a non-inverting amp by setting the feedback resistor ratio to 9. For example, if R1 = 1kΩ, then R2 = 9kΩ.</span><br><span>2. Component values: We'll need to calculate the exact resistor and capacitor values for the DABP filter based on the desired cutoff frequencies and gain. There are online calculators to help with this.</span><br><span>&nbsp;So in summary, I propose a non-inverting op-amp configuration for the microphone, followed by a 2nd-order DABP active filter with 20dB gain. The exact component values will depend on the specific microphone chosen and the filter design equations. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>How's that? Let me know if you have any other questions!</span></p></div>
<p><span>Here, Claude chooses the DABP and estimates some reasonablish values given that choice. (Usually you would choose values greater than 10k and less than 1M in op amp circuit design, to make assumptions about input and output impedance hold better). The wording is a bit confusing but it could be interpreted as a non-inverting op-amp for the gain stage, followed by a DABP filter with a lower gain. Which can work! Technically!<p>It's making slightly strange decisions across the board, but let's proceed with creating a complete design.&nbsp;</p><p>With a little more prompting, we can get Claude to write some code to do the detailed design and generate the circuit:</p></span></p>
<p><span><code>Great! Let's dive into the calculations and generate the netlists. We'll assume a 3.3V power supply and a microphone bias of 2.5V. We'll use an ideal op-amp model for simplicity.</code><p><code>; Microphone Bias Circuit:</code></p><p><code>; - Let's choose a bias resistor of 2.2kΩ.</code><br><code>; - Assuming negligible current draw from the op-amp, the mic bias will be very <br></code></p></span><span><code>; close to 2.5V.</code><p><code>; Netlist:&nbsp;</code><br><code>inst mic : electret-mic&nbsp;</code><br><code>inst rbias : chip-resistor(2200.0)&nbsp;</code><br><code>inst c1 : ceramic-cap(1.0e-6) ; Decoupling cap, assuming 1uF&nbsp;</code><br><code>net (vdd rbias.p[1])&nbsp;</code><br><code>net (rbias.p[2] mic.vdd c1.p[1])&nbsp;</code><br><code>net (gnd mic.gnd c1.p[2])</code></p></span></p>
<p><span>The decoupling cap in the bias circuit here really hampers the high-frequency performance of the circuit. What the circuit actually needs is a <em>coupling cap</em>, shown in the <code>human.mic</code> circuit here:</span></p>

<p><span>Presumably in the training corpus, many articles and datasheets write extensively about decoupling caps. Maybe the "average" recommendation wins out here, and once it sees a positive and negative pin it slaps a capacitor across them right away. In our tests (and most product demos), LLMs <em>loved</em> to give naive advice about decoupling, which usually isn't as actively harmful as it is here.<br></span></p>
<p><span>Moving on to the amplifier:</span></p>

<p>The AI describes the amplifier as non-inverting, but then feeds the signal into the inverting input. It's also missing a few other parts and nets that would make for a working circuit. Easier to see in the generated schematic:</p>

<p>A few more misses on the netlist here, and about as correct as the amplifier (which is to say, not very). We also see the weirdly strong default of attaching capacitors across positive and negative pins. I guess LLMs are high decouplers.</p>
<p>And to round it off, we've got another reminder to add decoupling caps, and a reasonable note about what to watch out for:</p>
<p><span>The output of op2 is the final output of the pre-amp circuit. This should give you a good starting point. Remember to add decoupling capacitors and power supply connections as needed. Also, the actual component values may need to be adjusted based on the real specs of your chosen op-amp and the exact requirements of your ADC. Let me know if you have any other questions!</span></p>
<h3><span>Comparing against ground truth</span></h3>
<p><span>This <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidu765/tidu765.pdf" rel="noopener">reference design</a> from Texas Instruments is a good implementation of the requirements we asked these LLMs to design to. It uses passive RC filters (which the AI considered and avoided), and a single op-amp. I did a quick implementation of this in JITX (<a href="https://github.com/JITx-Inc/generative-ai-test-cases/blob/main/amplifier/reference.stanza" rel="noopener">code here</a>) to compare the AI generated circuit (<a href="https://github.com/JITx-Inc/generative-ai-test-cases/blob/main/amplifier/ai-generated.stanza" rel="noopener">code here</a>) to the TI version.</span></p>

<p><span>The AI generated circuit was three times the cost and size of the design created by that expert engineer at TI. It is also missing many of the necessary connections.&nbsp;<p>I found this breakdown surprising - it had no problems generating code in general, and was able to generate a syntactically correct netlist. The code runs! It's just that the pins are not in the right net statements and the resulting circuit is not correct.</p></span></p>
<h3><span>Testing higher level code</span></h3>
<p><span>In fairness, it's rare to write code like this to design a circuit board. In practice you're primarily calling higher level functions, e.g. selecting an op-amp, configuring a filter with parameters, then using a parametric pre-amp circuit:</span></p>
<p><code>&nbsp; val OpAmpType = components/STMicroelectronics/TS971ILT/component</code><br><code>&nbsp; val bandpass = BandpassConfig(gain = 34.0, low-cut = 100.0, high-pass = 20.0e3)</code><br><code>&nbsp; val preampType = ocdb/modules/amplifiers/microphone-preamp(OpAmpType, bandpass)</code><br><code>&nbsp; inst amp : preampType</code></p>
<div><p>Would LLMs do better if we try to get them to define and use higher-level functions instead?</p><p>Gemini 1.5 did the best here, inventing some reasonable APIs to functions that would exist in a library of helpful circuits:</p></div>
<p><code># Modules</code><br><code>amp = inverting_amplifier("amp1", gain=-20.0)&nbsp;</code><br><code>filt = sallen_key_filter("filt1", low_cutoff=100.0, high_cutoff=20.0e3)&nbsp;</code><br><code># Connections&nbsp;</code><br><code>net (mic.pos r_bias.p[1]) # Microphone to bias resistor&nbsp;</code><br><code>net (r_bias.p[2] c1.p[1] amp.in) # Bias resistor to amp through coupling capacitor</code></p>
<p>(Still misses on the netlist generation though.)</p>
<div><p>Our experiments with code generation reveal an interesting pattern: the LLMs are not great at generating detailed code for a netlist <em>to implement a circuit design</em>. That was a little surprising because as shown in the datasheet parsing section, they can write a 95% correct netlist matching an uploaded image of a schematic. This difference suggests that LLMs excel at information extraction and transformation tasks, but struggle with original design synthesis.</p><p>Having the LLMs generate higher-level code worked better than raw netlist generation, and seems like a promising path forward. This suggests a hybrid approach where human experts create parametric implementations of common circuits, which LLMs can then utilize and adapt, potentially increasing overall reliability.</p></div>
<p>Future research could either explore fine-tuning models specifically for netlist generation tasks, or (this being generative AI) wait a month and see how well the next generation of models does on this problem.</p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span>Circuit board design requires a lot of precision to get all the details correct -- for unsupervised AI techniques, I think there is a data problem here.&nbsp;<p>The context and meaning of a design -- What does this do? How do you know if it's good? -- are usually absent from schematic and board design data. Maybe there's a little text comment on the schematic with filter calculations, but that's usually it, and the rest lives in the engineer's head.</p><p>An electrical engineer looks at a schematic, understands a portion as a Sallen-Key filter, knows the limitations and function of that circuit, and composes that understanding with the rest of the design. A tremendous amount of context, which is not in any of the design data you can scrape from the internet.</p><p>Our experiments show that generative AI models can be useful for circuit board design, if you use them to write code. With that approach, there were still significant differences across Gemini 1.5, Claude 3 Opus, and GPT-4o for circuit board design.&nbsp;</p><p>Claude 3 was most helpful for answering questions to learn new domains. There's a risk of hallucinations, but those usually fall away if you interrogate the model until it's consistent. Certainly Claude is better and more helpful than the *average* article on circuit board design you would find via web search (there are very good articles, but they can be hard to find).</p><p>Gemini's huge context window was very helpful for pulling component data out of datasheets. It was the one area where the AI 'just worked' and we got way more usability than we expected.</p><p>I'm interested in further testing to find the limits of this technique. Google has done a lot of work on the "Text Haystack" problem to pull tiny pieces of information accurately out of a massive corpus of data, and that's serving them well here.</p></span></p>

<p><span>Overall we have some promising directions. Using LLMs for circuit board design looks a lot like using them for other complex tasks. They work well for pulling concrete data out of human-shaped data sources, they can do slightly more difficult tasks if they can solve that task by writing code, but eventually their capabilities break down in domains too far out of the training distribution.<p>We only tested the frontier models in this work, but I predict similar results from the open-source Llama or Mistral models. Some fine tuning on netlist creation would likely make the generation capabilities more useful.</p><p>Our work shows both the potential and limitations of current LLMs in specialized fields like circuit design. They're excellent at retrieving information and generating code, but struggle with the nuanced decision-making needed for complex designs. Future LLMs will likely improve here, but for the current model generation, they're best used as tools to assist human experts rather than as standalone designers.</p></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The ancient Greeks wanted to believe that the universe could be described in its entirety using only whole numbers and the ratios between them — fractions, or what we now call rational numbers. But this aspiration was undermined when they considered a square with sides of length 1, only to find that the length of its diagonal couldn’t possibly be written as a fraction.</p>
<p>The first proof of this (there would be several) is commonly attributed to Pythagoras, a 6th-century BCE philosopher, even though none of his writings survive and little is known about him. Nevertheless, “it was the first crisis in what we call the foundations of mathematics,” said <a href="https://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/">John Bell</a>, a professor emeritus at Western University in London, Ontario.</p>
<p>That crisis would not be resolved for a long time. Though the ancient Greeks could establish what $latex \sqrt{2}$ was not, they didn’t have a language for explaining what it was.</p>
<p>For millennia, this sufficed. Renaissance mathematicians manipulated what they came to call irrational numbers while trying to solve algebraic equations. The modern notation for square roots came into use in the 16th and 17th centuries. But still, there was something slippery about them. Does $latex \sqrt{2}$ exist in the same way that 2 does? It wasn’t clear.</p>

<p>Mathematicians continued to live with that ambiguity. Then, in the mid-1800s, Richard Dedekind, among others, realized that calculus — which had been developed 200 years earlier by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz — stood on a shaky foundation. A reserved but gifted mathematician who worked slowly and published relatively little, Dedekind was preparing to teach his students about continuous functions when he realized that he couldn’t give a satisfactory explanation of what it meant for a function to be continuous.</p>
<p>He hadn’t even seen functions properly defined. And that, he argued, required a good understanding of how numbers worked — something mathematicians seemed to have taken for granted. How, he asked, could you know for sure that $latex \sqrt{2}$ multiplied by $latex \sqrt{3}$ equals $latex \sqrt{6}$? He wanted to provide some answers.</p>
<p>And so he introduced a way to define and construct the irrational numbers using only the rationals. Here’s how it works: First, split all the rational numbers into two sets, so that all of the fractions in one set are smaller than those in the other. For instance, in one group, collect all rationals that, when squared, are less than 2; in the other, put all rationals whose squares are greater than 2. Exactly one number plugs the hole between these two sets. Mathematicians give it the label $latex \sqrt{2}$. For Dedekind, then, an irrational number is defined by a pair of infinite sets of rational numbers, which create what he called a cut. “It’s a very lovely idea,” said <a href="https://ianstewartjoat.weebly.com/">Ian Stewart</a> of the University of Warwick. “You can pin down the missing irrational numbers not by describing them, but by describing the gap in which they have to sit.”</p>
<p>Dedekind showed that you can fill in the entire number line this way, rigorously defining for the first time what are now called real numbers (the rationals and the irrationals combined).</p>
<p>At around the same time that Dedekind introduced his cuts, his friend and collaborator Georg Cantor also began to think about irrational numbers. The overlap made their relationship complicated. “They were good friends, and they hated each other. They cooperated, and they ignored each other,” said <a href="https://www.openu.ac.il/en/about/president/pages/default.aspx">Leo Corry</a>, a historian of science who is the president of the Open University of Israel.</p>

<p>Cantor came up with a different definition of irrational numbers. He expressed each in terms of sequences of rational numbers that approached, or “converged” to, a particular irrational value. Though Cantor’s irrational numbers initially looked different from Dedekind’s, later work proved that they are mathematically equivalent.</p>
<p>Cantor’s work led him to ask how many numbers exist. The question might at first seem strange. There are infinitely many whole numbers — you can always keep adding one more. Presumably, that’s as big as a set of numbers can get. But Cantor showed that, paradoxically, though the number of fractions is the same as the number of integers, there are demonstrably more irrational numbers. He was the first to realize that <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-many-numbers-exist-infinity-proof-moves-math-closer-to-an-answer-20210715/">infinity comes in many sizes</a>.</p>
<p>The number line was more crowded, and weirder, than anyone had imagined. But mathematicians were only able to see that after a change in perspective.</p>

<p>Dedekind’s cuts are arguably the beginning of modern mathematics. “It’s really the first point in the history of mathematics where mathematicians actually know what they’re talking about,” Stewart said. Dedekind and others used his definition to prove major theorems in calculus for the first time — which allowed them not just to strengthen the edifice that Leibniz and Newton had built, but to add to it. Dedekind’s work enabled mathematicians to better understand sequences and functions. Emmy Noether, a prolific mathematician who helped shape the field of abstract algebra in the early 20th century, is said to have <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82253306.pdf">told her students</a> that “everything is already in Dedekind.”</p>
<p>A formal definition of $latex \sqrt{2}$ opened new horizons for exploration beyond the topics in calculus that initially motivated Dedekind. As Stewart put it, “After Dedekind, mathematicians started to realize that you can invent new concepts altogether. … The whole idea of what mathematics is about becomes much broader and more flexible.”</p>
