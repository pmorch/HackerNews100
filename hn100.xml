  <p><strong><em>February 2025 Issue</em></strong></p><p><strong>Carolyn Bruckmann, Harvard Kennedy School MPP ‘25</strong></p><p>The so-called “Friendship Recession” is making its way into the vernacular—a profound shift in how Americans experience and sustain friendships. The data paints a stark picture. According to the <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/">American Perspectives Survey</a>, the percentage of U.S. adults who report having no close friends has quadrupled to 12% since 1990, while the percentage of those with ten or more close friends has fallen by nearly threefold. The foundations of the crisis were laid long before lockdowns. For decades, Americans consistently spent about 6.5 hours a week with friends. Then, between 2014 and 2019, that number plummeted to just four hours per week.</p><p>To be sure, systemic forces underlie this shift. <a href="https://campuspress.yale.edu/ledger/urban-sprawl-a-growing-problem/">Suburban sprawl</a> has physically distanced us from one another. <a href="https://www.ericklinenberg.com/books">The government slowed down</a> its investment in and construction of <a href="https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2024/07/03/vanishing-third-places-and-what-can-be-done">third spaces</a>—such as community centers, parks, and coffee shops—which has left fewer places for organic social interactions. The rise of the <a href="https://www.naco.org/featured-resources/future-work-rise-gig-economy">gig economy</a> and economic pressures have made free time a luxury. These factors have made friendship more difficult, and policymakers, urban planners, and venture capitalists are searching for solutions.</p><p>However, these structural forces alone can't fully account for the larger shift. If inaccessibility were the primary driver, we wouldn’t see relatively <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/loneliness-epidemic">stable connection rates </a>among older adults over the last several decades. If wealthier individuals have more access to communal spaces, why has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">solo dining increased by 29% in the past two years</a>? If this were purely circumstantial, why would Stanford now offer <em>Design for Healthy Friendships</em>—a class dedicated to helping students structure their social lives with intention? </p><p>These trends point to something more insidious: a cultural crisis. As <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-friendship-dip">Anne Helen Petersen writes</a>, “time for friends is a privilege, but it is also a matter of priorities.” The way we spend our time, whom we invest in, and what we prioritize is shifting. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">Solitude is becoming more than a preference</a>—it’s becoming a default. And when not used <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/07/hermit-solitude-benefits-happiness/678955/">well</a>, the result of solitude isn’t just fewer friendships—it’s a fundamental loss of the ability to form and sustain them. If we don’t consciously reshape our priorities and re-learn how to cultivate meaningful relationships, we risk a future where connection—one of the most fundamental sources of happiness and well-being—fades into the background of our lives.</p><p><strong>The cultural shift</strong></p><p><span>Work has become a dominant social identity</span></p><p>It’s often said that if you ask an American what they do, they’ll tell you about their job, whereas a European might talk about their hobbies or passions. Data backs this up; U.S. workers put in an average of <a href="https://20somethingfinance.com/american-hours-worked-productivity-vacation/">1,799 hours per year</a>, which is 182 more hours than the OECD country average. But the role of work in shaping identity and social life in the United States has perhaps never been stronger. For example, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/american-work-habits-culture-change-2019-3#the-hours-are-longer-and-longer-4">77% of Americans</a> work more than 40 hours per week, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/30/how-americans-view-their-jobs/#:~:text=Nearly%20half%20of%20workers%20who,more%20time%20off%20(49%25).">few take their full paid leave</a>. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/12/14/the-growth-of-the-older-workforce/#:~:text=The%20share%20of%20older%20adults,18%25%20of%20older%20Americans%20worked.">Pew Research </a>suggests that the percentage of adults 65 and older who are employed has nearly doubled since 1987, rising from 11% to 19%. </p><p>These shifts are in part driven by broader <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/">economic forces</a>. Higher cost of living and stagnating wages for low-and middle-income earners means that everyday Americans must work harder to keep up. However, these shifts also suggest a deeper cultural transformation may be occurring—one where the old American ethos of working hard and climbing the economic ladder has evolved into an all-consuming, identity-defining pursuit that leaves little room for much else. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6889078/pdf/nihms-1060104.pdf">In a study</a> of generational shifts in work values in the United States, researchers found that Americans are placing greater importance on intrinsic work values—such as having interesting jobs and work that helps others and society. Finding meaning in work (obviously) isn’t a problem <em>per se.</em> Yet when finding fulfillment in work comes at the expense of meaningful personal relationships, it becomes a problem—one that risks leaving individuals fulfilled in their careers but isolated in their personal lives.</p><p><span>The focus is increasingly on the nuclear family</span></p><p>As work has become increasingly all-encompassing, Americans have also doubled down on prioritizing their families—particularly their children—over friendships. One 2013 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2013/03/14/chapter-4-how-mothers-and-fathers-spend-their-time/">Pew Research study</a> found that 49% of parents report spending more time with their kids than their own parents did, while 33% report spending the same amount of time, and 18% report spending less time. These trends reflect a cultural shift towards “intensive parenting.” A child’s achievements are an extension of their parents’ competence, which fuels an arms race of over-scheduling, constant supervision, and exhaustive emotional labor. This model of parenting leaves little room for adult friendships, as socializing is increasingly deprioritized in favor of ensuring one’s child “gets ahead”.</p><p>Beyond parenting, Americans in general are spending more time at home than in previous decades. A comprehensive study analyzing data from 2003 to 2022 found that the average time spent at home among American adults rose by 1 hour and 39 minutes per day. The trend is strongest among younger generations: 15- to 24-year-olds now spend over 2 additional hours per day at home compared to 2006. <a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S235282732200310X">Data suggests</a> that this extra time at home may not be going towards connection: the average time spent engaging with family members has dropped from 262 minutes per day in 2003 down to 243 minutes in 2019. </p><p>Simultaneously, Americans are spending less time engaged in activities and groups in their communities. The rate of volunteering has steeply declined since the early 2000s: <a href="https://www.ivint.org/in-the-u-s-volunteering-is-at-an-all-time-low/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Bureau,number%20had%20dropped%20to%2024.9%25.">some research</a> suggests that while almost 30% of Americans reported volunteering in 2005, only 23% reported volunteering in 2021. <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/disconnected-places-and-spaces/">The American Survey Center</a> found that only 15% of Americans belong to neighborhood associations, and only 10% are members of a sports league. This decline in community involvement mirrors a broader shift away from organized religion: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/">Pew Research</a> suggests that the percentage of Americans who don’t identify with any faith has grown from 17% to 26% over a decade. These institutions were once the glue that held social networks together, places where friendships naturally formed through shared experiences. </p><p>Taken together, these trends suggest that Americans are increasingly retreating inward instead of engaging in communal activities. Friendship is no longer seen as an integral part of daily life, but rather something we squeeze in when all our other responsibilities have been met.</p><p><span>The rise of screen time and digital-only friendships</span></p><p>Needless to say, the rise of the internet and mobile phones has only <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2009/11/04/social-isolation-and-new-technology/">accelerated this shift</a>. Nearly <a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/">40% of Americans</a> now have online-only friendships. Among teenagers, the trend is even more pronounced. Teenagers are spending only <a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S235282732200310X">40 minutes a day in person with friends</a> outside of school hours, down from 140 minutes a day nearly two decades ago. On the other hand, teens are spending increasing amounts of time on devices. The average teen spent almost <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/4037619-teens-are-spending-less-time-than-ever-with-friends/">nine hours on daily</a> screen time in 2021, up from seven hours in 2015. </p><p>This cultural shift would not matter if digital friendships were interchangeable with in-person friendships. But online friendships require a different set of social behaviors than in-person ones. Maintaining a friendship online relies on skills like crafting the perfect message, interpreting text-based interactions, and engaging in asynchronous exchanges with multiple people at once. In contrast, in-person friendships thrive on undivided attention, and are built through spontaneous moments, reading body language, and navigating the vulnerability of face-to-face connection. Some even suggest that young people, growing up immersed in digital interactions, are<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/"> losing the opportunity to develop the in-person social skills</a> that once defined deep human connection. As <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">Derek Thompson writes</a>, “a socially underdeveloped childhood leads to socially stunted adulthood.” In short, we’re building a generation of people who do not know, and may not have the ability, to tolerate the messy work of forming friendships. Research also suggests that digital interactions lead to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/28/in-person-friendships-health-benefits/">weaker connections</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/202305/face-to-face-communication-healthier-than-digital">lower senses of mental well-being</a>. A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/28/in-person-friendships-health-benefits/">recent study </a>of nearly 13,000 adults over the age of 50 found that those who engaged in face-to-face interactions at least once a week experienced better physical and mental well-being, whereas communication through calls or texts did not have the same effect. Neuroscience helps us make sense of these findings. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3277914/pdf/nihms353984.pdf">Research shows</a> that hearing a familiar voice reduces cortisol and boosts oxytocin—hormones tied to stress relief and bonding—while text-based communication and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3577190.3614168">video calls</a> fail to trigger the same response​. Without these biological cues, digital interactions can feel strangely empty, reinforcing isolation rather than alleviating it.</p><p><strong>The neuropsychology behind why this cultural shift is dangerous</strong></p><p>This cultural shift is particularly insidious because it’s not just changing our habits—it’s rewiring our brains. Forming friendships requires vulnerability, but loneliness makes that vulnerability harder to tolerate. <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1080/17588928.2015.1070136?casa_token=H11l9zS1Zo8AAAAA%3Ant09xEX4ywgkABKvm4wbySENB-5CVQIPjR4iTDSfXOx1zPkVkpc73Brj7oqZ2F0l1hfBO8trcu7fhg">Research by John Cacioppo</a> found that loneliness fuels itself: when people feel isolated, they become more sensitive to social threats and more likely to misinterpret interactions negatively, through the lens of rejection. </p><p>This is important because, at a neurological level, social rejection doesn’t just hurt emotionally—<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9029604/">it activates the amygdala</a>, the brain’s threat detection center, and triggers the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-397025-1.00144-5">same neural pathways</a> as physical pain. Over time, this makes socializing feel riskier, and to avoid that discomfort, we increasingly turn to psychological shortcuts. Digital interactions offer a sense of control: behind our screens, we can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15257832/">curate our self-presentation</a>, sidestep <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15257832/">awkward social cues</a>, and get <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2021/aug/22/how-digital-media-turned-us-all-into-dopamine-addicts-and-what-we-can-do-to-break-the-cycle">quick dopamine hits</a> that create the illusion of connection. <a href="https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/jschroeder/Publications/Epley&amp;Schroeder2014.pdf">Given the way our brains are wired</a>, we also gravitate toward the safest, most familiar spaces—choosing the comfort of home and close family over the unpredictability of community spaces and new relationships. </p><p>But these shortcuts and avoidances only deepen our isolation, creating a self-reinforcing cycle: the more we retreat from in-person connection, the harder it becomes, making digital interactions and solitude even more appealing. </p><p><strong>The dynamic dance of culture change: What we need to do</strong></p><p>It’s clear that something in our cultural fabric needs to change—what’s less clear is how to change it, given the dynamic dance of how culture is formed and sustained. Culture flows from the top-down—through funding that creates public spaces, zoning laws that make neighborhoods walkable, and labor policies that determine how much free time people can spend with friends—but also from the bottom-up, through the repeated choices of individuals. As <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">Derek Thompson</a> points out, the more people opt for convenience over community, the more businesses and institutions adapt to reinforce that behavior—solo dining increases, restaurants redesign for takeout, and social infrastructure crumbles. When enough people de-prioritize friendship, it doesn’t just affect their own lives; it shifts societal norms. This means that reversing the Friendship Recession requires action on both structural and individual levels. If we want to push back against the Friendship Recession—especially against its most visceral, burgeoning societal norms—we need to actively resist the forces that make solitude the default. The key lies in strengthening the two pillars of friendship: forming and sustaining connections. In what follows I’ll share what I’ve learned—from research and personal experience—on how to do this. </p><p><span>Forming friendship: embrace discomfort</span></p><p>Forming friendships requires taking risks, and discomfort is a natural part of risk-taking. But rather than being a deterrent, novel experiences and shared challenges can be the glue that binds friendships together. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6266683/">Research suggests</a> that people who go through something hard together tend to view each other more positively afterward, deepening their connection.</p><p>I saw this firsthand in research I conducted while studying loneliness at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business (GSB) and the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS). I teamed up with a couple of classmates and hosted a Hot Ones Challenge, where a group of strangers sat down together to eat progressively spicier wings while answering personal questions. What started as mild discomfort quickly escalated into chaos—people sweating, laughing, and rolling on the floor in pain. But something else happened, too: by the end of the night, these strangers felt like a bonded group. The shared experience of struggling through something novel and slightly painful had created instant camaraderie.</p><p>A few weeks later, I found myself in a similar situation, but this time, in an Escape Room with a different group. The experience felt similar to the Hot Ones Challenge; by the end of the hour, we were high-fiving and laughing over inside jokes. Novelty equalizes—when we enter a new situation together, hierarchical social norms fall away, and a shared identity forms.</p><p>These experiences didn’t just happen by chance—I had to take the initiative to plan them, extend invitations, and show up, even though I didn’t know how they would turn out. But that’s exactly the point: forming friendships isn’t passive. It takes effort, a willingness to embrace uncertainty, and the courage to put yourself out there. And more often than not, the risk is worth it.</p><p>How can you do this in your own life? Below is a set of suggestions on ways to make forming friendships a priority:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Invite a group of people</strong>—ideally, these are individuals who share a mutual interest in forming lasting friendships or share a common goal. It doesn’t have to be a formal or serious group; the key is to gather people who are open to connection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose an activity</strong> that allows the group to explore a new “frontier”, something unknown, together—this often involves working through a shared physical or intellectual challenge. The activity should be new enough to foster excitement and cooperation but not so intimidating that it deters participation. Consider solving an Escape Room, hosting a Hot Ones Challenge, organizing a team trivia night, or even creating a play where everyone contributes to the final production (<a href="https://www.artandhealing.org/">research suggests</a> that art is particularly helpful for healing a lonely brain). For folks more interested in physical challenges, consider organizing a group trekking adventure, creating an obstacle course, designing a race, or signing up for the myriad of these that exist already. The goal is to create an environment where everyone is learning and navigating something unfamiliar together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set the intention</strong>—clearly share the purpose or goal of the activity. People are more likely to invest in the experience if they know it’s about more than just the activity itself. Setting the tone makes the event feel purposeful and builds a foundation for deeper connections.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slowly escalate disclosure</strong>—start with surface-level, lighter (even goofy) questions or conversations and gradually increase the depth of sharing as trust builds. If the activity has stages (like a trivia night with multiple rounds or a progressive dinner), introduce vulnerability through carefully chosen prompts. For example, early on, you might ask something fun and simple like, “Would you rather sit next to a crying baby or a snorer on a long bus ride?” Later, you might ask, “What’s something you’re proud of that most people don’t know about?” These layers of sharing encourage openness while respecting personal boundaries.</p></li></ol><p><span>Sustainment: making friendship a priority</span></p><p>Forming friendships is only half the battle. Friendships thrive on ritual and repetition. As such, sustaining them requires intentional effort, particularly in a culture that prioritizes work and family over social ties. This means making active choices to spend time with friends—even when it feels inconvenient.</p><p>For a long time, I was reflective of the broader trends. I spent a lot of time forming one-on-one friendships in private settings—either at my place or theirs—rather than engaging in shared social spaces. I spent time texting long-distance friends instead of spending time in-person with friends co-located with me. As I started to learn about the broader cultural trends and the reinforcing psychology behind them, I started making shifts. I embedded myself in existing social structures and prioritized in-person social activities —ecstatic dance gatherings at the Harvard Divinity School, morning prayers at Memorial Church, and weekly workouts at the Harvard stadium with friends. </p><p>My sense of belonging shifted as I threw myself into these recurring activities. While these rituals didn’t provide the “new frontier” that I had uncovered as being crucial to forming friendships, they allowed for the consistency and commitment that cements friendships. This is not to say that one-on-one friendships are insufficient; but it <em>is</em> to say that we will lose the war if we don’t also lean into structured group activities and participating in the rituals and institutions that already exist. Below are some tips for what operationalizing this work can look like: </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Immerse yourself in a local-based ritual that already exists</strong>—<a href="https://trust.weavers.org/" target="_blank">Weave</a> is a great place to find opportunities (and understand the levels of social trust that do/don’t exist in your community).</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose a set cadence for meeting</strong>—consistency is key. Whether it’s weekly, biweekly, or monthly, having a recurring meeting time reduces the “Will they/won’t they show up?” stress and creates a ritual everyone can rely on. Regular interactions can help deepen bonds by building familiarity and trust.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose the activity</strong>—select something that allows for synchrony or harmony, as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23951106/">research shows</a> these shared experiences amplify feelings of connection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rinse and repeat</strong>—consistency doesn’t mean monotony. Rotate the hosting responsibilities or experiment with variations of the activity to keep things fresh. For example, if your group runs together weekly, add a themed run (like costumes or challenges) every so often. Or, if you have regular dinners, try hosting potlucks with rotating themes like “comfort food” or “childhood favorites.”</p></li></ol><p>While these prescriptions might sound easy, the reality is that culture change is hard, and its effects aren’t seen overnight. It would be easier to scapegoat external forces, build yet another friend-finding app, and call it a day. While broader policy changes and social infrastructure certainly are needed and will help, we also must recognize that change starts with us. The small, daily choices we make—to reach out, to show up, to invest in relationships—add up to and actively shape the culture we live in. Imagine what could happen if we’re better, <em>together</em>.</p><p><em>Contributing editors: </em></p><p><em>Bryce Fuemmeler, Senior Research Associate, Leadership &amp; Happiness Laboratory</em></p><p><em>Ryan Meachen, Associate Research Fellow, Leadership &amp; Happiness Laboratory </em></p>

<h2>Mark Zuckerberg personally lost the Facebook antitrust case (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/18/chatty-zucky/#is-you-taking-notes-on-a-criminal-fucking-conspiracy">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>It's damned hard to prove an antitrust case: so often, the prosecution has to prove that the company <em>intended</em> to crush competition, and/or that they raised prices or reduced quality because they knew they didn't have to fear competitors.</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to prove <em>what</em> a corporation did than it is to prove <em>why</em> they did it. What am I, a mind-reader? But imagine for a second that the corporation in the dock is a global multinational. Now, imagine that the majority of the voting shares in that company are held by one man, who has served as the company's CEO since the day he founded it, personally calling every important shot in the company's history.</p>
<p>Now imagine that this founder/CEO, this accused monopolist, was an incorrigible blabbermouth, who communicated with his underlings almost exclusively in writing, and thus did he commit to immortal digital storage a stream – a <em>torrent</em> – of memos in which he explicitly confessed his guilt.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlepersons, I give you Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Meta (nee Facebook), an accused monopolist who <em>cannot keep his big dumb fucking mouth shut</em>.</p>
<p>At long, long last, the FTC's antitrust trial against Meta is underway, and this week, Zuck himself took the stand, in agonizing sessions during which FTC lawyers brandished printouts of Zuck's own words before him, asking him to explain away his naked confessions of guilt. It did not go well for Zuck.</p>
<p>In a breakdown of the case for <em>The American Prospect</em>, editor-in-chief David Dayen opines that "The Government Has Already Won the Meta Case," having hanged Zuck on his own words:</p>
<p><a href="https://prospect.org/power/2025-04-16-government-already-won-meta-case-tiktok-ftc-zuckerberg/">https://prospect.org/power/2025-04-16-government-already-won-meta-case-tiktok-ftc-zuckerberg/</a></p>
<p>The government is attempting to prove that Zuck bought Instagram and Whatsapp in order to extinguish competitors (and not, for example, because he thought they were good businesses that complemented Facebook's core product offerings).</p>
<p>This case starts by proving how Zuck felt about Insta and WA before the acquisitions. On Insta, Zuck circulated memos warning about Insta's growth trajectory:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  they appear to be reaching critical mass as a place you go to share photos
</p></blockquote>
<p>and how that could turn them into a future competitor:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [Instagram could] copy what we’re doing now … I view this as a big strategic risk for us if we don’t completely own the photos space.
</p></blockquote>
<p>These are not the words of a CEO who thinks another company is making a business that complements his own – they're confessions that he is worried that they will <em>compete</em> with Facebook. Facebook tried to clone Insta (Remember Facebook Camera? Don't feel bad – neither does anyone else). When that failed, Zuck emailed Facebook execs, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [Instagram's growth is] really scary and why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.
</p></blockquote>
<p>At this point, Zuck's CFO – one of the adults in the room, attempting to keep the boy king from tripping over his own dick – wrote to Zuck warning him that it was illegal to buy Insta in order to "neutralize a potential competitor."</p>
<p>Zuck replied that he was, indeed, solely contemplating buying Insta in order to neutralize a potential competitor. It's like this guy kept picking up his dictaphone, hitting "record," and barking, "Hey Bob, I am in receipt of your memo of the 25th, regarding the potential killing of Fred. You raise some interesting points, but I wanted to reiterate that this killing is to be a <em>murder</em>, and it must be as <em>premeditated as possible</em>. Yours very truly, Zuck."</p>
<p>Did Zuck buy Insta to neutralize a competitor? Sure seems like it! For one thing, Zuck cancelled all work on Facebook Camera "since we're acquiring Instagram."</p>
<p>But what about <em>after</em> the purchase. Did Zuck reduce quality and/or raise costs? Well, according to the company, it enacted an "explicit policy of not prioritizing Instagram’s growth" (a tactic called "buy or bury"). At this juncture, Zuckerberg once again put fingers to keyboard in order to create an immortal record of his intentions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  By not killing their products we prevent everyone from hating us and we make sure we don’t immediately create a hole in the market for someone else to fill.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And if someone <em>did</em> enter the market with a cool new gimmick (like, say, Snapchat with its disappearing messages)?</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Even if some new competitors spring up, if we incorporate the social mechanics they were using, these new products won’t get much traction since we’ll already have their mechanics deployed at scale.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember, the Insta acquisition is only illegal if Zuck bought them to prevent competition in the marketplace (rather than, say, to make a better product). It's hard to prove why a company does anything, <em>unless</em> its CEO, founder, and holder of the majority of its voting stock explicitly states that his strategy is to create a system to ensure that innovating new products "won't get much traction" because he'll be able to quickly copy them.</p>
<p>So we have Zuck starving Insta of development except when he needs to neutralize a competitor, which is just another way of saying he set out to reduce the quality of the product after acquisition, a thing that is statutorily prohibited, but hard to prove (again, unless you confess to it in writing, herp derp).</p>
<p>But what about prices? Well, obviously, Insta doesn't charge its end-users in cash, but they <em>do</em> charge in attention. If you want to see the things you've explicitly asked for – posts from accounts you follow – you have to tolerate a certain amount of "boosted content" and ads, that is, stuff that Facebook's business customers will pay to nonconsensually cram into your eyeballs.</p>
<p>Did that price go up? Any Insta user knows the answer: hell yes. Instagram is such a cesspit of boosted content and ads that it's almost impossible to find stuff you actually asked to see. Indeed, when a couple of teenagers hacked together an alternative Insta client called OG App that only showed you posts from accounts you followed, it was instantly the most popular app on Google Play and Apple's App Store (and then Google and Apple killed it, at Meta's request):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained</a></p>
<p>But <em>why</em> did the price go up? Did it go up because Facebook had neutralized a competitor by purchasing it, and thus felt that it could raise prices without losing customers? Again, a hard thing to prove…unless Zuck happened to put it in writing. Which he did, as Brendan Benedict explains in Big Tech On Trial:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I think we’re badly mismanaging this right now. There’s absolutely no reason why IG ad load should be lower than FB at a time when . . . we’re having engagement issues in FB. If we were managing our company correctly, then at a minimum we’d immediately balance IG and FB ad load . . . But it’s possible we should even have a higher ad load on IG while we have this challenge so we can replace some ads with [People You May Know] on FB to turn around the issues we’re seeing.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/zuckerberg-v-zuckerberg-will-the">https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/zuckerberg-v-zuckerberg-will-the</a></p>
<p>So there you have it: Zuck bought Insta to neutralize a competitor, and after he did, he lowered its quality and raised its prices, because he knew that he was operating without significant competitors thanks to his acquisition of that key competitor. Zuck's motivations – as explained by Zuck himself – were in direct contravention of antitrust law, a thing he <em>knew</em> (because his execs explained it to him). That's a pretty good case.</p>
<p>But what about Whatsapp? How did Zuck feel about it? Well, he told his board that Whatsapp was Facebook's greatest "consumer risk," fretting that "Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp." He blocked Whatsapp ads on Facebook, telling his team that it was "trying to build social networks and replace us." Sure, they'd lose money by turning away that business, but the "revenue is immaterial to us compared to any risk." Sure seems like Zuck saw Whatsapp as a competitor.</p>
<p>Meta's final line of defense in this case is that even if they did some crummy, illegal things, they still didn't manage to put together a monopoly. According to Meta's lawyers – who're billing the company more than $1m/day! – Meta is a tiny fish in a vast ocean that has many competitors, like Tiktok:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.levernews.com/mr-zuckerbergs-very-expensive-day-in-court/">https://www.levernews.com/mr-zuckerbergs-very-expensive-day-in-court/</a></p>
<p>There's only one problem with this "market definition" argument, and that problem's name is Chatty Mark Zuckerberg. On the question of market definition, FTC lawyers once again raised Zuckerberg's own statements and those of his top lieutenants to show that Zuckerberg viewed his companies as "Personal Social Networks" (PSNs) and not as just generic sites full of stuff, competing with Youtube, Tiktok, and everyone else who lets users post things to the internet.</p>
<p>Take Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, who explained that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Instagram will always need to focus on friends and can never exclusively be for public figures or will cease to be a social product.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And then there was Zuck's memo explaining why he offered $6b for Snapchat:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Snap Stories serves the exact same use case of sharing and consuming feeds of content that News Feed and Instagram deliver. We need to take this new dynamic seriously—both as a competitive risk and as a product opportunity to add functionality that many people clearly love and want to use daily.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And an internal strategy document that explained the competitive risks to Facebook:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Social networks have two stable equilibria: either everyone uses them, or no-one uses them. In contrast, nonsocial apps (e.g. weather apps, exercise apps) can exist [somewhere] along a continuum of adoption. The binary nature of social networks implies that there should exist a tipping point, ie some critical mass of adoption, above which a network will organically grow, and below which it will shrink.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure sounds like Facebook sees itself as a "social network," and not a "nonsocial app." And of course – as Dayen points out – when Tiktok (a company Meta claims as a competitor) went up for sale, Meta did <em>not</em> enter a bid, despite being awash in free cash flow.</p>
<p>In Zuckerberg's defense, he's not the only tech CEO who confesses his guilt in writing (recall that FTX planned its crimes in a groupchat called WIREFRAUD). Partly that's because these firms are run by arrogant twits, but partly it's because digital culture is a written culture, where big, dispersed teams expected to work long hours from offices all over the world as well as from their phones every hour of day and night have to rely on memos to coordinate:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/03/big-tech-cant-stop-telling-on-itself/">https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/03/big-tech-cant-stop-telling-on-itself/</a></p>
<p>When Dayen claims that "the government has won the Meta case," he doesn't mean the judge will rule in the FTC's favor (though there's a high likelihood that this will happen). Rather, he means that the case has been proven beyond any kind of reasonable doubt, in public, in a way that has historically caused other monopolists to lose their nerve, even if they won their cases. Take Microsoft and IBM – though both companies managed to draw out their cases until a new Republican administration (Reagan for IBM, GWB for Microsoft) took office and let them off the hook, both companies were profoundly transformed by the process.</p>
<p>IBM created the market for a generic, multivendor PC whose OS came from outside the company:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/ibm-pc-compatible-how-adversarial-interoperability-saved-pcs-monopolization">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/ibm-pc-compatible-how-adversarial-interoperability-saved-pcs-monopolization</a></p>
<p>And Microsoft spared Google the same treatment it had meted out to Netscape, allowing the company to grow and thrive:</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-apple-microsoft-antitrust-technology-cases-1e0c510088825745a6e74ba3b81b44c6">https://apnews.com/article/google-apple-microsoft-antitrust-technology-cases-1e0c510088825745a6e74ba3b81b44c6</a></p>
<p>Trump being Trump, it's not inconceivable that he will attempt to intervene to get the judge to exonerate Meta. After all, Zuck did pay him a $1m bribe and then beg him to do just that:</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/zuckerberg-really-thought-trump-would-make-metas-legal-problems-go-away-2000589897">https://gizmodo.com/zuckerberg-really-thought-trump-would-make-metas-legal-problems-go-away-2000589897</a></p>
<p>But as Dayen writes, the ire against Meta's monopolistic conduct is thoroughly bipartisan, and if Trump was being strategic here (a very, very big "if"), he would keep his powder dry here. After all, if the judge <em>doesn't</em> convict Meta, Trump won't have wasted any political capital. And if Meta <em>is</em> convicted, Trump could solicit more bribes and favors at the "remedy" stage, when a court will decide how to punish Meta, which could be anything from a fine to a breakup order, to a nothingburger of vague orders to clean up its act.</p>

      <p>The prostate gland causes entirely too many problems.  In the US,
prostate cancer kills about one man of every forty.  “Benign
prostate hyperplasia” (BPH) is even more common, affecting most
men over age 60.  It pinches the urinary tract, making it hard to
urinate, and is constantly in danger of transforming from
“benign” to “malignant”.  Even the difficulty urinating is enough
of a problem that men often get surgery for it, usually TURP, a
sort of roto-rooter job (except cutting through the pipe instead
of just cleaning it out).</p>
<p>In women, breast cancer has a similar death toll, but the breasts
have an excuse: they’re much bigger; there are many more cells to
go bad.  They’re also much more metabolically active, capable of
producing enough milk to feed a baby; the prostate’s output is
tiny in comparison.</p>
<p>One idea I’ve seen is that the prostate serves as the body’s
“gatekeeper” against sexually transmitted diseases, and in the
process often gets chronically infected itself; the resulting
inflammation may cause hyperplasia, first benign then malignant.
Infectious causation is too often neglected these days, and
sexually transmitted diseases are common, so this is not
unreasonable.  But it doesn’t seem like a great explanation.  The
prostate doesn’t filter the urinary tract; it just secretes into
it; there’s no real “gate” there to be “kept”.  The prostate’s
position is like that of the salivary glands, which are not known
for being great houses of cancer.  And the epidemiology backs
this up: correlations with STDs are there, but not huge.  The
odds ratios are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15988645/">between one and two</a>; in comparison, the odds
ratio for human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer is
greater than ten.  An odds ratio of ten should make the ears perk
up; an odds ratio of 1.5 can be a minor effect or can be just a
spurious correlation.  And with the prostate, there’s not just a
minor effect which needs explaining: there has to be some
major-league cause.</p>
<p>A decade ago, Scott Alexander, in his blog “Slate Star Codex”,
<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/09/12/the-life-cycle-of-medical-ideas/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“About five years ago, two Israeli doctors named Gat and
Goren posit the theory that benign prostatic hyperplasia,
a prostate disease that affects millions of older men, is
caused by incompetence of the spermatic veins. They claim
they can treat it surgically, and show off rows of
smiling patients with glowing testimonials. Once again,
the guys are good doctors, nothing about their theory
contradicts basic laws of biology, and no one else has
any better ideas.</p>
<p>I shamefacedly admit I want this one to be true. There’s
so much “well, everything is a complicated combination of
genes, biomolecules, biopsychosocial stressors and immune
modulators that we may never really understand” going on
in medicine today that it would be super gratifying if
this one mysterious disease turned out to just be
plumbing going in the wrong direction. And although the
prostate is about as far from my area of expertise as it
is possible to be, I have to say that from a
physiological standpoint their theory seems to have that
rare and much-sought scientific elegance, where
everything comes together in a pretty package.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the medical community has totally
ignored this one. Gat and Goren have published their
hypothesis and their apparent excellent results <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18811916/">in
peer-reviewed medical journals</a>. It has garnered <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18811915/">praise</a>
from prestigious figures in the field (bonus points for
calling it “seminal”, especially if the pun was
intentional). As far as I know, no one has attacked it or
even formally expressed doubt. Yet as far as I know, it
has gone nowhere.</p>
<p>Does everyone mutually assume that if something this
revolutionary were true, someone would have noticed beyond a
single article in a urology journal? Do they just decide it needs
further research, and hope that this research will be conducted
by someone else? Or do they think that it would end up like
Zamboni’s MS cure, with hundreds of thousands of dollars wasted,
dozens of unnecessary surgeries performed, and nothing to show
but yet another fringe medical idea that sounded good at the
time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read that some time after it was written, and found that
there’s since been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25389666/">a small confirmatory study</a> from Germany.
So it hasn’t been entirely neglected.  Gat and Goren also have
other papers in the area.  (The latter author is sometimes listed
as “Gornish”, that being the non-Hebraicized verson of his name.)</p>
<p>At any rate, Scott’s was more of a social view of the question
than a technical one.  Still, it was intriguing enough to get me
to read the papers he linked to, and then to read the authors’
other papers on the subject.  I found that the above language
does not convey the full scope of the theory.  This is not just
about BPH; it’s also about prostate cancer, and also about
varicocele, the top cause of male infertility.  And it promises
to eliminate all these problems, if caught early enough, which is
not hard: screening for it is simple and cheap.</p>
<p>The theory here is largely mechanical; and it’s not just
psychiatrists like Scott who are weak at mechanical explanations;
it’s doctors in general as well as medical researchers and
biologists.  There is even a famous paper “Can a Biologist Fix a
Radio?”, wherein the biologist author laments the unsuitability
of biological reasoning, at least of the usual sort, for the task
of fixing an old radio.  (End result: “the radio remains
broken.”)  Reading medical review papers, I have often gotten
quite disgusted at the way they list result after result in the
fashion “X has an effect on Y”, without saying what the size of
the effect is or even what dose of X is required.  Especially
when you want to chain two mechanisms together (X having an
effect on Y and then Y having an effect on Z), you’ve got to know
the numbers.  The convention is that p=0.06 means “it doesn’t
have an effect” and p=0.04 means “it has an effect”, but any real
thought requires more than just that binary view of things.</p>
<p>I’m thoroughly comfortable with mechanical theory and practice,
so here’s an attempt at a full rendering of the Gat/Goren theory,
in language as simple as the subject permits, followed by my own
comments.  The basic idea is this: in healthy men, blood flows
out from the testicles into the spermatic veins (of which there
is one for each testicle).  Each spermatic vein goes up
vertically inside the body until it’s near the kidney on that
side.  (The kidneys are about halfway up the back.)  The left
spermatic vein then feeds into the left kidney vein, while the
right spermatic vein feeds directly into the vena cava (the vein
“as big as a cave”; it’s the largest vein in the body, leading
directly back to the heart; the kidney veins also feed into it).
Each spermatic vein has about seven one-way valves to prevent
blood from flowing the wrong way through the vein, which it would
otherwise do due to the force of gravity.  The following diagram
from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32833288/">their latest paper</a> shows the situation in healthy men.
(That paper is under a Creative Commons license, which this
re-use is in accordance with; I’ve slightly altered their diagram
to un-abbreviate the labels.  The subsequent images are also
re-used under the same license.)</p>
<p><img src="https://yarchive.net/photos/vein_diagram1.webp"></p><p>With age and wear and tear, the one-way valves cease to function,
and blood does flow the wrong way: down the vein towards the
testicles.  It bathes them in poorly-oxygenated blood, which is
bad for them, eventually killing the germ cells which produce
sperm and causing infertility.</p>
<p>The medical literature often blames that infertility on the
warmth which is produced by that reverse blood flow, but Gat and
Goren <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15932914/">blame the low oxygen</a>: warmth does interfere with sperm
production, but it’s low oxygen that actually kills
sperm-producing cells, as occurs in men with this disorder.  (The
warmth is still quite useful for diagnosing the disorder since
thermal imaging shows it plainly.)</p>
<p>The blood from the testicles, still at higher than normal
pressure, then continues on out the network of veins in that
area, and spills into the prostate, going backwards through veins
that normally drain the prostate; to use their diagram from the
same paper:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarchive.net/photos/vein_diagram2.webp"></p><p>Since this blood has just left the testicles, it is heavily
loaded with testosterone, which promotes prostate growth.  Making
things even worse, that blood has a much higher than normal
percentage of free testosterone.  Normally the vast majority of
testosterone in the blood is bound to sex hormone binding
globulin (SHBG); only a tiny proportion is free, but that
proportion has the actual hormone effect.  In the testicular
flow, there isn’t enough SHBG to bind to all the testosterone;
that happens only on the way back to the heart when it is mixed
with the blood returning from the rest of the body.  So the total
effect is to hit prostate cells with about a hundred times the
normal dose of free testosterone.  This makes them grow; their
growth is called benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer.
There’s also another effect of the high pressure: swelling the
prostate (pressurizing it and expanding it).  It also swells the
veins in the scrotum, the “pampiniform plexus” above the
testicles; when that swelling is prominent enough, it is given
the name “varicocele”.</p>
<p>(I’d originally imagined that their reason for the high free
testosterone was that the testosterone molecules took time to
find the SHBG molecules and bind to them, but that process seems
to be too fast: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/096007609090334H">this study</a> found a half-life of 12 seconds
for dissociation, and at equilibrium the rate of association must
equal the rate of dissociation.  So overwhelming the local supply
of SHBG seems like a better explanation, though being out of
equilibrium might add to it a bit.)</p>
<p>This theory can explain why giving men testosterone doesn’t seem
to increase the risk of prostate cancer, despite testosterone
promoting prostate cancer.  Giving men testosterone shuts down
their own production of testosterone, making backflow from the
testicles to the prostate harmless.  Thus even with more
testosterone in their blood, they can have less in the prostate
gland.</p>
<p>It can also explain why low testosterone is correlated with
prostate cancer: the backflow damages the testicles via hypoxia,
lowering testosterone, while simultaneously funneling the
testosterone that still <em>is</em> released directly to the prostate.</p>
<p>The way Gat and Goren fix this is simply by destroying the
spermatic veins.  Under fluoroscopy (that is, viewing an X-ray
image continuously during the procedure), they snake a catheter
in through the veins until it gets to the top of the spermatic
vein.  They then inject a pulse of X-ray contrast agent to make
the flow in that vein visible under the fluoroscope, proving that
the flow really is going the wrong way.  Having done so, they
then have the patient close off the bottom of the vein with
finger pressure while they inject a sclerosing agent into the
vein; they start by moving the catheter to the bottom and
sclerosing that portion, then repeatedly withdraw the catheter a
bit (moving up) and inject more.  After a few minutes the vein is
thoroughly and permanently clogged.  This is their diagram of the
results:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarchive.net/photos/vein_diagram3.webp"></p><p>To say a bit more about the background of this theory, venous
circulation is not a one-path-only thing: the veins are not like
a tree, where there’s only one path from the trunk to each leaf.
Indeed, this multiplicity of paths is why the problem arises in
the first place: the testicles being drained both by the
spermatic veins and by the local circulation.  It’s also why it
can be solved in this manner: the remaining veins enlarge a bit
to accomodate the flow, as well as new veins growing.  But it’s
also why they need to be thorough when performing the procedure.
Besides destroying both spermatic veins (a weakness, Gat and
Goren say, of other doctors’ work, where it’s often only done on
the left vein where the swollen veins tend to be more prominent),
they also follow up by injecting more pulses of contrast agent to
make sure that there’s no collateral circulation bypassing the
blocked vein, and that the veins they did treat are really
blocked.  (The finger blocking the vein at the bottom keeps the
sclerosing agent where it belongs rather than letting it spread
further into the body.  Of course a little of it still spreads,
but the sort of agent they use is harmless at low
concencentrations.)</p>
<p>It’s odd for there to be such an easily-removable design flaw in
the human body; evolution tends to remove them.  Since it strikes
at advanced ages, BPH doesn’t make a big impact on a man’s
ability to pass on his genes.  But being the leading cause of
male infertility sure does.  Their explanation is that evolution
hasn’t had much time to work on the problem; in animals the
spermatic vein is horizontal, and doesn’t have or need one-way
valves.  It’s our standing upright that yields the problem; in
evolutionary terms that’s a recent development.</p>
<p>So that’s their theory.  There is an obvious question, though,
which mechanically-inclined reviewers might have raised, and
which deserves an answer.  It has to do with pressure and height.
As Gat and Goren say, it is a law of physics that pressure within
a fluid increases as one descends deeper into the fluid, in
direct proportion to the depth.  (They invoke Bernoulli’s
equation, which also involves the velocity of the fluid, but they
then assume the velocity is negligible, so are using only the
part of the equation that relates pressure to height.)</p>
<p>But they apply this law only to the blood in the spermatic vein.
It is also applicable to the blood in the arteries and to the
blood in other veins.  Doing so, though, would ruin their
argument: it would mean that although pressure increases as one
descends down the spermatic vein, it also increases in the other
veins.  In their account, blood goes backward through the
spermatic vein, emerging at a pressure of 40 cm H2O or so, then
pours into other veins which, drained by the common iliac vein
which in turn is drained by the inferior vena cava, are at less
than 10 cm H2O.  (They use mm Hg as their units, but I’ll be
converting all pressures to cm of water, since it’s a more
directly relevant unit: blood’s density is close to that of
water.)</p>
<p>But gravity acts also on the iliac vein and the vena cava!  In
general, if you have a loop of tubing in a gravitational field,
and the fluid inside is not in motion, the pressure of the fluid
is everywhere proportional to altitude, no matter how the tubing
is shaped.  No spontaneous circulation arises.  Here we have a
loop with the spermatic vein being on one side and the vena cava
and iliac vein on the other, connected on top and bottom, and the
claim is that this is enough to give rise to spontaneous
circulation.  It’s not.</p>
<p>Yet there is reverse flow in the spermatic vein when the valves
fail; that’s standard medical knowledge.  And, as mentioned, Gat
and Goren confirm the reverse flow by injecting tracer dye into
each and every vein they treat, before sclerosing that vein.  The
reverse flow exists; it just has to have a more complicated
explanation than the one they provide.</p>
<p>Another part of their argument is that venous blood infiltrates
the prostate due to the venous pressure exceeding the local
pressure in the arteries that feed the prostate.  But gravity
also acts on the blood in arteries.  If the local arterial
pressure were equally boosted by height, it could not be
exceeded.</p>
<p>Fortunately for their argument, that’s not the way the human body
works.  It sort of theoretically could work that way, if all the
blood vessels were rigid: pressure everywhere would increase with
decreasing altitude in the same way that pressure increases with
depth inside the ocean.  Relative pressures would be higher in
arteries, lower in veins, and intermediate in capillaries: the
pressure difference between artery and vein would be the same
throughout the body, but the pressures of both would be highest
in the feet and lowest in the head.  (For fish, or babies in the
womb, this works even without blood vessels being rigid, due to
the outside pressure varying with altitude in the same way as the
pressure in their blood vessels does; all the fluids involved
have densities close enough to the density of water that the
difference doesn’t matter.)</p>
<p>Of course in fact blood vessels are not at all rigid.  Arteries
are the closest to being rigid; they’re thick-walled and can take
a lot of pressure, though they still have an important amount of
elasticity.  Veins, though, are thin-walled: they swell up with
higher pressure and collapse flat at negative pressure.
Capillaries don’t swell, but at higher pressures they leak fluid
into the surrounding tissues, producing swelling there.  So the
body maintains capillary pressures in the neighborhood of 20 cm
H2O (somewhat higher at the start of the capillary and somewhat
lower at its exit).</p>
<p>The usual figures for blood pressure (the ones for which “normal”
is about “120 over 80”) are arterial pressures in units of mm Hg,
measured with a blood cuff around the arm (at about the same
altitude as the heart).  In that example, the 120 is the maximum
pressure just after the heart beats, and the 80 is the minimum
pressure it reaches between beats.  Those numbers translate into
about 160 cm H2O and 110 cm H2O.</p>
<p>In a standing person, the arterial blood pressure is considerably
higher if measured at the ankles, as it would be in the
rigid-vessel model.  But then as large arteries divide down into
smaller and smaller arteries, most of that pressure is spent
before it gets to the capillaries.  This is not just a matter of
passive friction but also of active control: arteries have
muscular walls and contract to restrict blood flow to the part of
the body that they feed.  When more blood flow is needed
somewhere, the local arteries relax to let it through.</p>
<p>Veins operate at low pressure, usually less than 15 cm H2O; the
hard part, and the part that is most relevant here, is explaining
how they get blood upwards against gravity, since their pressure
is nowhere near enough to do so.  The one-way valves in the
spermatic vein have already been mentioned, and are present in
many other veins too, but valves themselves don’t do any actual
pumping work (in the physics sense of the word “work”).  Yet work
needs to be done to pump blood uphill.  In most cases that work
is supplied by muscle movements in nearby muscles, which compress
the veins.  In engineering, pumps are often built with two
one-way valves, the volume between those valves being alternately
compressed and expanded; the principle is the same here.  But
since it relies on muscle movements which are made for other
purposes, this process is slow and uncertain.  So to get the same
throughput the veins are much wider than the arteries.</p>
<p>When the veins’ one-way valves fail near the surfaces of the
legs, it results in high pressures and swollen, unsightly
“varicose veins”.  Even with functioning valves, standing
motionless results in high venous pressures in the feet; thus the
advice, on long trips sitting down, to take breaks and to move
the feet and legs around, so as to avoid blood stagnating and
clotting (a “deep vein thrombosis”).  For blood circulation
fidgeting is good, even if it’s not “good manners”.</p>
<p>But the vena cava is different: it doesn’t have any valves;
neither does the iliac vein (at least the portion of it under
discussion here).  Yet somehow blood which feeds into it at low
pressure manages to climb to the heart, overcoming that 40 mm H2O
pressure difference and more.</p>
<p>I looked in the medical literature for how this actually happens,
and was disappointed not to find a clear, definitive answer.
It’s common to see it stated that breathing has an effect.  The
heart is located between the lungs, so shares a common pressure
compartment.  The pressure outside the heart is about the same as
the pressure outside the lungs.  That pressure decreases to
inhale and increases to exhale.  But those pressure excursions
are minor: about 1 cm H2O in either direction.  (This rises with
heavy breathing, as in exercise; but the blood circulation has to
work even when the body is calm.)</p>
<p>There is also a disturbing level of confusion in the medical
literature as regards what “zero pressure” is.  Good engineering
practice is to say what reference pressure one is measuring
against.  Commonly that is the ambient pressure (the pressure of
the air surrounding the body, which is about 1000 cm H2O at sea
level and lower at higher altitudes).  To inhale, one obviously
has to drop the pressure in the lungs below ambient pressure.  A
measurement relative to ambient pressure is called “gauge
pressure” by engineers, because it’s what the usual sorts of
pressure gauges tell you.  The old-fashioned mercury manometers
for measuring blood pressure measured gauge pressure, since they
were open to the air on their other end.  Modern mercury-free
manometers are no doubt built to give the same numbers (so as to
be compatible, and also because it’s easy to build a gauge that
way.)  So the usual arterial blood pressure numbers are all
referenced against ambient pressure.</p>
<p>That is so even if medical literature tries to confuse the
matter, as happens.  Take, for instance, this passage in Guyton
and Hall’s <em>Textbook of Medical Physiology</em>, 14th edition (a
standard text in medical schools):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pressure Reference Level for Measuring Venous and
Other Circulatory Pressures</strong>  Although we have spoken of
right atrial pressure as being 0 mm Hg and arterial pressure
as being 100 mm Hg, we have not stated the gravitational
level in the circulatory system to which this pressure is
referred. There is one point in the circulatory system at which
gravitational pressure factors caused by changes in body
position of a healthy person usually do not affect the pressure
measurement by more than 1 to 2 mm Hg. This is at or near
the level of the tricuspid valve, as shown by the crossed
axes in Figure 15-12. Therefore, all circulatory pressure
measurements discussed in this text are referred to this level,
which is called the reference level for pressure measurement…</p>
<p>When a person is lying on his or her back, the tricuspid
valve is located at almost exactly 60% of the chest thickness
in front of the back. This is the zero pressure reference level
for a person lying down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what is meant by that?  It purports to define a pressure
reference level, and one that is not just equal to ambient
pressure.  But does it mean that every single blood pressure
measurement in the entire book was done by snaking a catheter
into the heart until it reaches the tricuspid valve, and using
that as reference?  Of course not!  That would be ridiculously
dangerous and expensive.  Also, that valve is in the middle of
the heart: it’s the valve between the right atrium and the right
ventricle.  The pressure there varies strongly as the heart
beats, making it unsuitable as an experimental reference
pressure.</p>
<p>So the passage cannot really mean that it is defining a reference
<em>pressure</em>.  Instead it is defining a pressure reference
<em>altitude</em>.  I take it to be just an overly fancy way of
standardizing the practice of putting the blood pressure cuff
around the top of the arm with the arm draping normally down the
side of the body, which puts the cuff at about heart height.
(Even on someone lying down, that position of the cuff is still
at about heart height.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately it also betrays a lack of real precision, which is
probably unimportant as regards the usual use (arterial
pressures), since those numbers are large, but is important when
dealing with the much lower pressures in veins and the issue of
how venous blood is pushed back from the lower body to the heart.</p>
<p>This lack of a definition also extends to the Gat and Goren
papers: they give pressure numbers, but never say <em>relative to
what</em>.  Ambient pressure generally seems like the best reference
pressure to use; I will be hoping that papers I cite for
pressures used it, but also, since none of them say they do, not
placing much trust in any absolute numbers.</p>
<p>Enough complaining; time to return to the question of how blood
makes it back to the heart.  As mentioned, inhaling a breath
reduces the pressure in the heart and lungs; but that reduced
pressure ends at the diaphragm, the sheet of muscle and tendon
that separates the thorax (heart and lungs) from the abdomen
(guts).  The diaphragm is arched upwards; to inhale we contract
it, flattening it and lowering the pressure in the heart and
lungs while increasing the pressure in the abdomen.  Those two
pressure changes add together to force blood in the vena cava up
past the diaphragm toward the heart.  (This is for normal
breathing; in general the pressure in the abdomen can vary quite
considerably depending on what the abdominal muscles are doing,
as measured for instance in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37629-5">this</a> paper.  Above the
diaphragm, it also depends on what the rib muscles are doing,
they being another force that powers breathing.  But in normal
breathing the diaphragm is the main actor.)</p>
<p>So breathing helps as regards the general problem of returning
blood to the heart.  Still, the heart does need blood feeding it
when breathing out as well as when breathing in.  We don’t
synchronize our breaths with our heartbeats, nor could we, since
breaths are less frequent.  (The frequency of the heartbeat does
change a bit in breathing out compared to breathing in, though.)</p>
<p>It helps that the lungs are elastic, and would collapse if there
weren’t more pressure inside them than outside.  This means the
normal pressure in the thorax is negative, helping to pull blood
in.  This “transpulmonary pressure” (the difference between the
air pressure in the lung and the fluid pressure outside it) is
about 6 cm H2O.</p>
<p>The heart, as it relaxes from its contraction, presumably also
can exert a bit of suction on the incoming flow; it’s obviously
not rigid enough to exert much suction, but every little bit
helps.</p>
<p>That the system operates right on the edge, getting blood back to
the heart with almost no pressure to spare, can be seen by the
reader if he examines the veins on the back of his hand: if held
at lap level those veins stand out, full of blood, while if
raised to eye level they flatten.  By moving the hand up or down
slowly, giving the veins time to empty or fill, the level where
the transition from full to flat occurs can be determined; it’s
about at the same level as the heart.  (This demonstration
probably won’t work for everyone; blood vessels are less
prominent in the young, and also can be hidden by fat.)</p>
<p>Now to return to the main question here, which is backflow in the
spermatic veins.  Those veins are entirely below the diaphragm.
They are in the same pressure compartment as the vena cava is at
that altitude (the retroperitoneal space), so the two competing
flow paths are under about the same pressures.</p>
<p>I’m afraid that the answer is that Gat and Goren are simply wrong
about the pressure at the bottom of the vena cava when standing:
it must be at considerably higher pressure than the sub-10-cm H2O
that they say it is – or at least it is when the patient is
standing up (or sitting normally).  It’s an understandable error,
since the medical literature usually refers to the lower numbers:
in circumstances where it matters, patients are commonly
horizontal.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/564306">a paper from 1966</a> which measured intravenous
pressures both with the patient horizontal and with the patient
standing: the horizontal numbers are in accordance with Gat and
Goren’s, but the standing numbers are considerably higher.  Using
their numbers for the common iliac vein (since they don’t say
where in the vena cava they measured pressures, and since the
common iliac vein is where the veins from the prostate enter, so
is the most relevant number anyway), the average of their three
measurements has the pressure with patient horizontal as 8 cm H2O
(plus an additional 9 cm H2O when breathing in), and the pressure
with patient erect as 30 cm H2O (plus an additional 15 cm H2O
when breathing in).  If we accept these numbers, the pressure in
the common iliac vein is close to the pressure in the bottom of
the spermatic veins.</p>
<p>Again, though, it’s generally agreed that the backflow exists, at
least through the spermatic vein.  (Gat and Goren’s contribution
is extending it to the prostate.)  The large pressure difference
they say is driving the backflow is calculated based on improper
assumptions, but there must be <em>some</em> pressure difference driving
the backflow.</p>
<p>Now, one difference between the two veins competing for flow here
is that the vena cava is much larger and thus has much less
frictional resistance to flow.  In general, blood flow in the
body is dominated by frictional effects (fluid friction, that is,
aka viscosity): Gat and Goren cite Poiseuille’s equation for
fluid flow, which states that flow is proportional to the fourth
power of the diameter of the pipe.  In comparison, if friction
were zero, the flow would only be proportional to the square of
the diameter of the pipe (that is, proportional to its
cross-sectional area).  But Poiseuille’s equation, which has it
as the fourth power, is the generally-accepted formula for blood
flows.  It’s just an approximation, not a fundamental law, but
the fact that it’s the accepted approximation shows how dominant
friction is in blood flow.</p>
<p>The ratio in diameters between the spermatic vein and the vena
cava is about a factor of 7.  So if equal lengths of the two
veins are subjected to the same pressures, Poiseuille’s equation
says that the vena cava has 2401 times the flow and 49 times the
average flow velocity.  But that just predicts much less forward
flow in the spermatic vein; it does not predict that it
backflows.</p>
<p>Yet it does.  The hydrostatics don’t predict it, though; we need
to look into its hydrodynamics.  The two main sources of dynamic
behavior (pulsations or fluctuations rather than constant flows
and pressures) have already been mentioned: one is the right
atrium, alternately accepting inflow then contracting in the
heartbeat, its input valve slamming shut to prevent backflow.
The other source is the breathing.</p>
<p>Since intestines have basically nothing holding them in place (as
can be attested to by any hunter who has gutted an animal,
slitting open its belly and seeing the guts spill out), it’s not
just the blood in the veins but the whole abdominal compartment
that is reasonably well modeled as having a pressure gradient
determined by altitude: about one cm H2O pressure for every cm of
altitude (since most things in the body have a density close to
that of water).  Of course pressures inside a pressurized cavity
(such as the bladder, a vein, or an intestine) can be higher, but
even within those cavities there is the same pressure gradient
with altitude (unless filled with air or some other gas, as
intestines sometimes are).</p>
<p>Though I earlier alluded to the retroperitoneal space as a
pressure compartment, the peritoneum is a thin membrane which, in
surgery, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12072988/">tears easily</a>; there’s not much chance of it
holding significant pressure for long.  What mainly holds in
abdominal pressure are layers of muscle and connective tissue.
In the bottom of the abdomen this is the pelvic floor muscles.
In men, those are just below the prostate, so the prostate too is
in the same pressure compartment.</p>
<p>What isn’t in that pressure compartment are the testicles; they
are hanging out in the breeze, surrounded by ambient pressure.</p>
<p>The level of influence that the heart’s beating has on the
pressure in the vena cava can be judged by the velocity of flow
in it.  According to measurements done in <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.RES.23.3.349">this paper</a>, the
velocity in the inferior vena cava peaks at 45 cm/second (in
people breathing normally while lying down, and measured at the
level of the T11-T12 intervertebral disc).  Per Bernoulli’s
equation, that energy density is the same as is produced by a
pressure rise of 2 cm against Earth’s gravity.  (This is also the
height an object rises to if it is thrown upwards with that
speed.)</p>
<p>2 cm H2O is not much pressure rise, particularly compared to the
above-cited 15 cm H2O pressure increase in the abdomen for
breathing in.  Also, the pressure pulse from the heartbeat is
entirely inside the veins (and diminishes with distance from the
heart), whereas the 15 cm H2O pressure increase is applied to the
whole compartment uniformly.  (But neither of those numbers is
particularly certain, and both must vary considerably depending
on circumstances.)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, capillaries and veins can only hold limited
blood pressure.  But what matters is the difference between
external and internal pressure.  If capillaries exceed maybe 40
cm H2O, they leak fluid, producing edema; but inside a pressure
compartment at 30 cm H2O that internal pressure limit increases
to 70 cm H2O.  Numbers like those occur near the bottom of the
abdominal cavity when standing: pressures higher all-around
without producing distress.  But if the testicles, which are
outside that pressure compartment, experience the same internal
pressure, that will produce distress in capillaries and veins.</p>
<p>While intact, the spermatic vein is protective: its one-way
valves mean that blood is drawn upwards when the abdominal
pressure is at its minimum and can’t return when it’s at its
maximum.  Still, to get into the abdomen at all, the blood in the
spermatic vein has to be at least at the pressure of the abdomen
(at the point of entry, which here is near the bottom of the
abdomen).  The abdominal pressure varies; if the pressure in the
spermatic vein is between the minimum and the maximum abdominal
pressures, then the part of the vein which is in the abdomen will
be collapsed part of the time, which with intact valves makes for
effective pumping.  If the pressure in the spermatic vein is
above the maximum abdominal pressure, it doesn’t need pumping to
flow, but still functions as a pump, via the vein expanding and
contracting.</p>
<p>So when the one-way valves fail, the pressure at the bottom of
the spermatic vein increases.  Still, the difference in pressure
between the failed and working states is not the full 40 cm H2O
that Gat and Goren deduce from the height of the spermatic vein,
but rather cannot be more than the 15 cm H2O pressure difference
between breathing in and breathing out.</p>
<p>Now, that last number is just a measurement from one paper,
likely from one single Irishman; and if he had been breathing
harder the number would have been higher.  So it should not be
taken as gospel; but it wasn’t easy even finding that number.
Not that I pretend to thoroughness; I could well have missed a
better source, and readers who know of one are invited to provide
it.  But I’ve spent enough time looking that at this point it
seems like it might be easier to measure intra-abdominal pressure
changes myself, sticking a pressure probe up my butt – that’s
literally how <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37629-5">this paper</a> did it (but on horizontal patients
rather than vertical ones, so their numbers are not quite on
point here.)  That’s not quite the same thing that the Irish
paper measured, which was intravenous pressure; sticking a
catheter into my veins is way beyond my skill set.  But for
measuring pressure <em>increase</em> it’s close enough, since the
pressure increase from breathing is applied to the whole
compartment.</p>
<p>In any case, that’s why there’s higher pressure at the bottom of
the spermatic vein when the valves fail, but it doesn’t answer
the question of why there is backflow.  The situation, again, is
of two vertical veins, connected at top and bottom, in the same
pressure compartment, with one vein being much larger than the
other.  Static, constant flow would just be divided between the
two; both would flow upwards.  But consider rhythmically varying
flow, such as is produced by the heartbeat or by breathing.
First there is an acceleration phase, which acts on both veins.
In the vena cava, with much less friction, the blood accelerates
upwards, whereas in the spermatic vein, with more friction, there
is much less acceleration; the extra upwards force is mostly
spent against friction.  Then there’s a deceleration phase.  The
blood in the vena cava has inertia; it’s trying to go upwards but
has to stop, so the pressure at its top increases.  Some of that
higher-pressure blood then is pushed down the spermatic vein.
And the flow up the vena cava has such a dominant share of the
overall flow that even a slight influence like this can yield net
backflow in the spermatic vein.</p>
<p>Now, the mechanism I just described does not seem like a
particularly strong mechanism; but as mentioned, in practice it’s
well established that there is backflow; this is just one way
that theory can agree with that observation.  There may be other
mechanisms that do better, perhaps involving the portion of the
flow which is outside the abdominal pressure compartment, and/or
the relatively narrow veins communicating between the two paths
at the their bottom – though that gets complicated enough that
it’s not easy to think through; a computer model might be in
order.</p>
<p>More questionable, although still quite plausible, is the idea
that the backflow reaches the prostate.  The Gat and Goren theory
is that it is pushed by about 40 cm H2O pressure, overwhelming
even the prostate’s arterial supply.  But that’s pure theory;
they don’t report actually measuring any pressures.  (If they
were researchers I would ding them harshly for not doing the
measurements, but they’re clinicians; they’re paid to cure
patients, not to produce knowledge.)</p>
<p>Gat and Goren didn’t do a great job of proving experimentally
that backflow reaches the prostate, either.  They measured the
high free testosterone levels described above, but that
measurement was at the bottom of the spermatic vein; they didn’t
have their catheter make another turn and go into the deferential
vein and then past its junction with the vesicular vein and into
the vein coming from the prostate, so as to measure high free
testosterone levels in a place where they definitely don’t
belong.  (This is readily excusable: those other veins are much
smaller, so the catheter might not fit or might not be able to
make the sharp turn into the smaller vein.  Again, researchers
should be dinged for omitting such tests – there’s got to be
some way to measure pressures there – but clinicians get a
pass.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest piece of evidence they offer for backflow
to the prostate is an X-ray showing contrast agent which was
injected into the spermatic vein.  They state that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On retrograde venography of the PP, after a
delay of about 10 s, a contrast material ‘blush’, of the
prostate gland capsular region, was observed (Fig. 3).
Both are clearly seen in the image.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s their Figure 3 (again, reproduced from their most recent
paper under the terms of a Creative Commons license):</p>
<p><img src="https://yarchive.net/photos/backflow_fluoroscopy.webp"></p><p>Looking at it, I can see the oval they label “prostate”, but it’s
pretty faint.  There are various other structures (such as the
bladder) which are also visible with similar intensity.  Backflow
down the spermatic vein is clearly visible (all that darkness
going down to the region marked PP, for “pampiniform plexus”, the
network of blood vessels above the testicle), but backflow down
the spermatic vein is not the new part of their theory.  There is
some darkness under the the prostate, which looks like
backflowing dye, but is not clearly connected to the dye in the
PP region.  Even if it is dye, it’s not evident whether it gets
into the prostate itself.  Perhaps specialists who are used to
viewing fluoroscopy images will pronounce this one definitive,
but for me it’d take a movie showing contrast emerging from the
tip of the catheter and then making its way to the prostate; in
this day and age, movies should be easy to provide.  Of course in
their clinical practice they <em>are</em> seeing such a movie with their
own eyes for every patient, so it requires a modest level of
distrust to doubt them on this.  But it’s not entirely unknown
for doctors to succumb to wishful thinking, and “blush” is not a
strong word.  I’m not inclined to distrust them on this, but the
image they show is less than a complete proof.</p>
<p>I’d also be curious, with such a movie, to look for variations in
the flow.  There would no doubt be motion visible from breathing,
and the contrast agent would show how that correlated with blood
flow in the veins.</p>
<p>Breathing would help spread the testosterone-loaded outflow,
since the prostate is inside the abdominal pressure compartment
while the testicles are outside.  Breathing would thus push the
flow alternately in one direction then the other, increasing the
chance of subjecting the prostate to outflow from the testicles.
The movie would show this.  Even if it resulted in only a weak
and diluted flow which didn’t deliver the theorized hundred-fold
increase in free testosterone, a ten-fold increase is still quite
a lot and even a doubling would be important.</p>
<p>A really thorough experimental workup would measure all the
relevant flows and pressures, perhaps by using an intravenous
catheter loaded with multiple pressure and flow sensors each
delivering many measurements per second.  (Whether such a
catheter can be bought today and whether it can be readily
inserted into the veins in question are not matters I have looked
into, but with modern technology there’s got to be a way of
measuring such pressures.)  Testosterone levels would also be
measured at various points.</p>
<p>Recently <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10471166/">a paper by Alyamani et al</a> came out which did do
such measurements of testosterone.  The patients were 266 men
undergoing prostatectomies for prostate cancer, none of whom had
any prior hormonal therapy.  During the course of those
operations the researchers extracted blood from the prostatic
dorsal vein and tested it for testosterone.  They also tested the
removed prostates for testosterone.  They indeed found levels of
testosterone in the dorsal vein and in the prostate which were
many times higher than the levels measured in normal peripheral
blood from the same patient.  Related substances in the samples
were consistent with the blood having come straight from the
testicles.  They dubbed this phenomenon “sneaky T”, and describe
their results as supportive of the Gat/Goren theory.</p>
<p>If I were just being booster-ish, I could leave it at that (“yay,
support”); but I’m taking a hard numerical look.  And from a
numerical point of view, at first glance that support seems weak.
Only 20% of the men had dorsal vein / peripheral vein ratios of
testosterone which were two or greater.  About half of them had
ratios below one.  This is not what you’d expect if this were the
main driving force of prostate cancer: you’d expect seriously
elevated ratios in pretty much all the men, not just in 20% or
50% of them.</p>
<p>The association they found between dorsal vein testosterone and
prostate tissue testosterone is also weak.  By biology standards
it’s totally there (P = 0.004), but there were still a lot of men
with high levels in one of those places and low levels in the
other.  This is not what you want for the definitive mechanical
cause of something.</p>
<p>But the title of <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC423704/">a paper</a> they cite caught my eye:
“Testosterone and estradiol are co-secreted episodically by the
human testis.”  Looking at it, I find it could explain the above
weaknesses: the testicles don’t put out testosterone all the
time, but rather do so only in pulses, at the rate of about one
pulse per hour.  Testosterone stays in the bloodstream long
enough that testosterone measurements in circulating blood don’t
vary much, but the output of the testicles varies quite a lot.
The paper’s measurements (once per fifteen minutes) weren’t
frequent enough to really pin down the length of each pulse, and
accordingly they give no figures for that length; but eyeballing
their graphs, maybe elevated testosterone is present about a
quarter of the time, though it’s hard to tell.</p>
<p>So when the Alyamani paper found doubled levels in 20% of men,
that could mean that it was actually happening in all of them,
just only about 20% of the time in each.  Or it might be
happening in half of them, about 40% of the time in each.  Also,
the stress of surgery might have affected the timing of the
testosterone pulses.</p>
<p>The pulsing also could explain prostate tissue concentrations
often being different from dorsal vein concentrations:
testosterone takes time to sink in, so if they measured on the
leading edge of a pulse the tissue concentrations would be lower
than the vein concentrations, whereas on the trailing edge they’d
be higher.  Or the measurements might have been done at different
times during the course of the surgery; the dorsal vein blood
might have been extracted, say, ten minutes prior to the
prostate’s extraction.</p>
<p>So the Alyamani paper’s measurements are consistent with backflow
of high-testosterone blood being a factor not just in 20% or 50%
of cases but in all of them.  Still, the backflow, when present,
is doubtless stronger in some men and weaker in others.  And
indeed being in that top 20% did have some predictive value:
prostate cancer recurrences were more common in the 20% group.
(Since the prostates themselves were all removed, this presumably
represents metastases.  It would be interesting to know whether
the increased metastases were in the same local area bathed by
high testosterone or whether they were distant; but the paper
does not report this.)  They also did not measure free
testosterone, just total testosterone, so that’s another unknown.</p>
<p>Besides the BPH paper, Gat and Goren even tried their method <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19737278/">on
outright prostate cancer</a> (early stage, Gleason 3+3) and
report disappearance of cancer (as measured via biopsy) in 5 out
of 6 patients, along with lowering of PSA levels.</p>
<p>One thing to note, though, is that their fix of destroying the
spermatic vein and any collaterals can’t make the system as good
as it was originally.  Destroying a backflowing vein always
provides improvement in pressures (since otherwise the vein
wouldn’t be backflowing), but it can’t improve pressures as much
as forward flow would.  The ideal would be valve repair or
replacement; that is done routinely on heart valves, but not on
vein valves.  (This also explains why evolution hasn’t simply
removed the spermatic vein in us: when it’s there and working, it
helps.)</p>
<p>Operations for varicocele are done widely, to try to fix male
fertility, but aren’t always of this sort: it’s common to see the
swollen veins in the scrotum as the problem and simply remove
many of them surgically.  This does not squarely address the
problem of backflow, and indeed there’s a bit of debate in the
medical literature over whether it produces statistically
significant fertility improvements.  (On the whole it seems to,
but there are enough failures to produce debate.)</p>
<p>Even among doctors using the embolization approach (that being
the term for inserting a catheter and using it to apply a
sclerosing agent), many do it only on the left side, that usually
being the one with the visible varicocele.  (There is an
asymmetry among the spermatic veins, with the left vein being a
bit longer and thus more problematic.)  Besides doing both sides
(or at least checking both sides for backflow with contrast
agent), sclerosing each from top to bottom, the full Gat/Goren
procedure is also to check for collateral veins and sclerose
those too, and then follow up with more contrast agent to ensure
that it was done properly.</p>
<p>So there’s a chance that a varicocele surgeon will do this
properly, but one can’t just go to a random varicocele surgeon
and assume he’ll do it properly.  Even someone who does believe
the Gat/Goren theory can screw it up in practice, especially if
you’ve just got done persuading him and this is his first try.</p>
<p>Screening for this disorder is simple: use a thermal camera and
compare testicular temperature sitting up (or standing) versus
lying down, in each case waiting five minutes or so for
temperatures to equilibrate, and taping the penis up so that it
does not affect the measurement.  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14550455/">According to Gat and
Goren</a>, this is almost as good a test as measuring backflow
on fluoroscopy, and a far more sensitive test than trying to look
for the enlarged veins of varicocele.  (Rather than a thermal
camera, they use a liquid crystal strip which is designed and
branded for this exact job; but given how expensive medical items
are, these days thermal cameras are likely cheaper and are
certainly more widely available.  Their calibration is probably
not as good, though.)</p>
<p>In the above-referenced blog post, Scott Alexander goes on to
write that neglect of this sort of new idea isn’t some sort of
conspiracy; it’s just the default.  For starters, most new ideas
everywhere are wrong and deserve to be neglected.  And here it’s
not like drugs where the patent system incentivizes people to
develop new ones and gets them enough money to test them
thoroughly and then pay for billions of dollars in advertising.
It also is not one of the “hot” fields in science where
scientists are racing to study the possibilities.  It’s not
genomics or the microbiome or any other “-ome”; it’s just
plumbing.</p>
<p>He might have added that most of society’s attention on medicine
is focused on squabbling about who pays for it, with precious
little attention given to possibilities of finding new ways to
actually cure disease.  Yet those can represent the most dramatic
cost savings; here, a thousand-dollar procedure might mean not
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on cancer.  The
thinking by the powers-that-be should not always be “oh, no, not
<em>another</em> thing that we’ll have to spend even <em>more</em> money on”,
even when that <em>is</em> true in the short run.</p>
<p>Malpractice law also stacks the deck against innovation: it
doesn’t blame doctors for doing what doctors generally believe in
doing (the “standard of care”), even if the outcome is bad, but
it does blame them in the event of a bad outcome from something
new and innovative.  (Which in a way it should, since most new
ideas are wrong; but it’s never really fair to put only the
failures in front of a scientifically ignorant jury and invite
them to shell out millions in damages.)</p>
<p>Insurance doesn’t pay for “experimental” treatments, either.</p>
<p>Advertising by doctors is also strongly frowned-on, particularly
advertising that goes against conventional wisdom; a doctor who
blanketed the local airwaves with claims of a prostate cancer
cure (or even a preventative) would very likely get his license
yanked by the state medical board.  (Not that broadcast
advertising really would be the way here: too costly for an
individual doctor.  The modern way would be targeted Facebook
ads, relying on Facebook’s intimate knowledge of personal medical
problems.  The medical board might not even find out about it,
though if they did they likely would be extra wrathful.)</p>
<p>The back-to-nature crowd is also not interested, at least not in
the financial sense of “interested”, because there’s nothing here
they can sell as a “dietary supplement” and they aren’t permitted
to perform medical procedures.  Perhaps they could advocate going
back to walking on all fours?  Nah, too impractical.  Going back
to the oceans and living like fish, with a supportive pressure
gradient all around us?  Nah, even more impractical (though there
already is a sect of “aquatic ape” believers out there).</p>
<p>None of this amounts to conspiracy – it’s all in the open – but
it adds up to quite a set of obstacles.  (It’s not like anyone’s
paying <em>me</em> to write this, or like I have much prospect of making
money from it; it’s just the strong curiosity of someone whose
grandfathers both died from prostate cancer.)</p>
<p>Being surgery, this procedure doesn’t need to go through FDA
approval, so there’s no decade-long process to form an obstacle
to people getting it.  Finding a doctor who will do a good job of
it, though, is not simple; a short glance at patient forums
reveals considerable frustration.  I can’t tell if the Gat/Goren
clinic in Israel is still open for business: their website
www.pirion.co.il isn’t responding, and given those doctors’ ages
it wouldn’t be surprising if it has closed.  The German clinic
which did the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25389666/">2014 reproducing study</a> might still be doing
the procedure.  At any rate, though, a single clinic can’t handle
worldwide demand for such a common disorder – not even just
elite demand.</p>
<p>The procedure also doesn’t last forever, according to Gat and
Goren’s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32833288/">latest paper</a>.  They write that new venous bypasses
grow to replace the destroyed spermatic veins: at first these are
tiny, but then grow to where the problem recurs.  Part of their
reasoning, though, is faulty: they write that at first the size
of each growing vein is small enough that capillary action can
draw fluid up.  Now, it’s quite true that capillary action (the
physical/chemical attraction between the fluid and the walls of
the capillary tube) can draw fluid up through great heights;
trees, for instance, rely on it to draw water into the treetops.
But it can only draw fluid up <em>into empty space</em>; it has no
lifting effect when the tube starts out completely filled, as is
the case here.  (In trees it’s the evaporation at the top that
powers it.)  A simpler explanation is just that those tiny veins
are too small to cause the problem to recur.  In any case, the
paper makes no comment as to whether the problem can be solved
the same way a second time; obviously in principle it can, but
finding all the new bypasses and sclerosing them might be
difficult in practice.</p>
<p>As for mass adoption, I’m well aware that this essay is not the
stuff of a mass patient movement.  I’ve tried to make it
accessible, but the needs of actually being accurate and making a
thorough technical argument mean that not more than one in a
thousand patients would read to the end of it.  (If you think
otherwise, please consider that your social circles are not
typical.)  A video with animations would improve that proportion
considerably, maybe to one in a hundred, and I’ve considered it,
though I’m not handy with animation tools.  But it’ll take
serious interest from scientists and doctors to really put an end
to all this prostate trouble.</p>

<p>
    TOKYO (Kyodo) -- A Japanese court on Friday ordered the Japanese unit of online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. to pay 35 million yen ($244,000) in damages for failing to take measures to stop sellers from offering fake products on its platform.
</p>
<!-- cxenseparse_end -->

<!-- cxenseparse_start -->

<p>
    The focus of the trial at the Tokyo District Court was on the degree of obligation Amazon Japan G.K. has to police listings, and how much effort it must make to identify and remove counterfeit goods.
</p>

<p>
    Medical equipment manufacturer Try and E Co. and its distributor Excel Plan Co. sought 280 million yen in damages against Amazon Japan, claiming that their sales declined due to the availability of counterfeit items.
</p>

<p>
    Presiding Judge Yuko Shintani said Amazon is obliged to take effective measures against counterfeits, noting that it failed to stop listings of such products despite being made aware of them.
</p>

<p>
    Try and E and distributor Excel Plan, both based in Kobe, filed the lawsuit over pulse oximeters for measuring blood oxygen levels. Only Excel Plan was compensated.
</p>

<p>
    "The ruling was a landmark in terms of acknowledging the obligation to build an appropriate (authentication) system, as businesses practically have no other option but to use platforms such as that of Amazon," a lawyer representing the plaintiffs said.
</p>

<p>
    The pulse oximeters concerned are developed and manufactured by Try and E, and distributed exclusively by Excel Plan.
</p>

<p>
    According to the suit, Excel Plan was selling a pulse oximeter on Amazon in 2021 while another seller listed a counterfeit item on the same page at about 10 percent of the price of the genuine product.
</p>

<p>
    Since the Amazon system promotes goods with the lowest price, the fake product was more visible on the site, it said.
</p>

<p>
    Excel Plan reported the situation and requested Amazon take appropriate action, but the page listing the genuine oximeter was deleted and the company was unable to sell it, according to the suit.

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Despite significant interest and advancements in humanoid robotics, most existing commercially available hardware remains high-cost, closed-source, and non-transparent within the robotics community. This lack of accessibility and customization hinders the growth of the field and the broader development of humanoid technologies. To address these challenges and promote democratization in humanoid robotics, we demonstrate <b>Berkeley Humanoid Lite</b>, an open-source humanoid robot designed to be accessible, customizable, and beneficial for the entire community. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The core of this design is a modular 3D-printed gearbox for the actuators and robot body. All components can be sourced from widely available e-commerce platforms and fabricated using standard desktop 3D printers, keeping the total hardware cost under $5,000 (based on U.S. market prices). The design emphasizes modularity and ease of fabrication. To address the inherent limitations of 3D-printed gearboxes, such as reduced strength and durability compared to metal alternatives, we adopted a cycloidal gear design, which provides an optimal form factor in this context. Extensive testing was conducted on the 3D-printed actuators to validate their durability and alleviate concerns about the reliability of plastic components. To demonstrate the capabilities of Berkeley Humanoid Lite, we conducted a series of experiments, including the development of a locomotion controller using reinforcement learning. These experiments successfully showcased zero-shot policy transfer from simulation to hardware, highlighting the platform's suitability for research validation.
      </p>
      <p>
        By making the hardware design, embedded code, and training and deployment frameworks fully open-source and globally accessible, we aim for Berkeley Humanoid Lite to serve as a pivotal step toward democratizing the development of humanoid robotics.

    <h2>Comparision</h2>
    <p>
        To be able to benchmark against other robots and illustrate our focus on accessibility and customizability while maintaining sufficient performance, we introduce a quantitative metric that captures cost-effectiveness. Specifically, we define the performance factor as the average peak torque of all actuated DoFs, normalized by the robot's size:
      </p>
      <p>
        \begin{equation}
        \hat{p} = \frac{1}{N h mg} \sum_{i=1}^N |\tau_i^{\max}|.
        \end{equation}
      </p>
      <p>
        $N$ denotes the number of actuated DoFs, $h$ and $mg$ represent the height and weight of the robot, and $|\tau_i^{\max}|$ represents the maximum torque of the i-th joint motor. The performance factor per dollar is then defined as the performance factor divided by the cost or selling price of the robot:
      </p>
      <p>
        \begin{equation}
        \varphi = \frac{\hat{p}}{\text{cost}}.
        \end{equation}
      </p>
      <p>
        As shown in the figure below, our platform achieves high performance factor with a cost lower than <b>$5000</b>.

It was a survey based on nominations from people who wrote into a website  - along with a few bits of research, photography and micky-taking that I carried out myself. I hoped it would be  a book about the true state of the nation – a ‘domesday book of misery’, as an early critic described it.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png" width="578" height="599" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:599,&quot;width&quot;:578,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F854b255b-2559-47ff-ac41-689051e3e0c3_578x599.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>This car, with its poor damaged face,  was left for weeks near my house in Hackney, on my bike route home from work. </figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The Fence generously endorsed this idea by saying that </span><em>Crap Towns</em><span> was something that “struck at the real core values of British life: bodged buildings, massive class anxiety and rampant self-loathing.” </span></p><p><span>The author of the article, Adam Steiner, took </span><em>Crap Towns</em><span> in the spirit I’d always intended.

The fact that he thought of me as the progenitor of this absurd tradition was simultaneously great and disastrous for my ego. Should I be pleased? Should I be ashamed? </p><p>But it wasn’t that that knocked me sideways. Later on in the conversation, we got onto the current state of the nation and he said: “Of course, you wouldn’t get away with it now.”</p><p>Many of other people - plenty of them journalists - have said the same thing to me since, but this was the first. </p><p>It felt like something I had to contend with.</p><p>My first thought was: “Oh shit, there goes the twentieth anniversary edition.”</p><p>My next was (slightly) less self-involved. Instinctively, I knew that my interviewer was right. So what did that imply about modern Britain? And was it good or bad? </p><p>There was part of me wanted to rail against this change. I wanted to conclude that we’ve lost our talent for self-deprecation - and that this was something lamentable. We can’t take jokes any more! </p><p><span>But there was also another part of me that could see that </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ-LivK4-78" rel="">I was yelling at clouds</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>I realised that I was in danger of becoming just the kind of old fart that the younger version of me - the one who had come up with the idea of </span><em>Crap Towns</em><span>  - might have enjoyed satirising. Which left me wondering - who was the asshole in that equation? Young me? Present me? Both of us?</span></p><p>Plus, much as I wanted to blame everyone else for their inability to take jokes about their hometowns on the chin, I could also see the problem:</p><p><em>Crap Towns</em><span> was a book that blatantly and gleefully insulted everyone and everything. Maybe, just maybe, this big idea of mine had not been such a good one?</span></p><p><span>That </span><em>Crap Towns</em><span> was a bad book was definitely the opinion of some podcasters who put out an episode last year describing it as a “cursed object.”</span></p><p>They asked: “How did something so cursed - so unpleasant - end up as a national publishing sensation? Were our brains all fried by lads mags, New Labour and tabloid journalism?”</p><p>They answered those questions by explaining that the problem was that the books were meant to be humorous. </p><p>“They want people to laugh and I find that so unappealing,” said one of the presenters.</p><p>I could feel my head banging against the dustbin of history as she spoke. </p><p>But I have to admit I also find this kind of puritanical outrage pretty amusing. It’s one of life’s delicious ironies that people who don’t want to laugh are often inadvertently hilarious. </p><p>Even so, I also felt sad and worried listening to that podcast. It reflected a kind of strident and confident righteousness that I’m not sure has been good for the world - and I’m not sure will stand up to the scrutiny of time.</p><p><span>After all, if there is anything that ages even more badly than jokes, it’s moral certainties.

Even when local papers from the towns on the list got in touch, the journalists tended to think it was pretty funny. They would tell me as much when we spoke, as well as fervently agreeing about the problems on their beat. True, they then went on to write outraged front pages about the dastardly things that were being said about their town – but they did so in a way that let everyone know they were in on the joke. We were all laughing at ourselves and each other. </span></p><p>It makes me feel pretty nostalgic - not least because if it is indeed true that we’ve lost the ability to enjoy that kind of self-deprecating humour, we may be losing something important, alongside the pleasure of laughter. </p><p>Because that laughter also brought a kind of freedom. It enabled us to speak truths that might otherwise have felt too uncomfortable. </p><p>And today, it can sometimes feel like all we’ve got left is the discomfort. </p><p><span>The good news is that I don’t think that the illiberalism of identity politics will endure much longer. Especially when it comes to the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-61882384" rel="">literal policing of humour</a><span> - and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/14/jerry-sadowitz-edinburgh-fringe-show-cancelled-over-extreme-racism-homophobia-and-misogyny" rel="">cancellation of comedians</a><span> for telling the wrong kinds of jokes. </span></p><p>But that doesn’t mean we aren’t still dealing with the repercussions. I can’t prove it, but I have a strong sense that there has been a nervousness about humour in the publishing industry for quite a few years. </p><p>After all, is it always worth taking on projects that might upset people like the presenters of that Cursed Object podcast?

</code></pre>
<p>I paid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threadripper#Castle_Peak_(Threadripper_3000_series,_Zen_2_based)">good money</a> for my 24 CPU cores, but <code>./configure</code> can only manage to use 69% of one of them.
As a result, this random project takes about 13.5× longer to <em>configure</em> the build than it does to actually <em>do</em> the build.</p>
<p>The purpose of a <code>./configure</code> script is basically to run the compiler a bunch of times and check which runs succeeded.
In this way it can test whether particular headers, functions, struct fields, etc. exist, which lets people write portable software.
This is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a> problem, but <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2021-01/msg00112.html">Autoconf can't parallelize it</a>, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/75161236/502399">neither can CMake</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/3635">neither can Meson</a>, etc., etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that most build configurations scripts pretty much look like this:</p>
<pre><code>CFLAGS="-g"
if $CC $CFLAGS -Wall empty.c; then
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -Wall"
fi
...

: &gt;config.h
if $CC $CFLAGS have_statx.c; then
    echo "#define HAVE_STATX 1" &gt;&gt;config.h
else
    echo "#define HAVE_STATX 0" &gt;&gt;config.h
fi
...
</code></pre>
<p>This is written in an inherently sequential way, but in principle many of these tests could be run in parallel.
In fact, we already have an effective tool for parallelizing lots of commands (<code>make</code>), so let's use it.
We'll have a configuration makefile that generates our <code>Makefile</code> and <code>config.h</code>:</p>

<div>
<h4 id="configuremk"><a href="#configuremk"><code>configure.mk</code></a></h4>
<pre><code># The default goal generates both outputs, and merges the logs together
config: Makefile config.h
	cat Makefile.log config.h.log &gt;$@.log
	rm Makefile.log config.h.log
</code></pre>
</div>
<hr>
<p>To start with, we'll save the initial values of variables like <code>CC</code> and <code>CFLAGS</code> into the <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<div>
<h4 id="configuremk-1"><a href="#configuremk-1"><code>configure.mk</code></a></h4>
<pre><code># Default values, if unspecified
CC ?= cc
CPPFLAGS ?= -D_GNU_SOURCE
CFLAGS ?= -g
LDFLAGS ?=

# Export these through the environment to avoid stripping backslashes
export _CC=${CC}
export _CPPFLAGS=${CPPFLAGS}
export _CFLAGS=${CFLAGS}
export _LDFLAGS=${LDFLAGS}

Makefile:
	printf 'CC := %s\n' "$$_CC" &gt;$@
	printf 'CPPFLAGS := %s\n' "$$_CPPFLAGS" &gt;&gt;$@
	printf 'CFLAGS := %s\n' "$$_CFLAGS" &gt;&gt;$@
	printf 'LDFLAGS := %s\n' "$$_LDFLAGS" &gt;&gt;$@
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Using <code>export</code> like this avoids stripping the necessary backslashes from invocations like</p>
<pre><code>$ ./configure CPPFLAGS='-DMACRO=\"string\"'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>Now let's check which flags our compiler supports.
We'll use this helper script:</p>
<div>
<h4 id="flagssh"><a href="#flagssh"><code>flags.sh</code></a></h4>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

set -eu

VAR="$1"
FLAGS="$2"
shift 2

if "$@" $FLAGS; then
    printf '%s += %s\n' "$VAR" "$FLAGS"
fi
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>When we run</p>
<pre><code>$ ./flags.sh CFLAGS -Wall cc empty.c
</code></pre>
<p>it will print</p>
<pre><code>CFLAGS += -Wall
</code></pre>
<p>if <code>cc empty.c -Wall</code> succeeds (and nothing otherwise).
We can use this to generate some makefile fragments that enable only the supported flags.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="configuremk-2"><a href="#configuremk-2"><code>configure.mk</code></a></h4>
<pre><code>ALL_FLAGS = ${CPPFLAGS} ${CFLAGS} ${LDFLAGS}

# Run the compiler with the given flags, sending
#
# - stdout to foo.mk (e.g. CFLAGS += -flag)
# - stderr to foo.mk.log (e.g. error: unrecognized command-line option ‘-flag’)
# - the compiled binary to foo.mk.out
#   - but then we delete it immediately
TRY_CC = ${CC} ${ALL_FLAGS} empty.c -o $@.out &gt;$@ 2&gt;$@.log &amp;&amp; rm -f $@.out $@.d

deps.mk:
	./flags.sh CPPFLAGS "-MP -MD" ${TRY_CC}
Wall.mk:
	./flags.sh CFLAGS -Wall ${TRY_CC}
pthread.mk:
	./flags.sh CFLAGS -pthread ${TRY_CC}
bind-now.mk:
	./flags.sh LDFLAGS -Wl,-z,now ${TRY_CC}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Each of these targets generates a tiny makefile fragment that's responsible for a single flag.
Importantly, each one can run independently, in parallel.
Once they're done, we can merge them all into the main <code>Makefile</code> and clean up the cruft:</p>
<div>
<h4 id="configuremk-3"><a href="#configuremk-3"><code>configure.mk</code></a></h4>
<pre><code>FLAGS := \
    deps.mk \
    Wall.mk \
    pthread.mk \
    bind-now.mk

Makefile: ${FLAGS}
	printf 'CC := %s\n' "$$_CC" &gt;$@
	...
	cat ${FLAGS} &gt;&gt;$@
	cat ${FLAGS:%=%.log} &gt;$@.log
	rm ${FLAGS} ${FLAGS:%=%.log}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The last part to add to the <code>Makefile</code> is the part that actually builds our application.
We can write a simple makefile like this:</p>
<div>
<h4 id="mainmk"><a href="#mainmk"><code>main.mk</code></a></h4>
<pre><code>OBJS := main.o

app: ${OBJS}
	${CC} ${CFLAGS} ${LDFLAGS} ${OBJS} -o $@

${OBJS}:
	${CC} ${CPPFLAGS} ${CFLAGS} -c ${@:.o=.c} -o $@

-include ${OBJS:.o=.d}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And append it to the <code>Makefile</code> after all the flags:</p>
<div>
<h4 id="configuremk-4"><a href="#configuremk-4"><code>configure.mk</code></a></h4>
<pre><code>Makefile: ${FLAGS}
	...
	cat main.mk &gt;&gt;$@
</code></pre>
</div>
<hr>
<p>We also want to generate a <code>config.h</code> file, which defines macros that tell us whether certain libraries/headers/functions/struct fields/etc. exist.
We can do this by test-compiling some simple C programs.
As an example, these programs check for the various ways to learn about a file's <em>creation timestamp</em>:</p>
<div>

<label for="tabs-have-statx"><code>have_statx.c</code></label>

<label for="tabs-have-st-birthtim"><code>have_st_birthtim.c</code></label>

<label for="tabs-have-st-birthtimespec"><code>have_st_birthtimespec.c</code></label>

<label for="tabs-have---st-birthtim"><code>have___st_birthtim.c</code></label>
<div>
<pre><code>#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

int main(void) {
	struct statx stx;
	return statx(AT_FDCWD, ".", 0, STATX_BTIME, &amp;stx);
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div>
<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

int main(void) {
	struct stat sb = {0};
	return sb.st_birthtim.tv_sec;
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div>
<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

int main(void) {
	struct stat sb = {0};
	return sb.st_birthtimespec.tv_sec;
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div>
<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

int main(void) {
	struct stat sb = {0};
	return sb.__st_birthtim.tv_sec;
}
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
This helper script:
<div>
<h4 id="definesh"><a href="#definesh"><code>define.sh</code></a></h4>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

set -eu

MACRO=$1
shift

if "$@"; then
    printf '#define %s 1\n' "$MACRO"
else
    printf '#define %s 0\n' "$MACRO"
fi
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>will output things like</p>
<pre><code>#define HAVE_STATX 1
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>#define HAVE_ST_BIRTHTIM 0
</code></pre>
<p>depending on whether the build succeeds.
We can use it in a makefile like this:</p>
<div>
<h4 id="configuremk-5"><a href="#configuremk-5"><code>configure.mk</code></a></h4>
<pre><code># Use a recursive make to pick up our auto-detected *FLAGS from above
config.h: Makefile
	+${MAKE} -f header.mk $@
</code></pre>
<h4 id="headermk"><a href="#headermk"><code>header.mk</code></a></h4>
<pre><code># Get the final *FLAGS values from the Makefile
include Makefile

# We first generate a lot of small headers, before merging them into one big one
HEADERS := \
    have_statx.h \
    have_st_birthtim.h \
    have_st_birthtimespec.h \
    have___st_birthtim.h

# Strip .h and capitalize the macro name
MACRO = $$(printf '%s' ${@:.h=} | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z')

ALL_FLAGS = ${CPPFLAGS} ${CFLAGS} ${LDFLAGS}

${HEADERS}:
	./define.sh ${MACRO} ${CC} ${ALL_FLAGS} ${@:.h=.c} -o $@.out &gt;$@ 2&gt;$@.log
	rm -f $@.out $@.d
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And to join them all together (along with a header guard):</p>
<div>
<h4 id="headermk-1"><a href="#headermk-1"><code>header.mk</code></a></h4>
<pre><code>config.h: ${HEADERS}
	printf '#ifndef CONFIG_H\n' &gt;$@
	printf '#define CONFIG_H\n' &gt;&gt;$@
	cat ${HEADERS} &gt;&gt;$@
	printf '#endif\n' &gt;&gt;$@
	cat ${HEADERS:%=%.log} &gt;$@.log
	rm ${HEADERS} ${HEADERS:%=%.log}
</code></pre>
</div>
<hr>
<p>The last step is to wrap <code>configure.mk</code> in a shell script, so people can run <code>./configure</code> like they're used to:</p>
<div>
<h4 id="configure"><a href="#configure"><code>configure</code></a></h4>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

set -eu

# Guess a good number for make -j&lt;N&gt;
jobs() {
    {
        nproc \
            || sysctl -n hw.ncpu \
            || getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN \
            || echo 1
    } 2&gt;/dev/null
}

# Default to MAKE=make
MAKE="${MAKE-make}"

# Set MAKEFLAGS to -j$(jobs) if it's unset
export MAKEFLAGS="${MAKEFLAGS--j$(jobs)}"

$MAKE -r -f configure.mk "$@"
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>I put together a simple proof-of-concept <a href="https://github.com/tavianator/parconf"><i aria-hidden="true"></i> GitHub repository</a> that contains the full version of all these files if you want to copy-paste.
The demo app prints file creation times, if it can figure out how to on your platform.</p>
<p>I've also been using a similar build system in <a href="https://tavianator.com/projects/bfs.html">bfs</a> for a while, if you want to see a larger example.
The performance benefit is substantial:</p>

<p>I turned a forest trail near my apartment into a playable neural world.<br>
You can explore that world in your web browser <a href="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/demo">by clicking right here</a>:</p>
<a href="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/demo" id="demo"><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
    <source src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/neural_world_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
</a>

<p>By "neural world", I mean that the entire thing is a neural network generating new images based on previous images + controls. There is no level geometry, no code for lighting or shadows, no scripted animation. Just a neural net in a loop.</p>

<p><img src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/inference_diagram.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating a neural network that consumes noise, controls, and memory, and produces video frames and memory."></p><p>By "in your web browser" I mean this world runs locally, in <em>your</em> web browser. Once the world has loaded, you can continue exploring even in Airplane Mode.</p>

<video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted=""><source src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/neural_world_demo_iphone.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>So, why bother creating a world this way? There are some interesting conceptual reasons (I'll get to them later), but my main goal was just to outdo a prior post.</p>

<p>See, <a href="https://x.com/madebyollin/status/1566838643771457536">three years ago</a>, I got a simple two-dimensional video game world to run in-browser by training a neural network to mimic gameplay videos from YouTube.
</p>

<a href="https://madebyoll.in/posts/game_emulation_via_dnn/demo">
<video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted=""><source src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/pokemon_world.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
</a>

<p>
Mimicking a 2D video game world was cute, but ultimately kind of pointless;<br>
existing video games already exist and we can already emulate them just fine.
</p>

<p>
The wonderful, unique, exciting property of neural worlds is that they can be constructed from any video file,
not just screen recordings of old video games. <br>
My previous post didn't really get this across.
</p>

<p>So for this post, to demonstrate what makes neural networks truly special,<br> I wanted to train a neural network on gameplay videos of the actual world.</p>

<h2 id="recording-data">Recording data</h2>

<p>To begin this project, I walked through a forest trail, recording videos with my phone,
using a customized camera app which also recorded my phone's motion.</p>

<video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted=""><source src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/capture_app.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>I collected ~15 minutes of video and motion recordings. I've visualized motion as a "walking" control stick on the left and a "looking" control stick on the right.</p>

<video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted=""><source src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/sample_videos.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>
Back at home, I transferred the recordings to my laptop, and shuffled them into a list of (<code>previous frame, control</code> → <code>next frame</code>) pairs just like my previous game-emulation dataset.</p>


<p><img src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/sample_pairs.jpg" alt="A screenshot of two examples from the dataset, showing the memory and control inputs as well as the corresponding video frame outputs."></p><p>Now, all I needed to do was train a neural network to mimic the behavior of these input→output pairs. I already had working code from my previous game-emulation project,<br>
so I tried rerunning that code to establish a baseline.</p>

<h2 id="training-baselines">Training baselines</h2>

<p>
Applying my previous game-emulation-via-neural-network recipe to this new dataset produced, regrettably, a sort of interactive forest-flavored soup.
</p>

<video autoplay="" playsinline="" loop="" muted=""><source src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/forest_soup_gameplay.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>
My neural network couldn't predict the actual next frame accurately,
and it couldn't make up new details fast enough to compensate,
so the resulting world collapsed even if I gave it a running start by initializing from real video frames:
</p>

<video autoplay="" playsinline="" loop="" muted=""><source src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/forest_soup.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>Undaunted, I started work on a new version of the neural world training code.<br></p>

<h2 id="upgrading-the-training-recipe">Upgrading the training recipe</h2>

<p>To help my network understand real-world video, I made the following upgrades:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Adding more control information.</strong> I upgraded the "control" network input from simple 2D controls to more-informative 3D (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_freedom">6DoF</a>) controls.</li>
    <li><strong>Adding more memory.</strong> I upgraded the "memory" network input from a single frame to 32 frames (using lower resolution for the older frames).</li>
    <li><strong>Adding multiple scales.</strong> I restructured the network to process all inputs across multiple resolutions, instead of a fixed 1/8 resolution.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/network_upgrades.jpg" alt="A before/after diagram of the neural network architecture."></p><p>These upgrades let me stave off soupification enough to get a half-baked demo:</p>

<video autoplay="" playsinline="" loop="" muted=""><source src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/first_stable_rollouts.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>This was  significant progress. Unfortunately, the world was still pretty melty,<br> so I started work on a second batch of improvements (more daunted this time).</p>

<h2 id="upgrading-the-training-recipe-more">Upgrading the training recipe more</h2>

<p>This time, I left the inputs/outputs as-is and focused on finding incremental improvements to the training procedure. Here's a mercifully-abbreviated montage:</p>

<video autoplay="" playsinline="" loop="" muted=""><source src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/improvement_montage.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>The biggest jumps in quality came from:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Making the network bigger</strong>: I added even more layers of neural network processing, while striving to maintain a somewhat-playable FPS.</li>
    <li><strong>Picking a better training objective</strong>: I adjusted training to put less emphasis on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error">detail prediction</a> and more emphasis on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">detail generation</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Training longer</strong>: I trained the network longer on a selected subset of video frames to try and eke out the highest-quality results.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here's a summary of the final forest world recipe:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Dataset</strong>: 22,814 frames (30FPS SDR video, timestamped ARKit poses) captured at Marymoor Park Audobon Bird Loop with iPhone 13 Pro.</li>
    <li><strong>Inputs</strong>:
        3x4-element relative camera pose, 2-element gravity-relative roll/pitch, relative time delta, valid/augmented bit,<br>
        4 past-frame TCHW memory buffers (32×3×3×4, 16×3×12×16, 8×3×48×64, 4×3×192×256),<br>
        4 U(0, 1) single-channel noise tensors at each spatial scale (like StyleGAN).</li>
    
    <li><strong>Model</strong>: Asymmetric (decoder-heavy) 4-scale UNet with reduced-size full-resolution decoder block. <br>~5M trainable parameters, ~1 GFLOP per generated 192×256 frame.
        <a href="https://netron.app/?url=https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/demo/model.onnx"><img src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/tiny_netron_screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of Netron's model diagram."></a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Training</strong>: AdamW constant LR + SWA, L1 + adversarial loss, stability fixes from the game-emulation recipe, around ~100 GPU-hours (~$100 USD).</li>
    <li><strong>Inference</strong>: Control-conditioned sequential autoregression with 60FPS cap, preprocessing in JS, network in ONNX Runtime Web's WebGL backend.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Whew. So, let's return to the original question: <br> why bother? Why go through so much work to get a low-resolution neural world of a single forest trail?
Why not make a stabler, higher-resolution demo using traditional video game techniques?
</p>

<h2 id="two-ways-to-create-worlds">Two ways to create worlds</h2>

<p>
Traditional game worlds are made like paintings. You sit in front of an empty canvas and layer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFld4EBO2RE">keystroke upon keystroke</a> until you get something beautiful. Every lifelike detail in a traditional game is only there because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XWxsJKpYYI">some artist painted it in</a>.
</p>

<p>
Neural worlds are made rather differently. <br> To create a neural world of a forest, <br>
I walked into an actual forest and pressed "record" on the device in my hand. <br>
Every lifelike detail in the final world is only there because my phone recorded it.
</p>

<p>
So, if traditional game worlds are paintings, neural worlds are photographs.<br>
Information flows from sensor to screen without passing through human hands.
</p>

<p><img src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/information_flow.jpg" alt="A doodle showing how information flows in painting-style worlds vs. photo-style worlds."></p><p>
Admittedly, as of this post, neural worlds resemble <em>very early</em> photographs.<br>
Early cameras <a href="https://youtu.be/wbbH77rYaa8?si=MH-xjGvK9wIAB-sK&amp;t=366">barely worked</a>, and the photos they took were not lifelike at all.
</p>

<p><a href="https://collectionscaptured.ncl.ac.uk/digital/collection/p21051coll22/id/4/">
<img src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/early_photo.jpg" alt="An early daguerrotype.">
</a></p><p>
The exciting part was that cameras reduced realistic-image-creation from an artistic problem to a technological one.<br>
As technology improved, cameras did too, and photographs grew ever more faithful to reality while paintings did not.
</p>

<p><img src="https://madebyoll.in/posts/world_emulation_via_dnn/current_photo.jpg" alt="A modern iPhone photograph."></p><p>
I think that neural worlds will improve in fidelity just like photographs did.
In time, neural worlds will have trees that bend in the wind, lilypads that bob in the rain, birds that sing to each other. <br>
Automatically, because the real world has those things and a tool can record them. Not because an artist paints them in.
</p>

<p>
I think the tools for creating neural worlds can also, eventually, be just as convenient as today's cameras.
In the same way that a modern digital camera creates images or videos at the press of a button,
we could have a tool to create worlds.
</p>

<p>If neural worlds become as lifelike, cheap, and composable as photos are today,<br> narrative arrangements of neural worlds could be their own creative medium,<br> as distinct from today's video games as photographs were from paintings.
</p>

<p>
I think that would be very exciting indeed!
</p>

<hr>

<p>Neural networks which model the world are often called "world models" and many smart people have worked on them; a classic example is Comma's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01230">"Learning a Driving Simulator"</a>, and some more recent examples are OpenDriveLabs' <a href="https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/Vista">Vista</a> or Wayve's <a href="https://wayve.ai/thinking/gaia-2/">GAIA-2</a>. If you're a programmer interested in training your own world models, I recommend looking at <a href="https://diamond-wm.github.io/">DIAMOND</a> or <a href="https://github.com/buoyancy99/diffusion-forcing">Diffusion Forcing</a>.</p>

<p>Compared to serious "Foundation World Models" with billions of parameters,<br> the GAN-based WM featured in this post is a toy (and a fairly brittle one at that).<br> Still, it would be fun to improve the recipe further and make a few more worlds.<br> If you know a place near Seattle that would be interesting to capture, <a href="https://x.com/madebyollin">LMK</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">This <a href="https://github.com/ndrwnaguib/principia">project</a> aims to formalize the first volume of Prof. Bertrand Russell’s
  Principia Mathematica using the Lean theorem prover. The goal is to ensure that
  the formalization aligns clearly with the corresponding theorems in the book to
  avoid confusion (See <a href="https://github.com/ndrwnaguib/principia/blob/main/*Metaprogramming%20=Syll=">Metaprogramming =Syll=</a>)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notation</h2><a id="user-content-notation" aria-label="Permalink: Notation" href="#notation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/principia-mathematica/" rel="nofollow">Principia Mathematica</a>’s notation (Peano-Russell notation) is exceptionally known
  for its sophistication that it <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pm-notation/" rel="nofollow">has a separate entry on the Stanford Encyclopedia
  of Philosophy (SEP)</a>. Also, Prof. Landon Elkind’s <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/904086" rel="nofollow">Squaring the Circles: a
  Genealogy of Principia’s Dot Notation</a> explains the notation skillfully.</p>
<p dir="auto">I do not think there is a <b>need</b> to read them, I would like to believe that
  after reading a few examples of how some formulas were formalized and
  contrasting them against Prof. Russell’s notation should make it clear.</p>
<p dir="auto">Throughout the formalization, I tried to rigorously follow Prof. Russell’s
  proof, with no or little added statements from my side, which were only
  necessary for the formalization but not the logical argument. Should you notice
  any inaccuracy (even if it does not necessarily falsify the proof), please let
  me know as I would like to proceed with the same spirit of rigor as Prof.
  Russell.</p>
<p dir="auto">Before starting this project, I had already found <a href="https://www.principiarewrite.com/" rel="nofollow">Prof. Elkind’s formalization
  of the Principia using Coq</a>, which is much mature work than this one. However, I
  still thought it would be fun to do it using Lean4 (See <a href="https://github.com/ndrwnaguib/principia/blob/main/*Remarks">Remarks</a>).</p>

<p dir="auto">I have included a <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="fb2ac254536cdb07cd40331a4c58de49">$\LaTeX$</math-renderer> fragment with each theorem that represents Prof. Russell’s
  proof. If you use Emacs, I recommend enabling <code>org-preview-latex</code> in the Lean
  buffer. If you are using VSCode, perhaps a similar experience can be achieved by
  installing the <code>Better Comments</code> extension. This is how it looked like for me:</p>

<p dir="auto">Prof. Russell repeatedly used *1.11 to indicate the inference of a proposition
  from another, for example <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="fb2ac254536cdb07cd40331a4c58de49">$[(3).(8).∗ 1⋅ 11]$</math-renderer> is the proposition deduced by chaining
  proposition (8) and (3). In Lean, this could be analogous to several tactics or
  atoms, e.g., <code>&lt;|</code>, <code>simp</code>, etc.</p>

<p dir="auto">The experience I planned for when reading the formalization is to have the
  corresponding text in the Principia included in the same file, only with Prof.
  Russell’s proofs replaced with their Lean formalization. For example, here is
  *2.16 along with a unique part in the formalization, that is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean4-metaprogramming-book/main/09_tactics.html" rel="nofollow">metaprogramming a
  new tactic</a> to follow Prof. Russell’s notation for <code>Syll</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">It was only a result of my greed to write a tactic that handles a more general
  form of syllogism; I believe in the case of the Principia, I could have got away
  with one that accepts two hypotheses.</p>

<p dir="auto">I do not see a particular use for this project except for learning the
  thought-process of building mathematics from scratch. Although the Principia is
  thought to be “a monumental failure”, as said by Prof. Freeman Dyson, it was an
  enriching experience for me to read as well as to formalize-especially after
  observing how the latter, more complicated results, are obtained using simpler
  ones I personally formalized.</p>

<section>
    <p>Curry is a <span>declarative multi-paradigm programming language</span>
        which combines in a seamless way features from
        <span>functional programming</span>
        (nested expressions, higher-order functions, strong typing, lazy evaluation)
        and <span>logic programming</span>
        (non-determinism, built-in search, free variables, partial data structures).
        Compared to the single programming paradigms, Curry provides
        additional features, like optimal evaluation for logic-oriented
        computations and flexible, non-deterministic pattern matching
        with user-defined functions.
    </p>

</section>
<div>
        
        <p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
</p>
<div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Purely Declarative</h2>
    <p>Curry is called a declarative language, because computed results are independent of the time and order of evaluation, which simplifies reasoning on programs. Side effects can be modeled as “IO” operations, i.e., a declarative description of what to do. Operations are constructed by expressions only, there are no statements or instructions, and every binding to a variable is immutable.</p>
    
</div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Type Inference</h2>
    <p>Curry is strongly typed but type annotations of functions need not be written by the programmer: they are automatically inferred by the compiler using a type inference algorithm. Nevertheless, it is a good style to write down the types of functions in order to provide at least a minimal documentation of the intended use of functions.</p>
    
</div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Non-Determinism</h2>
    <p>Curry supports non-deterministic operations which can return different values for the same input. Non-deterministic operations support a programming style similar to that of logic programming while preserving some advantages of functional programs such as expression nesting and lazy (demand-driven) evaluation.</p>
    
</div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Free Variables</h2>
    <p>Free variables denote “unknown” values. They are instantiated (i.e., replaced by some concrete values) so that the instantiated expression is evaluable. REPLs of Curry systems show bindings (i.e., instantiations) of the free variables of the main expression it has computed to evaluate an expression.</p>
    
</div>
    
</div>
        
    </div>
<div>
    <p>The development of Curry is an international
        initiative intended to provide a common platform for the research, teaching and application of integrated
        functional logic languages. The design of Curry is mainly discussed in the Curry mailing list. A detailed report
        describing the language is also available. To get an idea of Curry, you may have a look into the short list of
        Curry's features or a tutorial on Curry.</p>
    
</div>
<div>
        
        <p>
    <h2>Ecosystem</h2>
</p>
<div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Compilers</h2>
    <p>Several implementations of Curry are available and/or under development. The most prominent representatives are the Portland Aachen Kiel Curry System (PAKCS), the new version of the Kiel Curry System (KiCS2), and the Münster Curry Compiler (MCC).</p>
    
</div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Package Manager</h2>
    <p>The Curry Package Manager (CPM) is a tool to distribute and install Curry libraries and applications and manage version dependencies between them. These libraries are organized in packages. There is a central index of all these packages which can easily be downloaded by CPM.</p>
    
</div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>CurryDoc</h2>
    <p>CurryDoc is a tool that generates the documentation for a Curry program in HTML (and optionally also LaTeX) format. The generated HTML pages contain information about all data types and operations exported by a module as well as links between the different entities.</p>
    
</div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Curr(y)gle API Search</h2>
    <p>Curr(y)gle is a Curry API search engine which allows you to search the Curry libraries indexed by CPM. You can search by names of either operations, data types, and modules. It was designed following the example set by Haskell’s search engine Hoogle.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown rapidly in size, creating significant challenges for efficient deployment on resource-constrained hardware. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic-Length Float (DFloat11), a lossless compression framework that reduces LLM size by 30% while preserving outputs that are bit-for-bit identical to the original model. DFloat11 is motivated by the low entropy in the BFloat16 weight representation of LLMs, which reveals significant inefficiency in existing storage format. By applying entropy coding, DFloat11 assigns dynamic-length encodings to weights based on frequency, achieving near information-optimal compression without any loss of precision. To facilitate efficient inference with dynamic-length encodings, we develop a custom GPU kernel for fast online decompression. Our design incorporates the following: (i) decomposition of memory-intensive lookup tables (LUTs) into compact LUTs that fit in GPU SRAM, (ii) a two-phase kernel for coordinating thread read/write positions using lightweight auxiliary variables, and (iii) transformer-block-level decompression to minimize latency. Experiments on recent models, including Llama-3.1, Qwen-2.5, and Gemma-3, validates our hypothesis that DFloat11 achieves around 30% model size reduction while preserving bit-for-bit exact outputs. Compared to a potential alternative of offloading parts of an uncompressed model to the CPU to meet memory constraints, DFloat11 achieves 1.9-38.8x higher throughput in token generation. With a fixed GPU memory budget, DFloat11 enables 5.3-13.17x longer context lengths than uncompressed models. Notably, our method enables lossless inference of Llama-3.1-405B, an 810GB model, on a single node equipped with 8x80GB GPUs. Our code and models are available at <a href="https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins.

<p dir="auto"><strong>1. Install our test runner</strong> in the node project you want to test (or see our <a href="https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude-demo-repo">demo repo</a> if you don't have a project to try it on)</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm install --save-dev magnitude-test"><pre>npm install --save-dev magnitude-test</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2. Setup Magnitude</strong> in your project by running:</p>

<p dir="auto">This will create a basic tests directory <code>tests/magnitude</code> with:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>magnitude.config.ts</code>: Magnitude test configuration file</li>
<li><code>example.mag.ts</code>: An example test file</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configure LLMs</h3><a id="user-content-configure-llms" aria-label="Permalink: Configure LLMs" href="#configure-llms"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Magnitude requires setting up two LLM clients:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>A strong general multi-modal LLM (the <strong>"planner"</strong>)</li>
<li>A fast vision LLM with pixel-precision (the <strong>"executor"</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">For the <strong>planner</strong>, you can use any multi-modal LLM, but we recommend Gemini 2.5 pro. You can use Gemini via Google AI Studio or Vertex AI. If you don't have either set up, you can create an API key in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google AI Studio</a> (requires billing) and export to <code>GOOGLE_API_KEY</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If no <code>GOOGLE_API_KEY</code> is found, Magnitude will fallback to other common providers (<code>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY</code> / <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">To explicitly select a specific provider and model, see <a href="https://docs.magnitude.run/reference/llm-configuration" rel="nofollow">configuration docs</a>. Currently we support Google AI Studio, Google Vertex AI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, and OpenAI-compatible providers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configure Moondream</h4><a id="user-content-configure-moondream" aria-label="Permalink: Configure Moondream" href="#configure-moondream"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Currently for the <strong>executor</strong> model, we only support <a href="https://moondream.ai/" rel="nofollow">Moondream</a>, which is a fast vision model that Magnitude uses for precise UI interactions.</p>
<p dir="auto">To configure Moondream, sign up and create an API with Moondream <a href="https://moondream.ai/c/cloud/api-keys" rel="nofollow">here</a>, then add to your environment as <code>MOONDREAM_API_KEY</code>. This will use the cloud version, which includes 5,000 free requests per day (roughly a few hundred test cases in Magnitude). Moondream is fully open source and self-hostable as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">🚀 Once you've got your LLMs set up, you're ready to run tests!</p>

<p dir="auto">This will run all Magnitude test files discovered with the <code>*.mag.ts</code> pattern. If the agent finds a problem with your app, it will tell you what happened and describe the bug!</p>

    .step('Create a new company')
        .data('Make up the first 2 values and use defaults for the rest')
        .check('Company added successfully');"><pre><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>test</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'magnitude-test'</span><span>;</span>

<span>test</span><span>(</span><span>'can log in and create company'</span><span>)</span>

More strenuous workouts closer to bedtime coincided with greater disruptions to sleep and nighttime cardiac activity.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    <p>Published in <i>Nature Communications</i>, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x" target="_blank">study</a> found that exercising four hours or less before <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bedtime/" rel="tag">bedtime</a> was linked to falling asleep later, getting less and worse quality sleep, and having a higher resting heart rate and lower <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+rate+variability/" rel="tag">heart rate variability</a>. It is the first and largest study to identify this.</p>
<p>The study involved an international sample of 14,689 people monitored across one year, resulting in four million nights of data. They wore a multi-sensor biometric device (WHOOP Strap) to record exercise, sleep and cardiovascular data.</p>
<p>Monash and WHOOP researchers examined the relationships between evening exercise, exercise strain, sleep and nocturnal cardiac activity, including resting heart rate and heart rate variability.</p>
<p>The combination of later exercise timing and higher exercise strain was associated with delayed sleep onset, shorter <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sleep+duration/" rel="tag">sleep duration</a>, lower sleep quality, higher nocturnal resting heart rate and lower nocturnal heart rate variability.</p>
<p>The results were adjusted for gender, age, weekday, season, general fitness and the prior night's sleep. High strain exercise includes activities that lead to sustained increases in breathing rate, <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/core+body+temperature/" rel="tag">core body temperature</a>, heart rate and mental alertness.</p>

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>Examples include HIIT workouts (<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high-intensity+interval+training/" rel="tag">high-intensity interval training</a>), football and rugby games or a long run.</p>
<p>First author Dr. Josh Leota, from the Monash University School of Psychological Sciences, said he wanted to shed light on "the important yet puzzling" link between the timing of exercise and sleep.</p>
<p>"Intense exercise in the evening can keep the body in a heightened state of alertness, which is why public health guidelines have previously advised against working out too close to bedtime. However, findings from controlled laboratory studies are less conclusive, with many suggesting that evening exercise doesn't necessarily disrupt sleep," he said.</p>
<p>"These studies have relied on small sample sizes and laboratory settings, and rarely involved exercise bouts that elicit substantial cardiometabolic demand on the body, calling into question the external validity of such findings."</p>
<p>Dr. Leota said the new study's findings suggested that if people were aiming to improve sleep health, they may benefit from concluding exercise at least four hours before their bedtime.</p>
<p>"If exercising within a four-hour window of bedtime, people could choose brief low-intensity exercises, such as a light jog or swim, to minimize sleep disruption and allow the body to wind down," he said.</p>
<p>Senior author Dr. Elise Facer-Childs, from the Monash University School of Psychological Sciences, said the results demonstrated a clear and consistent relationship across all outcome variables.</p>
<p>"Evening exercise—particularly involving high levels of cardiovascular strain—may disrupt subsequent sleep, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability, thereby impairing a critical stage of the recovery process," Dr. Facer-Childs said.</p>
<p>"Our novel and timely findings have significant implications for public health messaging around timing, duration and intensity of <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/exercise/" rel="tag">exercise</a> and present a critical step towards improving population sleep health—an issue of central importance given 2 in 3 Australian adults report at least one sleep problem and 1 in 5 adults fail to achieve the recommended seven or more hours of sleep per night."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ask just about anybody, and they’ll tell you that new cars are too expensive. In the wake of tariffs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/electric-cars/643668/car-company-tariff-response-price-layoff-factory">shaking the auto industry</a> and with the Trump administration pledging to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349650/trump-ev-tax-credit-tariff-congress">kill the federal EV incentive</a>, that situation isn’t looking to get better soon, especially for anyone wanting something battery-powered. Changing that overly spendy status quo is going to take something radical, and it’s hard to get more radical than what Slate Auto has planned.</p><p>Meet the Slate Truck, a sub-$20,000 (after federal incentives) electric vehicle that enters production next year. It only seats two yet has a bed big enough to hold a sheet of plywood. It only does 150 miles on a charge, only comes in gray, and the only way to listen to music while driving is if you bring along your phone and a Bluetooth speaker. It is the bare minimum of what a modern car can be, and yet it’s taken three years of development to get to this point.</p><p>But this is more than bargain-basement motoring. Slate is presenting its truck as minimalist design with DIY purpose, an attempt to not just go cheap but to create a new category of vehicle with a huge focus on personalization. That design also enables a low-cost approach to manufacturing that has caught the eye of major investors, reportedly including Jeff Bezos. It’s been engineered and will be manufactured in America, but is this extreme simplification too much for American consumers?</p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="900" data-pswp-width="1350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="" data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Hero-Blank-Slate-and-SUV_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><div><p id="simplify-then-embrace-damage"><h2>Simplify, Then Embrace Damage</h2></p></div><p>If you haven’t seen the leaks and the reports of weirdly wrapped trucks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/electric-cars/652835/ok-but-please-tell-me-cry-share-is-a-real-company">hiding in plain sight</a>, the Slate Truck is the first product from Michigan-based Slate Auto. Think “American kei truck” and you’re not far off. It’s a machine designed to be extremely basic, extremely customizable, and extremely affordable. Those are not your typical design goals, but then the Slate Truck isn’t the fruit of your typical design process. </p><p>Wander through any automotive design studio anywhere in the world and you’ll inevitably come across a mood board or two, sweeping collages of striking photos meant to align the creative flows of passers-by. They’re a tool for helping a disparate design team to create a cohesive product, but where many such mood boards feature glamour shots of exotic roads and beautiful people, front and center in the Slate’s mood board was something different: a big, gray shark, covered in scrapes and scars.</p><p>“It looks like a shark that has definitely been in more than one brawl and clearly has come out ahead because it’s still swimming,” says Tisha Johnson, head of design at Slate and who formerly spent a decade at Volvo. That aesthetic, of highlighting rather than hiding battle scars, is key to the Slate ethos.</p><p>Instead of steel or aluminum, the Slate Truck’s body panels are molded of plastic. Or, as Slate calls them, “injection molded polypropylene composite material.” The theory is that this makes them more durable and scratch-resistant, if only because the lack of paint means they’re one color all the way through. Auto enthusiasts of a certain age will remember the same approach used by the now-defunct Saturn Corporation, a manufacturing technique that never caught on across the industry. </p><p>Slate continues the theme through to the upholstery, too, a heathered textile that was designed to get better looking as it wears. The idea is to lean into the aged aesthetic. </p><p>But not everybody will dig the shark theme, and so the Slate Truck is designed to be customizable to a degree never seen before on a production vehicle. Johnson says this is in contrast to the overly curated experience offered by many brands. </p><p>She says over-curation by automotive designers results in situations like premium, luxury cars that are only available in a palette of disappointingly bland colors: “There’s usually only a fraction that you actually want, and those are always more expensive,” she says.</p><p>Disparaging other brands for offering limited color choices might seem disingenuous coming from the designer of a vehicle available in a single shade. The Slate Truck, though, was designed to take advantage of the current trend of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/11/14894554/tesla-owner-2d-vinyl-wrap-rooster-teeth">vinyl-wrapping cars</a>. Its simple shape and minimal trim pieces mean that even amateurs can do the job. Slate will offer DIY kits that newbies can slap on in an afternoon and replace just as quickly based on mood.</p><p>However, the biggest benefit of this monochromatic thinking might come in production.</p><div><p id="bare-minimum-manufacturing"><h2>Bare-Minimum Manufacturing</h2></p></div><p>It’s probably no surprise to you that building cars is expensive. Elon Musk loves to bemoan just how complicated the process can be whenever Tesla is late shipping its next new model, but he’s far from alone in that assessment. </p><p>What is a little less commonly known is just how expensive it is to paint those cars. Creating a facility that can reliably, quickly, and cleanly lay down a quality coat of color on automotive body parts is a complicated task. </p><p>That task has only gotten more complicated (and thus expensive) in recent years, with greater environmental regulations and consumer expectations forcing manufacturers to find ways to offer more vibrant hues with less ecological impact. Mercedes-Benz just announced it’s building a “Next Generation Paintshop” at its Sindelfingen plant in Germany, and estimates place the thing’s cost at <a href="https://www.environmentenergyleader.com/stories/mercedes-benz-builds-975m-fossil-free-paint-shop-in-sindelfingen,71333#:~:text=Mercedes%2DBenz%20is%20investing%20a,its%20Sindelfingen%20plant%20in%20Germany.">nearly $1 billion</a>. </p><p>By eliminating paint, and thus eliminating the paint shop, Slate’s manufacturing process is massively simplified. So, too, the lack of metal body parts. “We have no paint shop, we have no stamping,” says Jeremy Snyder, Slate’s chief commercial officer who formerly led Tesla’s global business efforts. </p><p>Vehicle factories tend to have high ceilings to make room for the multiple-story stamping machines that form metal body parts. Injection molding of plastic is far easier and cheaper to do in limited spaces — spaces like the factory that Slate has purchased for its manufacturing, reportedly near Indiana. “The vehicle is designed, engineered, and manufactured in the US, with the majority of our supply chain based in the US,” Snyder says. </p><p>The simplification goes simpler still. Slate will make just one vehicle, in just one trim, in just one color, with everything from bigger battery packs to SUV upgrade kits added on later. </p><p>“Because we only produce one vehicle in the factory with zero options, we’ve moved all of the complexity out of the factory,” Snyder says.</p><p>While most buyers will rightly fixate on the cost of the truck, the bigger story here might just be this radically simplified approach to manufacturing. “From the very beginning, our business model has been such that we reach cash flow positivity very shortly after start of production. And so from an investment standpoint, we are far less cash-reliant than any other EV startup that has ever existed, as far as I know,” Snyder says.</p><p>As Slate tries to dash to production without tripping over the headstones of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181228/fisker-bankrupt-chapter-11-ev-ocean-tesla-playbook-musk">failed</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032769/vinfast-vf-wild-vf3-ev-concept-ces-2024">EV</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18088438/faraday-future-electric-cars-ev-news-layoffs-bankruptcy">startups</a> that litter the countryside, that leanness is key. It’s helped them attract some major investors. “The greatest industry magnates to invest in our company,” Snyder says. He declined to name names, but according to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/08/inside-the-ev-startup-secretly-backed-by-jeff-bezos/"><em>TechCrunch</em> report</a>, one of those magnates is Jeff Bezos. </p><p>“We don’t have a direct connection to Amazon,” Snyder clarified, but he didn’t rule out some corporate cooperation. “Who knows? Who knows if you’ll be able to purchase on Amazon? I don’t know.”</p><div><p id="byod"><h2>BYOD</h2></p></div><p>Those vinyl wraps are literally just the first layer of what Slate’s designers are positioning as a, well, blank slate. They want owners to personalize every aspect of the vehicle, including its silhouette.</p><p>Need room for more than two passengers? Slate has an SUV upgrade kit that will bolt onto the back of the truck, adding extra rollover crash protection and rear seats with seat belts to match, all in a package that’s easy to install at home. </p><p>No, this isn’t a <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/features/1978-1994-subaru-brat-classic-truck-history">Subaru Brat redux</a>. The seats will be forward-facing, and the whole setup is supposed to be strong enough to meet crash test regulations. In fact, Slate’s head of engineering, Eric Keipper, says they’re targeting a 5-Star Safety Rating from the federal government’s New Car Assessment Program. Slate is also aiming for a Top Safety Pick from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. </p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,8.3333333333333,100,83.333333333333" data-pswp-height="1125" data-pswp-width="900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="" data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Crop_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.3333333333333%2C100%2C83.333333333333&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p>This will be, in large part, thanks to a comprehensive active safety system that includes everything from automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection to automatic high beams.</p><p>A mandatory part of today’s safety features is a digital rear-view camera. Typically, this view pops up on a modern car’s central infotainment screen, but the Slate doesn’t have one of those. It makes do with just a small display behind the steering wheel as a gauge cluster, which is where that rearview camera will feed. You’ll have physical knobs for controlling the in-cabin temperature controls plus the typical turn stalk and other switchgear, but that’s about it.</p><p>The truck not only lacks a touchscreen for infotainment duties, it lacks any form of entertainment at all beyond whatever fun you can get from the 201-horsepower, rear-drive configuration. There’s no radio, no Bluetooth, and no speakers of any kind beyond for those required to play basic warning chimes. </p><p>Many will consider this a cost-cutting step too far, but the interior was designed for ease of upgrading, with easy mounting space for anything from a simple soundbar to a full sound system. </p><p>There’s an integrated phone mount right on the dashboard, but there’s nothing stopping you from bringing something even larger. I expect the low-cost Android tablet and 3D-printing communities to have a field day coming up with in-car media streaming solutions.</p><p>The rather extreme omission of any kind of media system in the car is jarring, but it, too, has secondary benefits. </p><p>“Seventy percent of repeat warranty claims are based on infotainment currently because there’s so much tech in the car that it’s created a very unstable environment in the vehicle,” Snyder says. </p><p>Eliminating infotainment, the theory goes, necessarily boosts reliability. And reliability will be key because Slate is taking DIY to new extremes on the maintenance front, too.</p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,8.4722222222222,100,83.055555555556" data-pswp-height="1121.2499999999998" data-pswp-width="897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="" data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Blank-Slate-Bodyside-Detail_web.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C8.4722222222222%2C100%2C83.055555555556&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><div><p id="sales-and-service"><h2>Sales and Service</h2></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/28/23738770/right-to-repair-updates-laws">right to repair</a> your devices is a massively important topic for everyone from smartphone users to smart <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24260513/john-deere-right-to-repair-elizabeth-warren-clean-air-act">tractor operators</a>. Traditionally, auto manufacturers haven’t exactly gone out of their way to make DIY maintenance easy, partly because their dealers make so much money hawking cabin air filters and unnecessary coolant flushes.</p><p>As an EV, the maintenance schedule for Slate Truck should be minimal (most EVs don’t need much more than an annual tire rotation), but for any warranty concerns, the company will encourage users to do the fixes themselves. At least when it’s safe to do so. </p><p>“If you’re not going to break the vehicle and you’re not going to injure yourself, meaning high voltage, you can do service and warranty service on your vehicle yourself and have the videos and the helpline to support you to do that work,” Snyder says.</p><p>That support network will be called Slate University and it’ll teach you everything you need to know. Don’t fancy yourself a shade tree mechanic? Or maybe you don’t have a tree to park under in the first place? Slate has a partnership with already-established nationwide service centers, where owners can take their trucks for any needed fixes. Upgrades can be performed here as well, including installing an extended-range battery that will bring the truck’s maximum range up to 240 miles. </p><p>“At start of production, we will have coverage across the country for servicing your vehicle,” Snyder says. Snyder declined to say who will provide the service, but it seems reasonable to expect something along the lines of a Midas, Monro, Meineke, or perhaps some other nationwide service chain that begins with the letter M.</p><p>And finally, how can you buy one? It should come as no surprise that Slate will follow Tesla’s footsteps by offering direct sales. No nationwide network of dealerships is planned. Instead, a limited set of pickup centers will pop up as needed based on preorder data. Or, if you don’t mind paying a little more, home delivery will be available.</p><p>Preorders cost just $50 on <a href="https://www.slate.auto/">Slate’s site</a>, and deliveries are expected to start in late 2026. Slate hasn’t said exactly how much the truck will cost, only that it’ll be less than $20,000 after federal incentives — assuming those incentives are still in place in 18 months’ time.</p><p>The bigger question, though, is whether consumers will actually be into such a simplified vision of what a car can be. The Slate Truck is a rolling rejection of the current, bloated state of American motoring, but it’s consumer demand that’s driven the market down this dark alley. Are those consumers ready for a rolling digital detox? </p><div><div><h2>Decoder with Nilay Patel</h2><p>A podcast from <em>The Verge</em> about big ideas and other problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://pod.link/decoder"><span>SUBSCRIBE NOW!</span></a></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

Cf-Ray: 935d70ff6864bcf5-ATL</code></code></pre><p>This behavior points to what's likely a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in action. But what's a WAF, and why would it block these paths?</p><p>Think of a Web Application Firewall as a security guard for websites. It sits between users and the web application, examining all traffic and blocking anything suspicious.</p><p>Like a nightclub bouncer who has a list of troublemakers to watch for, a WAF has rules about what kinds of requests look dangerous. When it spots something on its "suspicious list," it rejects the request.</p><p>One common attack that WAFs defend against is called a "path traversal" attack. Here's a simple explanation:</p><p>Imagine your website has files organized in folders, like:</p><pre><code><code>/images/profile.jpg
/docs/report.pdf</code></code></pre><p>A hacker might try to "break out" of these folders by sending requests like:</p><pre><code><code>/images/../../../etc/pass*d</code></code></pre><p>This is an attempt to navigate up through directory levels to access sensitive system files like the password file on the server.</p><p><span>System paths like </span><code>/etc/h*sts</code><span> and </span><code>/etc/pass*d</code><span> are common targets in these attacks because they contain valuable system information. A hacker who gains access to these files might find usernames, password hashes, or network configurations that help them compromise the system further.</span></p><p><em><span>[For more information on path traversal attacks, check out </span><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OWASP's guide</a><span>]</span></em></p><p><span>Another attack vector is "command injection," where an attacker tries to trick a web application into executing system commands. Mentioning system paths like </span><code>/etc/h*sts</code><span> might trigger filters designed to prevent command injection attempts.</span></p><p>In a command injection attack, an attacker might input something like:</p><pre><code><code>; cat /etc/pass*d</code></code></pre><p>If the web application doesn't properly sanitize this input before using it in a system command, it could execute the attacker's code and reveal sensitive information.</p><p><em><span>[Learn more about command injection at </span><a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">PortSwigger's Web Security Academy</a><span>]</span></em></p><p><span>Curious if others had encountered this issue, I searched for Substack posts containing these system paths. Interestingly, I found a post from March 4, 2025, that successfully included the string </span><code>/etc/h*sts.allowed</code><span>.</span></p><p><span>Another post from March 30, 2025, used the curious formulation </span><code>etc -&gt; hosts</code><span> - perhaps a workaround for this same issue?</span></p><p>This suggests the filtering behavior might have been implemented or modified sometime between these dates.</p><p>This case highlights an interesting tension in web security: the balance between protection and usability.</p><p>Substack's filter is well-intentioned - protecting their platform from potential attacks. But for technical writers discussing system configurations, it creates a frustrating obstacle.</p><p>The implementation also leaves room for improvement:</p><ol><li><p>The generic "Network Error" message is uninformative</p></li><li><p>The filter blocks legitimate technical content</p></li><li><p>There's no clear workaround for writers discussing these topics</p></li></ol><p>Examining the
