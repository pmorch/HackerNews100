			<h2 id="when-personhood-is-decided-by-the-big-five">When “personhood” is decided by the Big Five</h2>
<p>My partner and I recently moved states in order to benefit from lower rent and a
more affordable living environment. We found a place on Craigslist for the
winter that was not only scam-free, but extremely cute. We visited it in person,
met the landlord, and agreed to tenancy until April after the threat of frost.
The process, despite its rushed quality, was rather straightforward.</p>
<p>However, we started running into problems when we began updating our address.
Google, it seemed, never heard of our road let alone the fact that there were
houses on it.</p>
<p>I first noticed this issue when I went to update my address with my online
credit union. I was told, in no uncertain terms that the street didn’t exist
after I overrode the Google Maps autocomplete. When I switched to our PO Box
number, an error message popped up and said that “PO Boxes were not appropriate
addresses.”</p>
<p>And so our saga began.</p>
<p>The town, thankfully, knew of the road and gave us no problems when it came to
hyper-local needs like car registration at the downtown office. Signing up for a
new phone service left us both screaming at the computer, then eventually
settling with putting our address as the post office (because, again, PO boxes
aren’t “appropriate addresses”). We just hoped that the town being small enough
would make it so they would know where to put mail should something ever come
from the phone company or any other service that used Google to verify
addresses.</p>
<p>Getting a license was also difficult, since mail was rarely delivered to our
physical address. Instead, both of us needed to sign an affadavit…to prove
that the other person lived with us or at least wasn’t lying about living in the
state.</p>
<p>Which, when you think about it, is weird, right?</p>
<p>Go in with enough random people to say you lived at a place and that was more
legitimate than a letter with your address on top from a propane company that
served half the state.</p>
<p>The letter, you see, doesn’t count because it wasn’t a bill with the account
number on it, even though the mysterious street address was. But of course new
tenants wouldn’t have a bill with the account number on it yet since they had
only just moved in! Proof of car insurance wasn’t enough either because it only
had our mailing address, which is a PO Box…and well, we know what Serious
Institutions think of PO Boxes.</p>
<p>And while we have figured at least some of this out, we also had difficulty
discerning where to begin. Since, to get the PO Box at all, USPS had to know
where we lived and that we had proof of living in the town we wanted the PO Box
at…which caused a headache with Google Maps autocomplete again. Because of
Google, our address wasn’t even present for the USPS, who should have more say
than Google about what is and isn’t an address! It took a sympathetic postmaster
to help us out in person, since everyone in that office had delivered local mail
to our address previously, so knew we weren’t making things up.</p>
<p>This entire debacle is worth mentioning in as full of detail as possible for two
reasons: (1) It shows the extent to which Google can dictate our lives and how
we get to live it. (2) Proof of address is needed for so many things, down to the
basic necessities to be legal within this country.</p>
<p>If I don’t have an address, I cannot have a bank account. I cannot get a
driver’s license, register my car, vote in my town. I cannot even get a library
card.</p>
<p>For an entire week, I was a non-person to this country’s bureaucracy, which in
some respects <em>should</em> feel freeing, but in the end was a massive pain in the
ass. It was frightening to consider that something as simple as an address not
showing up on the world’s most popular maps app meant that, without the
intervention of locals who understood what it meant to live in a largely
unmarked rural area, this non-personhood would’ve potentially been permanent.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, it made me concerned for the use of AI in these kinds of
situations. What if I wasn’t able to intercept a human postmaster who could then
look at my documents and say that I was able to have a PO Box to receive mail
from outside of town? Or talk to a DMV associate who could see that my partner
was right beside me and could vouch for my legitimacy as a state resident?</p>
<p>Technology, of course, is falliable. It cannot account for all cases, all
possibilities. And forbid the thought of politics entering into it. These tools
can easily be manipulated further to label anyone outside of the white,
heteronormative, cisgender conglomerate as a non-person in the eyes of the
larger system. All they need is a huge company like Google to “not recognize” a
few key factors like whole neighborhoods in redlined areas or a gender marker
(as compared to a birth certificate or something).</p>
<p>If nothing else, I learned that nothing beats talking to a real, live human
being, especially those that are just down the street.</p>

<p>Graphite is designed principally as a desktop-grade professional application that is also accessible in-browser for fast, casual usage.</p>
<p>Where's the download? Desktop apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux should be available later in 2024. Until then, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361" target="_blank">install it as a PWA</a>.</p>
<p>Developing and maintaining a native app on four platforms is a big task. To not compromise on the optimal desktop experience—which takes longer to do the right way—priorities called for initially supporting just web, the one platform that stays up-to-date and reaches all devices.</p>
<p>Once it's ready to shine, Graphite's code architecture is structured to deliver native performance for your graphically intensive workloads on desktop platforms and very low overhead on the web thanks to WebAssembly and WebGPU, new high-performance browser technologies.</p>

<div id="proceduralism">
<div>

<hr>
<p>Graphite is the first and only graphic design package built for procedural editing — where everything is nondestructive.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>Save hours on tedious alterations and make better creative choices. Graphite lets you iterate rapidly by adjusting node parameters instead of individual elements.</p>
<p>Scatter circles with just a couple nodes...<br>
Want them denser? Bigger? Those are sliders.<br>
Want a different placement area? Just tweak the path.</p>
<p><a href="https://editor.graphite.rs/#demo/red-dress">Open this artwork</a> and give it a try yourself.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>Nondestructive editing means every decision is tied to a parameter you can adjust later on. Use Graphite to interpolate between any states just by dragging sliders.</p>
<p>Blend across color schemes. Morph shapes before they're scattered around the canvas. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Graphite, a new open source 2D procedural graphics editor, has spent July–September building major improvements to performance, node graph organization, nondestructive path editing, a new render engine, and more helpful nodes, amongst over 100 other features and fixes.
This has been the most productive quarter yet in the project's three-year history. Most of our Google Summer of Code student intern projects have already reached their goals, adding to the goodies included in this progress report. All Q3 2024 commits may be viewed in this list and all noteworthy changes are detailed below.

<p>Graphite, a new open source 2D procedural graphics editor, has spent April–June introducing boolean path operations, a new gradient picker, layer locking, and more improvements.
Overall, editor functionality has been shaping up and becoming an all around useful tool suite, with notable reductions in rough edges for the vector graphics workflow (our initial focus). Raster and raw photo processing workflows are also now in-development by our Google Summer of Code student interns. Node graph quality-of-life improvements centered around tidy node organization are also the focus of the summer work that's underway. These projects are detailed below.

Before we answer that let’s look at what an awning actually does for a building.</p> <h2>How Do Awnings Work?</h2> <p>Awnings were and still are extremely effective at blocking solar heat gain through windows. We often look at builders from the 19th century with a pitying condescension like they just weren’t as smart as we are today.

Since in the winter the sun is lower in the sky the awning, when positioned and sized properly, allows the winter sun into the room to warm things up.</p> <p>No adjusting, no tweaking, just completely passive heating in the winter and cooling in the summer by a thoughtful design.

Two simple words…air conditioning. Before the widespread adoption of air conditioning, awnings were the preferred way to keep buildings cooler. But just because we invented AC does that mean we don’t need the help that awnings provide?</p> <p>In the middle of the 20th century as air conditioning was gradually installed in homes across America, awnings came down or wore out and were not replaced because now we had the technology to mechanically cool our buildings.</p> <p>Energy costs were relatively cheap in those decades and one generation later when energy prices jumped up during the 1970s people seemed to have forgotten about awnings for energy savings. We jumped into the insulation craze and began stuffing fiberglass into every wall and ceiling as fast as possible, forgetting what our fathers and grandfathers knew to be true. If you kept the sun out of the windows you could keep the heat out of the building.</p> <p>Today, awnings are mainly used as signage for storefronts and coverings to keep rain off of customers. Retractable awnings to cover decks and patios have picked up in the ensuing decades and remain a market for manufacturers, but the days of covering individual windows with awnings have gone away.</p> <p>In this age of increasing energy prices, I’m hopeful the awning will swing back into popularity since it is an extremely simple way to keep temperatures moderated throughout the year. Time will tell. How about you? Would you consider adding awnings to your house to keep your heating and cooling costs down? If not then why?

                We praise canonical authors for their boundless imagination. Then why do all their plots feel the same?            </p>
                
<p><span>anthony trollope</span><br>
Your happiness is put on hold when it transpires your fiancé failed to correctly cash a cheque. This lasts for 130 chapters. Everyone else is ordained.</p>

<p><span>evelyn waugh</span><br>
The spectre of God’s grace haunts your attempts to hang out with people posher than yourself.</p>

<p><span>henry james</span><br>
You declined an invitation, not wishing, to wit, for it to be understood that you might have deliberately allowed yourself to be put at a disadvantage. Now your ruin is certain.</p>

<p><span>graham greene</span><br>
Your only desire is to preserve an inconceivably small piece of your dignity. You are denied this, because of a prior engagement with the British Foreign Office. This novel is called <em>The Way of the Thing</em>.</p>

<p><span>w shakespeare (i)</span><br>
You become King. This turns out to have been a very big mistake.</p>

<p><span>samuel richardson</span><br>
‘Dearest Mama, An alluring yet unvirtuous <em>rake</em> has designs on my Innocence and has placed me in a sack to be <em>transported</em> to Covent Garden. Fortunately the sack is so designed as to allow the writing of several letters.’</p>

<p><span>david foster wallace</span><br>
You suffer from an unbearably acute and inexpressible form of psychic pain and anxiety, the very inexpressibility of which is in and of itself a significant constituent part of this pain. Your name is Quagmire Gesamtkunstwerk.</p>

<p><span>marcel proust</span><br>
The only straight person in Paris has a series of very long lunches.</p>

<p><span>mrs gaskell</span><br>
You are forced to move to Manchester, which is unfortunately full of Mancunians. You have great sympathy for the sufferings of the working poor, but this does not stop you marrying a mill owner.</p>

<p><span>ian mcewan</span><br>
Here is an artist, doing artsy things. Here is a scientist, doing sciencey things. This presents a dichotomy that can only be resolved with a calculated cinematographic finale.</p>

<p><span>e m forster</span><br>
Things were bad, so you left England. Now things are muddled, and only a straight-talking Aunt can save you.</p>

<p><span>cormac mccarthy</span><br>
Nothing can ever be right again. Here’s a horse.</p>

<p><span>p g wodehouse</span><br>
You and all your acquaintances have names better suited to clowns, dogs, or sickening sexual euphemisms. An accidental engagement is contrived to prevent the theft of your aunt’s chef.</p>

<p><span>alan bennett</span><br>
The declining institution on stage represents Britain, because <em>Britain is a declining institution</em>.</p>

<p><span>jane austen</span><br>
Your obligation to make a judicious alliance with an alluring newcomer is constantly pressed upon you by your relations. You despise them all.</p>

<p><span>dan brown</span><br>
Award-winning author Dan Brown has written a complicated role for you with his expensive pen. You are a humanities professor at an Ivy League university, but also, somehow, in mortal peril. Your love interest is picturesque but ill-mannered and French. This is somehow worth several million dollars.</p>

<p><span>agatha christie</span><br>
The extravagant web of lies that is your home life is shattered by twin irritations: a spate of deaths and a Belgian asking irritating questions.</p>

<p><span>zadie smith</span><br>
Shameless recycling of modernist plots, because the novelist is too good at non-fiction to be called out for it.</p>

<p><span>w shakespeare (ii)</span><br>
Very much like the reality <span>tv</span> programme <em>Wife Swap</em>, but set in Italy.</p>

<p><span>iris murdoch</span><br>
An Oxford/ Hampstead sex farce is most profitably understood as a response to Sartre, more’s the pity.</p>

<p><span>ernest hemingway</span><br>
On the journey you drink beer from cold bottles, and peasant’s wine from the big leather sacks the fisherman gave you. When you arrive in the town square, you stop by a café for a bottle of champagne and a bottle of cheap wine. You hate the man you are with. You order more beer. Soon it will be time for lunch.</p>

<p><span>john banville</span><br>
An elderly art historian, lodged in a manor house in rural Ireland, compares the sky to Poussin paintings. For 250 pages.</p>

<p><span>harold pinter</span><br>
You know what Dad.<br>
<em>(pause)</em><br>
I’ve always known you to be a cunt.</p>

<p><span>f scott fitzgerald</span><br>
Ginevra Beauregard and Redmond Ingram (known as Red at Princeton) are honeymooning in the South of France. They are beautiful, clever and rich. For reasons never fully explored, they have resolved to make themselves unhappy.</p>

<p><span>tennessee williams</span><br>
<em>(An angry male protagonist wipes sweat from brow)</em> ‘Someone fix me a goddamn drink. From the icebox, Scarlett, from the goddamn icebox!’</p>

<p><span>oscar wilde</span><br>
To write a comedy of manners once may be regarded as a misfortune; to write several of them begins to look like carelessness.</p>

<p><span>d h lawrence</span><br>
You look upon his bright loins of darkness as they gleam in the Midlands sun. ‘Before we have sex,’ he says, ‘here are several of my opinions.’</p>

<p><span>thomas hardy</span><br>
Lies, lies, misery, lies, suicide, rape, and corn prices.</p>

<p><span>virginia woolf</span><br>
We follow the fortunes of an upper-middle class family as they spend 40 years engaged in artistic hobbies whose sole purpose is to distract them from the existence of a) the actuality of sex and b) the First World War.</p>

<p><span>tom stoppard</span><br>
You are trapped within a play within a play within a play within a GCSE drama syllabus.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>At the Open Compute Project (OCP) Global Summit 2024, we’re showcasing our latest open AI hardware designs with the OCP community.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>These innovations include a new AI platform, cutting-edge open rack designs, and advanced network fabrics and components.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>By sharing our designs, we hope to inspire collaboration and foster innovation. If you’re passionate about building the future of AI, we invite you to engage with us and OCP to help shape the next generation of open hardware for AI.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>AI has been at the core of the experiences Meta has been delivering to people and businesses for years, including AI modeling innovations to optimize and improve on features like </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/facebook-feed-improvements-ai-show-more-less/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Feed</span></a><span> and our </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/07/10/data-infrastructure/machine-learning-ml-prediction-robustness-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ads system</span></a><span>. As we develop and release new, advanced AI models, we are also driven to advance our infrastructure to support our new and emerging AI workloads.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Llama 3.1 405B</span></a><span>, Meta’s largest model, is a dense transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128k tokens. To train a large language model (LLM) of this magnitude, with over 15 trillion tokens, we had to make substantial optimizations to our entire training stack. This effort pushed our infrastructure to operate across more than 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, making Llama 3.1 405B the first model in the Llama series to be trained at such a massive scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Prior to Llama, our largest AI jobs ran on 128 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. ​But things have rapidly accelerated. ​Over the course of 2023, we rapidly scaled up our training clusters from 1K, 2K, 4K, to eventually 16K GPUs to support our AI workloads. Today, we’re training our models on two</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>24K-GPU clusters</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We don’t expect this upward trajectory for AI clusters to slow down any time soon. In fact, we expect the amount of compute needed for AI training will grow significantly from where we are today.</span></p>
<p><span>Building AI clusters requires more than just GPUs. Networking and bandwidth play an important role in ensuring the clusters’ performance. Our systems consist of a tightly integrated HPC compute system and an isolated high-bandwidth compute network that connects all our GPUs and domain-specific accelerators. This design is necessary to meet our injection needs and address the challenges posed by our need for bisection bandwidth.</span></p>
<p><span>In the next few years, we anticipate greater injection bandwidth on the order of a terabyte per second, per accelerator, with equal normalized bisection bandwidth. This represents a growth of more than an order of magnitude compared to today’s networks!</span></p>
<p><span>To support this growth, we need a high-performance, multi-tier, non-blocking network fabric that can utilize modern congestion control to behave predictably under heavy load. This will enable us to fully leverage the power of our AI clusters and ensure they continue to perform optimally as we push the boundaries of what is possible with AI.</span></p>
<p><span>Scaling AI at this speed requires open hardware solutions. Developing new architectures, network fabrics, and system designs is the most efficient and impactful when we can build it on principles of openness. By investing in open hardware, we unlock AI’s full potential and propel ongoing innovation in the field.</span></p>

<p><span>Today, we announced the upcoming release of Catalina, our new high-powered rack designed for AI workloads, to the OCP community. Catalina is based on the <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-contributes-blackwell-platform-design-to-open-hardware-ecosystem-accelerating-ai-infrastructure-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Blackwell platform full rack-scale solution</a>, with a focus on modularity and flexibility. It is built to support the latest NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, ensuring it meets the growing demands of modern AI infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The growing power demands of GPUs means open rack solutions need to support higher power capability. With Catalina we’re introducing the Orv3, a high-power rack (HPR) capable of supporting up to 140kW.</span></p>
<p><span>The full solution is liquid cooled and consists of a power shelf that supports a compute tray, switch tray, the Orv3 HPR, the</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/11/09/data-center-engineering/ocp-summit-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Wedge 400</span></a><span> fabric switch, a management switch, battery backup unit, and a rack management controller.</span></p>
<p><span>We aim for Catalina’s modular design to empower others to customize the rack to meet their specific AI workloads while leveraging both existing and emerging industry standards.</span></p>

<p><span>In 2022, we announced </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Grand Teton</span></a><span>, our next-generation AI platform (the follow-up to our Zion-EX platform). Grand Teton is designed with compute capacity to support the demands of memory-bandwidth-bound workloads, such as Meta’s <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/dlrm-an-advanced-open-source-deep-learning-recommendation-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep learning recommendation models (</a></span><span>DLRMs</span><span>), as well as compute-bound workloads like content understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, we have expanded the Grand Teton platform to support the AMD Instinct MI300X and will be contributing this new version to OCP. Like its predecessors, this new version of Grand Teton</span><span>&nbsp;features a single monolithic system design with fully integrated power, control, compute, and fabric interfaces. This high level of integration simplifies system deployment, enabling rapid scaling with increased reliability for large-scale AI inference workloads.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to supporting a range of accelerator designs, now including the AMD Instinct MI300x, Grand Teton offers significantly greater compute capacity, allowing faster convergence on a larger set of weights. This is complemented by expanded memory to store and run larger models locally, along with increased network bandwidth to scale up training cluster sizes efficiently.</span></p>

<p><span>Developing open, vendor-agnostic networking backend is going to play an important role going forward as we continue to push the performance of our AI training clusters. Disaggregating our network allows us to work with vendors from across the industry to design systems that are innovative as well as scalable, flexible, and efficient.</span></p>
<p><span>Our new <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/10/15/data-infrastructure/open-future-networking-hardware-ai-ocp-2024-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric (DSF)</a> for our next-generation AI clusters offers several advantages over our existing switches. By opening up our network fabric we can overcome limitations in scale, component supply options, and power density. DSF is powered by the open</span><a href="https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span> OCP-SAI</span></a><span> standard and</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2018/09/04/data-infrastructure/research-in-brief-building-switch-software-at-scale-and-in-the-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span> FBOSS</span></a><span>, Meta’s own network operating system for controlling network switches. It also supports an open and standard Ethernet-based RoCE interface to endpoints and accelerators across several GPUS and NICS from several different vendors, including our partners at NVIDIA, Broadcom, and AMD.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to DSF, we have also developed and built new 51T fabric switches based on Broadcom and Cisco ASICs. Finally, we are sharing our new FBNIC, a new NIC module that contains our first Meta-design network ASIC. In order to meet the growing needs of our AI&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Meta and Microsoft: Driving Open Innovation Together</span></h2>
<p><span>Meta and Microsoft have a long-standing partnership within OCP, beginning with the development of the </span><a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/switch-abstraction-interface-ocp-specification-v0-2-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI)</span></a><span> for data centers in 2018. Over the years together, we’ve contributed to key initiatives such as the </span><a href="https://www.opencompute.org/blog/new-open-accelerator-infrastructure-oai-sub-project-to-launch-within-the-ocp-server-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Open Accelerator Module (OAM)</span></a><span> standard and SSD standardization, showcasing our shared commitment to advancing open innovation.</span></p>
<p><span>Our current </span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/accelerating-industry-wide-innovations-in-datacenter-infrastructure-and-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>collaboration focuses on Mount Diablo</span></a><span>, a new disaggregated power rack. It’s a cutting-edge solution featuring a scalable 400 VDC unit that enhances efficiency and scalability.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/intel_amd_x86_future/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/intel_amd_x86_future/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41851104">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The shape of the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) is evolving. On Tuesday, Intel and AMD announced the formation of an ecosystem advisory group intended to drive greater consistency between the brands' x86 implementations.</p>
<p>Intel and AMD have been co-developing the x86-64 instruction for decades. But while end user workloads have enjoyed cross-compatibility between the two chipmakers' products, this has been far from universal.</p>
<p>"x86 is the de facto standard. It's a strong ecosystem, but it's one that really Intel and AMD have co-developed in a way, but an arm's length, and you know, that has caused some inefficiencies and some drift in portions of the ISA over time." AMD EVP of datacenter solutions Forrest Norrod said during a press briefing ahead of the announcement.</p>

    

<p>The introduction of advanced vector extensions (AVX) is the most obvious example of where compatibility across Intel and AMD platforms hasn't always been guaranteed.</p>

        


        

<p>For many years, those who wanted to take advantage of fat 512-bit vector registers have been limited to Intel platforms. In fact, AMD lacked support for AVX-512 until the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/10/amd_96core_epyc/">launch</a> of Zen 4 in 2022, and even then it only supported it by double pumping a 256-bit data path. It wasn't until this year's Zen 5 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/15/amd_spills_the_beans_on/">launch</a> the House of Zen added support for a full 512-bit data path.</p>
<p>Going forward, Intel, AMD, and their industry partners aim to avoid this kind of inconsistency by converging around a more uniform implementation. To support this goal, the duo has solicited the help of Broadcom, Dell, Google, HPE, HP, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat, as well as individuals, including Linux kernel-dev Linus Torvalds and Epic's Tim Sweeney.</p>

        

<p>This advisory group will be tasked with reshaping the x86 ISA to improve cross-compatibility, simplify software development, and address changing demands around emerging technologies.</p>
<p>"We'll have, not only will we have the benefits of performance, flexibility and compatibility across hardware, we'll have it across software, operating systems and a variety of services," Intel EVP of datacenter and AI group Justin Hotard told us.</p>
<p>"I think this will actually enable greater choice in the fundamental products, but reduce the friction of being able to choose from those choices," echoed Norrod.</p>

        

<p>However, it'll be some time before we see the group's influence realized in products. Norrod emphasized that silicon development can take months if not years. As such it's "not something that's going to reflect into products, I don't believe, in the next year or so."</p>
<p>For end users, the benefits are numerous as in theory taking advantage of either Intel or AMD's products will require less specialization, something we're sure the hyperscalers will appreciate.</p>
<p>For the long-time rivals, however, the change could have major implications for the future development of the architecture. While the two chipmakers have caught up with each other on vector extensions, Intel still has its advanced matrix extensions (AMX) for CPU-based AI inference acceleration.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether these extensions will be phased out or if some version of them will eventually make their way into AMD's Epyc and Ryzen processors. We have no doubt that either team's SoC designers would relish the opportunity to reclaim all that die area currently consumed by the NPU.</p>
<p>"I don't think we want to commit to 'we're going to support this or not support this' in a time frame. But I think the intent is we want to support things consistently," Hotard said.</p>
<p>While Norrod and Hotard declined to comment on specific changes coming to x86, recent developments, particularly on Intel's side, give us some idea of the ISA's trajectory.</p>
<p>In June, Intel published an update to its proposed <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/envisioning-future-simplified-architecture.html">x86S spec</a>, a stripped down version of the ISA free of legacy bloat — most notably 32-bit and 16-bit execution modes. As we understand it, 32-bit code would still be able to run, albeit in a compatibility mode.</p>
<p>There's also the AVX10 spec that we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/15/avx10_intel_interviews/">looked at</a> last year, which made many of AVX512's more attractive functions. Under the new spec, AVX10 compatible chips will, for the most part, share a common feature set — including 32 registers, k-masks, and FP16 support — and minimally support 256 bit wide registers.</p>
<p>AVX10 is important for Intel which has transitioned to a dual-stack Xeon roadmap with P-and E-core CPUs, like Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest, the latter of which lacks support for AVX512.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/10/amd_epyc_turin/">AMD pumps Epyc core count to 192, clocks up to 5 GHz with Turin debut</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/samsung_hb3me/">Samsung's HBM3E has been a disaster, but there's a path back</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/24/intel_xeon_6p/">With Granite Rapids, Intel is back to trading blows with AMD</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/19/sifive_ai_accelerator/">SiFive expands from RISC-V cores for AI chips to designing its own full-fat accelerator</a></li>
</ul>
<p>AMD's dense Zen C-cores don't suffer from this limitation, but can be switched to a double pumped 256-bit data path to achieve lower power AVX512 support. Whether Intel will push ahead with AVX10 or borrow AMD's implementation under the newly formed advisory group is another unknown, but given enough time, we can expect the two chipmakers to coalesce around a common implementation whether it be AVX, AMX or something else.</p>
<p>That's assuming, of course, that Intel and AMD can agree on how to address industry needs.</p>
<p>With that said, a more consistent ISA could help stave off the growing number of Arm-compatible CPUs finding homes in cloud datacenters. While the exact cores used by these chips may differ — most use Arm's Neoverse cores, but some, like Ampere have developed their own — most are using either the older ARMv8 or ARMv9 ISAs, ensuring that with few exceptions code developed on one should run without issue on the other. ®</p>

<p>The C23 edition of Modern C is now available for free download from</p>



<p><a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02383654">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02383654</a></p>



<div><p>This new edition has been the occasion to overhaul the presentation in many places, but its main purpose is the update to the new C standard, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/82075.html">C23</a>. The goal was to publish this new edition of Modern C at the same time as the new C standard goes through the procedure of ISO publication. The closest approximation of the contents of the new standard in a publically available document can be found <a href="https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3220.pdf">here</a>. New releases of major compilers already implement most of the new features that it brings.</p>
<p>Among the most noticeable changes and additions that we handle are those for integers: there are new bit-precise types coined <code>_BitInt(N)</code>, new C library headers <code>(for arithmetic with overflow check) and</code> (for bit manipulation), possibilities for 128 bit types on modern architectures, and substantial improvements for enumeration types. Other new concepts in C23 include a <code>nullptr</code> constant and its underlying type, syntactic annotation with attributes, more tools for type generic programming such as type inference with <code>auto</code> and <code>typeof</code>, default initialization with <code>{}</code>, even for variable length arrays, and <code>constexpr</code> for named constants of any type. Furthermore, new material has been added, discussing compound expressions and lambdas, so-called “internationalization”, a comprehensive approach for program failure.</p>
<p>Also added has been an appendix and a temporary include header for an easy transition to C23 on existing platforms, that will allow you to start off with C23 right away.</p>
<p>Manning’s early access program (MEAP) for the new edition is still open at</p>
<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-c-third-edition" rel="nofollow">https://www.manning.com/books/modern-c-third-edition</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately they were not yet able to tell me when their version of the C23 edition will finally be published.</p>

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The new iPad mini gets a major update with A17 Pro, delivering incredible performance and power efficiency in an ultraportable design. A17 Pro is a powerful chip that unlocks a number of improvements over A15 Bionic in the previous-generation iPad mini. With a 6-core CPU — two performance cores and four efficiency cores — A17 Pro delivers a 30 percent boost in CPU performance.<sup>1</sup> A17 Pro also brings a boost in graphics performance with a 5-core GPU, delivering a 25 percent jump over the previous generation.<sup>1</sup> A17 Pro brings entirely new experiences — including pro apps used by designers, pilots, doctors, and others — and makes it faster than ever for users to edit photos, dive into more immersive AR applications, and more. The new iPad mini brings true-to-life gaming with hardware-accelerated ray tracing — which is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing — as well as support for Dynamic Caching and hardware-accelerated mesh shading. From creating engaging content faster than ever in Affinity Designer, to playing demanding, graphics-intensive AAA games like Zenless Zone Zero, users can take the powerful performance and ultraportable iPad mini anywhere.

A custom haptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. Users can roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they’re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper, and with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark. Apple Pencil Pro features support for Find My, and pairs, charges, and is stored through a new magnetic interface on the new iPad mini. iPad mini also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at a great value.

Combining the activity of thousands of species of insects with other data like climate, acoustic, or soil analysis, can provide deep analysis into how environments can be repaired.</p><h3 id="offer-highly-localized-insights"> <a href="#offer-highly-localized-insights" aria-labelledby="offer-highly-localized-insights"></a> Offer Highly Localized Insights</h3><p>Because they tend to have short lives and often limited ranges, insects can provide super localized data. Moths, in particular, are great indicators of overall biodiversity because they are often host-specific as caterpillars. This means they only feed on one or a limited number of plant species. So, by monitoring moths, you are getting a proxy of the local plant community.</p><p>For comparison, think about something like a Jaguar, which is a rare find and scientifically valuable to see on a wildlife camera, but they have large ranges and long lives. The presence of a Jaguar does not necessarily tell us much about the health of the environment where it was spotted. It could simply be travelling across disturbed farmland to escape from a destroyed habitat elsewhere.</p><p>Having an insect sensor (like a Mothbox), however, that could compare the activity of thousands of different species of insects can highlight differences in environmental health in areas just a couple kilometers apart.</p><h3 id="they-are-easy-to-attract"> <a href="#they-are-easy-to-attract" aria-labelledby="they-are-easy-to-attract"></a> They are Easy to Attract</h3><p>Humans have long ago discovered that many nocturnal insects like Moths seem to be attracted to lights. We now know this is because <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44785-3">bright lights disorient their natural steering mechanism</a>. Scientists have used bright artificial lights for over a century now to take censuses of insect populations. The problem with this type of “Mothlighting” is that it can be incredibly time consuming (a scientist has to hang out all night and note which insects are visiting). Instead we have an automated device that does all this work for you!</p><h2 id="what-it-does"> <a href="#what-it-does" aria-labelledby="what-it-does"></a> What it Does</h2><p>The Mothbox stays in an ultra low-power state until your schedule tells it which nights to wake up. Then it triggers an insect lure (usually a bright UV light) and then takes ultra-high resolution photos of the visitors it attracts. <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb7f6a03-849b-4b2a-99b9-9580aa245816" alt="PXL_20240607_025924783 NIGHT-EDIT"></p><p>Next we created some open-source AI scripts that process these insects for you.

</figure><p>Put aside the hype about the growing number of us who are likely to make it to 100, because the rise in human life expectancy might actually be slowing down. At least, according to a study that analysed mortality data for ten countries or regions over the past three decades<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>“There are limits to how far out we can push out the envelope of human survival,” says study co-author S. Jay Olshansky, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. “If you live long enough, you run up against the biological process of ageing.”</p><p>The era of what he calls radical life extension is over, he argues. Some researchers, however, disagree and point out that medical science could yet find a way to push age limits.</p><p>Advances in public health and medicine during the twentieth century increased human life expectancy to about three years per decade. But Olshansky and others have long argued that this rate of improvement is not sustainable, despite more-optimistic forecasts that predict most children born in the twenty-first century would live for a 100 years or more<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. But this is difficult to confirm, because the only way to be sure is to wait for enough people to die, or not.</p><p>With his colleagues, Olshansky first published the idea<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup> that human life expectancy has a finite limit in 1990. “We have waited 30 years to test this,” he says. “And we now have definitive evidence that the limited lifespan hypothesis is correct.”</p><p>That evidence is based on the numbers of reported deaths in parts of the world with some of the highest current life expectancies, including Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Australia, France, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, the United States and Spain. The analysis looked at the period of 1990 to 2019, to avoid the distorting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The team found that the rate of improvement in life expectancy in the decade of 2010–19 had dropped below that seen between 1990 and 2000. People were still living longer, but not by as much. In fact, in every population except those of Hong Kong and South Korea, the decadal rise in life expectancy decelerated to below two years.</p><p>Overall, the study found that children born since 2010 have a relatively small chance of living to 100 (5.1% chance for women and 1.8% chance for men). The most likely cohort to see a full century are women in Hong Kong, with a 12.8% chance.</p><h2>Can we overcome ageing?</h2><p>It’s clear that further extension of the average lifespan is difficult because that would require researchers to find treatments for illnesses that affect older people, says Dmitri Jdanov, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany.

<p dir="auto">Asterinas is a <em>secure</em>, <em>fast</em>, and <em>general-purpose</em> OS kernel
that provides <em>Linux-compatible</em> ABI.
It can serve as a seamless replacement for Linux
while enhancing <em>memory safety</em> and <em>developer friendliness</em>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Asterinas prioritizes memory safety
by employing Rust as its sole programming language
and limiting the use of <em>unsafe Rust</em>
to a clearly defined and minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
This innovative approach,
known as <a href="https://asterinas.github.io/book/kernel/the-framekernel-architecture.html" rel="nofollow">the framekernel architecture</a>,
establishes Asterinas as a more secure and dependable kernel option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Asterinas surpasses Linux in terms of developer friendliness.
It empowers kernel developers to
(1) utilize the more productive Rust programming language,
(2) leverage a purpose-built toolkit called <a href="https://asterinas.github.io/book/osdk/guide/index.html" rel="nofollow">OSDK</a> to streamline their workflows,
and (3) choose between releasing their kernel modules as open source
or keeping them proprietary,
thanks to the flexibility offered by <a href="#License">MPL</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">While the journey towards a production-grade OS kernel can be challenging,
we are steadfastly progressing towards our goal.
Currently, Asterinas only supports x86-64 VMs.
However, <a href="https://asterinas.github.io/book/kernel/roadmap.html" rel="nofollow">our aim for 2024</a> is
to make Asterinas production-ready on x86-64 VMs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started</h2><a id="user-content-getting-started" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started" href="#getting-started"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Get yourself an x86-64 Linux machine with Docker installed.
Follow the three simple steps below to get Asterinas up and running.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Download the latest source code.</li>
</ol>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas"><pre>git clone https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas</pre></div>

<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>Inside the container, go to the project folder to build and run Asterinas.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">If everything goes well, Asterinas is now up and running inside a VM.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Lillian Schwartz, resident artist and consultant at Bell Laboratories (New Jersey), 1969-2002. During the 70s and 80s Schwartz developed a catalogue of visionary techniques for the use of the computer system by artists. Her formal explorations in abstract animation involved the marriage of film, computers and music in collaboration with such luminaries as computer musicians Jean-Claude Risset, Max Mathews, Vladimir Ussachevsky, Milton Babbit, and Richard Moore. Schwartz’s films have been shown and won awards at the Venice Biennale, Zagreb, Cannes, The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and nominated and received Emmy nominations and awards.</p><p>Her work has been exhibited at, and is owned by, The Museum of Modern Art (New York), The Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), The Whitney Museum of American Art (New York), The Moderna Museet (Stockholm), Centre Beauborg (Paris), Stedlijk Museum of Art (Amsterdam), and the Grand Palais Museum (Paris). Lumen has collaborated with Lillian Schwartz and curator Gregory Kurcewicz to compile a touring package of these important works. “A Beautiful Virus Inside the Machine” features animations restored to video. “The Artist and the Computer”, 1976, 10 mins is a documentary about her work. Produced by Larry Keating for AT&amp;T, “The Artist and the Computer is an excellent introductory informational film that dispels some of the ‘mystery’ of computer-art technology, as it clarifies the necessary human input of integrity, artistic sensibilities, and aesthetics. Ms. Schwartz’s voice over narration explains what she hoped to accomplish in the excerpts from a number of her films and gives insight into the artist’s problems and decisions.” – John Canemaker</p><div>

Music by F. Richard Moore. “The most fascinating use of the computer in filmmaking that I have seen recently is in L. Schwartz’ ALAE. Beginning with footage of sea birds in flight, the film image is then optically scanned and transformed by the computer. The geometric overlay on live random motion has the effect of creating new depth, a third dimension. Our perception of the birds’ forms and movements is heightened by the abstract pattern outlining them. Even if you suffer from the delusion that if you’ve seen one computer film, you’ve seen them all, give this stunning, original film a chance. Should you remain unconvinced, ALAE is a good example of the fact that computer technology seems destined to play an important role in animation.” – Jana Varlejs, Cine-Opsis, \f2Wilson Library Bull.\f1, March 1976. Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>
<p><strong>1974 “METAMORPHOSIS” – 8 Min. 15 Sec.</strong></p>

Music Symphony in D Major by Salieri. “As expert hands in the complex techniques of integrating the computer and animation, L. Schwartz makes fascinating use of exotic, flowing forms, colors and electronic music in ‘Metamorphosis’.” – A. H. Weiler, N. Y. Times. “Schwartz’ METAMORPHOSIS is a complex study of evolving lines, planes, and circles, all moving at different speeds, and resulting in subtle color changes. The only computer-generated work on the program, it transcends what many of us have come to expect of such film with its subtle variations and significant use of color.” – Catherine Egan, Sight Lines, Vol. 8, No. 4, Summer 1975.

<p>“Lines and rectangles are the geometric shapes basic to ENIGMA, a computer graphics film full of subliminal and persistent image effects. In a staccato rhythm, the film builds to a climax by instantly replacing one set of shapes with another, each set either changing in composition and color or remaining for a moment to vibrate strobiscopically and then change.” – The Booklist.

<p><strong>1971 “UFOs” – 3 Min</strong><br>

<p>Copyright © 1971, 2013, 2015 Lillian F. Schwartz</p>
<p>Invented first 2D/3D Film without Pixel Shifting.</p>
<p>UFOs involved developing special color filters used on anoptical bench in reshooting original rolls, but to heighten the color saturation exponentially, black frames were inter-edited so that the eyes’ cones were constantly refreshed, the saturation never diminished, and there was a shift in the brain’s alpha rhythm so that observers had conflicting reations. A film breakthrough that literally created an individualized viewing experience.</p>
<p>Music by Emmanuel Ghent. “UFOs proves that computer animation–once a rickety and gimmicky device–is now progressing to the state of an art. The complexity of design and movement, the speed and rhythm, the richness of form and motion, coupled with stroboscopic effects is unsettling. Even more ominously, while design and action are programmed by humans, the ‘result’ in any particular sequence is neither entirely predictable … being created at a rate faster and in concatenations more complex than eye and mind can follow or initiate.” – Amos Vogel, Village Voice. Awards: Ann Arbor-1971; International award-Oberhausen, 1972; 2nd Los Angeles International Film Festival; Museum of Modern Art collection; Commissioned by AT&amp;T. Recent screening at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, December 10, 2012.</p>
<p><strong>1970 “PIXILLATION” – 4 Min.</strong></p>

Copyright © 1970, 2013 Lillian F. Schwartz All rights reserved.</p>
<p>PIXILLATION occurred at a time when the computer system was linear in time and space; Programs did not yet control pixels as moving, malleable palettes so Lillian F. Schwartz only coded a few lines of computer-generated black and white texture that she intermixed with colored hand animation. She developed an editing technique so that colors between the two media were usually matched, but sometimes mismatched to permit the eye to see an even more saturated color arrangement. The film can be viewed in either 2D or 3D without pixel shifting although one must wear chroma-depth glasses.</p>
<p>“With computer-produced images and Moog-synthesized sound Pixillation is in a sense an introduction to the electronics lab. But its forms are always handsome, its colors bright and appealing, its rhythms complex and inventive.” – Roger Greenspun, N. Y. Times. Golden Eagle-Cine 1971. Moog sound by Gershon Kingsley; Version III: pulls the viewer into a primal experience. Awards:Red Ribbon Award for Special Effects from The National Academy of Television, Arts &amp; Sciences; The Smithsonian Institution and The United States Department of Commerce, Travel Services for Man &amp; His World at the Montreal Expo, ’71; collection The Museum of Modern Art. Commissioned by AT&amp;T. Recent screening at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, December 10, 2012.</p>
