</div>
                        <div><p>The international medical humanitarian organization is urgently calling on all parties, once again, for an <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/doctors-without-borders-calls-immediate-ceasefire-gaza" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0a57b5b1-1f3e-4aac-a965-e8c4efac6070" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Doctors Without Borders calls for immediate ceasefire in Gaza">immediate ceasefire</a> to save lives and enable the flow of humanitarian aid. Israel must stop its targeted and indiscriminate attacks against civilians, and its allies must act without delay to protect the lives of Palestinians and uphold the rules of war.</p><p>"People in Gaza are struggling to survive apocalyptic conditions, but nowhere is safe, no one is spared, and there is no exit from this shattered enclave," said Christopher Lockyear, MSF secretary general, who visited Gaza earlier this year. The recent <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/whats-happening-northern-gaza" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eae15551-d701-4eab-8d81-7f074f6aae00" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="What’s happening in northern Gaza?

              <div><h2>Bearing witness in Gaza</h2><p>"What our medical teams have witnessed on the ground throughout this conflict is consistent with the descriptions provided by an increasing number of legal experts and organizations concluding that genocide is taking place in Gaza,” Lockyear said. “While we don't have legal authority to establish intentionality, the signs of ethnic cleansing and the ongoing devastation—including mass killings, severe physical and <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/mental-health" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dbe372ca-7cce-4d31-a84e-5bd5297f1f22" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Mental health">mental health</a> injuries, forced displacement, and impossible conditions of life for Palestinians under siege and bombardment—are undeniable."</p><p>In response to the horrific attacks carried out by Hamas and other armed groups in Israel on October 7, 2023—in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 people were taken hostage—Israeli forces are crushing the entire population of Gaza. Israel's all-out war on Gaza has reportedly <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-247-gaza-strip">killed more than 45,000 people</a>, according to the Ministry of Health, <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/remembering-our-colleagues-killed-gaza" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="daf39f9f-0731-49d5-ae0b-8ddd0b98b14e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Remembering our colleagues killed in Gaza">including eight MSF colleagues</a>. The number of excess deaths related to the war is likely much higher due to the impacts of a collapsed health care system, disease outbreaks, and severely limited access to food, water, and shelter. The United Nations estimated earlier this year that more than 10,000 bodies remained buried under the rubble. &nbsp;</p></div>

People cannot find even the most basic necessities like food, clean water, medicines, and soap amid a punishing siege and blockade."&nbsp;</p>

Instead, Israeli authorities continue to actively block MSF and other humanitarian organizations from providing lifesaving assistance to people trapped under siege and bombardment.</p></div>

    <p>States must leverage their influence to alleviate the suffering of the population and enable a massive scale-up of humanitarian assistance across the Gaza Strip. As the occupying power, Israeli authorities are responsible for ensuring the rapid, unimpeded, and safe delivery of humanitarian aid at the level sufficient to address people’s needs. Instead, Israel's blockade and continued obstruction of aid have made it close to impossible for people in Gaza to access essential goods, including fuel, food, water, and medicines. At the same time, Israel has decided to <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/israels-decision-ban-unrwa-will-significantly-worsen-humanitarian-catastrophe" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2684c0f0-8173-4eb3-98fc-751be638a5d5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Israel’s decision to ban UNRWA will significantly worsen humanitarian catastrophe ">effectively ban</a> the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which is the largest provider of aid, health care, and other vital services for Palestinians.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The MSF report notes that even if the Israeli military offensive on Gaza ended today, its long-term impacts would be unprecedented, given the scale of the destruction and the extraordinary challenges of providing health care across the Strip. A staggering number of war-wounded people are at risk of infection, amputation, and permanent disability, and many will require years of rehabilitative care. The cumulative physical toll and mental trauma caused by the extreme violence, loss of family members and homes, repeated forced displacement, and inhumane living conditions will scar generations.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction<a href="#Introduction"> </a></h2>
<p>You may have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly bet allocation strategy</a>. It is a system for correctly exploiting information or bias in a gambling situation. It is also known as a maximally aggressive or high variance strategy, in that betting more than the Kelly selection can be quite ruinous.<br>
I recently ran into a strange card game where the Kelly strategy is risk free with <em>zero variance</em>. Peter Winkler calls the game “Next Card Bet” in his remarkable book <em>Mathematical Puzzles</em>. The problem and solution appear to come from Thomas Cover. I find this betting game and its analysis amazing, and want to share them with you here.
</p></div>
<div data-mime-type="text/markdown" tabindex="0">
<h2 id="The-Game">The Game<a href="#The-Game"> </a></h2>
<p>The game is played as follows. A standard 52 card deck consisting of 26 red cards and 26 black cards is shuffled and the player start with a stake of $1. Each card is exposed one at a time, without being replaced in the deck. The player is allowed to bet any fraction of their current stake on whether the next card is black or red at a one to one payoff.<br>
The player clearly has advantageous strategies involving counting the number of black and red cards seen. Counting cards seen lets them know how many cards of each color remain in the unseen portion of the deck. For example they can safely double their stake by not betting on any card other than the last. This allows them to safely bet their entire stake on the now inferable color of the final unseen card.
</p></div>
<div data-mime-type="text/markdown" tabindex="0">
<h2 id="The-Kelly-strategy">The Kelly strategy<a href="#The-Kelly-strategy"> </a></h2>
<p>The Kelly strategy is to pick a bet that maximizes the expected logarithm of the stake. We can derive it as follows.<br>
Let <code>r</code> be the number red cards remaining in the deck and <code>b</code> black cards remaining. Without loss of generality assume <code>r &gt; b</code>. We then want to maximize <code>P[draw red] * log(1 + bet_fraction) + P[draw black] * log(1 - bet_fraction)</code> as a function of <code>bet_fraction</code>. This expression is maximized where its derivative is zero. The probability of drawing red next is <code>r/(r + b)</code>. So we need to solve <code>(r/(r + b)) / (1 + bet_fraction) - (b/(r + b)) / (1 - bet_fraction) = 0</code>. Some algebra tells us <code>bet_fraction = (r - b) / (r + b)</code>.<br>
The entire Kelly betting strategy is then:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>r = b</code>, then no bet</li>
<li>If <code>r &gt; b</code> bet a <code>|r - b| / (r + b)</code> fraction of your stake on “red”</li>
<li>If <code>b &gt; r</code> bet a <code>|r - b| / (r + b)</code> fraction of your stake on “black.”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div data-mime-type="text/markdown" tabindex="0">
<h2 id="Trying-the-strategy">Trying the strategy<a href="#Trying-the-strategy"> </a></h2>
<p>You really should see this strategy in action. It is a strong claim that it is in fact zero variance, so we really should insist on that being confirmed. We will work the example in Python.

<p>
For each run we made a return of <code>9.08</code> times our starting stake. It is remarkable that there was no variation or variance in the outcomes. Notice this <code>9.08</code> times return is much larger than the <code>2</code> times return of the simple “wait to the end” strategy.<br>
This result is very unusual for a Kelly strategy. Kelly strategies guarantee to not “bust” (lose all of the money) and to maximize the expected growth rate of the logarithm of the stake. But they usually guarantee little else, can in fact lose money, and are usually high variance. How is it that in this case Kelly <em>can’t</em> fail?
</p>
</div>
<div data-mime-type="text/markdown" tabindex="0">
<h2 id="An-explanation">An explanation<a href="#An-explanation"> </a></h2>
<p>There is a remarkable proof that the strategy is zero variance.<br>
There are <code>(52 choose 26) = 495,918,532,948,104</code> possible arrangements of red versus black cards. It is a standard result (not proven here) that each of these arrangements is in fact equally likely in a properly shuffled deck.<br>
We define a new “portfolio” strategy as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the <code>(52 choose 26)</code> possible red/black arrangements is assigned as a sub-strategy in our portfolio.</li>
<li>We allocate a <code>1/(52 choose 26)</code> fraction of our initial stake to each sub-strategy. We allow each sub-strategy to keep its own money and do not re-allocate money between sub-strategies.</li>
<li>Each sub-strategy assumes its assigned red/black arrangement is what is going to happen in the actual deck. The sub-strategy bets its entire stake on each card, betting the card exposed will match the corresponding one it its own defining arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<p>All but one of the portfolio sub-strategies will lose all of their money- as they eventually bet all their stake on a wrong guess. The single strategy that correctly guesses the entire deck ends experiences <code>52</code> doublings and no losses. Thus this strategy multiplies its starting stake by <code>2^(52)</code>. So our portfolio strategy itself always experiences a total aggregate return of <code>$1/(52 choose 26) * 2^(52) ~ $9.08</code> on an initial <code>$1</code> stake. This ending portfolio return is independent of the order of the cards.<br>
The claim to finish the argument is: the new portfolio strategy is in fact identical to the earlier Kelly strategy.<br>
Consider what happens to the portfolio when we draw a red card. In our portfolio strategy a <code>r / (r + b)</code> fraction of the non-bankrupt sub-strategies expect the next card to be “red”, and a <code>b / (r + b)</code> fraction of the non-bankrupt sub-strategies expect the next card to be “black”. The next draw bankrupts one of these families, and doubles the other (depending on the drawn color). Some though shows the portfolio strategy evolves its combined stake as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate <code>stake</code> goes to <code>stake * 2 * b / (r + b)</code> on drawing “red”</li>
<li>Aggregate <code>stake</code> goes to <code>stake * 2 * r / (r + b)</code> on drawing “black.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a matter of algebra to confirm this portfolio payoff is <em>exactly</em> the payoff pattern for our earlier Kelly strategy of putting <code>|r - b| / (r + b)</code> on the most common color remaining. The Kelly strategy has exactly the same payoffs as the portfolio strategy, and we have our result that the two strategies are one and the same.<br>
The Kelly strategy is zero variance because it is identical to the portfolio strategy that is itself zero variance.
</p></div>
<div data-mime-type="text/markdown" tabindex="0">

<p>An idea I like to take away is as follows. As we are betting on majority color, every time we lose a bet the deck becomes more unbalanced and more favorable to us. If we make the bet small enough then the gain in edge on a wrong bet offsets the loss of capital. In this case the Kelly strategy is pricing information or pricing uncertainty just right. This is similar to considerations of “exploration versus exploitation phases” in problems such as A/B testing.<br>
The proof given is from Winkler <em>Mathematical Puzzles</em>. I <em>strongly</em> recommend picking up the book to see his writeup on this and many other problems. The proof itself is very much the style of Cover. This is the Cover who later goes on to invent the <a href="https://isl.stanford.edu/~cover/papers/paper93.pdf">universal portfolio</a> investment strategy.

<p dir="auto">I'm fairly well versed with original XBOX and writing home-brew code for it 20 years ago, but I have since not spent much time on the XBOX 360 or XBOX One platforms beyond tons of gaming and I have always been interrested in how exactly the XBOX 360 security was defeated.</p>
<p dir="auto">So - here is a hopefully informative write up of my Journey to figuring out how these guys were running unsigned code in 2011 on a XBOX 360..   Buckle up.. its a long read :)</p>

<p dir="auto">The Original XBOX was released in 2001 and the security of that system was defeated by hardware reverse engineering fairly soon after launch and folks were able to run Linux on the system.  There mistakes made in the security for the original XBOX, the biggest of them were probably the basic oversights around implementation of weak and outdated security encryption algorithms used as hashing algorithms. The system saw 6 hardware revisions through its short 4 year life span and every single one those included fixes to address security flaws and each of those "fixes" were in turn defeated within weeks of release. Today the original XBOX still is one of my favourite systems and I have quite a few of them squirreled away..</p>

<p dir="auto">This cat and mouse game ended with the XBOX 360 being released in November 2005 and security on this system was priority No.1. The system is pretty solid and secure and I wont go through all the details, but suffice to say that every step of the way during the loading and execution of any code, there are hardware layers to make sure only Microsoft "signed code" can run. but..

<p dir="auto">In late 2011, about six years after the launch of the XBOX 360, a couple of very smart hardware hackers (Gligli and Tiros) managed to defeat the XBOX 360 security by using a hardware "glitching" method and made the XBOX CPU essentially think the code it was executing is pure Microsoft provided "signed" code, when in fact it was tampered with.. i.e. You can run any code you want!! And thus the XBOX 360 RGH (Reset Glitch Hack) exploit was born!</p>

<p dir="auto">Turns out, hardware is pretty susceptible to electrial interference and in specific, digital logic chips like CPU's dont like very noisy or unstable power, data or reset lines..</p>
<p dir="auto">So, you can alter the behaviour of a software system by manually injecting anomalies or errors onto the power, reset and data lines of underlying hardware. These anomalies makes the hardware execute the software instructions in unexpected ways and with a very cleverly crafted "anomaly" you can make hardware do things you want to software.. Like [SPOILER] skip verification checks!!</p>

<p dir="auto">Super High level explanation of XBOX 360 boot process.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The XBOX 360 starts up and starts loading sequences of Boot Loader (BL) code</li>
<li>During this process, it supplies 8-bit "post codes" on an 8-bit bus present on the motherboard</li>
<li>You can read these pins for post codes and each code represents a different step of the boot process.</li>
<li>At post code 0xD8, BL RC4 decryption is done (RC4 Encrypted BL stored on flash chip)</li>
<li>At post code 0xDA, BL SHA1 verification is done (compares hardware embedded signature to loaded code signature)</li>
<li>If signatures match, it is MS signed code and the system continues to start up</li>
<li>If the loaded code signature does not match the hardware embedded signature, the system resets</li>
<li>After a small number of resets and retry loops, the system halts</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The "Glitch"</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Glitching is done by injecting a very short 3-10 nanosecond pulse on CPU RESET line</li>
<li>The Glitch is timed to happen EXACTLY when a "memory compare" function is executing</li>
<li>This <code>memcmp</code> function is inside the SHA1 verification when comparing BL signatures</li>
<li>The glitch will make <code>memcmp</code> return 0x00, meaning a perfect match, regardless of actual data compared</li>
<li>If you can fake-out the CPU into thinking signatures match, you can run ANY code you want..</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Step by step glitching an XBOX 360</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Create a NAND image with custom code and flash to onboard NAND chip</li>
<li>Wait for post code 0xD8 (BL decryption)</li>
<li>Issue a command on the I2C bus to slow down the CPU significantly</li>
<li>Wait for post code 0xDA (BL verification)</li>
<li>Wait EXACTLY until <code>memcmp</code> executes to compare signatures</li>
<li>Send a 3-10ns pulse on CPU RESET line to glitch a 0x00 return from <code>memcmp</code></li>
<li>The system will "think" the signatures match and will continue to run un-trusted code</li>
<li>Issue a command on the I2C bus to speed up the CPU back to normal</li>
<li>Tadaa - you are now running fully un-trusted code!!</li>
<li>The custom NAND image also contains a custom SMC (Systems Management Controller)</li>
<li>If this custom SMC does not detect a success within a specific timeout, it resets and tries again.</li>
<li>The custom SMC will also override the halt and continiously loop and reset until the glitch works.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">I have always been very intrigued at the inner workings of this incredible feat and wanted to duplicate this hardware glitch hack from scratch and really understand how it works. But, one of the barriers of entry was the timings of these attacks. You have to be EXTREMELY precise.. We are talking about TWO HUNDRED MILLIONTH of a second precise! Or more succinctly, you need te able to inject a single 3-10 nano second pulse at a VERY precise time after post code 0xDA shows up on the post bus. It has to align within 3-5 nanoseconds window of the <code>memcmp</code> function execution that verifies the signatures.</p>

<li>The RESET pin toggles LOW/HIGH and after a while a VERY short LOW/HIGH pulse and then cycle repeats</li>
<li>I suspect the first toggle is simply a system reset</li>
<li>the super short less than 10ns pulse is highly likely to be the glitch pulse</li>

<li>There are 20 post bit 1 HIGH/LOW toggles that I counted during RESET LOW period</li>
<li>I refer to these HIGH/LOW rising and falling edges as "post counts", 1 count each per edge</li>
<li>Then there are 10 post counts before the DB2G3 pin goes HIGH</li>
<li>Post count 10 is likely post bus message 0xD8 (BL Decrypt) and DB2G3 HIGH is likely CPU slow down</li>
<li>After 1 more post pin toggle at post count 11 there is the ~5ns pulse on RESET line</li>
<li>It is highly likely that post count 11 is post message 0xDA (SHA signature verify)</li>
<li>The RESET pulse right after post count 11 is likely the <code>memcmp</code> glitch</li>
<li>The DB2G3 line goes HIGH again right after the the glitch pulse, likely indicating CPU speed up</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>The DB2G3 pin on the South Bridge has a single long HIGH/LOW period during a RESET cycle</li>
<li>It is highly likely that this is what controls CPU slow down and speed up</li>
<li>I disconnected this pin and the time between post count 10 and 11 was WAAAAAY less..</li>
<li>This told me that DB2G3 HIGH at post count 10 is for sure CPU slow down and LOW is speed up at count 11</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>The I2C bus has a bunch of traffic, but after a number of RESET cycle captures, I found a pattern!</li>
<li>Right after the DB2G3 line goes HIGH, there is always a <code>0xCD,0x04,0x4E,0x08,0x80,0x03</code> message</li>
<li>Right after the DB2G3 line goes LOW, there is always a  <code>0xCD,0x04,0x4E,0x80,0x0C,0x02</code> message</li>
<li>These two messages are identical except for th last 3 bytes, so they must be related!</li>
<li>more captures by disconnecting the DB2G3 pin had none of these messages</li>
<li>Confirmed DB2G3 HIGH/LOW is for slowdown/speedup and it triggers these I2C messages</li>
<li>So, instead of using the DB2G3 pin, injecting these messages directly on the I2C should have same effect</li>

<li>STEP 4 - After EXACTLY 180,840 nano seconds, send a 10 nanosecond LOW/HIGH pulse on RESET (Glitch!)</li>
<li>STEP 5 - Issue a "speed up" I2C message <code>0xCD,0x04,0x4E,0x80,0x0C,0x02</code> to restore CPU clock</li>
<li>If RESET gets pulled LOW and there are post counts, this means the glitch failed and system reset</li>
<li>If system reset, start over again from Step 1</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I did not want to use the South Bridge GPIO_0 (DB2G3) pin, since I have heard rumours about repurposing the South Bridge output pin as a SMC input pin was not healthy for the South Bridge.. Jury is still out, but I wanted to use the tried and true Gligli method using just the I2C bus.</p>

<p dir="auto">So after reading a book and few tutorials on Verilog, I downloaded the free Xilinx ISE 14.7 IDE and went about implementing the all the code in this repo to perform steps 1 through 5 and all the rest of the logic to auto restart and retry and additionally use I2C based slowdown instead of South Bridge GPIO_0 (DB2G3) "Muffin" style slowdown.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have to say, getting everything to work and fit into a 64 cell CPLD, was REALLY tricky!! Everyone I spoke to told me that it can't be done..  Well.. I finally cracked it and it all fit and seemed to work as planned.</p>
<p dir="auto">I played with the Glitch Timer values and I finally got it to glitch and XELL loaded up!!! HOLY SHIT, IT WORKS!!!! but it was VERY inconsistent.. I could only get it to sucessfully glitch like once or twice after many many many reset cycles..</p>

<p dir="auto">Finally I reached out to some folks on Discord familiar with XBOX 360 RGH (Mena and Octal450) and I learnt that the XBOX 360's standby clock at 48Mhz is waay too slow for consistent glitches. You can process the clock on Dual Edge Triggering (DET) with a Xilinx Coolrunner CPLD, meaning you can process on both rising and falling edges of a clock and in theory the processing happens at 96Mhz, but still even working with ~10 nanosecond periods it seemed too slow.  I saw notes in existing exploit files that it was running at 192Mhz and getting 48Mhz to 192Mhz with this tiny CPLD seemed pretty darn impossible!</p>
<p dir="auto">There are no built-in IP logic on CPLD's to perform frequency multiplication using Phased Lock Loops (PLL) or Digital Clock Managers (DCM's) or other features you typically get for free in FPGA's..  After some serious Google fu and head scratching, I found an archive on Xilinx Forums on a way to DOUBLE the frequency of a digital circuit by phase delaying the signal a little and then XOR'ing an inverse of the delayed signal with the original and boom! you can double the Frequency!</p>

<p dir="auto">I hooked up my Oscilloscope to the board and after some tests involving basic frequency measurements, I confirmed the CPLD was doing exactly what the Xilinx forum suggested.. It delayed the input 48Mhz clock phase by a few degrees, then XOR'ed the Input 48Mhz and delayed 48Mhz clock signals to produce a DOUBLE frequency clock signal at 96Mhz - Then you can do Dual Edge Triggering to process signals at 192Mhz!!!!  Thats pretty crazy to process at 4x the input clock speed without any PLL's or DCM's!!!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Now I could process and produce signals on the CPLD in 5.208333 nanosecond periods - that is a pretty darn accurate clock !!</h3><a id="user-content-now-i-could-process-and-produce-signals-on-the-cpld-in-5208333-nanosecond-periods---that-is-a-pretty-darn-accurate-clock-" aria-label="Permalink: Now I could process and produce signals on the CPLD in 5.208333 nanosecond periods - that is a pretty darn accurate clock !!" href="#now-i-could-process-and-produce-signals-on-the-cpld-in-5208333-nanosecond-periods---that-is-a-pretty-darn-accurate-clock-"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">After these Changes and some more input from Octal450 on glitch timing fine tuning and a suggestion to delay the "slow down" message until 30-50ms after post count 10, I found the magic numbers..  and BOOM!!  I was able to glitch the XBOX 360 pretty much within 1-5 seconds EVERY single time!! using code I created entirely from a Logic Analyzer output !!!</p>

<p dir="auto">This was a WILD ride! I learnt so much during the process about hardware glitching and how powerful of a tool such a teeny tiny little anomaly at the right time could be!</p>
<p dir="auto">I am still AMAZED at the people who researched this hack 10 years ago and found all the puzzle pieces to pull it off..  This is a very advanced hack and to get to to work so well and so consistently is pretty darn incredible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>Over the last couple years, my programming brain has become increasingly warped around types, functional programming principles &amp; Typescript. Most of it is influenced by the inordinate amount of time I’ve spent working on the Heartbeat codebase, a 300k+ line Typescript full-stack application that includes a React web app, a React Native mobile app and a Node.js server. My experience in this codebase has shown me that the more I lean into relying on the type system, the more I benefit.</p>
<p>Writing code in a codebase that has fully bought into types feels like cheating. I can often implement 80% of a new feature without ever running the code. I’ll start working on a large refactor that requires breaking an assumption made throughout the code &amp; quickly discover that the type system makes the change trivial. Simple features practically code themselves because typos are caught instantly and half my code is autocompleted. Nuanced questions from the support team about how a certain feature works can be answered with a quick Ctrl+F in the code even when little written documentation exists. Entire <em>categories</em> of bugs that I used to deal with have vanished.</p>
<p>I’ve come to think of the style of coding that enables this as Type Driven Development. Below is a loose collection of thoughts &amp; links to resources that have heavily influenced what type driven development means to me.</p>
<h3 id="1-let-the-types-flow">1) Let the types flow</h3>
<p>Investing in type safety is much more effective when types are able to flow across every surface of our application. In a simple full-stack application, the data flow typically looks like: database -&gt; server -&gt; client. Changing our database schema should cause us to see errors in our frontend code. By achieving this level of type interconnectedness, we can make changes to one side of our codebase and feel confident that the type system will inform us about the implications of that change, even if those implications are happening on a completely different side of the codebase.</p>
<p>Enabling our types to flow through the system usually means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the same language everywhere. Naturally, if we want to share type information as much as possible, we need to be using the same language. While not perfect, React Native and Node.Js are powerful for allowing us to use Typescript on mobile &amp; server-side.</li>
<li>Making sure that type information is properly preserved across network boundaries. Using a well-typed ORM such as Prisma or Drizzle. Using a typed framework for API calls such as tRPC.</li>
<li>Using a monorepo. We want changes in one part of the system to alert us about changes that need to made in other parts of the system, which doesn’t work when those other parts are in a different repo.</li>
<li>Using <code>any</code> very rarely. Nothing breaks the flow of types more than <code>any</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This can often times be the hard part. Letting the types flow entails doing a lot of work architecting the system in a way that allows for a completely closed loop. At Heartbeat, we’ve gone to <a href="https://mayhul.com/posts/hacking-prisma" rel="nofollow, noopener, noreferrer" target="_blank">extensive lengths</a> to make this flow as robust as possible. And sometimes doing this work can feel pointless because I’m knee-deep in arcane Typescript errors instead of working on a new feature. But for any codebase that’s going to be sticking around for a while, setting up good base-level infrastructure is invaluable.</p>
<h3 id="2-start-with-the-types">2) Start with the types</h3>
<p>Given that types act as a glue that tie the system together, the natural starting place for any new feature is the type definitions. The first thing I do when implementing a new feature is map out what are all the entities involved, what is their relationship, what properties do they have and how should they be represented as a type.</p>
<p>This video is a great example of this concept: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JB1_e5wZmU" rel="nofollow, noopener, noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JB1_e5wZmU</a></p>
<p>Some key takeaways from the video:</p>
<p>a) type definitions are a great way to make sure that my understanding of the domain is aligned with reality. The process of writing these type definitions forces me to map out &amp; wrangle the different components of the project in a comprehensive way. Usually this process results in me discovering gaps or ambiguities in the feature spec that I can then hash with the rest of the team. Often times, these gaps/ambiguities are things that would otherwise go undiscovered until I’m halfway through the project. At which point resolving them might involve throwing away most of the work I’ve already done. Type driven development brings these questions up to the beginning of the process, gets them answered, and serves as a blueprint for the rest of the project.</p>
<p>b) type definitions are human-readable. They’re a great way for someone new (or me in the future) to get a high level understanding of how a feature is structured without having to dive into any actual code tracing.</p>
<p>c) type definitions are both a documentation of the domain model AND real code that is directly used by our implementation. They are a living document that is <em>guaranteed</em> to be an accurate reflection of the codebase.</p>
<p>d) an entity’s conceptual idea is more important than its representation. For example, an email address and a customer id are both <em>represented</em> by strings, but conceptually they are independent things and should not be considered the same type. This distinction should be reflected in our types.</p>
<h3 id="3-make-illegal-states-unrepresentable">3) Make illegal states unrepresentable</h3>
<p>Another key takeaway from the video that deserves it’s own section. Making our types reflect the true nature of the data as closely as possible makes it almost impossible to mess up. Some concrete examples of what this can look like in Typescript:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have <code>Product</code> entity. Every product must have at least one price associated with it:</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span></span>
<span><span>type</span><span> NonEmptyArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt; </span><span>=</span><span> [</span><span>T</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>T</span><span>[]];</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>type</span><span> Price</span><span> =</span><span> //something</span></span>
<span></span>

<span></span>
<span><span>//If I try to create a product with no prices, I get a type error</span></span>
<span><span>createProduct</span><span>({</span></span>
<span><span>	prices</span><span>:</span><span> [],</span></span>
<span><span>})</span></span></code></pre>

<span><span>	},</span></span>
<span><span>	//...</span></span>
<span><span>});</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Structuring our types in this way removes a complete category of bugs from ever occurring. Every single state that we make illegal via our type system was a bug waiting to happen in an alternate universe. Additionally, the <em>process</em> of making illegal states unrepresentable is valuable too. Making our types represent the “truth” as closely as possible forces us to ask a lot of questions about what the truth is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there cases where it makes sense for a product to have no prices?</li>
<li>How many possible states are there? Are state X and Y actually different, or are they essentially the same thing?</li>
</ul>
<p>And those questions are vital to understanding the full expanse of the problem we’re trying to solve.</p>
<h3 id="4-parse-dont-validate">4) Parse, don’t validate</h3>
<p>Reading this article crystalized so many loose thoughts that I had into a clean slogan: <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/" rel="nofollow, noopener, noreferrer" target="_blank">https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/</a>.</p>
<p>The key insight of the article is that types can be interpreted as a vehicle to “store” validation. Having validation work encoded in our types means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the rest of our code is allowed to make assumptions about data without having to constantly validate those assumptions</li>
<li>the type system enforces that validation happens when needed</li>
<li>changing these assumptions is much easier. We can change the types to reflect a new assumption &amp; the type system will point us to the implications of this change</li>
</ul>
<p>(The only reason this section is so short is that the article explains things perfectly. Definitely go read it!)</p>
<h3 id="5-be-honest">5) Be honest</h3>
<p>In many ways, I’ve come to think of programming as <em>finding the truth</em>. The goal is to find the purest, rawest, deepest essence of what an entity represents and express that as a type. And if my goal is truth, then I need to value <em>being honest</em> in my code. This can manifest itself via “make illegal states unrepresentable” — I don’t want to <em>lie</em> and say that something is possible when it isn’t. Or, if I dive down and discover that two things I thought were the same are actually different, I shouldn’t <em>lie</em> and refer to them with the same type. I should do the extra work to split them into different types because that would be a more <em>honest</em> representation of the truth.</p>
<p>To contrast that grandiose description, here’s a mundane example. We have a calendar app where users can create events &amp; see a list of their events:</p>

<p>We decide to add a new feature. Users can now create recurring events! Users define a recurring event using a <a href="https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-8-5-3-recurrence-rule.html" rel="nofollow, noopener, noreferrer" target="_blank">recurrence rule</a>, which specifies when &amp; how often the event repeats. We want our event list to show all instances of upcoming recurring events. To do this we create a <code>getExpandedEvent</code> function which takes in an event. If the event is recurring, the event gets expanded to include all of the instances. Otherwise we return the single event. Once we create this function, all we need to do is call it in our <code>EventList</code> component and then we can continue as usual.</p>

<p>Seems pretty straightforward, so we go ahead and ship it. Soon, the customer bug reports come in: “I was trying to delete the May instance of my monthly event, but the whole thing disappeared!?!?!” As you may have noticed, the issue with this implementation is that clicking delete on an instance of a recurring event will delete the entire event. Probably not the behavior that we want. There’s a couple things that went wrong to get here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whoever was speccing the delete event feature should have called out how it should work for non-recurring vs recurring events</li>
<li>We probably would have realized this was weird if we had more tests or QA before releasing</li>
</ul>
<p>And while those might be true, I’d argue that one of the underlying reasons we got here was because we weren’t fully honest when we implemented the <code>getExpandedEvent</code> function. At the time, it was convenient to continue using the <code>Event</code> type. All we needed to do is call the function and everything else would remain the same. But if we were honest, we would have recognized that while very similar, events &amp; event instances are different concepts.</p>
<p>An <code>Event</code> is the core object that gets stored in the database. When someone creates a recurring event - say a meeting every Monday for a year - we don’t store 52 different events in the database. Instead, we store a single <code>Event</code> with a recurrence rule. Then, whenever someone needs to see their upcoming events, we use that rule to generate the appropriate <code>EventInstance</code>s, each representing one occurrence of the meeting. Events are stored in the database, while event instances are ephemeral. Events can be created, while event instances cannot. Editing an <code>Event</code> (changing the meeting from Mondays at 2pm to Mondays at 3pm) is a completely different action from editing an <code>EventInstance</code> (rescheduling just one specific Monday’s meeting to Tuesday). A more honest representation might look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>type</span><span> EventInstance</span><span> =</span><span> Omit</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Event</span><span>, </span><span>"</span><span>id</span><span>"</span><span>&gt; </span><span>&amp;</span><span> {</span></span>

<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The exact implementation of <code>EventInstance</code> would vary depending on what behavior we wanted. But the key point is differentiating event instances from events. If we had done this we never would have ran into the deletion issue because it would be clear that the <code>deleteEvent</code> endpoint is not applicable to event instances. In fact, going back to <em>Start with the types</em>, the <code>EventInstance</code> type in our codebase likely would have made us realize during the feature speccing phase that we needed to handle deleting events and deleting event instances separately.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see why we wouldn’t want to make this change. It’s more work for no immediate payoff. Adding the new type requires changing <code>EventListItem</code> as well. In a larger project, the new type might require even more refactoring across the codebase. But by being lazy the first time, we introduced a subtle lie into our type system that corrupted it, causing it to deviate slightly from being a true representation of the underlying domain. This prevented the types from helping us when we needed them later.</p>
<h3 id="6-be-specific">6) Be specific</h3>
<p>A companion to being honest is being specific. We don’t want to lie by omission. So as much as possible, we want our types to be the narrowest possible expression of the truth.</p>
<p><a href="https://egghead.io/blog/using-branded-types-in-typescript" rel="nofollow, noopener, noreferrer" target="_blank">Branded types</a> are a great example of this. We <em>could</em> use a <code>string</code> to represent the id of a user and it would be an honest representation. But by using a branded <code>UserID</code> type instead, we can be even more specific about what a user id truly represents. And the more specific we are, the more the type checker is able to help us out:</p>

<p>Once you start to see everything in your codebase through the lens of types, any action a user takes can be reduced down to a series of type jumps. Define the starting types. Define the ending type. Find a way to go from the starting types to the ending type. What’s the best way to convert one type to another with no distractions? <strong>A pure function</strong>. That’s quite literally what the mathematical definition of a function is.</p>
<p>Let’s say that we’re implementing a payment page. Our domain looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>type</span><span> Price</span><span> =</span><span> {</span></span>

<span><span>	subscriptions</span><span>:</span><span> Subscription</span><span>[];</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Our payment page has 3 different possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user has not purchased the product yet, in which they can choose a price point &amp; make the purchase</li>
<li>The user is currently subscribed, in which case we show a Cancel Subscription button. When the user clicks on this button:
<ul>
<li>If they’ve been a subscriber for more than 12 months, offer them a 1% discount for each month they’ve been a subscriber (capped at 50%)</li>
<li>Otherwise, offer them a flat $5 discount</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The user has canceled their subscription, in which case we prompt them to restart their subscription</li>
</ol>
<p>Representing this as a type, we get:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>type</span><span> Discount</span><span> =</span></span>

<p>A user visits the payment page for a particular product. We need to render the page. How do we do this? Well, given that we have these types established, the task at hand is clear. We need to convert a <code>Product</code> and a <code>User</code> into a <code>CheckoutPageState</code>. If the user has an active subscription, we need to convert a <code>Subscription</code> to a <code>Discount</code>. So…we write two pure functions to do the conversion &amp; we’re done.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you can imagine how this small example could expand to a production application with dozens of types &amp; hundreds of business logic rules encoded in a network of pure functions. The magic of pure functions is that they turn something intimidating into something approachable. We could have the gnarliest, most complicated domain with tons of intersecting edge cases and unintuitive logic. But if we’ve broken it down into the constituent types, then at any given moment all I need to worry about is converting <code>IntermediateType5</code> to <code>IntermediateType6</code>. I don’t need to think about anything else. That level of clarity &amp; focus does wonders for easing my mental burden while working on large project.</p>
<p>For a full-stack application, the pattern is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define types for my core entities, the ones that get stored in the database (<code>Product</code>, <code>Price</code>, <code>User</code>, <code>Subscription</code>)</li>
<li>Define my intermediate types (<code>Discount</code>, <code>CheckoutPageState</code>)</li>
<li>Fetch the relevant core entities from the database</li>
<li>Run my entities through a series of pure functions, jumping from type to type, until I have a UI to show</li>
</ol>
<p>Even React, the final piece of the puzzle in this example, is built on functional programming principles. Our <code>CheckoutPage</code> React component is one last pure function that converts the <code>CheckoutPageState</code> type to JSX that gets rendered on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="8-ask-and-you-shall-receive">8) Ask and you shall receive</h3>
<p>One of the most common changes required by a new feature is something that used to be simple gets just <em>slightly</em> more nuanced. Before the feature, we call a function and it does the thing. But now, that function needs a little bit more context. And based on that context, it does something a little bit different. For example, let’s say we have a <code>generateInvoice</code> function that takes in various values and uses them to generate an <code>Invoice</code> object. The details of the function itself are irrelevant.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>function</span><span> generateInvoice</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>:</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>	customerId</span><span>:</span><span> string</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>	currency</span><span>:</span><span> string</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>	items</span><span>:</span><span> InvoiceItem</span><span>[];</span></span>
<span><span>	//...</span></span>
<span><span>})</span><span>:</span><span> Invoice</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>	//Generate the invoice</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>But now the time has finally come for us to stop ignoring the IRS’ emails and start properly collecting tax from our users. To do so, our invoices will need to look different depending on what the tax rate is.</p>
<p>With types, my approach for a change like this is straightforward. I go to the function that needs the additional context and I edit the input type to include the new context that I need. And then I see what type errors I get. If the function that’s calling <code>generateInvoice</code> doesn’t know what the <code>taxRate</code> should be, then I add <code>taxRate</code> to the input for that function and continue up the call stack. Eventually, I reach a function that is able to either pull the necessary context from a stateful source (a database, endpoint, etc) OR I’m able to calculate the necessary value and pass it in.</p>
<p>So in this case, let’s say I add the <code>taxRate</code> field to <code>params</code> and see the following two errors:</p>
<ol>
<li>One that’s happening on the backend when we call <code>generateInvoice</code> from <code>generateInvoiceForCustomer</code>. To fix it, I call <code>calculateTaxRateForCustomer</code> inside <code>generateInvoiceForCustomer</code> and pass the result of that function into <code>generateInvoice</code>.</li>
<li>One that’s happening on the frontend when we call <code>generateInvoice</code> from <code>previewInvoice</code>. In this case, we’re generating a preview invoice for a sample customer, so there’s no tax rate to be calculated. Instead, I just pass in a static value of <code>0.1</code> to use as the example tax rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach saves a lot of time and headache. In a larger application, it’s possible that <code>generateInvoice</code> is being called from 7 different contexts. Rather than proactively trying to map out all of these different cases, I just tell the type system that I need a certain value and let it guide to me where I need to go next.</p>
<h3 id="9-if-it-compiles-it-works">9) If it compiles, it works</h3>
<p>Haskell developers have a refrain that if the code compiles, it probably works. While Haskell is on the extreme side of the spectrum, I’ve found this to also be quite true for any system that relies heavily on types. Having types embedded in our codebase means the feedback loop for our code comes directly from the editor &amp; type errors. I don’t need to run the code to see if I messed up, because my editor lets me know as I type.</p>
<p>There’s an inverse relationship between the expressiveness of the types and the number of possible programs that type check successfully. So when our types are honest &amp; specific, it can be hard to write code that type checks <em>without</em> doing what we want it do.</p>
<p>The best example of this is how productive I’ve become on airplanes. Despite being a full-stack application that needs Internet to run locally, I can get on a flight with no wifi, pull out my laptop &amp; implement a new Heartbeat feature with zero distractions — just me and my type checker. When I eventually land and run the code, I’m usually good to go after some UI work &amp; maybe 2-3 quick bug fixes.</p>

<p>One of the most underrated aspects of Typescript is how it can be used as a tool to understand your codebase. If I’m trying to understand how a certain feature works, I can play around with the types to help me learn about how parts of that feature interact with the rest of the codebase.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say I’m working on an update where I want to standardize how we can display prices in the product. Right now the only currency that we support is USD, and all of our prices are displayed like this: $100.00. But we’re getting some confusion from people in Canada about whether we’re referring to USD or CAD, so we want to update the UI to clarify that we mean USD. We show prices on a lot of different components in various contexts, so tracking down everything will be difficult.</p>
<p>What can I do is temporarily delete the <code>amount</code> field from the <code>Price</code> type:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>type</span><span> Price</span><span> =</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>	id</span><span>:</span><span> PriceId</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>	interval</span><span>:</span><span> "</span><span>month</span><span>"</span><span> |</span><span> "</span><span>year</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now, anywhere that I attempt to reference the <code>amount</code> field, I’ll get a type error instead. So if I have 10 different components that display a price in some way, Typescript will point me towards each of those components. I can go to each of them, make the changes I need to and undo the change I made to the type.</p>
<p>Or, let’s say we have a <code>Button</code> component in our design system and we’re considering getting rid of the <code>success</code> variant because it feels unnecessary. To help us make the decision, we want to identify all the screens in our product where we use a <code>success</code> button.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>interface</span><span> Props</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>	//...</span></span>
<span><span>	variant</span><span>?:</span><span> "</span><span>primary</span><span>"</span><span> |</span><span> "</span><span>secondary</span><span>"</span><span> |</span><span> "</span><span>success</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>	//...</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> Button</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>:</span><span> Props</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>	//button</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I <em>could</em> do a Ctrl-F for <code>success</code> and try to find examples that way — but predictably it will lead to lots of unrelated results popping up. My approach in these situations is to just delete <code>success</code> as one of the options in <code>Props</code>. By doing this, I’ll immediately get type errors that point me to the exact location of every success button in the product. From there, I can click through the results and evaluate whether the <code>success</code> button is necessary or if it can be replaced with an alternative. The ability to quickly answer questions like “Where does every success button in our product live?” means that I can even use the codebase as a tool in design/product planning meetings.</p>
<h3 id="11-hard-mode-and-easy-mode">11) Hard mode and easy mode</h3>
<p>Using types extensively splits coding into 2 phases. A short period of intense &amp; difficult work followed by a longer period of straightforward work that’s hard to mess up.</p>
<p>The hard part is setting up the scaffolding &amp; defining the types. In Typescript, scaffolding can involve delving into arcane type-level programming or setting up complex frameworks to make sure that types are propagated robustly. As we’ve talked about above, defining types involves deep rumination to figure out what states are valid, how to be honest, where to draw the line between entities, etc. Figuring all of this out can be intimidating and cumbersome.</p>
<p>But, the hard work pays off because coding with types on is astoundingly EASY. The editor is constantly guiding me down the right path. Typos, misused variables, forgotten validation checks are all caught instantly. Autocomplete means I don’t even need to type that much. In the age of AI code completion, type definitions provide a valuable source of documentation to help the AI provide more accurate suggestions. And the type checker makes it harder for invalid AI-suggested code to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>This dichotomy gels really well with the way my brain works. I’m able to channel short bursts of creative energy into precisely mapping the domain or getting type scaffolding set up. And then I’m able to sustain long coding sessions to actually implement the feature because the scaffolding means I rarely have to think too hard.</p>
<h3 id="12-know-when-to-opt-out">12) Know when to opt out</h3>
<p>This one might be controversial for some — but I really like that Typescript allows us to cheat every now and then. Knowing when it’s ok to throw our hands up and use an <code>any</code> is important. If we’re thoughtful, we can maintain 99.9% of the benefits of the type system without wasting days trying to cover the last 0.1%.</p>
<p>Typically using <code>any</code> or type assertions such as <code>as string</code> are a bad idea because they’re a form of lying to the type system. But in situations where we genuinely know better than the type system and the scope of the assertion is small, a small lie is acceptable. A common time where we might know better than the type system is when dealing with external dependencies or legacy code. For example, this is the helper function we use for getting feature flags from Posthog:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>export</span><span> const</span><span> POSTHOG_FLAGS </span><span>=</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>	"</span><span>longer-free-trial</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span> [</span><span>"</span><span>control</span><span>"</span><span>, </span><span>"</span><span>30-days</span><span>"</span><span>],</span></span>
<span><span>	"</span><span>checkout-page-design</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span> [</span><span>"</span><span>control</span><span>"</span><span>, </span><span>"</span><span>variant-a</span><span>"</span><span>, </span><span>"</span><span>variant-b</span><span>"</span><span>],</span></span>
<span><span>} </span><span>as</span><span> const</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> type</span><span> PosthogFlag</span><span> =</span><span> keyof</span><span> typeof</span><span> POSTHOG_FLAGS;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> async</span><span> function</span><span> getPosthogFlagVariant</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span> extends</span><span> PosthogFlag</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>userID</span><span>:</span><span> UserID</span><span>, </span><span>flagName</span><span>:</span><span> T</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>	const</span><span> variant </span><span>=</span><span> await</span><span> posthog.</span><span>getFeatureFlag</span><span>(flagName, userID);</span></span>
<span><span>	return</span><span> variant </span><span>as</span><span> (</span><span>typeof</span><span> POSTHOG_FLAGS)[</span><span>T</span><span>][</span><span>number</span><span>] </span><span>|</span><span> undefined</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The default return type for <code>posthog.getFeatureFlag</code> is <code>string | boolean | undefined</code>. But we have more precise knowledge. If we’re getting a value for <code>longer-free-trial</code> then the return type must be either <code>control</code> or <code>30-days</code>. So we can use the type assertion to assert our knowledge onto Typescript. And by doing so, anyone calling the <code>getPosthogFlagVariant</code> will have much more accurate &amp; specific types. Because <code>POSTHOG_FLAGS</code> is edited in a very controlled context (only when we’re adding or changing a feature flag), we can feel confident that unrelated changes to the codebase are unlikely to cause this lie to backfire.</p>
<p><em>Make illegal states unrepresentable</em> is another rule that’s helpful to know when to break. There are times when the work it would take to make an illegal state fully unrepresentable is just not worth it. And if I know that changes to what a legal state is are possible in the future, I might not want to cut off all our options too forcefully. Building an intuition for when to leave the door open is difficult and mostly comes from experience. A great example of this is <a href="https://www.swyx.io/preemptive-pluralization" rel="nofollow, noopener, noreferrer" target="_blank">preemptive pluralization</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s important to remember that all of these rules are in place to help us be more productive. We’re here to use the tool, not let the tool use us.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Everything is editable in place, all changes are saved automatically and last 50 revisions are kept for undo/redo:</p>

<p dir="auto">Nullboard is something that handles ToDo lists in the way that works really well. For <em>me</em> that is.</p>
<p dir="auto">Tried a lot of options, some were almost <em>it</em>, but none was 100%.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Trello</strong> wasn't bad, but never was comfortable with the idea of storing my data in cloud without any actual need.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wekan</strong> looked promising, but ultimately too heavy and had no offline usage support or a local storage option.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Things</strong> was beautiful, but not the right tool for the job.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Inkscape</strong> - I kid you not - with a laundry list of text items was actually OK, but didn't scale well.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ditto for the plain <strong>text files</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Pieces of <strong>paper</strong> were almost there, but rearranging items can be quite a hassle.</p>
