<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p><span>O</span>ne afternoon in January 2011, <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~hussein.mourtada/">Hussein Mourtada</a> leapt onto his desk and started dancing. He wasn’t alone: Some of the graduate students who shared his Paris office were there, too. But he didn’t care. The mathematician realized that he could finally confirm a sneaking suspicion he’d first had while writing his doctoral dissertation, which he’d finished a few months earlier. He’d been studying special points, called singularities, where curves cross themselves or come to sharp turns. Now he had unexpectedly found what he’d been looking for, a way to prove that these singularities had a surprisingly deep underlying structure. Hidden within that structure were mysterious mathematical statements first written down a century earlier by a young Indian mathematician named Srinivasa Ramanujan. They had come to him in a dream.</p>
<p>Ramanujan brings life to the myth of the self-taught genius. He grew up poor and uneducated and did much of his research while isolated in southern India, barely able to afford food. In 1912, when he was 24, he began to send a series of letters to prominent mathematicians. These were mostly ignored, but one recipient, the English mathematician G.H. Hardy, corresponded with Ramanujan for a year and eventually persuaded him to come to England, smoothing the way with the colonial bureaucracies.</p>
<p>It became apparent to Hardy and his colleagues that Ramanujan could sense mathematical truths — could access entire worlds — that others simply could not. (Hardy, a mathematical giant in his own right, is said to have quipped that his greatest contribution to mathematics was the discovery of Ramanujan.) Before Ramanujan died in 1920 at the age of 32, he came up with thousands of elegant and surprising results, often without proof. He was fond of saying that his equations had been bestowed on him by the gods.</p>
<p>More than 100 years later, mathematicians are still trying to catch up to Ramanujan’s divine genius, as his visions appear again and again in disparate corners of the world of mathematics.</p>

<p>Ramanujan is perhaps most famous for coming up with partition identities, equations about the different ways you can break a whole number up into smaller parts (such as 7 = 5 + 1 + 1). In the 1980s, mathematicians began to find deep and surprising connections between these equations and other areas of mathematics: in statistical mechanics and the study of phase transitions, in knot theory and string theory, in number theory and representation theory and the study of symmetries.</p>
<p>Most recently, they’ve appeared in Mourtada’s work on curves and surfaces that are defined by algebraic equations, an area of study called algebraic geometry. Mourtada and his collaborators have spent more than a decade trying to better understand that link, and to exploit it to uncover rafts of brand-new identities that resemble those Ramanujan wrote down.</p>
<p>“It turned out that these kinds of results have basically occurred in almost every branch of mathematics. That’s an amazing thing,” said <a href="https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/OleWarnaar/">Ole Warnaar</a> of the University of Queensland in Australia. “It’s not just a happy coincidence. I don’t want to sound religious, but the mathematical god is trying to tell us something.”</p>
<h2><strong>New Worlds </strong></h2>
<p>Ramanujan’s mathematical prowess was obvious to those who knew him. Without formal training, he excelled; by the time he was in high school he had devoured advanced, though often outdated, textbooks, and was doing independent research on different kinds of numerical properties and patterns.</p>
<p>In 1904, he was granted a full scholarship to the Government Arts College in Kumbakonam, the small city where he had grown up, in what is now the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. But he ignored all subjects besides math and lost his scholarship within a year. He later enrolled in another university, this time in Madras (now Chennai), the provincial capital some 250 kilometers north. Again he flunked out.</p>

<p>He continued his research on his own for years, often while in poor health. During that time, he tutored students in math to support himself. Eventually he secured a job as a clerk at the Madras Port Trust in 1912. He pursued mathematics on the side and published some of his results in Indian journals.</p>
<p>Hoping to get some of his work into more prestigious and widely read publications, Ramanujan wrote letters to several British mathematicians, enclosing pages of findings for their review. “I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a university course,” he wrote, “but I am striking out a new path for myself.” Among the recipients was Hardy, an expert in number theory and analysis at the University of Cambridge.</p>

                            <p>Ramanujan’s first letter to G.H. Hardy included formulas (5), (6) and (7), strange nested fractions that Hardy said “defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before.”</p>

<p>Hardy was shocked at what he saw. Ramanujan had identified and then solved a number of continued fractions — expressions that can be written as infinite nests of fractions within fractions, such as:</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ramanujan_Equation.svg" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy">    </p>
    </figure>

<p>They “defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before,” Hardy later wrote. “They must be true because, if they were not true, no one would have had the imagination to invent them.” The formulas, unproved, were so striking that they inspired Hardy to offer Ramanujan a fellowship at Cambridge. In 1914, Ramanujan arrived in England, and for the next five years he studied and collaborated with Hardy.</p>

<p>One of Ramanujan’s first tasks was to prove a general statement about his continued fractions. To do so, he needed to prove two other statements. But he couldn’t. Neither could Hardy, nor could any of the colleagues he reached out to.</p>
<p>It turned out that they didn’t need to. The statements had been proved 20 years earlier by a little-known English mathematician named L.J. Rogers. Rogers wrote poorly, and at the time the proofs were published no one paid any attention. (Rogers was content to do his research in relative obscurity, play piano, garden and apply his spare time to a variety of other pursuits.) Ramanujan uncovered this work in 1917, and the pair of statements later became known as the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.</p>
<p>Amid Ramanujan’s prodigious output, these statements stand out. They have carried through the decades and across nearly all of mathematics. They are the seeds that mathematicians continue to sow, growing brilliant new gardens seemingly wherever they fall.</p>
<p>Ramanujan fell ill and returned to India in 1919, where he died the next year. It would fall to others to explore the world his identities had revealed.</p>
<h2><strong>The Music of the Game</strong></h2>
<p>Hussein Mourtada grew up in the 1980s in Lebanon, in a small city called Baalbek. As a teenager, he didn’t like studying and preferred to play: soccer, billiards, basketball. Math, too. “It looked like a game,” he said. “And I liked playing.”</p>
<p>As an undergraduate at the Lebanese University in Beirut, he studied both law and mathematics, with an eye to a legal career. But he soon found that while he enjoyed the philosophical aspects of law, he did not enjoy it in practice. He turned his attention to math, where he was particularly drawn to the community. As a child, his teachers and classmates were what excited him about going to school, even though he often fell asleep during class. As a budding mathematician, “I had the impression that these are beautiful people,” he said. “They are honest. You need to be honest with yourself to be a mathematician. Otherwise, it doesn’t work.”</p>

<p>He moved to France for his doctorate and started to focus on algebraic geometry — the study of algebraic varieties, or shapes cut out by polynomial equations. These are equations that can be written as sums of variables raised to whole-number powers. A line, for instance, is cut out by the equation <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> = 0, a circle by <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = 1, a figure eight by <em>x</em><sup>4</sup> = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>. While the line and circle are completely smooth, the figure eight has a point where it intersects itself — a singularity.</p>
<p>It’s easy to spot singularities when you’re dealing with shapes that you can draw on a sheet of paper. But higher-dimensional algebraic varieties are far more complicated and impossible to visualize. Algebraic geometers are in the business of understanding their singularities, too.</p>
<p>They’ve developed all sorts of tools to do this. One dates back to the mathematician John Nash, who in the 1960s started studying related objects called arc spaces. Nash would take a point, or singularity, and define infinitely many short trajectories — little arcs — that passed through it. By looking at all these short trajectories together, he could test how smooth his variety was at that point. “If you want to see if it’s smooth, you want to pet it,” said <a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Gleb.POGUDIN/">Gleb Pogudin</a> of the École Polytechnique in France.</p>
<p>In practical terms, an arc space provides an infinite collection of polynomial equations. “This is really the thing that Mourtada is expert in: understanding the meaning of those equations,” said <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~bernard.teissier/">Bernard Teissier</a>, a colleague of Mourtada’s at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris. “Because these equations can be very complicated. But they have a certain music to them. There is a lot of structure which governs the nature of these equations, and he’s just the person, I think, who best listens to this music and understands what it means.”</p>

<p>T-Mobile and AT&amp;T say US regulators should drop a plan to require unlocking of phones within 60 days of activation, claiming that locking phones to a carrier's network makes it possible to provide cheaper handsets to consumers. "If the Commission mandates a uniform unlocking policy, it is consumers—not providers—who stand to lose the most," T-Mobile alleged in an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1017178290200/1">October 17 filing</a> with the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p>The proposed rule has support from consumer advocacy groups who say it will give users more choice and lower their costs. T-Mobile has been criticized for locking phones for up to a year, which makes it impossible to use a phone on a rival's network. T-Mobile claims that with a 60-day unlocking rule, "consumers risk losing access to the benefits of free or heavily subsidized handsets because the proposal would force providers to reduce the line-up of their most compelling handset offers."</p>
<p>If the proposed rule is enacted, "T-Mobile estimates that its prepaid customers, for example, would see subsidies reduced by 40 percent to 70 percent for both its lower and higher-end devices, such as the Moto G, Samsung A15, and iPhone 12," the carrier said. "A handset unlocking mandate would also leave providers little choice but to limit their handset offers to lower cost and often lesser performing handsets."</p>
<p>T-Mobile and other carriers are responding to a call for public comments that began after the FCC approved a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-77A1.pdf">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</a> (NPRM) in a 5–0 vote. The FCC is proposing "to require all mobile wireless service providers to unlock handsets 60 days after a consumer's handset is activated with the provider, unless within the 60-day period the service provider determines the handset was purchased through fraud."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>When the FCC proposed the 60-day unlocking rule in July 2024, the agency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/fcc-blasts-t-mobiles-365-day-phone-locking-proposes-60-day-unlock-rule/">criticized T-Mobile</a> for locking prepaid phones for a year. The NPRM pointed out that "T-Mobile recently increased its locking period for one of its brands, Metro by T-Mobile, from 180 days to 365 days."</p>
<p>T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/policies/sim-unlock-policy">policy</a> says the carrier will only unlock mobile devices on prepaid plans if "at least 365 days... have passed since the device was activated on the T-Mobile network."</p>
<p>"You bought your phone, you should be able to take it to any provider you want," FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said when the FCC proposed the rule. "Some providers already operate this way. Others do not. In fact, some have recently increased the time their customers must wait until they can unlock their device by as much as 100 percent."</p>
<h2>T-Mobile locking policy more onerous</h2>
<p>T-Mobile executives, who also argue that the FCC lacks authority to impose the proposed rule, met with FCC officials last week to express their concerns.</p>
<p>"T-Mobile is passionate about winning customers for life, and explained how its handset unlocking policies greatly benefit our customers," the carrier said in its post-meeting filing. "Our policies allow us to deliver access to high-speed mobile broadband on a nationwide 5G network <em>via handsets that are free or heavily discounted</em> off the manufacturer's suggested retail price. T-Mobile's unlocking policies are transparent, and there is absolutely no evidence of consumer harm stemming from these policies. T-Mobile's current unlocking policies also help T-Mobile combat handset theft and fraud by sophisticated, international criminal organizations."</p>
<p>For postpaid users, T-Mobile says it allows unlocking of fully paid-off phones that have been active for at least 40 days. But given the 365-day lock on prepaid users, T-Mobile's overall policy is more onerous than those of other carriers. T-Mobile has also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/t-mobile-users-enraged-as-un-carrier-breaks-promise-to-never-raise-prices/">faced angry customers</a> because of a recent decision to raise prices on plans that were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/t-mobile-users-thought-they-had-a-lifetime-price-lock-guess-what-happened-next/">advertised as having a lifetime price lock</a>.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1262649/">enables unlocking</a> of paid-off phones after 60 days for postpaid users and after six months for prepaid users. AT&amp;T lodged similar complaints as T-Mobile, saying in an October 7 <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1008217166272/1">filing</a> that the FCC's proposed rules would "mak[e] handsets less affordable for consumers, especially those in low-income households," and "exacerbate handset arbitrage, fraud, and trafficking. "</p>
<p>AT&amp;T told the FCC that "requiring providers to unlock handsets before they are paid-off would ultimately harm consumers by creating upward pressure on handset prices and disincentives to finance handsets on flexible terms." If the FCC implements any rules, it should maintain "existing contractual arrangements between customers and providers, ensure that providers have at least 180 days to detect fraud before unlocking a device, and include at least a 24-month period for providers to implement any new rules," AT&amp;T said.</p>
<p>Verizon, which already faces unlocking rules because of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/wireless-net-neutrality-puts-verizon-and-rivals-on-equal-footing/">requirements imposed on spectrum licenses</a> it owns, automatically <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy">unlocks</a> phones after 60 days for prepaid and postpaid users. Among the three major carriers, Verizon is the most amenable to the FCC's new rules.</p>

<h2>Consumer groups: Make Verizon rules industry-wide</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1018046516995/1">October 18 filing</a> supporting a strict unlocking rule was submitted by numerous consumer advocacy groups including Public Knowledge, New America's Open Technology Institute, Consumer Reports, the National Consumers League, the National Consumer Law Center, and the National Digital Inclusion Alliance.</p>
<p>"Wireless users are subject to unnecessary restrictions in the form of locked devices, which tie them to their service providers even when better options may be available. Handset locking practices limit consumer freedom and lessen competition by creating an artificial technological barrier to switching providers," the groups said.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>The groups cited the Verizon rules as a model and urged the FCC to require "that device unlocking is truly automatic—that is, unlocked after the requisite time period without any additional actions of the consumer." Carriers should not be allowed to lock phones for longer than 60 days even when a phone is on a financing plan with outstanding payments, the groups' letter said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Providers should be required to transition out of selling devices without this [automatic unlocking] capability and the industry-wide rule should be the same as the one protecting Verizon customers today: after the expiration of the initial period, the handset must automatically unlock regardless of whether: (1) the customer asks for the handset to be unlocked or (2) the handset is fully paid off. Removing this barrier to switching will make the standard simple for consumers and encourage providers to compete more vigorously on mobile service price, quality, and innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an October 2 <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10022636123363/1">filing</a>, Verizon said it supports "a uniform approach to handset unlocking that allows all wireless providers to lock wireless handsets for a reasonable period of time to limit fraud and to enable device subsidies, followed by automatic unlocking absent evidence of fraud."</p>
<p>Verizon said 60 days should be the minimum for postpaid devices so that carriers have time to detect fraud and theft, and that "a longer, 180-day locking period for prepaid is necessary to enable wireless providers to continue offering subsidies that make phones affordable for prepaid customers." Regardless of what time frame the FCC chooses, Verizon said "a uniform unlocking policy that applies to all providers... will benefit both consumers and competition."</p>

<h2>FCC considers impact on phone subsidies</h2>
<p>While the FCC is likely to impose an unlocking rule, one question is whether it will apply when a carrier has provided a discounted phone. The FCC's NPRM asked the public for "comment on the impact of a 60-day unlocking requirement in connection with service providers' incentives to offer discounted handsets for postpaid and prepaid service plans."</p>
<p>The FCC acknowledged Verizon's argument "that providers may rely on handset locking to sustain their ability to offer handset subsidies and that such subsidies may be particularly important in prepaid environments." But the FCC noted that public interest groups "argue that locked handsets tied to prepaid plans can disadvantage low-income customers most of all since they may not have the resources to switch service providers or purchase new handsets."</p>
<p>The public interest groups also note that unlocked handsets "facilitate a robust secondary market for used devices, providing consumers with more affordable options," the NPRM said.</p>
<p>The FCC says it can impose phone-unlocking rules using its legal authority under Title III of the Communications Act "to protect the public interest through spectrum licensing and regulations to require mobile wireless service providers to provide handset unlocking." The FCC said it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/wireless-net-neutrality-puts-verizon-and-rivals-on-equal-footing/">previously relied</a> on the same Title III authority when it imposed the unlocking rules on 700 MHz C Block spectrum licenses purchased by Verizon.</p>
<p>T-Mobile told the FCC in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10923041590680/1">filing</a> last month that "none of the litany of Title III provisions cited in the NPRM support the expansive authority asserted here to regulate consumer handsets (rather than telecommunications services)." T-Mobile also said that "the Commission's legal vulnerabilities on this score are only magnified in light of recent Supreme Court precedent."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/scotus-kills-chevron-deference-giving-courts-more-power-to-block-federal-rules/">overturned</a> the 40-year-old <em>Chevron</em> precedent that gave agencies like the FCC judicial deference when interpreting ambiguous laws. The end of <em>Chevron</em> makes it harder for agencies to issue regulations without explicit authorization from Congress. This is a potential problem for the FCC in its fight to revive net neutrality rules, which are currently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/fcc-suffers-major-setback-in-attempt-to-defend-net-neutrality-rules/">blocked</a> by a court order pending the outcome of litigation.</p>

<p>For almost as long as <a href="https://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/">the Undergraduate Projects Lab</a> at the University of Wisconsin has existed, there’s been a camera of some sort peering at the room. There’s evidence of a system existing even as far back as the 1990s, with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202092257/http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/uplcam.html">prehistoric revision of the site</a> mentioning that an old iteration was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…a $15 video camera attached to the wall with duct tape, connected to a VCR, connected to a video spigot in a Mac IIcx, running Timed Video Grabber (TVG), and FTPd. Dax, an HP workstation ran a script that would try to FTP the latest image every 60 seconds. Because the clocks would drift, occasionally, the file accesses would collide, and the whole scheme would break.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just <em>reading</em> that makes me stare at the camera that now sits perched on top of the arcade cabinet with wonder. What used to be several thousand dollars of equipment is now achievable (with immeasurably better quality) with a $50 webcam plugged into a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/old_upl.png" alt="A grainy image featuring an interior view of the UPL, a triangular-shaped undergraduate lab at UW-Madison.">
    <img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/new_upl.jpeg" alt="An image featuring the interior of the UPL, a lab at UW-Madison. Students sit at laptops.">
</p>
<p><i>Taken ~25 years apart.</i></p>
<p>I could—and probably will—write an entire other blog post about the intricate history of the UPL, mentioning how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001003051528/http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/uplcam/spincam.html">older versions of the website</a> allowed for users to control the tilt and pan of the camera using four stepper motors attached to the camera.</p>
<p>However, the focus of this article is about the two <em>latest</em> iterations of cameras in the UPL.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-upl-open-right-now"><a href="#is-the-upl-open-right-now">#</a>“Is the UPL open right now?”</h2>
<p>I’m sure that any UPL member can testify the horror of arriving to the lab to see a closed door. If you live anywhere off campus, it’s heartbreaking to see your arduous trek to the CS building result in failure.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that as far back as IRC, members of the UPL messaged each other asking if the lab was open. With the advent of mobile phones, it’s gotten easier to bother your friends—who may not even be in the room!</p>
<p>Well, myself, in collaboration with other UPL members, decided to fix this issue in, perhaps, the most CS-student-esque way possible: an automated system to identify the occupancy of the lab.</p>
<h2 id="people-counting"><a href="#people-counting">#</a>People counting</h2>
<p>The first iteration of the people counting system (as built by <a href="https://github.com/mdberkey">Michael Berkey</a>) utilized a Logitech C920 camera mounted on a vantage point that had a clear view of the room. A Discord bot was set on a 15 minute loop (using discord.py.ext’s <code>@tasks.loop(minutes=15)</code>) to call a YOLOv7 model set to class 0 (detecting people). The bot called the webcam to take an image, then ran it through the model for inference. It returned the number of people in the room (and annotated the image with bounding boxes of where it believed the people to be, for debug purposes).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/camera-over.png" alt="The front side of a C920 webcam.">
    <img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/camera-peek.png" alt="The back side of a C920 webcam.">
</p>
<p><i>…don’t mind the tape.</i></p>
<p>It then set the name of a channel to the results (either <code>1-person-in-upl</code> or <code>X-people-in-upl</code>), which others could check.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/8-people-in-upl.png" alt="A channel in the UPL Discord reads '8 people in UPL'.">
</p>
<p><i>An example of what the Discord looked like on a day with a semi-busy UPL.</i></p>
<h2 id="switching-to-door-sensing"><a href="#switching-to-door-sensing">#</a>Switching to door sensing</h2>
<p>This worked perfectly for a while — people would check the Discord channel name and see the estimated count of the number of people in the room. If it said “zero people”, they could infer that the UPL wasn’t open.</p>
<p>However, this solution started presenting issues. For one, having people in the room didn’t necessarily indicate that the UPL was open. There could be a meeting, or a separate gathering where the doors were closed and people weren’t allowed inside. This was confusing to people who might have seen “8 people inside the UPL”, only to arrive at the building to see coords having a meeting.</p>
<p>There was also the issue of the model sometimes interpreting the chair in the corner as a person<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/upl_empty.png" alt="An image of the empty lab. An annotation on a brown armchair reads 'Person 0', despite no human on the chair.">
</p>
<p><i>Either the model is too sensitive, or the UPL has a friendly ghost!</i></p>
<p>It was around this time that I stumbled upon the homepage of <a href="https://miters.mit.edu/">MITERS</a>, a makerspace at MIT. On their website, they broadcast whether the door to the space is open using a reed switch attached to a Raspberry Pi. Reed switches are small, physical components that are able to detect a magnetic field. If you put one on a doorframe, and then attach a tiny magnet to the door itself, you have an effective way of detecting whether a door is open or closed! I was able to find <a href="https://andrewbirkel.com/projects/MITERS_Door.html">a writeup</a> by a former member of the space on their implementation, but I can’t guarantee that it’s accurate to how it’s set up there currently.</p>
<p>I considered using similar components for a door status checker for the UPL — it wouldn’t have been too much effort to buy WiFi enabled ESP32 modules and off-the-shelf door-mountable reed switches. Then, I would have the chips simply send a POST request with their status every time the door was opened or closed.</p>
<p>I decided against this approach for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The UPL doesn’t really have the equipment to maintain such a system. I don’t know how to solder, and mounting breadboards to the walls doesn’t seem like the most future-proof or aesthetically pleasing solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the system were to spontaneously break after I left, it would be difficult to find somebody to fix it. The UPL is mainly a software oriented lab!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WiFi ran by the university (UWNet) requires you to log in with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal">captive portal</a> to register your device to connect to the network. Without intervention, it will occasionally require you to sign back in to renew your ability to connect<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. While there <em>are</em> some ways to emulate the specific requests a typical browser would use to authenticate with your NetID, it would be a ton of recurring effort (and the login it used would have to be changed as people graduated)!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I decided that the sensors themselves would have to act autonomously and simply relay their state to a device elsewhere in the room. Luckily, the Raspberry Pi that ran the code for the people counter was easily repurposed. I installed <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>, an open source platform for interfacing with various network connected devices.</p>
<p>There are plenty of devices that track the status of doors, made by companies like Ring and ADT for home security. However, they usually require proprietary hubs to check their status, and don’t offer easily accessible APIs to interface with the device. Luckily, there was a better solution!</p>
<h2 id="zigbee"><a href="#zigbee">#</a>Zigbee!</h2>
<p>Enter Zigbee. It’s a low-rate mesh wireless protocol that allows for smart devices to communicate over a personal area network. A benefit of this is that you’re able to use one hub to communicate with a variety of devices, even those made by different manufacturers. Instead of searching for a particular brand for the door contact sensors, I would just have to find ones that supported the Zigbee protocol. Then I would be able to view their status through Home Assistant’s dashboard.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Zigbee radios operate independently from WiFi or Bluetooth antennas. If you want to interface with Zigbee devices, you’ll have to pick up a special receiver that can support the protocol. For this project, I picked up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SONOFF-Universal-Assistant-Zigbee2MQTT-Wireless/dp/B0B6P22YJC/">this one</a> made by SONOFF. Home Assistant’s Zigbee integration is called <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/">Zigbee Home Automation</a>, and it supports a variety of Zigbee coordinators (the USB dongles that allow for connections). When you use this integration, Home Assistant automatically creates a Zigbee network that the devices can join.</p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-MCCGQ11LM-Window-Sensor-White/dp/B07D37VDM3/">these Aqara door and window sensors</a> for this project. They had the best reviews out of all of the Zigbee door sensors I looked at, and have a battery life of two years (with an easily replaceable CR1632 cell).</p>
<p>Once the coordinator and sensors arrived, I created a Home Assistant login and installed the ZHA integration. Pairing simply required holding the “reset” button on the sensors until Home Assistant recognized them and added the corresponding entities in the dashboard.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-door-statuses"><a href="#using-the-door-statuses">#</a>Using the door statuses</h2>
<p>Once this was all configured, I had the live statuses of the doors through the Home Assistant dashboard! I’m not going to lie, it was really fun opening and closing the doors repeatedly and seeing the dashboard change in real-time (even if passerby in the CS building probably thought I was crazy).</p>

<p><i>It’s so satisfying to watch this happen in real-time.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></i></p>
<p>An important thing to note here is that UWNet provides total access point isolation. None of the devices on the network can see any of the others (for good reason, as it would be a huge security vulnerability for any devices with open ports). If this wasn’t a limitation, I would just have the website directly query the rpi.</p>
<p>My first intuition was to use Home Assistant’s <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rest_command/">RESTful Command</a> integration to send a POST request to my webserver whenever the status of the doors changed. These require you to setup each command ahead of time, in HA’s <code>configuration.yml</code>:</p>

<p>…but I very quickly realized that this solution wasn’t the best. For one, when I published <a href="https://github.com/UW-UPL/people-counter-v2/blob/main/home-assistant/configuration.yaml">the source code</a> onto GitHub, some very funny students decided that they would manually simulate the POST requests and change the status of the doors to be inaccurate. That’s what I get for leaving the endpoint unsecured!<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I eventually learned that Home Assistant provides a <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/">RESTful API</a> directly alongside the web dashboard. If I set that up, I would be able to query the instance for the states of the connected devices.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> All it took was appending an <code>/api/</code> route to the HA URL. I could just use that!</p>
<p>The API has all of its routes authenticated with a bearer token (to most likely mirror the permissions of the frontend, which requires a user login before showing any data). Given that I wanted to display the door status on the UPL’s page, I realized the potential danger in shipping the bearer token with the site. Any crafty user could take it and access any other route on Home Assistant’s API. Given the level of information and control available on HA instances, this could be disastrous.</p>
<p>I made a quick webserver using Express that proxies the request with the bearer token and only serves the relevant door information. Because it displays this separately, the user has no way of seeing or manipulating anything beyond this.</p>

<p>Now, the server will query Home Assistant’s API on your behalf (with the proper bearer token). It’ll return a JSON object of the door statuses and their last change, like so:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="json"><code><div><p><span>[</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"door"</span><span>: </span><span>"back"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"status"</span><span>: </span><span>"on"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"last_updated"</span><span>: </span><span>"2024-10-12T20:01:54.353657+00:00"</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>},</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"door"</span><span>: </span><span>"front"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"status"</span><span>: </span><span>"on"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"last_updated"</span><span>: </span><span>"2024-10-12T20:02:10.132178+00:00"</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>]</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>…and the Discord bot/UPL website can use that to let people know what the status is.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/open_door.png" alt="The UPL website reads 'the doors are open!' with an icon of an open door.">
</p>
<p><i>The UPL website uses a header component which fetches the door status every 15 seconds.</i></p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/upl_discord.png" alt="A channel in the UPL Discord reads 'UPL doors open'.">
</p>
<p><i>The Discord channel name is an easy way to see the status without opening the site.</i></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m pretty happy with how this project turned out. It’s been really fun developing something that I actually use every day, and I find it pretty special that every time I check if the UPL’s open or not, I’m doing it via something that I made myself.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>A new </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/30-cameras-border-patrols-main-surveillance-system-are-broken-memo-say-rcna175281"><span>bombshell scoop</span></a><span> from NBC News revealed an internal U.S. Border Patrol memo claiming that 30 percent of camera towers that compose the agency's "Remote Video Surveillance System" (RVSS) program are broken. According to the report, the memo describes "several technical problems" affecting approximately 150 towers.</span></p>
<p><span>Except, this isn't a bombshell. What should actually be shocking is that Congressional leaders are acting shocked, like those who recently sent a </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/whistleblowers-border-patrol-surveillance-cameras-out-service-gop-demands-answers-dhs"><span>letter</span></a><span> about the towers to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. These revelations simply reiterate what people who have been watching border technology have known for decades: Surveillance at the U.S.-Mexico border is a wasteful endeavor that is ill-equipped to respond to an ill-defined problem. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Yet, after years of bipartisan recognition that these programs were straight-up boondoggles, there seems to be a competition among political leaders to throw the most money at programs that continue to fail. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Official oversight reports about the failures, repeated breakages, and general ineffectiveness of these camera towers have been public since at least the mid-2000s. So why haven't border security agencies confronted the problem in the last 25 years? One reason is that these cameras are largely political theater; the technology dazzles publicly, then fizzles quietly. Meanwhile, communities that should be thriving at the border are treated like a laboratory for tech companies looking to cash in on often exaggerated—if not fabricated—homeland security threats.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Acronym Game</strong></h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/cbp-expanding-its-surveillance-tower-program-us-mexico-border-and-were-mapping-it"><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/10/18/eff_map_10-18-2024.png" width="1125" height="729" alt="A map of the US-Mexico border with multicolored dots representing surveillance towers." title="EFF is mapping surveillance at the US-Mexico border"></a></p><p>EFF is mapping surveillance at the U.S.-Mexico border</p></div><p><em><i><span>.</span></i></em></p><p><span></span><span>In fact, the history of camera towers at the border is an ugly cycle. First, Border Patrol introduces a surveillance program with a catchy name and big promises. Then a few years later, oversight bodies, including Congress, conclude it's an abject mess. But rather than abandon the program once and for all, border security officials come up with a new name, slap on a fresh coat of paint, and continue on. A few years later, history repeats. </span></p>
<p><span>In the early 2000s, there was the Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS), with the installation of RVSS towers in places like Calexico, California and Nogales, Arizona, which was later became the America's Shield Initiative (ASI). After those failures, there was Project 28 (P-28), the first stage of the Secure Border Initiative (SBInet). When that program was canceled, there were various new programs like the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan, which became the Southwest Border Technology Plan. Border Patrol introduced the Integrated Fixed Tower (IFT) program and the RVSS Update program, then the Automated Surveillance Tower (AST) program. And now we've got a whole slew of new acronyms, including the Integrated Surveillance Tower (IST) program and the Consolidated Towers and Surveillance Equipment (CTSE) program. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Feeling overwhelmed by acronyms? Welcome to the shell game of border surveillance. Here's what happens whenever oversight bodies take a closer look. </span></p>
<h3><b>ISIS and ASI</b></h3>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/10/18/calexico_rvss.jpg" width="1920" height="1346" alt="A surveillance tower over a home." title=""></p><p>An RVSS from the early 2000s in Calexico, California.</p></div>
<p><span>Let's start with the Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS), a program comprised of towers, sensors and databases originally launched in 1997 by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. A few years later, INS was reorganized into the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and ISIS became part of the newly formed Customs &amp; Border Protection (CBP). <br></span></p>
<p><span>It was only a matter of years before the DHS Inspector General </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23314612-oig_06-15_dec05"><span>concluded that ISIS</span></a><span> was a flop:</span><span> "ISIS remote surveillance technology yielded few apprehensions as a percentage of detection, resulted in needless investigations of legitimate activity, and consumed valuable staff time to perform video analysis or investigate sensor alerts." </span></p>
<p><span>During </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24483802-chrg-109shrg99863"><span>Senate hearings</span></a><span>, Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH), complained about a "</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24483802-chrg-109shrg99863#document/p125"><span>total breakdown in the camera structures</span></a><span>," and that the U.S. government "</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24483802-chrg-109shrg99863#document/p141"><span>bought cameras that didn't work.</span></a><span>" </span></p>
<p><span>Around 2004, ISIS was folded into the new America's Shield Initiative (ASI), which officials claimed would fix those problems. CBP Commissioner Robert Bonner even <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24483802-chrg-109shrg99863#document/p30">promoted</a> ASI as a "critical part of CBP’s strategy to build smarter borders." Yet, less than a year later, Bonner stepped down, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found the ASI had <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25242401-gao-06-295#document/p2">numerous unresolved issues</a> necessitating a total reevaluation. CBP disputed none of the findings and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25242401-gao-06-295#document/p6">explained</a> it was dismantling ASI in order to move onto something new that would solve everything: the Secure Border Initiative (SBI).<br></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23825159-chrg-110hhrg44137#document/p10"><span>Reflecting on the ISIS/ASI programs in 2008</span></a><span>, Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) said, "What we found was a camera and sensor system that was plagued by mismanagement, operational problems, and financial waste. At that time, we put the Department on notice that mistakes of the past should not be repeated in SBInet."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can guess what happened next.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>P-28 and SBInet</b></h3>
<p><span>The next iteration was called Project 28, which then evolved into the Secure Border Initiative's SBInet, starting in the Arizona desert.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2010, the DHS Chief Information Officer summarized its </span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24487999/itpa-cbp-sbinet2010.pdf"><span>comprehensive review</span></a><span>: "'Project 28,' the initial prototype for the SBInet system, did not perform as planned. Project 28 was not scalable to meet the mission requirements for a national comment [sic] and control system, and experienced significant technical difficulties."&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/10/18/sbinet.jpg" width="1000" height="750" alt="A convoluted graphic illustrating how SBInet surveillance towers fit into the border security plan." title=""></p><p>A DHS graphic illustrating the SBInet concept</p></div>
<p><span>Meanwhile, bipartisan consensus had emerged about the failure of the program, due to the technical problems as well as contracting irregularities and cost overruns.</span></p>
<p><span>As Rep. Christopher Carney (D-PA) said in his </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23825159-chrg-110hhrg44137#document/p9"><span>prepared statement</span></a><span> during Congressional hearings:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span> P–28 and the larger SBInet program are supposed to be a model of how the Federal Government is leveraging technology to secure our borders, but Project 28, in my mind, has achieved a dubious distinction as a trifecta of bad Government contracting: Poor contract management; poor contractor performance; and a poor final product.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Rep. Rogers' remarks were even more cutting: "You know the history of ISIS and what a disaster that was, and we had hoped to take the lessons from that and do better on this and, apparently, we haven’t done much better. "</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps most damning of all was yet another GAO </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24488007-ad1179135"><span>report</span></a><span> that found, "SBInet defects have been found, with the number of new defects identified generally increasing faster than the number being fixed—a trend that is not indicative of a system that is maturing."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In January 2011, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2011/01/dhs-cancels-virtual-border-fence-047625"><span>canceled</span></a><span> the $3-billion program.</span></p>
<h3><b>IFTs, RVSSs, and ASTs<br></b></h3>
<p><span>Following the termination of SBInet, the </span><i><span>Christian Science Monitor</span></i><span> ran the naive headline, "</span><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/0115/US-cancels-virtual-fence-along-Mexican-border.-What-s-Plan-B"><span>US cancels 'virtual fence' along Mexican border. What's Plan B</span></a><span>?" Three years later, the newspaper answered its own question with another question, "'</span><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2014/0319/Virtual-border-fence-idea-revived.-Another-billion-dollar-boondoggle"><span>Virtual' border fence idea revived. Another 'billion dollar boondoggle'</span></a><span>?" <br></span></p>
<p><span>Boeing was the main contractor blamed for SBINet's failure, but Border Patrol ultimately awarded one of the biggest new contracts to Elbit Systems, which had been one of Boeing's subcontractors on SBInet. Elbit began installing IFTs (again, that stands for "Integrated Fixed Towers") in many of the exact same places slated for SBInet. In some cases, the equipment was simply swapped on an existing SBInet tower.<br></span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, another contractor, General Dynamics Information Technology, began installing new RVSS towers and upgrading old ones as part of the RVSS-U program. Border Patrol also started installing hundreds of "Autonomous Surveillance Towers" (ASTs) by yet another vendor, Anduril Industries, embracing the new buzz of artificial intelligence. <br></span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/10/18/ast_and_rvss.jpg" width="1313" height="941" alt="Two surveillance towers and a Border Patrol vehicle along the Rio Grande" title=""></p><p>An Autonomous Surveillance Tower and an RVSS tower along the Rio Grande.</p></div>
<p><span>In 2017, the GAO </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24733271-gao-18-119#document/p2"><span>complained</span></a><span> the Border Patrol's poor data quality made the agency "limited in its ability to determine the mission benefits of its surveillance technologies." In one case, Border Patrol stations in the Rio Grande Valley claimed IFTs assisted in 500 cases in just six months. The problem with that assertion was there are no IFTs in Texas or, in fact, anywhere outside Arizona. <br></span></p>
<p><span>A few years later, the DHS Inspector General issued yet another </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23706411-oig-21-21-feb21"><span>report</span></a><span> indicating not much had improved: <br></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>CBP faced additional challenges that reduced the effectiveness of its existing technology. Border Patrol officials stated they had inadequate personnel to fully leverage surveillance technology or maintain current information technology systems and infrastructure on site. Further, we identified security vulnerabilities on some CBP servers and workstations not in compliance due to disagreement about the timeline for implementing DHS configuration management requirements.</span></p>
<p><span>CBP is not well-equipped to assess its technology effectiveness to respond to these deficiencies. CBP has been aware of this challenge since at least 2017 but lacks a standard process and accurate data to overcome it. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Overall, these deficiencies have limited CBP’s ability to detect and prevent the illegal entry of noncitizens who may pose threats to national security.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Around that same time, the RAND Corporation published a </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24711700-rand_rr4348#document/p60/a2562275"><span>study</span></a><span> funded by DHS that found "strong evidence" the IFT program was having no impact on apprehension levels at the border, and only "weak" and "inconclusive" evidence that the RVSS towers were having any effect on apprehensions.</span></p>
<p><span>And yet, border authorities and their supporters in Congress are continuing to promote unproven, AI-driven technologies as the latest remedy for years of failures, including the ones voiced in the memo obtained by NBC News. These systems involve cameras controlled by algorithms that automatically identify and track objects or people of interest. But in an age when algorithmic errors and bias are being identified nearly everyday in every sector including law enforcement, it is unclear how this technology has earned the trust of the government. <br></span></p>
<h3><b>History Keeps Repeating <br></b></h3>
<p><span>That brings us today, with reportedly 150 or more towers out of service. So why does Washington keep supporting surveillance at the border? Why are they proposing record-level funding for a system that seems irreparable? Why have they abandoned their duty to scrutinize federal programs? <br></span></p>
<p><span>Well, one reason may be that treating problems at the border as humanitarian crises or pursuing foreign policy or immigration reform measures isn't as politically useful as promoting a phantom "invasion" that requires a military-style response. Another reason may be that </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/hundreds-tech-companies-want-cash-border-security-funding-heres-who-they-are-and"><span>tech companies and military contractors</span></a><span> wield immense amounts of influence and stand to make millions, if not billions, profiting off border surveillance. The price is paid by taxpayers, but also in the civil liberties of border communities and the human rights of asylum seekers and migrants.</span></p>
<p><span>But perhaps the biggest reason this history keeps repeating itself is that no one is ever really held accountable for wasting potentially billions of dollars on high-tech snake oil.</span></p>

<p><strong>No. But they don’t need to.</strong></p>



<p>In preparation for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-PSODNOwJY">5th test flight of Starship</a>, SpaceX announced that they would try to catch the booster using “Mechazilla’s chopsticks.” Later during pre-launch discussions, SpaceX VP Bill Gerstenmaier claimed that they were confident of success since they had landed the booster in the ocean during Flight 4 with “<a href="https://x.com/jeff_foust/status/1844183958873047215" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/jeff_foust/status/1844183958873047215">half a centimeter accuracy</a>.” And then last Sunday they went for the landing and nailed it!</p>



<p>But did they really nail it to within half a centimeter? That number sounds too good to be true, and it sparked quite a bit of skepticism from industry observers. What can SpaceX <em>really</em> expect for their landing accuracy?</p>



<p>My background: I am an aerospace engineer who has designed guidance, navigation, &amp; control (GNC) systems for successful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eCvxPieA84" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eCvxPieA84">orbital launch vehicles</a>, worked with RTK precision GPS systems on the ground, and implemented GNSS systems on satellite constellations. Standard disclaimer that I am only speaking for myself, and am only using public non-ITAR information. I don’t know what SpaceX is using to estimate the position and orientation on their rockets or their exact control schemes, and I might be missing some information that they’ve made public, but I am well versed in what goes into the design space and can hopefully make some good guesses. Please comment if I’m missing or misinterpreting anything. Also this post isn’t meant as a “gotcha” against Bill – take that as an excuse to dive into the cool engineering behind catching the rocket!</p>



<p>So buckle in for a deep dive and let’s look at what goes into landing a rocket!</p>

<h5><strong>Main Points:</strong></h5>



<ul>
<li>Half a centimeter landing accuracy is not possible, and Bill likely misspoke or was talking about control error.</li>



<li>SpaceX Super Heavy booster landing margins are so wide that you could land one with your smartphone electronics.</li>



<li>Falcon 9 is likely harder to land.</li>



<li>Catching the booster is an absolutely tremendous achievement that the team should be incredibly proud of!</li>
</ul>



<h2>Controlling Position</h2>



<h5><strong>How Accurately Can SpaceX Measure Position?</strong></h5>



<p>The position of a rocket can be measured two primary ways. First, using GNSS (GPS) to get an absolute position. Second, by using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that includes an accelerometer to estimate the distance from a known reference position (the launch pad). These sensors are both necessary and sufficient for rocket flight, so I’ll focus on them.</p>



<p>The Super Heavy booster lands back in the chopsticks 7 minutes after launch. If we use a <a data-type="link" data-id="https://aerospace.honeywell.com/us/en/products-and-services/product/hardware-and-systems/sensors/inertial-measurement-units" href="https://aerospace.honeywell.com/us/en/products-and-services/product/hardware-and-systems/sensors/inertial-measurement-units">nice expensive IMU</a> that has around 0.01 milli-g’s of accelerometer bias, that double integrates up to 8.6 meters of error. So flying by dead reckoning isn’t going to cut it. (This is a very quick-n’-dirty calculation – a real error propagation analysis would find a larger number due to velocity and attitude errors, so think of this as a lower bound).</p>



<p>We need to bring in GPS to get a better absolute position. Let’s look at the datasheet for <a href="https://novatel.com/products/receivers/gnss-gps-receiver-boards">high-end GNSS chips </a>to get a sense of what’s feasible. Civilian GPS is the L1 band at 250 cm accuracy (looking at the 95% confidence sphere), and military GPS adds the L2 band to 240 cm accuracy, so note that even if SpaceX is using the military band that doesn’t do much on its own in an open-air environment. You could use SBAS (Satellite based augmentation systems, over the US it’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Area_Augmentation_System" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Area_Augmentation_System">WAAS system</a> which airplanes use for landing at airports) which improves accuracy to 120 cm and is available through just the GPS satellite link. Going further than that requires communication between the booster and the ground. At the most precise, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning">RTK positioning system</a> could lower position accuracy all the way down to 2.5 cm (+1cm per km of distance). If SpaceX put a receiver on the launch tower or the ocean buoys, then the landing position could be incredibly accurate. But even the most advance positioning tech won’t guarantee it down to 0.5 cm. And RTK does rely on being able to acquire and maintain a link between the booster and ground for this precision.</p>

<p><a data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/" href="https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/">Sensor fusion with the accelerometer (aka Kalman filtering)</a> will help fill any gaps in GNSS signals, provide higher rate estimates, and allow for identification &amp; rejection of GNSS errors, but it won’t appreciably improve the absolute position error.</p>



<p>Furthermore, this is just the position of the GPS receiver on the rocket. How does that translate to the position of the landing pins? If there is angular pitch/yaw motion of the rocket, there will be a dynamic offset between the GPS antenna and the landing pins (though this can be calculated and compensated for). There will be manufacturing tolerances which may stack up to less than 5mm, but that would be incredibly tight for something this size. The booster itself will also change dimensions as it is cooled by propellant and heated by reentry. The coefficient of thermal expansion of steel is about 12 μm/m-degC, so for a 71 m booster with liquid oxygen at -183 degC and reentry temperature of (let’s say) 50 degC, that’s a 20 cm change in length. Cut that in half since the LOX tank is half the booster, and you still get 10 cm of elongation. It’s not clear to me whether the booster avionics are near the pins (in which case the local thermal deformation would be minimal) or the engines (in which case it definitely matters), but this shows that thermal effects alone could dwarf half a centimeter accuracy. Additionally, for the Flight 4 landing at sea which quoted the 0.5 cm number, movement of the buoys would be more than this.</p>



<p>SpaceX has said that they use radar altimeters to measure distance to the ground on Falcon 9 landings, which helps constrain the vertical axis error. That would help here as well, though the Super Heavy booster is coming down on an irregular pad rather than a flat landing zone, so a radar return signal would be harder to interpret reliably.</p>



<p>Could you use other real-time distance measurements like laser rangefinding or visual processing? I don’t think so – the surface of the vehicle is too irregular to get a reliable fix point, especially while it is moving, and these are vulnerable to smoke/fog/gas/ambient lighting. Technologies like Ultra Wideband are vulnerable to multipath reflections and attenuation by the booster’s steel walls, and aren’t more accurate than RTK anyway. It is possible that SpaceX has found a proprietary technique for more accurate localization, but at this point we are speculating. And I would point to the SpaceX design philosophy that “the best part is no part” if that extra accuracy isn’t needed. As we’ll see below, it’s not.</p>



<p>So 0.5 cm position accuracy is not possible with applicable technologies. I think the most likely scenario is that Bill misspoke and meant to say “half a meter” or “centimeters level accuracy” and conflated the two.</p>

<h5><strong>How Accurately Can SpaceX Control Position?</strong></h5>



<p>The algorithms here can get arbitrarily precise. I think &lt; 10 cm accuracy is achievable, and 0.5 cm is impressive but not unbelievable. But this is only control of the vehicle relative to where it <em>thinks</em> it is. I think it’s also possible that this metric is what Bill was talking about, though it’s not the ultimate number that matters for landing.</p>



<p>In preparation for this landing attempt, SpaceX undoubtedly performed extensive <a href="https://github.com/scottshambaugh/monaco/blob/main/README.md" data-type="link" data-id="https://theshamblog.com/introducing-the-monaco-monte-carlo-python-library/">Monte Carlo analyses</a>, simulating the flight of the booster millions of times with different variations in vehicle properties, engine performance, environmental effects such as wind, contingency and off-nominal scenarios such as engine failures, timing errors and signal lag, etc. This would result in realistic landing accuracy numbers. Any estimate of how accurately SpaceX can position the rocket <em>must </em>be downstream of a full analysis like this that incorporates the dynamics of the landing event with all sources of uncertainty and error, and is well outside the scope of this post.</p>



<p>But we can bound the estimates by looking at Falcon 9 landings. Reddit user FortisVeritas <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/b3zr0i/chart_with_the_approximate_falcon_9_landing/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/b3zr0i/chart_with_the_approximate_falcon_9_landing/">collected the locations of Falcon 9 landings</a> and made the plot below. Looking at just the green landing locations on land (in order to remove the extra error from landing on a moving droneship), they tend to land in approximately a 5-10 meter wide area (the large yellow circle on the landing zone is ~20 meters wide).</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="940" height="741" src="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png?resize=940%2C741&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png?resize=940%2C741&amp;ssl=1 940w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png?resize=580%2C457&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png?resize=768%2C606&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png?w=1107&amp;ssl=1 1107w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure></div>


<p>However, Falcon 9 has several disadvantages relative to the Super Heavy booster:</p>



<ul>
<li>It does not have separate landing propellant tanks, so propellant slosh will disturb its trajectory. The Super Heavy booster has <a data-type="link" data-id="https://ringwatchers.com/article/booster-prop-distribution" href="https://ringwatchers.com/article/booster-prop-distribution">dedicated central header tanks</a> for landing propellant, so there should be minimal propellant slosh to disturb the vehicle attitude.</li>



<li>It lands with a single engine which cannot throttle low enough to hover the vehicle, and as such must perform a “hoverslam” maneuver to bring the vehicle to a stop right on the ground. While the Super Heavy booster must perform most of a hoverslam maneuver to slow down just before coming in to the tower, it can hover for the final fine positioning.</li>



<li>Because it lands with a single engine, roll control is minimal close to touchdown when the airspeed is low and the grid fins can impart minimal torque, and is limited to its weaker cold-gas thrusters. The Super Heavy booster can control roll with its 3 engines all the way to the ground.</li>



<li>Falcon 9 has no engine-out capability for landing. SpaceX has not confirmed it for the Super Heavy booster, but I believe one engine out is likely possible (more on this later).</li>



<li>It is smaller with a lower moment of inertia. Rockets get more stable and easier to control the larger they are, much like it’s easier to balance a broom on your finger than a pencil.</li>



<li>It is smaller, and so thanks to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law#:~:text=The%20square%E2%80%93cube%20law%20can,the%20cube%20of%20the%20multiplier." data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law#:~:text=The%20square%E2%80%93cube%20law%20can,the%20cube%20of%20the%20multiplier.">cubed-square law</a> has a higher area:mass ratio. This means that it will be more affected by wind gusts that might blow it off course.</li>
</ul>



<p>All this to say that the Super Heavy booster should be easier to control precisely than Falcon 9, and its landings more accurate than a ±2.5 meter range.</p>



<h5><strong>How Accurate Does SpaceX Need Position To Be?</strong></h5>



<p>Pulling from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub6HdADut50" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub6HdADut50">Ryan Hansen’s excellent video</a> where he modeled and simulated the Super Heavy catch system, the below arc is the feasible catch zone for the booster. This area is 22 m at its narrowest point, and needs to fit a 9 m booster in it, so this allows for ± 6.5m of side-to-side error. The catch arm area is 18 m long, so call that ± 9 m of front-to-back accuracy required.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-8.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="940" height="526" src="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-8.png?resize=940%2C526&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-8.png?resize=940%2C526&amp;ssl=1 940w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-8.png?resize=580%2C324&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-8.png?resize=768%2C430&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-8.png?w=1253&amp;ssl=1 1253w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure></div>


<p>This side-to-side error range does assume that the catch arms can still close around the booster if it is off-center – can the tower can adjust the arm positions in real time so it doesn’t knock into one side of the rocket first and push it over? In the video below it certainly looks like this is the case. The left arm moves first and we see them come in at different speeds to keep centered around the booster in real time. They start moving before the rocket is between the arms, so I don’t expect this is being controlled by tower sensors such as radars mounted on the arms.</p>



<figure><p><iframe title="TOWER CAM! SpaceX Super Heavy Booster Catch" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JlcrNakUGVs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure>



<p>Vertical distance is likely to be the most constrained. If the engines shut off several meters above the arms, the booster would hit with quite a bit of force and in the worst case may bounce back off. There are pistons on the catch rails that could allow for damping out the impact from a dropped booster, but you still want to avoid this. The way to mitigate this is to center the booster in the right spot and then drop down slowly at a speed which you know is manageable for a successful catch. This is what we see SpaceX do. The limiter here becomes fuel – dropping at a steady speed burns as much as hovering. If you are dropping at 1 m/s, can you do that for 5 seconds? It’s not clear how much fuel margin SpaceX has here. The engines turns off immediately after contact, but that may have been because contact was detected, and SpaceX had more fuel margin to go. With a lot of uncertainty here, let’s ballpark a 5 meter tall box for a range of ±2.5m.</p>

<h5><strong>Position Summary</strong></h5>



<p>With standard consumer grade GPS, SpaceX can localize its rocket to within 2.5 meters. Using SBAS which would require no extra complexity, that shrinks to 1.2 meters. To get more accurate than that, they would need to have a communications link between the rocket and a base station on the pad. Using RTK for this they could get as accurate as 2.5 cm, but this adds complexity to the system. On top of this will be several centimeters of hardware offsets due to manufacturing tolerances and thermal effect. On the other hand, the allowable error box is roughly ± 6.5, 9 and 2.5 (?) meters large, for safety margins of 2-8x. This is a little low for a test flight – if I were SpaceX I would try to use RTK or DGPS to make the margins larger, but would also feel good that the simpler system could work as backup. This may also suggest that radar is still being used for vertical accuracy.</p>



<p>Going off of Falcon 9 landing history, that rocket consistently lands within a ±2.5 – 5 meter area. However I would expect the Super Heavy booster to be easier to control for a number of reasons.</p>



<p>One reason that the landing looks so precise is simply that everything is so big, and GPS accuracy doesn’t change with scale. We aren’t surprised when a consumer drone flies back to us autonomously using GPS and lands on the grass at our feet, and this rocket is using the same underlying technology. It’s just that 1 meter error looks really small when your booster is 71 meters tall.</p>



<h2>Controlling Orientation / Attitude</h2>



<h5><strong>How Accurately Can SpaceX Measure Attitude?</strong></h5>



<p>Without a device that measures absolute attitude such as a star tracker, the angular orientation of a rocket will be reliant on measuring angular velocity with its onboard gryoscopes, which is then integrated up into angular position relative to the launch orientation. </p>



<p>The Super Heavy booster landing back in the chopsticks 7 minutes after launch is short enough that you don’t need a very good gyro at all to stay pointed well. Without digging too deep into the details of Allan Deviance, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10490716/">the MEMS gryo</a> in an iPhone XR has an angular bias of 27 deg/hr, and s Pixel 7 Pro is 10x more accurate at 1.9 deg/hr. Over 7 minutes, that is an error of 3.2 deg and 0.2 deg respectively. And that’s just using the cheap gyro in your phone! SpaceX is probably using <a href="https://aerospace.honeywell.com/us/en/products-and-services/product/hardware-and-systems/sensors/inertial-measurement-units">a nicer “tactical grade” MEMS gyro</a> with 10x more stability at ~0.25 deg/hr (0.03 deg over 7 minutes), or all the way to “navigation grade” ring laser gyros, which can be 100x more accurate that that. This analysis is very rough, and linear error accumulation ignores other sources of error such as scale factors, bias instability, temperature sensitivity, and G-loading sensitivity. But it also ignores fancier sensor fusion techniques you can use by combining multiple sensors, as well as calibration techniques. So it’s a good order-of-magnitude look.</p>



<p>Perhaps surprisingly, I expect that this error will be dominated by the measurement error of the initial orientation. Ensuring that the rocket is perfectly vertical can be a surprisingly tricky problem. You can measure exterior markers using laser range finding, and you can measure the local gravity vector using accelerometer measurements. But how do you account for mechanical strain under propellant load and thermal contraction which might change the orientation of the IMU during fill operations, and throughout flight? How do you account for mechanical machining tolerances where surfaces are not manufactured perfectly flat and change the static mounting orientation of the IMU relative to other components? Will that thermal deformation be symmetric, or tend to tilt your IMU one way or another? These effects and more can be measured and analyzed, but never perfectly compensated for, especially with very little flight history. I do still expect that the error here will be well under 1 deg.</p>

<h5><strong>How Accurately Can SpaceX Control Attitude?</strong></h5>



<p>This can also get arbitrarily precise. Based on eyeballing their Falcon 9 landings, I would guess that SpaceX can definitely control landing attitude to well under 1 degree of error in each of its pitch/yaw/roll axes. The Super Heavy trajectory divert just before landing from a safe impact location to the chopsticks is a much more dynamic maneuver than Falcon 9’s landing, but for much the same reasons as its better position accuracy I would expect better attitude control on the Super Heavy booster.</p>



<p>But again, a full accounting here must be downstream of flight simulations which take into account dynamics and uncertainties.</p>

<p><strong>Pitch</strong>: The head of the pin has a ball joint that connects it to its support structure, and allows it to pivot a bit to accommodate angular error in pitch and yaw. Pitch is the direction of travel as the booster flies in towards the launch mounts and the most dynamic. But it appears that the booster flies to a point a bit above the launch pins, and then lowers itself vertically down. So the dynamic movements should largely be done prior to catch. Any error in the pitch direction would potentially cause the booster to “swing” back and forth towards the tower once it landed, but I don’t see anything inherently wrong with this from a structural perspective. From measuring the booster on the chopsticks, there is likely at least 15 degrees of swing towards the tower that could be accommodated without hitting it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-2.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="530" height="593" src="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-2.png?resize=530%2C593&amp;ssl=1" alt=""></a></figure></div>


<p><strong>Yaw</strong>: I think this is likely the angle with the tightest tolerance. Over a roughly 10 meter pin-to-pin distance, every 1 degree of yaw error will result in a 17 cm vertical offset with one pin hitting a catch arm before the other. The catch rails are mounted on pistons which can move vertically by about 85 cm. These could be meant for shock absorption, or they could be meant to differentially lower during a landing event with high yaw. With 85 cm of travel distance, these could offset exactly 5 deg of yaw error – a suspiciously nice number if I put my design requirements hat on!</p>



<p>During the first catch attempt the booster was almost perfectly vertical, and we saw hardly any compression of these rails on first touch. They lowered evenly about half a second after the booster had landed and settled on the rail. So there doesn’t seem to be any “baseline” shock absorption happening. Either this is because this was a clean landing and the shock absorption was not needed, or these are primarily for yaw error compensation. If you didn’t compensate for yaw, then you would impart large twisting forces on the catch arm structure with one pin hitting before the other. This can certainly be designed for, but this adds a lot of further mass needed for structural rigidity and my guess is that the SpaceX engineers would much prefer that the arms be evenly loaded.</p>



<p>The other factor helping SpaceX mitigate yaw errors is that the two arms squeezing the booster will tend to push it towards vertical in that axis. You can somewhat see this in the landing video.</p>



<h5>Attitude / Orientation Summary</h5>



<p>I expect that the Super Heavy booster has attitude knowledge and attitude control both well under 1 degree in all axes. I believe the catch requirements are roughly ± 10 deg in roll, ± 15 deg in pitch, and ± 5 deg in yaw. So under a nominal landing without any hardware failures, SpaceX will have a factor of at least 10x performance margin to requirements. </p>



<p>This margin is large enough that I expect attitude on landing is robust to failure of 1 of the 3 landing engines. With one engine out, the other two would only need to gimbal (very roughly) 2 deg to point through the center of mass, and the booster would come in tilted by that angle in pitch / yaw. But this can be handled with still plenty of angular margin. Whether only two engines have enough thrust to set the rocket down softly is another question.</p>

<h2>Controlling Velocity &amp; Angular Rate</h2>



<h5>Velocity Accuracy</h5>



<p>GPS is much more accurate at measuring velocity than position. Consumer GPS can be accurate to within 1-2 cm/s by measuring the doppler shift of the GPS signal frequency. Perhaps surprisingly, this is about as good as it gets – even going to RTK doesn’t appreciably improve the accuracy of velocity measurements. During a rocket landing, the vibrations and heavy accelerations will likely degrade this a bit. Using the same IMU as above with 0.01 milli-g acceleration drift over 420 seconds, the dead reckoning integrates up to an error of 4.1 cm/s. The numbers here are close enough that likely neither sensor dominates, and a fused approach is used. For example, if the booster can get a GPS reading of velocity at 1 cm/s just before landing burn ignition, the IMU alone could keep the error at about that level for the final 20 seconds of flight.</p>



<h5>Angular Rate Accuracy</h5>



<p>If we dig into the spec sheet for a cheap consumer IMU like the <a data-type="link" data-id="https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/icm-42688-p/" href="https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/icm-42688-p/">ICM-42688-P</a>, we see ±15.625 deg/s gyro accuracy at 16 bits of precision, for a resolution of 0.0005 deg/s. Scale factors, gryo bias, and temperature effects will worsen the true accuracy, but these can be largely corrected for. Vehicle modes and heavy vibrations will also inject error into the signal, but this can be filtered out. The point is that this is already 100x the accuracy you might need. Since the gyro measures angular rate directly, the error here is bounded and does not integrate up higher. SpaceX will also undoubtedly be using a nicer gyroscope than this.</p>



<h5>Capability &amp; Requirements</h5>



<p>It’s unclear how accurately SpaceX needs to control velocity and angular rate. This will be driven by the strength of the tower and catch arms to accommodate the force of stopping a moving rocket flying into it. True capability here is also hard to estimate since it is such an incredibly dynamic event. Falcon 9 shows us that SpaceX is very good at performing the hoverslam maneuver for a soft touchdown on a hard surface, and for the same reasons as before the Super Heavy booster should be easier to control. But simulations are again needed to answer this question rigorously, and no one outside SpaceX has all the data needed to do those.</p>



<h2>So What’s the Hard Part?</h2>



<p>SpaceX isn’t using magic to control their rockets. While the size of the booster gives the impression of impossible GNC precision needed to land back in the chopstick arms, it should not come as a surprise that SpaceX actually developed a system with large safety margins using sound engineering principles. They would not have attempted a catch landing without confidence that it could work.</p>



<p>But there’s a large difference between something that could work in theory, and actually work in reality. Spaceflight is such a difficult field of engineering because there is such low margin for failure – a rocket is made up of millions of individual parts, most of which have zero redundancy. The margins in landing position and orientation I look at here only matter if you can get back to the launch pad in the first place. Countless little things could go wrong, and any one of them will end with your rocket blowing up. Gravity is a relentless opponent to fight.</p>



<p>So what do I personally find most impressive about this launch?</p>



<ul>
<li>The real-time solver that generates new reference trajectories to land the booster under hard fuel constraints (SpaceX has a lot of experience with this for Falcon 9, but they are still the only ones who can do this and I remain impressed every time – shoutout to <a href="http://www.larsblackmore.com/index.htm">Lars Blackmore</a>).</li>



<li>The real-time link that seems to exist between the tower and the vehicle during the catch event, which is a new system and would be hard to test.</li>



<li>The speed at which SpaceX is iterating, building, and testing Starship, which blows the rest of the industry out of the water.</li>



<li>The sheer guts it took to risk blowing up the pad during a catch attempt after only one booster touchdown test, in a maneuver that no one has ever done before.</li>



<li>The fact that everything worked first try! There were no unknown unknowns that derailed the catch, no mismatches in configuration tracking with the upgrades rolling into every single vehicle, no engineering assumptions that were too loose, no tricky differences between test and flight, no machining/build errors that would break parts.</li>
</ul>



<p>SpaceX has demonstrated once again that they are performing at the pinnacle of engineering and operational excellence. It seems to me that the question is no longer <em>if </em>Starship will be successful in revolutionizing access to space by slashing launch costs, but <em>when</em>. Hats off to the team for reaching this milestone in such a spectacular fashion, and for sharing the journey so publicly. The videos never get old.</p>

		<p>TAMPA, Fla. —&nbsp;The Intelsat 33e satellite has broken up in geostationary orbit (GEO) and lost power, ceasing communications services for customers across Europe, Africa and parts of Asia Pacific.

</p><p>Intelsat said in an Oct. 19 news release it is working with satellite maker Boeing to address an anomaly that emerged earlier that day, but “believe it is unlikely that the satellite will be recoverable.” An Intelsat spokesperson said the satellite was not insured at the time of the issue.

</p><p>The U.S. Space Force reported Oct. 19 it is tracking around 20 pieces of debris associated with the spacecraft.

</p><p>“U.S. Space Forces-Space (S4S) has confirmed the breakup of Intelsat 33E (#41748, 2016-053B) in GEO on October 19, 2024, at approximately 0430 UTC,” <a href="https://www.space-track.org/">states an alert posted on SpaceTrack</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense’s space-tracking platform.&nbsp;

</p><p>“Currently tracking around 20 associated pieces – analysis ongoing. S4S has observed no immediate threats and is continuing to conduct routine conjunction assessments to support the safety and sustainability of the space domain.”

</p><p>Douglas Hendrix, CEO of ExoAnalytic Solutions, said the U.S.-based space-tracking company identified 57 pieces of debris Oct. 21 associated with the breakup.

</p>

<p>“We are warning operators of any spacecraft that we think are at risk of collision,” Hendrix said via email.

<p>The IOCCC Flight Simulator was the winning entry in the 1998 International Obfuscated C Code Contest. It is a flight simulator in under 2 kilobytes of code, complete with relatively accurate 6-degree-of-freedom dynamics, loadable wireframe scenery, and a small instrument panel.</p>



<p>IOCCC Flight Simulator runs on Unix-like systems with X Windows. As per contest rules, it is in the public domain.</p>



<h3>Documentation</h3>



<h4>Introduction</h4>



<p>You have just stepped out of the real world and into the virtual. You are now sitting in the cockpit of a Piper Cherokee airplane, heading north, flying 1000 feet above ground level.</p>



<p>Use the keyboard to fly the airplane. The arrow keys represent the control stick. Press the Up Arrow key to push the stick forward. Press the left arrow key to move the stick left, and so on. Press Enter to re-center the stick. Use Page Up and Page Down increase and decrease the throttle, respectively. (The rudder is automatically coordinated with the turn rate, so rudder pedals are not represented.)</p>



<p>On your display, you will see on the bottom left corner three instruments. The first is the airspeed indicator; it tells you how fast you’re going in knots. The second is the heading indicator, or compass. 0 is north, 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west. The third instrument is the altimeter, which measures your height above ground level in feet.</p>



<h4>Usage</h4>



<p>To use, type:</p>



<pre><code>
cat horizon.sc pittsburgh.sc | ./banks
</code>
</pre>



<p>banks is the name of the program (a quirk of IOCCC rules, and no pun intended). horizon.sc and pittsburgh.sc are scenery files.</p>



<h4>Features</h4>



<ul>
<li>Simulator models a Piper Cherokee, which is a light, single-engine, propeller-driven airplane.</li>
<li>The airplane is modeled as a six degree-of-freedom rigid body, accurately reflecting its dynamics (for normal flight conditions, at least).</li>
<li>Fly through a virtual 3-D world, while sitting at your X console.</li>
<li>Loadable scenery files.</li>
<li>Head-up display contains three instruments: a true airspeed indicator, a heading indicator (compass), and an altimeter.</li>
<li>Flight controls may be mapped to any keys at compile time by redefining the macros in the build file. Nice if your keyboard doesn’t have arrow keys.</li>
<li>Time step size can be set at compile time. This is useful to reduce flicker on network X connections. (But be careful: step sizes longer than about 0.03 seconds tend to have numerical stability problems.)</li>
<li>Airplane never stalls!</li>
<li>Airplane never runs out of fuel!</li>
</ul>



<h4>Scenery</h4>



<p>Each of the <cite>*.sc</cite> files is a scenery file. The simulator program reads in the scenery from standard input on startup. You may input more than one scenery file, as long as there are less than 1000 total lines of input.</p>



<p>Here is a brief description of the scenery files:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>horizon.sc</strong> – A horizon, nothing more. You will probably always want to input this piece of scenery.</li>
<li><strong>mountains.sc</strong> – An alternate horizon; a little more mountainous.</li>
<li><strong>pittsburgh.sc</strong> – Scenery of downtown Pittsburgh. The downtown area is initially located to your right.</li>
<li><strong>bb.sc</strong> – Simple obstacle course. Try to fly over the buildings and under the bridges.</li>
<li><strong>pyramids.sc</strong> – Fly over the tombs of the ancient Pharaohs in this (fictitious) Egyptian landscape.</li>
<li><strong>river.sc</strong> – Follow a flowing river from the sky.</li>
</ul>



<p>A few examples of how to input scenery:</p>



<pre><code>
cat horizon.sc pittsburgh.sc | ./banks
cat mountains.sc bb.sc | ./banks
cat mountains.sc river.sc pyramids.sc | ./banks
</code>
</pre>



<p>You can simulate flying through a cloud bank as well:</p>



<pre><code>
./banks &lt; /dev/null
</code>
</pre>



<p>You will usually want at least a horizon, though.</p>



<p>The format of scenery files is simple, by the way. They’re just a list of 3-D coordinates, and the simulator simply draws line segments from point to point as listed in the scenery file. 0 0 0 is used to end a series of consecutive line segments. Note that in the coordinate system used, the third coordinate represents altitude in a negative sense: negative numbers are positive altitudes.</p>



<p>I’m sure you’ll be making your own scenery files very soon!!!</p>



<h4>Alternate Build Instructions</h4>



<p>Several options must be passed to the compiler to make the build work. The provided build file has the appropriate options set to default values. Use this section if you want to compile with different options.</p>



<p>To map a key to a control, you must pass an option to the compiler in the format “-Dcontrol=key”. The possible controls you can map are described in the table below:</p>



<pre><code>
Control  Description           Default Key
-------  --------------------- -----------
IT       Open throttle         XK_Page_Up
DT       Close throttle        XK_Page_Down
FD       Move stick forward    XK_Up
BK       Move stick back       XK_Down
LT       Move stick left       XK_Left
RT       Move stick right      XK_Right
CS       Center stick          XK_Enter
</code>
</pre>



<p>Values for the possible keys can be found in the X Windows header file &lt;X11/keysym.h&gt;. This file is most likely a cross-reference to another header, &lt;X11/keysymdef.h&gt;.</p>



<p>You must map all seven controls to keys at compile time, or the compilation will fail.</p>



<p>For example, to map Center Stick to the space-bar, the compile option would be “-DCS=XK_space”.</p>



<p>To set the time step size, you must pass the following option to the compiler: “-Ddt=duration”, where dt is literal, and where duration is the time in seconds you want the time step to be.</p>



<p>Two things to keep in mind when selecting a time step. Time steps that are too large (more than about 0.03) will cause numerical stability problems and should be avoided. Setting the time step to be smaller than your clock resolution will slow down the simulator, because the system pauses for more time than the simulator expects.</p>



<p>The best advice is to set time step size to your system timer resolution. Try a
longer period if you’re getting too much flicker.</p>



<h3>Screen Shots</h3>



<p>Here we are flying towards Downtown Pittsburgh. We can see the Point, several buildings including the USX tower, and several bridges including the Smithfield Street bridge. We see three instruments near the bottom.</p>

<h3>About the IOCCC Entry</h3>



<p>IOCCC stands for “International Obfuscated C Code Contest.” It is an quasi-annual contest to see who can write the most unreadable, unintelligible, unmanagable, but legal C program.</p>



<p>In the 1998 IOCCC, My flight simulator won the “Best of Show” prize. Here is the source code to the program:</p>

<p>Note that this program will not compile out-of-the-box. It requires certain compile-time parameters. The folloing script builds it on my Linux system:</p>



<pre><code>
#! /bin/sh
cc banks.c -o banks -DIT=XK_Page_Up -DDT=XK_Page_Down \
        -DUP=XK_Up -DDN=XK_Down -DLT=XK_Left -DRT=XK_Right \
        -DCS=XK_Return -Ddt=0.02 -lm -lX11 -L/usr/X11R6/lib
</code>
</pre>



<p>If you want to try this program, I suggest you download the <a href="http://www0.us.ioccc.org/years.html#1998">1998 IOCCC Winners Distribution</a>.</p>



<p>One of the rules of the contest was that the program could not be longer than 1536 bytes (excluding spaces, tabs, newlines, semicolons, and braces). Needless to say, cramming a flight simulator into such a small file was fairly difficult. I will say that if it weren’t for the wonderful property of orthogonal matrices, this flight simulator would not have been possible.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Erin is a simple and self-hostable service that enables you to view your own clips using TikTok's well-known vertical swipe feed.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dogl9d/selfhost_a_site_for_short_videos_like_tiktok/" rel="nofollow">A request was made on Reddit</a>
for a self-hostable app that can show filtered videos using TikTok's interface, so I made it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Erin has all these features implemented :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Display your own videos using TikTok's swipe feed</li>
<li>Mask the videos you don't want to see in your feed*</li>
<li>Choose which feed you want to play**</li>
<li>Autoplay your feed without even swiping</li>
<li>Seek forward and backward using your keyboard, or using double taps</li>
<li>Show video metadata using TikTok's UI***</li>
<li>Simple lazy-loading mechanism for your videos</li>
<li>Automatic clip naming based on file name</li>
<li>Simple and optional security using a master password</li>
<li>Support for HTTP and HTTPS</li>
<li>Support for Docker / proxy deployment</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">On top of these, please note that Erin is only a React app powered entirely by <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy">Caddy</a>.
Caddy takes care of authentication, serving static files, and serving the React app all at once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">*: You can mask videos to hide them from your feed. Should you want to see which videos were masked, and even unmask them, you can long-press the <code>Mask</code> button, and the manager will open.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">**: By default, Erin will create a random feed from all the videos in your folder and its subdirectories. However, if you would like to create custom feeds, you can set your URL to any of the subdirectories path. For example: <code>https://my-server.tld/directory-a</code> will create a feed from the videos located in the <code>/directory-a</code> directory, and it works with any path (so, nested folders are supported).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">***: You can show a channel (with an avatar and name), a caption and a link for all your videos using a metadata file. The metadata file can be located anywhere inside your videos folder, and it must match its associated video's filename, while replacing the extension with JSON. For example: <code>my-video.mp4</code> can have its metadata in <code>my-video.json</code>. The metadata format <a href="https://github.com/will-moss/erin/blob/master/examples/video-metadata.json">is shown here</a>, and note that you can use raw HTML in the caption for custom styling and effects.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Deployment and Examples</h2><a id="user-content-deployment-and-examples" aria-label="Permalink: Deployment and Examples" href="#deployment-and-examples"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Before proceeding, regardless of Docker, Docker Compose, or a standalone deployment, please make sure
that you have created a <code>videos</code> directory containing all your video files. Later on, this directory will
be made available to your instance of Erin (by binding a volume to your Docker container, or putting the directory
next to your Caddyfile).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Deploy with Docker</h3><a id="user-content-deploy-with-docker" aria-label="Permalink: Deploy with Docker" href="#deploy-with-docker"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can run Erin with Docker on the command line very quickly.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the following commands :</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Create a .env file

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Deploy with Docker Compose</h3><a id="user-content-deploy-with-docker-compose" aria-label="Permalink: Deploy with Docker Compose" href="#deploy-with-docker-compose"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To help you get started quickly, a few example <code>docker-compose</code> files are located in the <a href="https://github.com/will-moss/erin/blob/master/examples">"examples/"</a> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's a description of every example :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>docker-compose.simple.yml</code>: Run Erin as a front-facing service on port 443, with environment variables supplied in the <code>docker-compose</code> file directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>docker-compose.proxy.yml</code>: A setup with Erin running on port 80, behind a proxy listening on port 443.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">When your <code>docker-compose</code> file is on point, you can use the following commands :</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Run Erin in the current terminal (useful for debugging)
docker-compose up

# Run Erin in a detached terminal (most common)
docker-compose up -d

# Show the logs written by Erin (useful for debugging)

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note :</strong> When using <code>docker-compose.yml</code> environment variables, if your password hash contains dollar signs: double them all, or else the app will crash.
For example : <code>$ab$cd$efxyz</code> becomes <code>$$ab$$cd$$efxyz</code>. This is due to caveats with <code>docker-compose</code> string interpolation system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Troubleshoot</h2><a id="user-content-troubleshoot" aria-label="Permalink: Troubleshoot" href="#troubleshoot"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Should you encounter any issue running Erin, please refer to the following common problems that may occur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If none of these matches your case, feel free to open an issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Erin is unreachable over HTTP / HTTPS</h4><a id="user-content-erin-is-unreachable-over-http--https" aria-label="Permalink: Erin is unreachable over HTTP / HTTPS" href="#erin-is-unreachable-over-http--https"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Erin sits on top of a Caddy web server.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a result :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You may be able to better troubleshoot the issue by reading your container logs.</li>
<li>You can check the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/concepts#addresses" rel="nofollow">official Caddy documentation regarding addresses</a>.</li>
<li>You can check the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https" rel="nofollow">official Caddy documentation regarding HTTPS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Other than that, please make sure that the following requirements are met :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">If Erin runs as a standalone application without proxy :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Make sure your server / firewall accepts incoming connections on Erin's port.</li>
<li>Make sure your DNS configuration is correct. (Usually, such record should suffice : <code>A erin XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX</code> for <code>https://erin.your-server-tld</code>)</li>
<li>Make sure your <code>.env</code> file is well configured according to the <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If Erin runs inside Docker / behind a proxy :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Perform the previous (standalone) verifications first.</li>
<li>Make sure that <code>PUBLIC_URL</code> is well set in <code>.env</code>.</li>
<li>Check your proxy forwarding rules.</li>
<li>Check your Docker networking setup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In any case, the crucial part is <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> and reading the official Caddy documentation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Erin says that no video was found on my server</h4><a id="user-content-erin-says-that-no-video-was-found-on-my-server" aria-label="Permalink: Erin says that no video was found on my server" href="#erin-says-that-no-video-was-found-on-my-server"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For Erin to serve your video files, those must respect the following requirements :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The file extension is one of <code>.mp4</code>, <code>.ogg</code>, <code>.webm</code>. (There are the only extensions supported by web browsers.)</li>
<li>The files are located in <code>/srv/videos</code> on your Docker container using a volume.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To make sure that your videos are inside your Docker container and in the right place, you can :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Run <code>docker exec -it &lt;NAME-OF-YOUR-CONTAINER&gt; sh</code></li>
<li>Inside the newly-opened shell, run : <code>ls /srv/videos</code></li>
<li>You should see your video files here. If not, then check your volume-binding.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If Erin is still unable to find your videos despite everything being well-configured, please open an issue
including the output of your browser's Javascript console and network tab when the request goes to <code>/media/</code>.
It may have to do with browser-caching, invalid configuration, or invalid credentials.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How can I add new videos to my feed?</h4><a id="user-content-how-can-i-add-new-videos-to-my-feed" aria-label="Permalink: How can I add new videos to my feed?" href="#how-can-i-add-new-videos-to-my-feed"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For now, you should just put your new video files into your videos directory that is mounted with Docker.
Erin will automatically pick up these new files, and when you refresh your browser you'll see them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How should I name my video files?</h4><a id="user-content-how-should-i-name-my-video-files" aria-label="Permalink: How should I name my video files?" href="#how-should-i-name-my-video-files"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Erin will automatically translate your file name into a title to display on the interface.</p>
<p dir="auto">The conversion operated is as follows :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>-</code> becomes <code> </code></li>
<li><code>__</code> becomes <code>-</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here's a few examples to help you name your files :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>Vegas-trip__Clip-1.mp4</code> becomes <code>Vegas trip - Clip 1</code></li>
<li><code>Spanish-language__Lesson-1.mp4</code> becomes <code>Spanish language - Lesson 1</code></li>
<li><code>Spiderman-1.ogg</code> becomes <code>Spiderman 1</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">In what order will my files appear in the feed?</h4><a id="user-content-in-what-order-will-my-files-appear-in-the-feed" aria-label="Permalink: In what order will my files appear in the feed?" href="#in-what-order-will-my-files-appear-in-the-feed"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Erin randomly shuffles your video files on every browser refresh.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a result, there is no specific order for your videos to appear.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Some of my videos seem to be missing or not loaded at all</h4><a id="user-content-some-of-my-videos-seem-to-be-missing-or-not-loaded-at-all" aria-label="Permalink: Some of my videos seem to be missing or not loaded at all" href="#some-of-my-videos-seem-to-be-missing-or-not-loaded-at-all"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For now, Erin will only attempt to retrieve the videos that have a supported extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">Supported extensions are : <code>.webm</code>, <code>.mp4</code>, and <code>.ogg</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, please note that Safari doesn't seem to support <code>.ogg</code>, hence these videos will be ignored for Safari users.</p>
<p dir="auto">Should you have any advice or idea to support more extensions (especially for Safari users), please feel free to open an issue.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">My custom password doesn't work</h4><a id="user-content-my-custom-password-doesnt-work" aria-label="Permalink: My custom password doesn't work" href="#my-custom-password-doesnt-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There seems to be a few caveats when using Docker / Docker Compose with Caddy-generated password hashes.</p>
<p dir="auto">These are the rules you should follow :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If you deployed Erin using the Docker CLI, via the command <code>docker run ... --env-file .env ...</code>, then your <code>AUTH_SECRET</code> should have no quote at all, and all the dollar signs should stay as they are without escape or doubling</li>
<li>If you deployed Erin using Docker Compose, via a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, then your <code>AUTH_SECRET</code> should have its dollar signs doubled. Example : <code>i$am$groot</code> becomes <code>i$$am$$groot</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">That said, remember that your password hash must be generated with the following command :</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker run caddy caddy hash-password --plaintext &quot;your-new-password&quot;"><pre>docker run caddy caddy hash-password --plaintext <span><span>"</span>your-new-password<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Something else</h4><a id="user-content-something-else" aria-label="Permalink: Something else" href="#something-else"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Please feel free to open an issue, explaining what happens, and describing your environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Credits</h2><a id="user-content-credits" aria-label="Permalink: Credits" href="#credits"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Hey hey ! It's always a good idea to say thank you and mention the people and projects that help us move forward.</p>
<p dir="auto">Big thanks to the individuals / teams behind these projects :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/cauemustafa/tik-tok-clone">tik-tok-clone</a> : For the base TikTok UI and smooth interaction.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy">Caddy</a> : For the lightweight and powerful web server.</li>
<li>The countless others!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And don't forget to mention Erin if you like it or if it helps you in any way!</p>

<p>Not all CPUs are created equal, and performance can vary significantly between different architectures and configurations. AWS’s c6g instances use ARM-based Graviton2 processors, which offer excellent performance per dollar for certain workloads but may present compatibility issues with software not optimized for ARM architecture. When selecting an x86-based instance like AWS’s m7a.2xlarge (8 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM), which utilizes AMD EPYC processors, the cost increases to <strong>$405.47</strong> per month—making it over <strong>5 times more expensive</strong> than Hetzner’s CPX51. </p><h3 id="hidden-costs-in-aws-and-azure">Hidden Costs in AWS and Azure</h3><p>Beyond the base pricing, AWS and Azure often introduce additional expenses that can impact the total cost of ownership:</p><ul><li>Storage Costs: EBS volumes (AWS) and Managed Disks (Azure) are billed separately.</li><li>Data Transfer Fees: Charges apply for data movement between services and outbound internet traffic, which can accumulate based on usage patterns.</li><li>Complex Pricing Models: Layered pricing structures and a multitude of service offerings can make cost estimation and budgeting more challenging.</li></ul><p>In contrast, Hetzner offers straightforward, nearly all-inclusive pricing, simplifying budget management and reducing the risk of unexpected charges. Yes, there are disadvantages about managing your own infrastructure, and we will cover them in the following chapters.</p><h2 id="adequate-performance-and-reliability">Adequate Performance and Reliability</h2><p>For many manufacturing companies and system integrators, the primary requirement is reliable application hosting without the need for massive scaling or global distribution. Most workloads in the manufacturing sector continue to operate on <a href="https://learn.umh.app/lesson/introduction-into-it-ot-system-administration/">virtual machines</a>, often running on-premises Windows servers. In such contexts, the advanced features and managed services offered by AWS and Azure may be excessive and unnecessarily complex.</p><p>Many organizations have small IT teams—sometimes as few as one person—responsible for managing Industrial IoT applications and infrastructure. These teams need straightforward, cost-effective solutions that align with their existing skill sets. Starting with a couple of VMs on Hetzner allows companies to begin their journey into modern IT infrastructure without incurring high costs or requiring specialized personnel.</p><p>In contrast, adopting AWS or Azure from the outset can require a steep learning curve and may necessitate hiring additional staff with specialized expertise. We experienced this firsthand: we spent several weeks trying to perform simple administrative tasks on AWS, such as adding a billing administrator, and found the process unnecessarily complicated.</p><p><strong>Do you really need the advanced features of AWS and Azure right now?

That is a failed market.”</blockquote><p>These perspectives reflect a larger industry movement: companies are reevaluating the cost-benefit equation of major cloud providers, especially when high expenses don’t translate into proportional advantages.</p><h2 id="conclusion-what-has-this-to-do-with-umh">Conclusion: What has this to do with UMH?</h2><p>To get started with the <a href="https://www.umh.app/?ref=learn.umh.app" rel="noreferrer">UMH</a>, you need to install it via the <a href="https://management.umh.app/?ref=learn.umh.app" rel="noreferrer">Management Console</a>, either locally using the experimental Docker container or in a virtual machine.</p><p>If you don’t have an on-premises VM, you don’t need to use AWS or Azure either! By choosing Hetzner, you can deploy a UMH cloud instance for approximately <strong>$32 per month</strong>, compared to several hundred dollars on AWS or Azure. This makes it a much easier sell to conservative manufacturing companies, as <strong>the initial proof of concept (PoC) with the free community edition of UMH and a Hetzner cloud instance costs just a $32 per month of software and infrastructure costs</strong>.</p><p>In conclusion, if you’re just getting started and are not yet locked into AWS or Azure, Hetzner offers a cost-effective, reliable, and straightforward alternative. It allows you to deploy applications like UMH without incurring excessive costs or dealing with unnecessary complexity.</p>

</a>Italy has an administrative blocking mechanism and a technical blocking platform, Piracy Shield, operated by rightsholders in the private sector. </p>
<p>Up until now, AGCOM, Italy’s independent telecoms regulator, has been Piracy Shield’s greatest supporter, at least of those not already benefiting financially from the activities of football league Serie A, currently the only beneficiary of Piracy Shield blocking. </p>
<p>To the extent there’s much of a ‘public’ component to Piracy Shield’s activities in Italy, the ‘private’ absolutely dominates. There’s almost zero transparency and any information of any use is routinely withheld from the public, even when that information relates directly to the public. People who demand access to information are routinely ignored, even punished. The only people never punished are those operating Piracy Shield, no matter how big the blunder or how many people are affected.</p>
<p>After blocking Cloudflare a few months ago, on Saturday night another vital online service was rendered inaccessible. The nature and circumstances of this event should be a signal for the Italian government to remove rightsholders’ ability to meddle in internet infrastructure before it’s too late. The details make for very uncomfortable reading.</p>
<h2>Warnings Pile Up, All Ignored, Again and Again</h2>
<p>When reporting on the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/piracy-shield-cloudflare-disaster-blocks-countless-sites-fires-up-opposition-240226/">Cloudflare debacle</a> in February, we included commentary from Giorgio Bonfiglio, Principal Technical Account Manager at Amazon Web Services. </p>
<p>Bonfiglio’s expert advice was ignored before, during, and after last year’s introduction of new law to support blocking, despite predicting the Cloudflare problem before it actually became one. As far as we can determine, Bonfiglio was first to link Google Drive’s outage on Saturday evening with Piracy Shield blocking.</p>
<p>“Piracy Shield blocked a Google Drive domain,” Bonfiglio <a href="https://x.com/g_bonfiglio/status/1847728976933904453">revealed</a> on X, along with the AGCOM notice displayed on the blocked domain.</p>

<p>The domain/subdomain blocked in the image above is <em>drive.usercontent.google.com</em>; not only does this URL clearly identify Google as its owner, the Google product it serves is on full display too. With no prompting a 10-year-old could identify google.com as important on the internet. So, three broad explanations for how it ended up on the system (ticket below) before causing chaos.</p>
<p><em>1. Domain was accidentally entered into the system, then evaded all subsequent checks<br>
2. Domain was knowingly entered into the system, then evaded all subsequent checks<br>
3. Domain was knowingly entered into the system, and then passed, regardless of risk</em></p>

<p>For good measure, the relevant Google IP address [142.250.180.129] was also entered into Piracy Shield to be blocked by local ISPs; <a href="https://x.com/g_bonfiglio/status/1847729915858211314/photo/2">this image</a> shows how access to that IP degraded unlike an adjacent one.</p>
<p>Those hoping to access Google Drive were subject to domain hijacking instead, with requests diverted to a blocking page hosted at different IP addresses depending on the ISP involved; 195.162.95.240 [Sky] and 34.110.214.49 [TIM], for example.</p>
<h2>Blocking in 30 Minutes, Unblocking…whenever</h2>
<p>The domain/IP address block began to take effect a little time after 6pm and as the image below shows, three smaller ‘downtime peaks’ were followed by an almost total degradation of service around 9pm. This seems to show that blunders take at least three hours to fix, even a massive one like this. More tellingly, the constant claim of blocking internet resources within 30 mins is at best, very optimistic indeed.</p>
<p>We took a look at Google Trends data for Italy during the same period. The top five queries in Italy all relate to Google Drive (right) and on the left, the topic ‘Google Drive’ dominates by a very wide margin. Nevertheless, the results are sensitive enough to identify AGCOM and piracy as connected to the trending searches. </p>

<p>More data is needed to draw firm conclusions but under both columns, Google Drive competitor ‘One Drive’ gets a mention. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to conclude that faced with no access to their files on Google Drive, searching for a replacement would be a logical step. The hidden costs of overblocking are perhaps not quite so hidden here.</p>
<h2>Full Unblocking Doesn’t Take 30 mins</h2>
<p>A full twelve hours after the block was put in place, around 20% of the Italian population still had no access to their Google Drives due to the lingering IP address block that underpinned the domain-based blocking.</p>

<p>Had this disaster happened on a weekday, who knows the damage it could’ve caused. Luckily it didn’t, and everyone can be grateful for that, but the word ‘luck’ in a sentence to describe an event that should not have happened, period, understates the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>Whether there will be explanation of any kind on Monday is currently unknown, but there is no explaining this one away. Explanations for the Cloudflare block began with denial, slowly moved towards claims it was only a tiny, tiny block that didn’t last long, before Cloudflare was blamed for having a customer allegedly pirating football matches.</p>
<h2>Drastic Action Required Immediately</h2>
<p>Incompetence doesn’t qualify as an excuse, not when a Google domain is part of the equation. So if not incompetence, surely it must’ve been deliberate? Whatever the reason or excuse, the conclusion is the same; this cannot be allowed to continue, and the government must step in before the unthinkable happens. </p>
<p>Since users are about to be fined for piracy, an alternative would be to introduce heavy fines, directly linked to the potential damage to companies, infrastructure or government, plus compensation paid to citizens, for those who overblock.</p>
<p>Let’s say, a population of 59 million in Italy, a conservative 30 million Google users, one euro compensation each, leading to a 30 million euro fine. It won’t stop incompetence, but it should focus the mind during the 30-day ban on any additional blocking or until the fine is paid in full, whichever comes last.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <p>Remember when being a “Senior Software Engineer” actually meant something? I do, and I can’t help but feel nostalgic for that clarity. In recent years, our industry has witnessed rampant title inflation, turning what used to be a clear-cut junior-mid-senior progression into a confusing parade of inflated roles.</p>
<p>The “senior” title, once a badge of substantial experience and expertise, has been particularly devalued. Today, developers are being crowned “senior” faster than ever, often with just three to four years under their belts. It’s as if the path to seniority, once a marathon of skill-building and diverse experiences, has turned into a sprinter’s dash.</p>
<p>This explosion of grandiose titles isn’t just confusing—it’s eroding the meaning of career milestones in tech. Each new title tries to outdo the last in impressiveness, while paradoxically meaning less and less. For everyone involved—from job seekers to hiring managers—this inflation has muddied the waters of professional progression and recognition.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-senior-engineer-anyway">What is a “Senior” Engineer Anyway?</h3>
<p>Being a senior engineer meant far more than just logging years on the job. It was a title earned through a diverse set of experiences and challenges that shaped not just their technical skills, but their entire approach to software development.</p>
<p>A true senior engineer is a battle-tested problem solver. They’ve faced and conquered complex technical challenges across multiple projects, dealing with more than just tricky bugs. These are the architects who’ve untangled system-wide issues that require deep understanding and creative solutions. They’re the ones who can navigate and refactor sprawling legacy codebases with confidence, understanding the delicate balance between maintaining existing systems and building new ones.</p>
<p>Senior engineers have been through the crucible of major production outages. They’ve felt the heat of a system melting down in real-time and learned to stay calm under pressure. These experiences have taught them to diagnose issues rapidly and lead a team through a crisis, making critical decisions when every second counts.</p>
<p>But technical skills alone don’t make a senior engineer. They’re also architectural visionaries who can see beyond immediate tasks to design scalable, maintainable systems. Their decisions positively impact projects years down the line, showcasing a level of foresight that only comes with extensive experience. They’ve developed the soft skills to be effective mentors and leaders, guiding junior developers not just in coding, but in navigating the complex landscape of software development.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, senior engineers remain humble and curious despite their experience. They’re continuous learners, adapting to new technologies and methodologies, always expanding their toolkit. They’ve developed a strong sense of professional ethics, understanding the broader implications of their work and advocating for responsible development practices.</p>
<p>This depth of experience isn’t typically gained in just a few years. It’s forged through diverse projects, multiple tech stacks, and yes, a fair share of failures and lessons learned along the way.</p>
<h3 id="the-root-cause-of-title-inflation">The Root Cause Of Title Inflation</h3>
<p>The fierce competition for talent has led companies, especially startups, to use titles as a retention tactic. Unable to always match the salaries offered by tech giants, these companies resort to inflating titles as a form of non-monetary compensation. While this might seem like a clever short-term solution, it’s creating long-term problems for the industry by diluting the meaning of these titles.</p>
<p>The rise of professional networking platforms like LinkedIn has exacerbated this issue. These platforms have turned titles into personal branding tools, creating immense pressure for individuals to sport impressive-sounding roles. This “LinkedIn Effect” has everyone, from fresh graduates to seasoned professionals, yearning for titles that look good on their profiles, often prioritizing appearance over substance.</p>
<p>HR departments, grappling with the increasing complexity of tech roles, have contributed to this problem as well. In an attempt to accurately categorize the myriad of specialized positions in our rapidly evolving field, they’ve created a proliferation of niche titles. While these titles might be descriptive, they’ve made it increasingly difficult to compare roles across companies, further muddying the waters of career progression.</p>
<p>Lastly, many companies have begun using title promotions as a retention strategy. The intent is to recognize and retain valuable employees, but this approach often backfires. When titles are handed out like participation trophies, they cease to align with actual growth in responsibilities or skills. This misalignment not only devalues the titles themselves but also sets unrealistic expectations for the newly promoted employees.</p>
<p>In essence, what we’re seeing is a perfect storm of market pressures, personal branding needs, organizational challenges, and short-sighted retention strategies. Together, these factors have inflated titles to the point where they risk losing their meaning entirely.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-we-need-to-address-title-inflation">Why Do We Need to Address Title Inflation?</h3>
<p>Title inflation isn’t just about words on a business card or a LinkedIn profile. It’s a problem that strikes at the heart of our industry’s integrity and functionality. When we inflate titles, we’re essentially lying to ourselves and each other about our capabilities and experience.</p>
<p>This deception has real consequences. It creates a mismatch between expectations and reality, leading to situations where people are placed in roles they’re not prepared for. Imagine a “senior” engineer with three years of experience trying to architect a complex system or mentor junior developers. The potential for failure is high, and the stress on that individual is immense.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-we-do-about-title-inflation">What Can We Do About Title Inflation?</h3>
<p>For those in leadership positions, it’s paramount to resist the temptation of using inflated titles as a quick fix for retention or recruitment challenges. Instead, focus on creating meaningful career progression frameworks that tie advancements to concrete skills and responsibilities. Consider implementing a system similar to those used by larger tech companies, where levels (like L3, L4, L5) provide a more nuanced view of seniority without resorting to title inflation.</p>
<p>Companies can take a stand by standardizing their title structures and being transparent about what each level means. This could involve creating detailed job descriptions that clearly outline the expectations and responsibilities for each role. By doing so, you not only provide clarity for your employees but also contribute to a more standardized industry-wide understanding of titles.</p>
<p>HR departments have a critical role to play. They can work on developing more sophisticated ways to categorize and compare roles across the industry. This might involve collaborating with tech leads to create standardized skill matrices that can be used to evaluate candidates and employees more objectively.</p>
<p>Companies that resist title inflation gain a significant competitive edge. By maintaining meaningful titles, they attract and retain top talent who value authentic growth over inflated roles. This leads to more accurate hiring, improved team dynamics, and enhanced productivity. Realistic titles also foster trust, both internally and with clients, positioning the company as a beacon of integrity in the industry. Ultimately, companies with well-defined, honest title structures build stronger, more capable teams and a reputation for excellence that sets them apart in the market.</p> </article></div>]]></description>
