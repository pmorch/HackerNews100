<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The staggering and fast-growing cost of AI datacenters is a call for performance engineering like no other in history; it's not just about saving costs – it's about saving the planet. I have joined OpenAI to work on this challenge directly, with an initial focus on ChatGPT performance. The scale is extreme and the growth is mind-boggling. As a leader in datacenter performance, I've realized that performance engineering as we know it may not be enough – I'm thinking of new engineering methods so that we can find bigger optimizations than we have before, and find them faster. It's the opportunity of a lifetime and, unlike in mature environments of scale, it feels as if there are no obstacles – no areas considered too difficult to change. Do anything, do it at scale, and do it today.</p>

<p>Why OpenAI exactly? I had talked to industry experts and friends who recommended several companies, especially OpenAI. However, I was still a bit cynical about AI adoption. Like everyone, I was being bombarded with ads by various companies to use AI, but I wondered: was anyone actually using it? Everyday people with everyday uses? One day during a busy period of interviewing, I realized I needed a haircut (as it happened, it was the day before I was due to speak with Sam Altman). </p>

<p>Mia the hairstylist got to work, and casually asked what I do for a living. "I'm an Intel fellow, I work on datacenter performance." Silence. Maybe she didn't know what datacenters were or who Intel was. I followed up: "I'm interviewing for a new job to work on AI datacenters." Mia lit up: "Oh, I use ChatGPT all the time!" While she was cutting my hair – which takes a while – she told me about her many uses of ChatGPT. (I, of course, was a captive audience.) She described uses I hadn't thought of, and I realized how ChatGPT was becoming an essential tool for everyone. Just one example: She was worried about a friend who was travelling in a far-away city, with little timezone overlap when they could chat, but she could talk to ChatGPT anytime about what the city was like and what tourist activities her friend might be doing, which helped her feel connected. She liked the memory feature too, saying it was like talking to a person who was living there.</p>

<p>I had previously chatted to other random people about AI, including a realtor, a tax accountant, and a part-time beekeeper. All told me enthusiastically about their uses of ChatGPT; the beekeeper, for example, uses it to help with small business paperwork. My wife was already a big user, and I was using it more and more, e.g. to sanity-check quotes from tradespeople. Now my hairstylist, who recognized ChatGPT as a brand more readily than she did <em>Intel</em>, was praising the technology and teaching <em>me</em> about it. I stood on the street after my haircut and let sink in how big this was, how this technology has become an essential aide for so many, how I could lead performance efforts and help save the planet. Joining OpenAI might be the biggest opportunity of my lifetime.</p>

<p>It's nice to work on something big that many people recognize and appreciate. I felt this when working at Netflix, and I'd been missing that human connection when I changed jobs. But there are other factors to consider beyond a well-known product: what's my role, who am I doing it with, and what is the compensation?</p>

<p>I ended up having <strong>26 interviews and meetings</strong> (of course I kept a log) with various AI tech giants, so I learned a lot about the engineering work they are doing and the engineers who do it. The work itself reminds me of Netflix cloud engineering: huge scale, cloud computing challenges, fast-paced code changes, and freedom for engineers to make an impact. Lots of very interesting engineering problems across the stack. It's not just GPUs, it's everything.</p>

<p>The engineers I met were impressive: the AI giants have been very selective, to the point that I wasn't totally sure I'd pass the interviews myself. Of the companies I talked to, OpenAI had the largest number of talented engineers I already knew, including former Netflix colleagues such as Vadim who was encouraging me to join. At Netflix, Vadim would bring me performance issues and watch over my shoulder as I debugged and fixed them. It's a big plus to have someone at a company who knows you well, knows the work, and thinks you'll be good at the work.</p>

<p>Some people may be excited by what it means for OpenAI to hire me, a well known figure in computer performance, and of course I'd like to do great things. But to be fair on my fellow staff, there are many performance engineers already at OpenAI, including veterans I know from the industry, and they have been busy finding important wins. I'm not the first, I'm just the latest.</p>

<h2>Building Orac</h2>

<p>AI was also an early dream of mine. As a child I was a fan of British SciFi, including Blake's 7 (1978-1981) which featured a sarcastic, opinionated supercomputer named Orac. Characters could talk to Orac and ask it to do research tasks. Orac could communicate with all other computers in the universe, delegate work to them, and control them (this was very futuristic in 1978, pre-Internet as we know it). </p>

<p>Orac was considered the most valuable thing in the Blake's 7 universe, and by the time I was a university engineering student I wanted to build Orac. So I started developing my own natural language processing software. I didn't get very far, though: main memory at the time wasn't large enough to store an entire dictionary plus metadata. I visited a PC vendor with my requirements and they laughed, telling me to buy a mainframe instead. I realized I needed it to distinguish hot versus cold data and leave cold data on disk, and maybe I should be using a database… and that was about where I left that project.</p>

<p>Last year I started using ChatGPT, and wondered if it knew about Blake's 7 and Orac. So I asked:</p>

<center><img src="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/images/2026/chatgpt_orac_01.png" width="450"></center>

<p>ChatGPT's response nails the character. I added it to Settings-&gt;Personalization-&gt;Custom Instructions, and now it always answers as Orac. I love it. (There's also surprising news for Blake's 7 fans: A <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/blakes-7-reboot-peter-hoar-newsupdate/">reboot</a> was just announced!)</p>

<h2>What's next for me</h2>

<p>I am now a Member of Technical Staff for OpenAI, working remotely from Sydney, Australia, and reporting to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbeck449/">Justin Becker</a>. The team I've joined is ChatGPT performance engineering, and I'll be working with the other performance engineering teams at the company. One of my first projects is a multi-org strategy for improving performance and reducing costs.</p>

<p>There's so many interesting things to work on, things I have done before and things I haven't. I'm already using Codex for more than just coding. Will I be doing more eBPF, Ftrace, PMCs? I'm starting with OpenAI's needs and seeing where that takes me; but given those technologies are proven for finding datacenter performance wins, it seems likely -- I can lead the way. (And if everything I've described here sounds interesting to you, OpenAI is hiring.)</p>

<p>I was at Linux Plumber's Conference in Toyko in December, just after I announced leaving Intel, and dozens of people wanted to know where I was going next and why. I thought I'd write this blog post to answer everyone at once. I also need to finish part 2 of <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2025-08-04/when-to-hire-a-computer-performance-engineering-team-2025-part1.html">hiring a performance engineering team</a> (it was already drafted before I joined OpenAI). I haven't forgotten.</p>

<p>It took months to wrap up my prior job and start at OpenAI, so I was due for another haircut. I thought it'd be neat to ask Mia about ChatGPT now that I work on it, then realized it had been months and she could have changed her mind. I asked nervously: "Still using ChatGPT?". Mia responded confidently: "twenty-four seven!"</p>

<p><span size="-1"><i>I checked with Mia, she was thrilled to be mentioned in my post. This is also a personal post: no one asked me to write this.</i></span></p>

We landed in Kona and shared a sunset dinner by the water. We watched Kīlauea erupt together, lava shooting hundreds of feet into the sky and soot falling from the air like snow. We laughed. We snorkeled. I remember feeling Amy rest her head on my shoulder as we watched the sky burn itself out over the island. It was one of those moments where time seems to slow. Where all you want is for the weight of another person, the sound of their breathing, to stay exactly the same forever. I held that feeling more tightly than I realized at the time.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg" width="568" height="609.046875" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1647,&quot;width&quot;:1536,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:568,&quot;bytes&quot;:590333,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://andrewjrod.substack.com/i/186112551?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47991a71-712c-45ce-b78d-f3e81cd5835b_1536x2048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Windy sunset from Mauna Kea</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>It was beautiful. It was also haunted. Haunted, because while we were laughing and taking pictures, I was carrying a thought I didn’t want to say: </span><strong>something is wrong</strong><span>.</span></p><p>For weeks before our vacation, I could feel that my girlfriend had a brain tumor. Not in a mystical way. But in the mundane way that comes from living with someone and noticing the small, unexplainable things. Amy was in constant fatigue. Her period inexplicably disappeared for 6 months. Her bone density was poor. All of this despite averaging 10 hours of sleep per night and consistent physical activity.</p><p>We met with some doctors. They initially fixated on the fatigue, citing that it could be any of allergies, stress, vision problems, or burnout. One even suggested that some people just need 10-11 hours of sleep to feel normal. But no one told us exactly what was wrong.</p><p><span>Day by day, Amy experienced more moments of fatigue and sadness. It didn’t just inflict fear in me. It made me feel </span><strong>time</strong><span>. I felt scarcity. I felt pangs of anger every time I wasn’t fully present in the moment with her while dark thoughts pulled me away. Every day we waited to see the next doctor, I tried to salvage moments of joy amidst my running imagination.</span></p><p>When we got back from vacation, Amy turned 25. We had a lovely 12 course dinner. Her roommates and I threw her a surprise party at home. People showed up with less than 24 hours notice on a Monday night. She looked tired but happy, held by all this love.</p><p>And I remember thinking; quietly, privately:</p><p><em>I have no idea what her 26th birthday will look like.</em></p><p>Because earlier that day, Amy had a doctor’s appointment. While I waited for her, my mind juggled between two realities: one where this is nothing, and one where everything is about to change.</p><p>Then I saw the images:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png" width="462" height="442.6442307692308" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1395,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:462,&quot;bytes&quot;:1648037,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://andrewjrod.substack.com/i/186112551?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>First MRI, Sagittal View</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>My life partner has a brain tumor</em><span>.</span></p><p>The diagnosis was both devastating and relieving.</p><p>Relieving because it wasn’t metastatic. It wasn’t widespread. It wasn’t the worst-case story our brains had been writing.</p><p>Devastating because it was still a brain tumor.</p><p>Amy has a prolactinoma: a tumor of the pituitary gland that causes the body to massively overproduce prolactin. Prolactin is best known for helping mammals produce milk for their babies, but is involved in hundreds of processes, including menstruation. Clinicians often call it “chill,” because it usually doesn’t spread and often responds to dopamine agonists like Cabergoline.</p><p>Amy’s case hasn’t been chill.</p><p><span>Her prolactin levels were supposed to be between 5–20 ng/mL. They were </span><strong>330 ng/mL</strong><span>. The tumor was large, caught late, and growing quickly on the back of her posterior pituitary gland. Normally, you can try Cabergoline for a few months to see if it shrinks the tumor and lowers your prolactin. But according to her care team, if the tumor grew by even 20%, it would threaten her vision.</span></p><p>Surgery was the only option. Prolactinoma resection occurs through a process called a transnasal transsphenoidal surgery. The procedure involves passing a fiberoptic cable up one nostril and surgical tools up the other, cutting an opening in the nasal septum and sphenoid sinus to reach the base of the skull (sella turcica).</p><p>Normally, this surgery is very low risk: the majority of these tumors occur on the anterior (front) pituitary gland, which is easily accessible via the nose. She has a less common posterior (back) pituitary tumor. Her tumor was large and caused intracranial pressure, so the surgeons needed to perform a riskier procedure to lift the pituitary gland to access the tumor.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic" width="424" height="565.2362637362637" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:424,&quot;bytes&quot;:953949,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://andrewjrod.substack.com/i/186112551?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Amy in good spirits in pre-op, first surgery</figcaption></figure></div><p>The morning of Amy’s first surgery, I wrote a journal entry:</p><blockquote><p>It’s currently 9:36am and I’m sitting in a crepe place near UCSF. Amy is currently getting her tumor removed. Despite my confidence that she will be okay, now and then, the reality of the situation hits and I feel a child like fear that things won’t turn out okay. I’m scared.</p><p>I’m keeping this record of how I feel in this moment because it’s important to allow myself to feel the terror of this moment, however painful. The love of my life is on an operating table, and our future together depends on the actions of a few doctors right now. That’s scary.</p><p>I’m also sad that I can’t be with her the very moment she wakes up. I promised to be there, but the hospital restricts this until you have your own room. The live updates I’ve been getting are reassuring. I would have moved worlds to get her the care she has by default. We are so lucky.</p><p>Nothing else in this journal is as important as how I feel about her now and in the future. I’m excited to see my wife soon. I’ll think back today when we meet our children. - AR</p></blockquote><p>The first surgery removed 80% of the tumor. Her prolactin levels decreased from 330 ng/mL to 60 ng/mL. Not quite the 100% cure we were hoping for or the acceptable 5-20ng/mL range, but her condition appeared more manageable.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0KNW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0KNW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0KNW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0KNW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0KNW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0KNW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic" width="368" height="490.5824175824176" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:368,&quot;bytes&quot;:1016714,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://andrewjrod.substack.com/i/186112551?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0KNW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0KNW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0KNW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0KNW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbded62ee-3c03-444e-9840-7559d1ebbdac_1536x2048.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Post-op, first surgery</figcaption></figure></div><p>Amy’s recovery was rough. She couldn’t bend. I played human-forklift for her backpack and shoes. I held her hand when the intense headaches left her bedridden. I read every page on r/prolactinoma for solutions to her nasal congestion; she couldn’t blow her nose for fear of triggering a spinal fluid leak. I bought a humidifier that left our bedroom musky and damp. She couldn’t use straws or taste food, and still does saline nasal rinses to this day.</p><p>Up until Amy started having symptoms, I worked day and night as an independent consultant on projects advancing human health. In the first half of 2025, I worked on several projects and presentations that have been seen by some of the richest people on Earth, Vitalik, and tons of Tier 1 VCs.</p><p>But when conditions got worse, I happily chose to be Amy’s full-time nurse. I downsized to 10-20 hours of part-time consulting, I feel immense gratitude to have had a work structure that allowed me to be so present.</p><p>Eventually, Amy was well enough to travel again, and we celebrated our wins by taking a vacation to the base of Mt.

One with arguably the top prolactinoma neuroendocrinologist in the world, one with her ENT, and one with her surgeon. We were expecting the doctors to treat her with dopamine agonists to kill the residual tumor tissue. We were expecting her to finally have a “chill” brain tumor.</p><p><span>But Amy’s tumor continued to grow rapidly and had granulated features that made it more likely to spread if untreated. Within weeks of surgery, her prolactin rose again to 100 ng/mL.

More space for prolactin-induced mood swings. More occasions where I didn’t feel present with my closest friends due to emotional burnout. I pinned all of my hopes on this 90% probability. And I hoped that even if the odds were somehow not in our favor, surely the tumor would be so small that the cabergoline could then treat her.</p><p>But I also knew that every time you surgically manipulate the pituitary gland, you increase the risk of permanent brain damage. You increase your risk of getting a condition called diabetes insipidus, or DI which requires a lifetime of cumbersome medication.</p><p>—</p><p>I got the call. The surgery was proclaimed a complete success with no complications! Her surgeon described how they thoroughly examined all suspect areas and removed all suspicious tissue. I finally let myself relax. Amy was in a daze, but recovering well. She even got her own room this time, so I was able to stay overnight.</p><p>The next afternoon, I took a walk to get Amy a caffeine-free, strawless boba with her care team’s blessing. I returned while in the middle of a phone call with a friend when Amy signaled that I needed to get off the phone immediately. She just got back her post-op prolactin levels.</p><p>Prolactin has a half-life of ~50 minutes in our bodies. Because of this quirk, we can tell within 24 hours how a prolactinoma resection went because one’s prolactin could only be elevated if you’re actively secreting excessive amounts. This is how we knew the first surgery was not a complete success when her level was 60ng/mL.</p><p><span>This time, her level was 65ng/mL. </span><em><strong>Higher than after the first surgery</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><p>—</p><p><span>My mask came off. I was completely beside myself. I sprinted over to the nurse’s station and demanded to speak to the surgeon, the resident on call, anyone who could explain this, </span><em>immediately</em><span>. It’s the closest I’ve ever come to screaming at someone who didn’t deserve it.</span></p><p><span>A nurse came in and rolled Amy off to get an expedited post-op MRI, something that normally happens 6 weeks after the surgery. After she left, I fell into a fetal position and cried. All the months of being the rock caught up to me at once. I couldn’t hold it anymore. I believed the tumor had spread beyond the pituitary. My whole world collapsed in on itself. My future wife was going to die. I was all but promised this would be over. It was so unfair. I was so </span><em>tired</em><span>.</span></p><p>Since Amy’s second surgery, we’ve spoken with most of the world’s leading prolactinoma experts. Yet even they disagree: some see residual tumor in Amy’s post-op MRIs; others don’t. Some advise cabergoline; others recommend a third surgery. The uncertainty is maddening, but at least they all agree it hasn’t spread.</p><p>A third surgery would have a 5-15% chance of permanent pituitary dysfunction, so Amy’s taking cabergoline. So far, she’s only experienced mild side-effects. We’re optimistic.</p><p>When we asked one of the top prolactinoma experts what causes these tumors, he shrugged: “It’s random, but there’s possibly some genetic weighting.” Amy’s mother may have had one.</p><p><strong>That’s when a horrifying but clarifying thought hit me.</strong></p><p>We want children one day. If there’s a hereditary component (more on this in a future post), there is a non-trivial chance our kids could develop brain tumors. Given how early Amy’s symptoms started, we would have ~20 years before any child of ours might show signs.</p><p>It also happens that today we are on the cusp of a transformation in AI-driven science.</p><p>Do I wait for that transformation to arrive? Or do I choose to use the tools available and deepen our understanding today?</p><p><span>If there’s one thing this year taught me, it’s that the future is uncertain, and you can wake up one day with a “chill” brain tumor just after turning 25. </span><strong>So I’m choosing to act.</strong></p><p>Prolactinomas have a standard of care, yes. But “standard of care” often means “the least bad option we currently have.” The gap between what the best doctors know and what is actually actionable for patients is shockingly wide. I’ve watched in real time how slowly and incompletely scientific knowledge translates into decisions in the clinic.</p><p>At the same time, I’ve consulted with researchers who are building “AI Scientist” systems - agents that can read thousands of papers, propose hypotheses, design experiments, and reason about biology far beyond a human’s cognitive bandwidth. The juxtaposition is impossible to ignore.</p><p>So here’s the real question I’m trying to answer:</p><blockquote><p>Can one motivated researcher with undergraduate-level biology training, armed with state-of-the-art AI scientist tools, and open data, meaningfully advance our understanding of brain tumors?</p></blockquote><p>This isn’t entirely foreign territory for me.</p><p><span>I used to do biophysics research at Columbia’s Zuckerman Institute under Stavros Lomvardas. I’m no stranger to molecular biology, neuroscience, or scientific reasoning. And I’ve spent the last few years embedded in the techbio and AI ecosystems, most recently as an investor at Side Door Ventures. I have above average knowledge about biology. </span><strong>A future state where I comfort myself with thoughts like “there was nothing I could do anyway” is completely wrong, self-soothing bullshit.</strong></p><p>I’m committing to work on this full time. I’ve been reading papers about prolactinomas and trying AI research tools. </p><p>And I’m inviting you to be part of my journey.</p><p>I’ll share my procedure, the papers, the tools, and my goals in much more detail next week. After that, I’m going to share my thoughts on how the tools I’m using are uplifting my rate of learning (most likely a qualitative analysis). </p><p><span>I’m hoping to meet people that are excited to help cure and treat all human diseases. </span><strong>These are some archetypes of people I’m trying to meet and why:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Scientists working at the intersection of AI x Bio to tear my ideas apart and give me new ones.</p></li><li><p>Techbio founders eager to get feedback on their tools.</p></li><li><p>Neurotech founders and scientists that can help spark new research directions and ideas! </p></li><li><p>VCs that invest in tangentially related places, as they will likely be connected to the people above. Also happy to refer over cool companies :)</p></li><li><p>Foundations and grants writers that fund independent research projects like this! I’d like to both feed myself and have a budget to pay for tools.</p></li></ol><ol><li><p><span>Here’s my </span><a href="https://calendar.app.google/3QtJJFnBs8MdxBrv9" rel="">calendar</a><span>. </span><strong>Before whatever interesting thought you have now escapes you, grab time and write it in the invite!</strong></p></li><li><p><span>There are a bunch of ways to DM me. </span><a href="https://x.com/andrewjrod" rel="">X</a><span>, Substack, and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arodriguez231" rel="">LinkedIn</a><span> all work.

I realized that I don’t care to be known for my intelligence. I don’t care to be known for my accomplishments.</p><p>I want to be known for my capacity to love.</p><p>—</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BKoT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BKoT!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BKoT!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BKoT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BKoT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BKoT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg" width="560" height="420" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:3024,&quot;width&quot;:4032,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:560,&quot;bytes&quot;:2230330,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://andrewjrod.substack.com/i/186112551?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03bb7cde-4482-4839-b2fd-7d3c8ee0a32b_4032x3024.heic&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BKoT!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BKoT!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BKoT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BKoT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b57eadd-8335-4186-988f-696c3205b6f1_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Surprise birthday party Amy threw for me last month with some of my favorite people.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Thank you to everyone in my life that’s given me courage over the past year.

<p><strong>OpenCiv3</strong> (formerly known by the codename “C7”) is an open-source, cross-platform, mod-oriented, modernized reimagining of <em>Civilization III</em> by the fan community built with the Godot Engine and C#, with capabilities inspired by the best of the 4X genre and lessons learned from modding Civ3. Our vision is to make Civ3 as it could have been, rebuilt for today’s modders and players: removing arbitary limits, fixing broken features, expanding mod capabilities, and supporting modern graphics and platforms. A game that can go beyond C3C but retain all of its gameplay and content.</p>

<p><strong><em>OpenCiv3 is under active development and currently in an early pre-alpha state.</em></strong> It is a rudimentary playable game but lacking many mechanics and late-game content, and errors are likely. Keep up with our development for the latest updates and opportunities to contribute!</p>

<h2 id="get-openciv3-dutch">Get OpenCiv3 “Dutch”</h2>

<h2 id="december-2025-v03-dutch-preview-1-has-been-released">December 2025: v0.3 Dutch Preview 1 Has Been Released!</h2>

<p>The OpenCiv3 team is pleased to announce the first preview release of the v0.3 “Dutch” milestone.  This is a major enhancement over the “Carthage” release, and our debut with standalone mode featuring placeholder graphics without the need for Civ3 media files. A local installation of Civ3 is still recommended for a more polished experience. See the <a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/releases/">release notes</a> for a full list of new features in each version.</p>

<p><img src="https://openciv3.org/Dutch_standalone.png" alt="OpenCiv3 Dutch standalone mode" width="576" height="384"> 
<img src="https://openciv3.org/Dutch_imported.png" alt="OpenCiv3 Dutch Civ3 mode" width="576" height="384"></p>

<p><em>OpenCiv3 Dutch Preview 1 with the same game in Standalone mode (top) and with imported Civ3 graphics (bottom)</em></p>

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>

<p>Download the appropriate zip file for your OS from <strong><a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/releases/tag/v0.3-dutch-preview-1">the Dutch Preview 1 release</a></strong></p>

<p>All official releases of OpenCiv3 along with more detailed release notes can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/releases/">GitHub releases page.</a></p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<h3 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>64-bit Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. Other platforms may be supported in future releases.</li>
  <li>Minimum hardware requirements have not yet been identified. Please let us know if OpenCiv3 does not perform well on your system.</li>
  <li>Recommended: A local copy of <em>Civilization III</em> files (the game itself does NOT have to run) from <em>Conquests</em> or the <em>Complete</em> edition. Standalone mode is available with placeholder graphics for those who do not have a copy.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Civilization III Complete</em> is available for a pittance from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3910/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_III_Complete/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_civilization_iii_complete">GOG</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="windows-installation">Windows Installation</h3>

<p>This is a Windows 64-bit executable. OpenCiv3 will look for a local installation of <em>Civilization III</em> in the Windows registry automatically, or you may use an environment variable to point to the files.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download and extract the zip file</li>
  <li>Double-click <code>OpenCiv3.exe</code></li>
  <li>If it is blocked, you may need to unblock it by
    <ul>
      <li>Right click</li>
      <li>Click on Properties</li>
      <li>Check the “Unblock” checkbox near the bottom buttons in the “Security” section</li>
      <li>Click OK</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If your <em>Civilization III</em> installation is not detected, you can set the environment variable <code>CIV3_HOME</code> pointing to it and restart OpenCiv3</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="linux-installation">Linux Installation</h3>

<p>This is an x86-64 Linux executable. You may use an environment variable to point to the files from a <em>Civilization III</em> installation. You can just copy or mount the top-level “Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete” (Sans “Complete” if your install was from pre-Complete CDs) folder and its contents to your Linux system, or install the game via Steam or GOG.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download and extract the tgz file</li>
  <li>Set the <code>CIV3_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the Civ3 files, e.g. <code>export CIV3_HOME="/path/to/civ3"</code></li>
  <li>From that same terminal where you set <code>CIV3_HOME</code>, run <code>OpenCiv3.x86_64</code></li>
  <li>To make this variable permanent, add it to your <code>.profile</code> or equivalent.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mac-installation">Mac Installation</h3>

<p>This is a universal 64-bit executable, so it should run on both Intel and M1 Macs. You may use an environment variable to point to the files from a <em>Civilization III</em> installation. You can just copy or mount the top-level “Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete” (Sans “Complete” if your install was from pre-Complete CDs) folder and its contents to your Mac system, or install the game via Steam or GOG.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the zip; it may complain bitterly, and you may have to tell it to keep the download instead of trashing it</li>
  <li>Double click the zip file, and a folder with <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> and a json file will appear</li>
  <li>If you try to open <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> it will tell you it’s damaged and try to trash it; it is not damaged</li>
  <li>To unblock the downloaded app, from a terminal run <code>xattr -cr /path/to/OpenCiv3.app</code>; you can avoid typing the path out by typing <code>xattr -cr </code> and then dragging the <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> icon onto the terminal window</li>
  <li>Set the <code>CIV3_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the Civ3 files, e.g. <code>export CIV3_HOME="/path/to/civ3"</code></li>
  <li>From that same terminal where you set <code>CIV3_HOME</code>, run <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> with <code>open /path/to/OpenCiv3.app</code>, or again just type <code>open </code> and drag the OpenCiv3 icon onto the terminal window and press enter</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>OpenCiv3 uses many primitive placeholder assets; loading files from a local <em>Civilization III</em> install is recommended (see platform specific setup instructions above)</li>
  <li>Support for playing Civ3 BIQ or SAV files is incomplete; some files will not load correctly and crashes may occur</li>
  <li>For Mac:
    <ul>
      <li>Mac will try hard not to let you run this; it will tell you the app is damaged and can’t be opened and helpfully offer to trash it for you. From a terminal you can <code>xattr -cr /path/to/OpenCiv3.app</code> to enable running it.</li>
      <li>Mac will crash if you hit buttons to start a new game (New Game, Quick Start, Tutorial, or Load Scenario) because it cant find our ‘new game’ save file we’re using as a stand-in for map generation. But you can Load Game and load <code>c7-static-map-save.json</code> or open a Civ3 SAV file to open that map</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Other specific bugs will be tracked on the <a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug">GitHub issues page.</a></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BreezyBox shell demo for ESP32-S3</h2><a id="user-content-breezybox-shell-demo-for-esp32-s3" aria-label="Permalink: BreezyBox shell demo for ESP32-S3" href="#breezybox-shell-demo-for-esp32-s3"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a demo for how you can turn an ESP32-S3 microcontroller into a <strong>tiny instant-on PC</strong> with its own shell, editor, compiler, and online apps installer. Something like Raspberry Pi, minus the overhead of a full server/desktop grade OS. I think ESP32 is underrated in hobby maker community for this PC-like use case. This demo uses <a href="https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezybox">BreezyBox</a>, my mini-shell ESP-IDF component.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">That sounds too good to be true. What is BreezyBox anyway?</h2><a id="user-content-that-sounds-too-good-to-be-true-what-is-breezybox-anyway" aria-label="Permalink: That sounds too good to be true. What is BreezyBox anyway?" href="#that-sounds-too-good-to-be-true-what-is-breezybox-anyway"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">First of all, seeing is believing (click to watch the video):</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://youtu.be/wlDsaQgWCaI" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9645483c92e8eb33557ff954e1f0bedcc64f6cb11587012aa4903117895f428/68747470733a2f2f696d672e796f75747562652e636f6d2f76692f776c4473615167574361492f6d617872657364656661756c742e6a7067" alt="Watch the video" data-canonical-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/wlDsaQgWCaI/maxresdefault.jpg"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It started as a "cyberdeck" style crafting project. Then I got carried away with the software part. I chose ESP32-S3 for the base platform. It has the nostalgic appeal of the DOS era PCs, with similar resources, and elbow-deep-in-bytes coding experience, plus modern wireless comms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">ESP32-S3 can do everything those PCs did and more, but that is inconvenient out of the box, because that is not the commercial use case it is positioned for. It also forces away the code bloat. If you are like me, and love small elegant things, and technology that punches way above its weight, you ought to try it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">So anyway, I decided to try and package some key missing parts: a basic vterm, the current working directory (CWD) tracking, a few familiar UNIX-like commands, and an app installer. Believe it or not, the rest is already there in ESP-IDF components, including the elf_loader with dynamic linking.</p>
<p dir="auto">The result is called "BreezyBox", by analogy with the BusyBox commands suite. The name is just a light joke, it is not meant to be a full clone. You can import it with one command in your ESP-IDF project, and if you have some stdio going, even at "Hello World" level, it should mostly just work. I call it a "mini shell", a naïve user might call it an OS (it is not, it runs on FreeRTOS), and you can also call it the userland layer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">This repo is just one possible example</h2><a id="user-content-this-repo-is-just-one-possible-example" aria-label="Permalink: This repo is just one possible example" href="#this-repo-is-just-one-possible-example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The BreezyBox component leaves the display and other board configuration details to the user's firmware project, providing mainly the vterm/vfs features, and some shell commands. This particular example/demo project supports only one specific dev board: <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-lcd-7b.htm" rel="nofollow">Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7B</a> (no affiliation). But you can see how all the parts connect, and adapt it to your display/board, or just copy some code snippets from here.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to Use</h2><a id="user-content-how-to-use" aria-label="Permalink: How to Use" href="#how-to-use"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I suggest just fork it, clone it, and try to make it work on your board. Mine was about 40€; you can start with some random $10 two inch LCD S3 dev board if you like. Hint: LVGL text label control is the easiest path to stdout on LCD that works almost everywhere. You can also start with a headless board over USB console, that takes zero code, and gives you free ANSI codes in standard IDF Monitor in VSCode (or in Tabby).</p>
<p dir="auto">You do not have to write your own font renderer like I did here; that was just to push past 30 FPS on a display slightly too large for this chip.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">License</h2><a id="user-content-license" aria-label="Permalink: License" href="#license"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is free software under <a href="https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezydemo/blob/main/LICENSE">MIT License</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing: Help Wanted!</h2><a id="user-content-contributing-help-wanted" aria-label="Permalink: Contributing: Help Wanted!" href="#contributing-help-wanted"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The best help is currently more testing beyond "works on my computer", more shared examples and fun use cases:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">More ELF apps – see the examples at my <a href="https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezyapps">breezyapps repo</a>, they are super easy to follow. Even a carefully written stdlib C program with no platform-specific bits may work sometimes, also with some ANSI codes. But be sure to verify on the actual ESP32-S3: the memory is tight, the larger PSRAM requires alignment, and there are other limits and quirks. You can publish and install the apps using your own repo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">More full example firmware repositories: for different boards, with different styles. Maybe you provide the basic LVGL text label example on some popular board. Maybe you prefer C++ to plain C. Maybe you embrace the GUI. Maybe you port some retro games. Maybe you even make it work on P4, or C6 (RISC-V, a completely different CPU). Maybe you attach some cool gadgets to it. Maybe you build an extra cool cyberdeck case. Or maybe you reproduce the exact same thing, and just share your setup experience and hands-on impressions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">It would be so cool to see more people using BreezyBox, and to have more ready-to-clone examples for everyone!</p>
<p dir="auto">Have fun!</p>

</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Experimental</strong> - This project is still in development, and not ready for the prime time.</p>
<p dir="auto">A minimal, secure Python interpreter written in Rust for use by AI.</p>
<p dir="auto">Monty avoids the cost, latency, complexity and general faff of using full container based sandbox for running LLM generated code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, it let's you safely run Python code written by an LLM embedded in your agent, with startup times measured in single digit microseconds not hundreds of milliseconds.</p>
<p dir="auto">What Monty <strong>can</strong> do:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Run a reasonable subset of Python code - enough for your agent to express what it wants to do</li>
<li>Completely block access to the host environment: filesystem, env variables and network access are all implemented via external function calls the developer can control</li>
<li>Call functions on the host - only functions you give it access to</li>
<li>Run typechecking - monty supports full modern python type hints and comes with <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/" rel="nofollow">ty</a> included in a single binary to run typechecking</li>
<li>Be snapshotted to bytes at external function calls, meaning you can store the interpreter state in a file or database, and resume later</li>
<li>Startup extremely fast (&lt;1μs to go from code to execution result), and has runtime performance that is similar to CPython (generally between 5x faster and 5x slower)</li>
<li>Be called from Rust, Python, or Javascript - because Monty has no dependencies on cpython, you can use it anywhere you can run Rust</li>
<li>Control resource usage - Monty can track memory usage, allocations, stack depth, and execution time and cancel execution if it exceeds preset limits</li>
<li>Collect stdout and stderr and return it to the caller</li>
<li>Run async or sync code on the host via async or sync code on the host</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">What Monty <strong>cannot</strong> do:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Use the standard library (except a few select modules: <code>sys</code>, <code>typing</code>, <code>asyncio</code>, <code>dataclasses</code> (soon), <code>json</code> (soon))</li>
<li>Use third party libraries (like Pydantic), support for external python library is not a goal</li>
<li>define classes (support should come soon)</li>
<li>use match statements (again, support should come soon)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">In short, Monty is extremely limited and designed for <strong>one</strong> use case:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>To run code written by agents.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">For motivation on why you might want to do this, see:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/" rel="nofollow">Codemode</a> from Cloudflare</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling" rel="nofollow">Programmatic Tool Calling</a> from Anthropic</li>
<li><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp" rel="nofollow">Code Execution with MCP</a> from Anthropic</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents">Smol Agents</a> from Hugging Face</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In very simple terms, the idea of all the above is that LLMs can be work faster, cheaper and more reliably if they're asked to write Python (or Javascript) code, instead of relying on traditional tool calling. Monty makes that possible without the complexity of a sandbox or risk of running code directly on the host.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> Monty will (soon) be used to implement <code>codemode</code> in <a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai">Pydantic AI</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Monty can be called from Python, JavaScript/TypeScript or Rust.</p>

<li>Oh my god, this solves so many problems, I want it.</li>

<p dir="auto">I'll try to run through the most obvious alternatives, and why there aren't right for what we wanted.</p>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: all these technologies are impressive and have widespread uses, this commentary on their limitations for our use case should not be seen as a criticism. Most of these solutions were not conceived with the goal of providing an LLM sandbox, which is why they're not necessary great at it.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: No classes (yet), limited stdlib, no third-party libraries</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Explicitly controlled filesystem, network, and env access, strict limits on execution time and memory usage</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Starts in microseconds</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: just <code>pip install pydantic-monty</code> or <code>npm install @pydantic/monty</code>, ~4.5MB download</li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Strictly controlled, see <a href="https://github.com/pydantic/monty/pull/85" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/pydantic/monty/pull/85/hovercard">#85</a></li>
<li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Monty's pause and resume functionality with <code>dump()</code> and <code>load()</code> makes it trivial to pause, resume and fork execution</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Docker</h3><a id="user-content-docker" aria-label="Permalink: Docker" href="#docker"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython with any library</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Process and filesystem isolation, network policies, but container escapes exist, memory limitation is possible</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Container startup overhead (~195ms measured)</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: Requires Docker daemon, container images, orchestration, <code>python:3.14-alpine</code> is 50MB - docker can't be installed from PyPI</li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Volume mounts work well</li>
<li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal, or snapshotting an image and saving it as a Docker image.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython compiled to WASM, almost all libraries available</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Relies on browser/WASM sandbox - not designed for server-side isolation, python code can run arbitrary code in the JS runtime, only deno allows isolation, memory limits are hard/impossible to enforce with deno</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: WASM runtime loading is slow (~2800ms cold start)</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: Need to load WASM runtime, handle async initialization, pyodide NPM package is ~12MB, deno is ~50MB - Pyodide can't be called with just PyPI packages</li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Virtual filesystem via browser APIs</li>
<li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal presumably, but hard</li>

<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Configuration language, not Python - no classes, exceptions, async</li>

<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: runs embedded in the process like Monty, hence impressive startup time</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: Usable in python via <a href="https://github.com/inducer/starlark-pyo3">starlark-pyo3</a></li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: No file handling by design AFAIK?</li>

<p dir="auto">There are similar challenges, more setup complexity but lower network latency for setting up your own sandbox setup with k8s.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython with any library</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Professionally managed container isolation</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Network round-trip and container startup time. I got ~1s cold start time with Daytona EU from London, Daytona advertise sub 90ms latency, presumably that's for an existing container, not clear if it includes network latency</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: Pay per execution or compute time</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: API integration, auth tokens - fine for startups but generally a non-start for enterprises</li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Upload/download via API calls</li>
<li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal, also the services offer some solutions for this, I think based con docker containers</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython with any library</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: None - full filesystem, network, env vars, system commands</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Near-zero for <code>exec()</code>, ~30ms for subprocess</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: None</li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Direct filesystem access (that's the problem)</li>

      <p>
        This is a tool that encrypts files and splits the decryption key among trusted friends
        using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing" target="_blank">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a>.
        For example, you can give pieces to 5 friends and require any 3 of them to cooperate to recover the key.
        No single friend can access your data alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each friend receives a self-contained bundle with <code>recover.html</code>—a browser-based tool that works
        offline, with no servers or internet required. If this website disappears, recovery still works.
      </p>
      
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>Your file is encrypted, the key is split into shares, and friends combine shares to recover it.</p>

      

      <p>Different friend combinations can recover the file (any 3 of 5)</p>

      <p>
          <strong>Your File</strong> → <strong>Encrypt</strong> → <strong>Split key into 5 shares</strong> → <strong>Distribute to friends</strong><br>
          ↓<br>
          <strong>Any 3 friends</strong> → <strong>Combine shares</strong> → <strong>Decrypt</strong> → <strong>File recovered</strong>

      </ol>
      <p>This is the best way to understand what your friends would experience during a real recovery.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why I built this</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted a way to ensure trusted friends could access important files if something happened to me—without
        trusting any single person or service with everything. Shamir's Secret Sharing seemed like the right approach,
        but I couldn't find a tool that gave friends a simple, self-contained way to recover files together.
        So I built one. I'm sharing it in case it's useful to others.

Every decision in your project that you don’t take and document will be taken for you by the AI.</p><p>Your responsibility of delivering quality code cannot be met if not even you know where long-lasting and difficult-to-change decisions are taken.<br>You must know what parts of your code need to be thought through and what must be vigorously tested.</p><p>Think about and discuss the architecture, interfaces, data structures, and algorithms you want to use.
Think about how to test and validate your code to these specifications.</p><h2 id="2-maintain-precise-documentation"><a href="#2-maintain-precise-documentation">2 Maintain Precise documentation</a></h2><p>You need to communicate to the AI in detail what you want to achieve, otherwise it will result in code that is unusable for your purpose.</p><p>Other developers also need to communicate this information to the AI. That makes it efficient to write as much documentation as practical in a standardized format and into the code repository itself.</p><p>Document the requirements, specifications, constraints, and architecture of your project in detail.<br>Document your coding standards, best practices, and design patterns.<br>Use flowcharts, UML diagrams, and other visual aids to communicate complex structures and workflows.<br>Write pseudocode for complex algorithms and logic to guide the AI in understanding your intentions.</p><h2 id="3-build-debug-systems-that-aid-the-ai"><a href="#3-build-debug-systems-that-aid-the-ai">3 Build debug systems that aid the AI</a></h2><p>Develop efficient debug systems for the AI to use, reducing the need for multiple expensive CLI commands or browsers to verify code functionality.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>There was recently an attempt by an independent journalist to expose fraud in a Minnesota social program. It was deeply frustrating; the journalist had notably poor epistemic standards, which secondary media <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/31/nx-s1-5662600/nick-shirley-minnesota-daycare-fraud">seized upon</a> to dismiss their result.</p><p>The class-based sniffing almost invariably noted that prestige media had already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/29/us/fraud-minnesota-somali.html">reported</a> stories which rhymed with the core allegation, while sometimes implying that makes the allegations less likely to be true, through a logical pathway which is mysterious to me.</p><p>The journalism went quite viral anyway, in part because of sensationalized framing, in part because of signal boosting by an aligned media ecosystem and aligned politicians, and in part because the journalism develops one bit of evidence that has a viscerality that paperwork dives often lack: these purported childcare operations routinely <em>have no children in them</em>.</p><p>Fraud has become quite politicized in the United States the last few years. We had a poorly-calibrated federal initiative led by a charismatic tech entrepreneur which believed it would unearth trillions of dollars of fraud that focused substantial effort on large programs which are comparatively fraud-resistant. Across the aisle, we have reflexive dismissal that fraud happens in social programs, which functions as air cover for <a href="https://www.startribune.com/federal-prosecutors-charge-six-more-people-in-staggering-social-services-fraud-scandal/601548801">scaled criminal operations</a> which loot many <a href="https://medium.com/@marginaliant/a-third-of-my-online-college-students-are-ai-powered-spambots-now-what-91c6e34b5d11">varied social programs</a> [0] and are sometimes <a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/report-22-17-covid-19-economic-injury-disaster-loan-applications-submitted-foreign-ip-addresses">run out of geopolitical adversaries</a> of the U.S. including by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fraud-us-government-theft-60-minutes/">ambiguously-retired members of their clandestine services</a>.</p><p>I worked in the financial industry for a few years. We do not have the luxury of pretending that fraud is something invented by our rivals to besmirch our good name. It hits the P&amp;L every quarter and will eat you alive if you’re not at least minimally competent in dealing with it. Conversely, it is well-understood in industry that the <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/optimal-amount-of-fraud/">optimal amount of fraud is not zero</a>.</p><p>The financial industry has paid at least tens of billions of dollars in tuition here. Overwhelmingly, one learns about fraud in it through an apprenticeship model, with different firms having different internal levels of understanding on the shape of the elephant. The industrial organization presumes small numbers of people architecting anti-fraud systems and relatively larger numbers of investigators and analysts operating those systems on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>There does exist some informal knowledge sharing between firms. If you work in payments, try getting invited to the Chatham House rule sessions held by… oh yeah, can’t say. Despite that social technology being originally developed for the benefit of government and press actors, it is my general impression that U.S. benefits programs don’t yet see themselves as sufficiently yoked by adversarial attention to benefit from their own Chatham House series. Perhaps that should change.</p><p>And so, for the benefit of fraud investigators with badges, press cards, or GoPros, some observations from a community of practice with an extensive (and mostly nonpublic) body of work. But first a tiny bit of throat clearing.</p><h2 id="in-which-we-briefly-return-to-minnesota">In which we briefly return to Minnesota</h2><p>Minnesota has suffered a decade-long campaign of industrial-scale fraud against several social programs. This is beyond intellectually serious dispute. The <a href="https://www.auditor.leg.state.mn.us/sreview/ccap.pdf"><em>2019</em> report from the Office of the Legislative Auditor</a> (a non-partisan government body) makes for gripping reading. The scale of fraud documented and separately alleged in it staggers the imagination: the state’s own investigators believed that, over the past several years, <em>greater than fifty percent of all reimbursements to daycare centers</em> were fraudulent. (Separate officials took the… novel position that they were only required to recognize fraud had happened after securing a criminal conviction for it. Since they had only secured a few criminal convictions, there was <em>no way</em> that fraud was that high. Asked to put a number on it, repeatedly, they declined.)</p><p>The investigators allege repeatedly visiting daycare centers which did not, factually, have children physically present at the facility despite reimbursement paperwork identifying specific children being present at that specific time. The investigators demonstrated these lies on timestamped video, and perhaps in another life would have been YouTube stars.</p><p>Our social class is intensely averse to straightforwardly recounting these facts, partly due to political valence and partly due to this particular fraud being dominantly conducted within a community which codes as disadvantaged in the U.S. sociopolitical context.</p><p>Fraudsters are liars and will cheerfully mouth any words they believe will absolve them of their crimes. If an accusation of racism gets one a free pass to steal hundreds of millions of dollars, they will <a href="https://media.kalzumeus.com/bam/fraud-investigator/pacer-feeding-our-future.pdf">speciously sue you alleging racial discrimination</a>. That empirically <em>worked</em> in Minnesota. The OLA takes explicit notice of this multiple times, a coordinator for the fraud operation is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aimee-bock-minnesota-fraud-feeding-our-future-interview/">on record explicitly explaining the strategic logic of accusations of racism</a>, and a judge was even moved to make <a href="https://mncourts.gov/about-the-courts/newsandannouncements/feeding-our-future-v-minnesota-department-of-education-correcting-media-reports-and-statements-by-governor-tim-walz-concerning-orders-issued-by-the-court">an extraordinary statement</a> to clarify that the bad-faith lawsuit alleging racism did not achieve success<em> through the formal judicial process</em> but rather through the voluntary compliance of governmental actors shamed by its allegations.</p><p>(As a sidenote: one has to be able to hold two thoughts simultaneously about fraudulent operations. They can be sophisticated with respect to exploiting sociopolitical cleavages in their targets while also being comically inept at faking evidence elsewhere, such as having a single person write dozens of adjacent rows in a sign-in sheet. This routinely surprises observers and <em>it should not surprise them</em>. The financial industry <em>also</em> has a division of labor in it. The person architecting the fraud department’s standard processes is well-paid, well-educated, and routinely brings crossdisciplinary expertise to bear. A Fraud Analyst I, on the other hand, bears a lot of similarity to a call center employee in terms of compensation, education, and permitted amounts of agency.)</p><p>In the immediate wake of the independent journalist’s report, the great and the good rallied around the organizations he accused. Of course it was natural that journalists wouldn’t get immediate access to children if they asked. Of course there was a certain amount of informality in the sector. Of course, as the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/nick-shirley-san-diego.html">very carefully wordsmithed recently</a>:</p><p><em>Minnesota officials said in early January that the state conducted compliance checks at nine child-care centers after Mr. Shirley posted his video and found them “operating as expected,” although it had “ongoing investigations” at four of them. One of the centers, which Mr. Shirley singled out because it misspelled the word “Learning” on its sign, has since voluntarily closed.</em></p><p>An inattentive reader might conclude from this paragraph that the Times disputes Shirley’s reporting.</p><p>To the extent that Bits about Money has an editorial line on that controversy, it is this: if you fish in a pond known to have 50% blue fish, and pull out nine fish, you will appear to be a savant-like catcher of blue fish, and people claiming that it is unlikely you have identified a blue fish will swiftly be made to look like fools. But the interesting bit of the observation is, almost entirely, the base rate of the pond. And I think journalism and civil society should do some genuine soul-searching on how we knew—<em>knew</em>—the state of that pond, but didn’t consider it particularly <em>important</em> or <em>newsworthy</em> until someone started fishing on camera.</p><p>But this is not a publication about particular ponds. It is a publication about getting better at fishing.</p><h2 id="common-signals-methods-and-epiphenomena-of-fraud">Common signals, methods, and epiphenomena of fraud</h2><h3 id="fraudsters-are-playing-an-iterated-game">Fraudsters are playing an iterated game</h3><p>The best non-fiction work on fraud is Dan Davies’ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lying-Money-Legendary-Frauds-Working/dp/1982114932">Lying for Money</a>. In it, you’ll find replete examples of something well-known to fraud investigators: the dominant next adventure for a former fraudster is… opening up a new fraud. And therefore, if you want to identify a ridiculously-high-hit-rate list of frauds in round N+1 of a game, a so-easy-its-practically-cheating way to do so is to look at what known fraudsters from round N are doing today.</p><p>There is a genuine difference in the culture and epistemology of the financial industry versus the government of the United States here. In the financial industry, we keep <a href="https://developer.mastercard.com/product/match/">blacklists</a> and getting a second chance after obvious misbehavior is intentionally non-trivial. This runs against deeply felt values of civil servants. An accusation is not a conviction, and absent clear authority to impose consequences in a new program, an actor <em>convicted at enormous societal cost</em> emerges to a new program officer as tabula rasa, equal in moral worth to any randomly chosen citizen.</p><p>I will not argue that Mastercard has better moral intuitions than the Founding Fathers. I would, however, happily suggest that the government not assume that the Constitution contains emanating penumbras obligating it to be repeatedly taken advantage of by the same people in the same fashion. We are not forbidden object permanence.</p><p>Minnesota raided the Sunshine Child Care Center in 2022 on suspicion of overbilling. <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/investigations/fraud/past-failed-day-care-fraud-investigations-investigators-say-dhs-refused-to-fully-help/89-6f828871-cbd6-49cd-aa3e-1f373639d9dd">No charges were brought</a>, in what investigators imply was less an exoneration and more an inter-departmental fumble. That operation was owned by one Fowsiya Hassan. A separate childcare center owned by Fowsiya Hassan was featured on YouTube recently. This follows on<a href="http://startribune.com/day-care-fraud-minnesota-video/601554760"> $1.5 million of funds received through Feeding Our Future</a>, a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/federal-jury-finds-feeding-our-future-mastermind-and-co-defendant-guilty-250-million">scaled fraud operation</a> which has generated over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_Our_Future">70 indictments, 5 criminal convictions, and 50 guilty pleas</a>. What a set of coincidences. Perhaps Hassan has, as she has <a href="https://media.kalzumeus.com/bam/fraud-investigator/hassan-complaint-vs-walz.pdf">alleged in a lawsuit</a>, been a frequent target of racially-motivated government investigations into a successful serial entrepreneur in the childcare field.</p><h3 id="the-fraud-supply-chain-is-detectable">The fraud supply chain is detectable</h3><p>Much of the intellectual energy in policy circles about fraud is aimed at retail-level fraud by individual beneficiaries. Most fraud, like most scaled property crime, is actually the result of a business process.</p><p>This is an elementary fact of capitalism. It is deeply disconcerting to find every benefits program independently rediscovers it a decade too late to do anything about it. Most bread is not baked by amateurs in their kitchens. It comes from <em>a bakery </em>which <em>exists to bake bread </em>and hires <em>specialists in baking bread</em> and then supports them with <em>capital-intensive built infrastructure</em>.</p><p>Fraud develops <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/the-fraud-supply-chain/">a supply chain</a>. Some elements in the supply chain are dual-use; the bad guys use Excel for the same reason every business uses Excel. Some elements in the supply chain, though, are specialized infrastructure with no or de minimis legitimate purpose. <em>Those elements can be profiled</em>.</p><p>I worked at Stripe for several years and am currently an advisor there. Stripe does not endorse what I write in my personal spaces. In its own spaces, Stripe has discussed being able to follow fraudulent operations in sufficient detail to determine <a href="https://stripe.com/annual-updates/2024">when the operators went to lunch</a>.</p><p>Fraudsters share specialists quite frequently. They use the same incorporation agents, the same mail services, the same CPAs, the same lawyers, etc.</p><p>You can make the same observation about many communities of practice. It is a non-coincidence that many tech startups are at 548 Market Street in San Francisco. 548 Market Street is not the world’s hippest coworking space. It is the address for <a href="https://www.earthclassmail.com/">EarthClassMail</a> in SF. There are many P.O. box providers in the world; many geeks with taste reach for ECM. (Bits about Money is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/can-spam">legally required</a> to maintain a postal address and, if you were ever to send it a physical letter, that would also end up in the hands of an EarthClassMail employee.)</p><p>Elsewhere in the world, there exist P.O. box providers whose customers statistically include fewer AI labs and more frauds. One imagines the specialist-in-fraud at the storefront, picking up the day’s take from fifteen separate boxes.</p><p>Elementary work graphing supporting infrastructure, even on something as unsophisticated as <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/1886922461918248987?s=20">butcher paper</a>, frequently unravels fraud networks. Data science has any number of more sophisticated approaches. Jetson Leder-Luis, an academic who now routinely works with the government, has <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/defrauding-government-jetson-leder-luis/">previously discussed</a> some approaches which work based on widely commercially available data sources.</p><p>There is an emerging defender’s advantage here in the age of LLMs, since exploratory work in visualizing and walking network graphs is getting much cheaper. You no longer need to buy Palantir and engage a “forward-deployed engineer” to cluster IP addresses. A non-technical fraud investigator could get an LLM to do that while eating at Chipotle, and the lunch would cost more.</p><p>This democratization of capabilities is relevant to journalists, formal and otherwise, and also to governments. RFPs and software contracting once de facto mandated a multi-year lead time to do an automated network analysis if an analyst thought perhaps their program might need one. Now that is an afternoon’s work, if we allow ourselves to do it. We should.</p><h3 id="investigators-should-expect-to-find-ethnically-clustered-fraud">Investigators should expect to find ethnically-clustered fraud</h3><p>As mentioned, there is enormous visceral distaste for the conclusion that a particular fraud ring operates within a particular community. This is quite common. You should expect to find circumstances which rhyme with it when conducting effective fraud investigations. You should not abandon fraud investigation when you chance upon this.</p><p>People assume a level of ethical fraughtness here which is not warranted. You would, if doing ethnographic work on perfectly legitimate businesses across industries, routinely discover ethnic concentration rather than population-level representation everywhere you looked. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Behind-Lobby-Indian-American/dp/0804778833">Patels run the motels</a>. One doesn’t need to adopt grand theories about how certain groups are predisposed to becoming pharmacists or startup employees or line cooks; simple microeconomic reasoning explains reality easily. Firms hire the people they already know, like, and trust. That will routinely include friends and family, who are going to be much more like the founding team than they are like randomly drawn members of the population. This is <em>the default outcome</em>.</p><p>Fraudsters do have one structural factor here. Everyone wants to trust their coworkers. Fraudsters need to trust their coworkers will be loyal <em>even upon threat of prison time</em>. That necessarily selects for tighter bonds than the typical workplace. Madoff was a family affair, SBF was in an on-again off-again romantic relationship with a chief lieutenant, and neither of those facts is accidental or incidental.</p><p>That’s the other ethical dimension of being other-than-blind to concentration: so-called <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investorpubsaffinity">affinity frauds</a> do not merely recruit <em>fraudsters</em> from affinity groups. They recruit <em>victims</em> from affinity groups. Madoff mobilized the social infrastructure of the Jewish community in New York and Palm Beach to find his marks. Community members certainly did not <em>intend</em> their charitable foundations to be looted by a fraudster. It was an emergent consequence of trust networks.</p><p>This also happens to “chosen” communities. FTX was, in material part, an affinity fraud against effective altruists, who are not a religion or ethnic group as traditionally construed.</p><p>And so when the great and the good turn a blind eye towards abuses because the perpetrators share an uncomfortable common factor, they are often simultaneously turning a blind eye towards abuses <em>of a community whose interests they purport to champion</em>.</p><h3 id="high-growth-rate-opportunities-attract-frauds">High growth rate opportunities attract frauds</h3><p>As covered extensively in Lying for Money, the necessary fundamental conceit of a fraud is growth in a business that doesn’t happen in the real world. “Every lie told incurs a debt to the truth, and one day, that debt will be paid”, to quote the excellent drama mini-series Chernobyl. Fraudsters forestall that day of reckoning by telling a bigger lie, increasing the debt, which (mostly as a side effect) alleges that they’re growing much faster than most of your legitimate portfolio. Happily, many businesses have figured out how to keep track of fast-growing customers. Tracking rocketships doesn’t require rocket science.</p><p>Sort-by-growth-rate-descending on new accounts will turn up a lot of interesting observations about the world. One is that Fortune 500 companies sometimes open new accounts, and you probably don’t need to open a fraud investigation file in that case. Another is that some people claim to be feeding millions of meals to a community of tens of thousands of people, beginning from a standing start, and growing local social services at a rate which an Uber Eats city manager would not expect to achieve in the wildest dreams of their go-to-market plan.</p><p>Feeding Our Future had a CAGR of 578% sustained for 2 years. Uber, during their meteoric growth period in core rideshare services, had an average CAGR of 226%. Their <em>best year </em>was 369%. But, if you asked in Minneapolis in 2021, you’d quickly find someone who had been in an Uber, but fail to find anyone who ate courtesy of Feeding Our Future. So curious, given that they were drubbing one of the fastest growing companies in history on growth rate.</p><p>Investigators in Minnesota were ringing the alarm bells for years about implausibly fast growth in Feeding Our Future’s reimbursement requests, including at new facilities. Feeding Our Future felt it was maxed out on the fraud it could conduct at existing sites, and expanded voraciously, including (most prominently) enrolling numerous restaurants as “feeding sites.” They then copy/pasted the usual playbook and requested reimbursement for implausible volumes at those sites, paying kickbacks to many participants. This then required growing the fraud, which… you get the general idea. We could have gotten off the bus at many points, and I suppose that is at some level a question of political will.</p><p>The highest growth rates in the economy generally are newer fields (you basically can’t sustain the alternative). This doesn’t imply that those fields are fraudulent, but they will tend to <em>disproportionately attract frauds</em>. The defenders in those fields have not yet paid their tuition to the School of Hard Knocks, and so attackers target the weaker systems. The higher growth rates of legitimate businesses function as protective cover for high stated growth rates of illegitimate businesses; a CAGR of 1,000% looks implausible for a restaurant but barely-meets-expectations for an AI software shop.</p><p>And, not to put too fine a point on it, many people are invested, literally and metaphorically, in whatever today’s new hotness is. People who could not secure an allocation in the more legitimate ends of it will sometimes find themselves adversarially selected by less salubrious actors. This will read to those people as a <em>justly earned success</em>. They might even have their marketing department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221109025610/https:/www.sequoiacap.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-spotlight/">write up their victimization</a> as <a href="https://www.sba.gov/article/2020/jul/06/sba-treasury-announce-release-paycheck-protection-program-loan-data">an indisputable success</a>.</p><p>And so, if you’re a defender who has many different lines of business and has limited resources (or political will), where should you deploy those resources? Should you place your bets on e.g. Social Security, a multi-trillion dollar program whose primary source of growth is fun to conjure but then requires 70 years of seasoning? Or should you place them on the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105331">Paycheck Protection Program</a>, or <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106696">pandemic-era unemployment insurance</a>, or <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/media-materials/media-materials-nationwide-genetic-testing-fraud/">genetic testing</a>, or <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105447.pdf">non-emergency medical transportation</a>? Despite those being smaller line items, they probably have more juice worth squeezing, and the fraud is more easily detectable. Just <em>look</em>.</p><h3 id="fraudsters-find-the-weakest-links-in-the-financial-system">Fraudsters find the weakest links in the financial system</h3><p>Bits about Money has extensively covered <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/money-laundering-and-aml-compliance/">anti-moneylaundering</a> and <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/kyc-and-aml-beyond-the-acronyms/">Know Your Customer regulations</a> and I won’t rehash those regimes here. A bit of tacit knowledge in the financial industry: some actors in the set “broadly considered trustworthy” are more worthy of trust than others… and some are less.</p><p>We are generally discreet about writing this down in as many words. But, as an analogy, cross-national regulatory bodies require that financial institutions maintain a list of high-risk jurisdictions to do business in. You are generally required to do enhanced due diligence on customers/activities/etc touching the high-risk list.</p><p>If you are particularly competent, and there are plusses and minuses to being competent in detecting fraud (you will <em>not</em> be the most popular person in the firm at bonus time; that goes to the folks who sold the high-growth accounts), you might have the analogous list of U.S. financial institutions which are <em>not entirely fronts for the bad guys</em>.</p><p>If one hypothetically has that list, that’s one more signal you can use in evaluating any particular account, and a one-stop shop for developing a list of accounts to look into. It would be uncouth of me to name an extant bank that has poor controls, but for a general example of the flavor, see my (scathing) <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/debanking-and-debunking/#so-called-choke-point-20">commentary on Silvergate’s AML and KYC program</a>. Without using any proprietary information, I predict confidently that Silvergate banked many more multi-billion dollar frauds as a percentage of its customer base than almost any of the U.S.’s 4,500 banks. (Trivial substantiation: divide FTXes-banked by total-count-of-customers.)</p><p>One might, if one has never seen the list, wonder whether it is simply proxying for something the financial industry is <em>definitely not allowed to proxy for</em>. One of the first things you learn as a data analyst is zip codes are extremely probative and <em>you are absolutely not allowed to use them</em>. The American system remembers the experience of redlining and has forbidden the financial industry from ever doing it again; the industry mostly respects that. But good news: institutions with weak controls environments are not, in fact, simply a proxy for “Who banks socially disadvantaged people?” There are many financial institutions that have that as an explicit business model. Some of them are good at their jobs. Some, less so, <em>and the fraudsters know it</em>.</p><p>This sometimes happens with the knowing connivance of the financial institution and/or their staff. For much more on that, see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Way-Rob-Bank-Own/dp/0292754183">histories</a> of the savings and loan crisis, or the Lying for Money chapter on control frauds. But more commonly it is simply a community of practice developing organic knowledge about who is just <em>very easy to get an account with</em>. You need accounts, as a business. As a fraudulent business, which intends to cycle through accounts and identities at a much higher rate than baseline, you would prefer to do business with a bank which will not detect that malfeasance.</p><p>And so you will disproportionately end up banked, with many of your buddies, at the least attentive place still capable of getting a license. And so an agency, trying to find a fraudulent network, might want to look at fraud-cases-by-routing-number and then start making some judgment calls.</p><p>One of the reasons the government has deputized the financial industry is it is good at keeping spreadsheets and quickly responds to requests for them. Perhaps the government should call up a few of their deputies and say “So, not <em>alleging</em> anything here, but we think you might have <em>a list</em>, carefully maintained by your fraud department for your own purposes. We want to see the list. It would be pro-social of you to give us a copy of it.”</p><h3 id="frauds-openly-suborn-identities">Frauds openly suborn identities</h3><p>There is a thriving market in identities to be used in fraud. This is because bad actors prefer not putting their own names on paper trails certain to become evidence, because they frequently “burn” themselves early in their careers, and because institutions have cottoned onto the wisdom of collecting lists of ultimate beneficiaries.</p><p>Sometimes this is a social process, conducted at e.g. the dinner table. Sometimes the market is explicitly a market. <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/defrauding-government-jetson-leder-luis/">Jetson recounted</a> that, having exhausted the supply of patients needing dialysis who could plausibly need ambulance services, frauds began bribing potential patients, first with donuts and then with cash. This is <em>extremely common</em>. In Minnesota, parents were recruited to childcare providers with the promise of cash kickbacks or (a detail we’ll return to in a moment) fictitious paperworked no-show jobs, sometimes at substantially fictitious companies.</p><p>Fraudsters <em>sometimes</em> exercise some level of operational discipline in their communications. The bad guys have also seen The Wire; they know Stringer Bell’s dictum on the wisdom of keeping notes on a criminal conspiracy. However, the population of people willing to be named in a federal indictment over $200 necessarily selects preferentially for individuals who are not experts at operational security. They will sometimes organize recruitment very openly, using the same channels you use for recruiting at any other time: open Facebook groups, Reddit threads, and similar. They will film TikTok videos flashing their ill-gotten gains, and explaining steps in order for how you, too, can get paid.</p><p>As a fraud investigator, you are allowed and encouraged to read Facebook at work.</p><p>Now, knowing that there exists the frequent epiphenomenon where fraudsters recruit strawmen to use their identities to qualify for payments: suppose that you have an entirely new enterprise whose first customers are individuals A, B, C, and D. You know, from past records, that A, B, C, and D have all been customers of an organization which you now know, positively, was a fraudulent actor. You might infer from this that A, B, C, and D <em>might have</em> sold their identities once, but you probably don’t have sufficient information to convict them in a court of law of that. (It is of course possible that they are simply unsophisticated, or that bad actors obtained their information without their knowledge, for example by misappropriating a client list from a previous corporate entity they happened to own/work for/etc.)</p><p>But do you have enough information to take a more-detailed-than-usual look at this totally new enterprise? <em>I think you do</em>.</p><h3 id="asymmetry-in-attacker-and-defender-burdens-of-proof">Asymmetry in attacker and defender burdens of proof</h3><p>We have choices, as the defender, in what levels of evidence we require to enter the circle of trust, what our epistemological standards are, and how much evidence we require to forcibly exit someone from the circle of trust.</p><p>A detail from the Minnesota cases is that these burdens are asymmetric, in a way which disadvantages the defender (all of us). That decision <em>is a choice</em> and we should make better choices.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the primary evidence of a child attending a day-care was a handwritten sign-in sheet of minimal probative value. Prosecutors referred to them as “almost comical” and “useless.” They were routinely fraudulently filled out by a 17 year old “signing” for dozens of parents sequentially in the same handwriting, excepting cases where they were <em>simply empty</em>.</p><p>To refute this “evidence”, the state forced itself to do weeks of stakeouts, producing hundreds of hours of video recording, after which it laboriously reconstructed exact counts of children seen entering/exiting a facility, compared it with the billing records, and then invoiced the centers <em>only for proven overbilling</em>.</p><p>On general industry knowledge, if you are selected for examination in e.g. your credit card processing account, and your submission of evidence is “Oh yeah, those transactions are ones we customarily paperwork with a 17 year old committing obvious fraud”, your account <em>will be swiftly closed</em>. The financial institution doesn’t have to reach a conclusion about every dollar which has ever flowed through your account. What actual purpose would there be in shutting the barn door after the horse has left? The only interesting question is what you’ll be doing tomorrow, and clearly what you intend to do tomorrow <em>is fraud</em>.</p><p>We can architect the asymmetry in the other fashion: legitimate businesses will customarily, as a fact of their operations, put enormous effort into creating visible effects in the world which are trivial to check. In technologist circles this is sometimes called a “proof of work” function.</p><p>Once upon a time, a team of fraud analysts asked how they could possibly determine frauds from non-frauds without having extensive industry knowledge about every possible commercializable human activity. I suggested that a good first pass was “Just ask the correspondent for a quick video, shot on their cell phone, of their workspace.”</p><p>That is minimally invasive for the business owner, generates a huge amount of signal (including that which can be correlated across accounts), and can be usefully adjudicated by non-specialists in a minute. No multi-month stakeout of their storefront is required. Of course you can convincingly fake a video of working in, say, a machine shop, but fraudsters maintaining spreadsheet row 87 about the machine shop will find that difficult to juggle with all the other required lies in their backlog. Actual machine shops, meanwhile, include people, which means they include functional cell phone cameras at no additional cost to anyone.</p><p>You can also get some signal from who can trivially produce a video and who needs a week of advance notice to find a cell phone to record those machines that were absolutely milling aluminum last week.</p><p>Fundamentally, we have a choice about where we put our investments in defanging fraud, and we should stop choosing to lose.</p><p>So-called “pay-and-chase”, where we put the burden on the government to disallow payments for violations retrospectively, has been enormously expensive and ineffective. Civil liability bounces off of exists-only-to-defraud LLC. Criminal prosecutions, among the most expensive kinds of intervention the government is capable of doing short of kinetic war, result in only a ~20% reduction in fraudulent behavior. Rearchitecting the process to require prior authorization resulted in an “immediate and permanent” 68% reduction. (I commend to you <a href="https://marriner-wpmedia.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dialysis_Ambulance_Fraud.pdf">this research</a> on Medicare fraud regarding dialysis transport. And yes, the team did some interesting work to distinguish fraudulent from legitimate usage of the program. Non-emergency transport for dialysis specifically had exploded in reimbursements—see Figure 1— not because American kidneys suddenly got worse but because fraudsters adversarially targeted an identified weakness in Medicare.)</p><p>Attackers carefully respond to signals they think they are being sent from defenders. A lawyer for some of the Minnesota defendants, Ryan Pacyga, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/29/us/fraud-minnesota-somali.html">quoted</a> by the New York Times as saying that his clients understood Minnesota to tacitly allow their actions.</p><p>&gt; No one was doing anything about the red flags. … It was like someone was stealing money from the cookie jar and they kept refilling it.</p><p>Don’t be the defender who sends that message. It will not work out well for you or your program.</p><h3 id="fraudsters-under-paperwork-their-epiphenomena">Fraudsters under-paperwork their epiphenomena</h3><p>Most frauds have rich external lives, with a soaring narrative of how deserving people are getting valuable services (and/or getting rich for being right and early regarding e.g. crypto asset cross-margining). They tend to be distinctly underpaperworked internally, partly because a synonym for “paperwork” is “evidence” and partly because… most frauds aren’t really that sophisticated, when it comes down to it. There is a true number; lie about it; <em>done</em>.</p><p>Like many time-pressed entrepreneurs busy talking to potential customers, fraudsters put the minimal amount of time necessary into bookkeeping and even less than that into paperworking epiphenomena of their frauds. One example of epiphenomena is sometimes the beneficiaries need <em>their own</em> paperwork. A legitimate mortgage company employs sales reps and a backoffice to help unsophisticated customers successfully get <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/mortgages-are-a-manufactured-product/">several hundred pages of paperwork together to sell a mortgage</a>. Frauds… mostly don’t do that.</p><p>And so, if you have e.g. a statutory requirement that a beneficiary be employed to access services, a fraudster might say “Don’t worry about it!” They’ll just assert that you are an employee at a cleaning company. Perhaps they might even go as far as <em>payrolling you</em> as an employee of a cleaning company. This kills two birds with one stone, paying you your kickback while also generating the paystub they need you to have to qualify for the government reimbursement. (This happened, per the OLA’s reports summarizing the results of many investigations, in Minnesota.)</p><p>But fraudsters <em>don’t actually operate cleaning companies </em>even in those cases where they <em>do operate daycares</em>.</p><p>Cleaning companies are legitimate businesses, in the main, and working for one is an honest occupation. And so a fraud investigator should feel no chagrin at calling a cleaning company in the phone book and asking for a quote. A cleaning company which expresses complete befuddlement that someone could ask for a quote is providing, ahem, evidence in a direction.</p><p>(I have to note, as someone who pays to send children to a private school, that there is replete evidence that the school is accepting new children, knocking on the door and asking will quickly result in being given a brochure, and there are scheduled open houses and similar. I can imagine a gratuitously mismanaged educational establishment which does none of these things, and I can imagine an educational establishment which makes a lot of money, but I have trouble holding both thoughts in my head at the same time.)</p><p>The core frauds are sometimes hardened, to an attenuated degree. The peripheral frauds collapse under even a glance. Architect processes to require more signals regarding the periphery, then architect a system which takes at least a cursory look at the periphery. You will trivially catch frauds.</p><p>If you’re worried about exposing the exact signal that you are using, costing utility of it in the future, you can use this as a “parallel construction” engine. Develop leads for investigation using the non-public signal, pull the core records as a matter of routine, find the discrepancies that all frauds leave in their core records, and then put <em>those</em> in the indictment. Ask your friendly neighborhood lawyer if that passes muster or if you need to add a sentence rhyming with “was selected for a routine audit on the basis of information available to the department.”</p><h3 id="machine-learning-can-adaptively-identify-fraud">Machine learning can adaptively identify fraud</h3><p>We have discussed some heuristics [1] for identifying fraud. The financial industry still makes material use of heuristics, but a heuristic is a compression of the real world. It will sometimes lose fidelity to the world. It will frequently, <em>by design</em>, be legible to the adversary.</p><p>The defender has one advantage the attacker cannot ever replicate: data at scale. It knows what legitimate use looks like because it has all the messy, contradictory, varying quality, typos-and-all data <em>which legitimate businesses in the real world constantly throw off</em>. You cannot duplicate all of the shadows on the wall of Plato’s cave without first duplicating the entire world. Fraudsters, even quite talented ones, can’t do that.</p><p>There are any number of techniques for machine learning in anti-fraud; <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/the-past-present-and-future-of-ai-with-stripe/">Emily Sands has previously discussed some with me</a>. An important subset of the field can adapt in real-time or close to it to changes in adversary (or legitimate!) behavior. For example, covid surprised the fraudsters at the same time as it surprised every supermarket in the country, but the ex-post actions of the fraudsters and the supermarkets were <em>very different</em>. Revenue went up for both, but only one group <em>actually runs a supermarket</em>. And so by ingesting and constantly analyzing data from all users, including retrospective annotation of which users you’ve identified to be frauds, you get better <em>and earlier</em> signals on which users are likely fraudulent and which are likely not.</p><p>This can inform outright interdiction or the investigate-then-punish loop that we ordinarily expect from government. It can also inform less consequential, easier-to-reverse interventions. For example, rather than putting all users immediately through the highest-possible-ceremony process for application, you can let most users do a lower-burden process, saving the higher levels of scrutiny for those which signal greater likelihood of being fraudulent. Or you can default to approving more applicants and reserve more of your investigatory budget for post-approval review, with this being equivalently costly by using better tasking of those reviews versus random allocation. Pay-and-chase becomes more palatable if it is not pay-and-pay-and-pay-and-pay-and-chase and more pay-until-we-decide-to-chase-but-stop-payments-at-that-decision-not-after-the-catching.</p><p>Machine learning isn’t simply useful from a perspective of decreasing fraud. The history of regulation of benefits programs is the history of too-late, too-harsh overcorrection to notorious abuses. Much of what advocates find most maddening and Kafkaesque about eligibility criteria and application processes was voted on by a legislature but bears the signature of a fraudster with a novel idea.</p><p>With a good machine learning practice, you can increase data ingested but decrease the burdensome formal application/etc requirements. This is in no small part because those data points are less probative (they are under the direct control of the attacker and <em>announce</em> that they will be scrutinized). But it bears a dividend: if you better control fraud, and can successfully demonstrate that to the public and legislators, you can <em>decrease application burden</em> and perhaps even <em>widen eligibility criteria</em>. Those are both in the direct interests of potential marginal beneficiaries.</p><p>A political commentator might focus more on the optics here than on the substance, because that is so frequently where the point of actual leverage is in politics. But the substantive reality of fraud losses <em>matters</em>. It is much easier to tell the story of fraud in benefits programs being rare, opposed by all right-thinking people, and swiftly sanctioned when that story is not <em>an obvious lie</em>.</p><h3 id="frauds-have-a-lifecycle">Frauds have a lifecycle</h3><p>You can read Lying for Money or other histories of frauds for more detail on the texture, but in the main, a dedicated fraudulent enterprise is created, is seasoned for a while before crossing the rubicon, has a period of increasing brazenness, is detected, is closed, and then is resurrected when the fraudster gets the band back together from round N+1.</p><p>We can intervene against the lifecycle model if we understand it. This begins with not defaulting to the understanding of investigators that frauds are isolated incidents by disparate individual actors. Those have been known to happen, but frauds are, by total damage, dominated by repeatable business models perpetrated by professional specialized bad actors. We should study them like we study other successful entrepreneurs, and then <em>not</em> invest in them.</p><p>One actionable insight from the lifecycle model: because the fraudster intends to be in business multiple times in their life, we should track the person-to-business mapping much more closely than we have historically. As Lying for Money says, if you’re an accountant and willing to go to prison, and you do not get rich via fraud… well, you are very bad at your job. That’s on you. When we give you <em>repeated chances to do it</em>, that’s on us.</p><p>One might think that the simplest imaginable reform is passing some sort of beneficial ownership regulation to unroll complex corporate structures designed to obscure who is actually puppeting Totally Not A Fraud, LLC. But the simplest imaginable reform is probably just <em>actually reading</em> corporate filings that already exist and are public. Again, most fraudsters are not the hypersophisticated Moriarties of the popular imagination. The Minnesota fraudsters frequently did not even bother with fig leaves. While they did find some nominee directors in some cases, many of the convicted operated their companies in their own names, with no complicated structuring at all. Sometimes multiple times, consecutively, after the previous entities had worn out their welcome with Minnesota.</p><p>The Fed should not be <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20230817a1.pdf">surprised when the bad guys buy a bank</a> when buying a bank requires an extended permission-seeking process and the bad guy’s corporate records, dutifully recorded <a href="https://egov.maryland.gov/BusinessExpress/EntitySearch/Business">by Maryland</a> (entity D20033544), are signed by a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">notorious bagman</a>. In the Fed’s defense, the bagman <em>lied to them about his intentions</em>, which was outside of their world model. (Pip pip to the New York Times for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/23/business/ftx-cryptocurrency-bank.html">figuring that out</a> before the Fed did. That is, sadly, not the usual way it works in financial journalism.)</p><h2 id="should-we-care-about-fraud-investigation-anyway">Should we care about fraud investigation, anyway?</h2><p>Responsible actors in civil society have a mandate to aggressively detect and interdict fraud. If they do not, they cede the field to irresponsible demagogues. They will not be careful in their conclusions. They will not be gentle in their proposals. They will not carefully weigh consequences upon the innocent. But they will be telling a truth that the great and the good are not.</p><p>The public will believe them, because the public believes its lying eyes.</p><p>[0] In a thing you will see frequently in fraud investigations, early detection of anomalies does not necessarily imply successful identification of the underlying fraudulent enterprise. A teacher was scandalized that a third of their students are using AI to write papers. Those “<a href="https://abc30.com/post/ghost-students-digital-network-thieves-posing-major-threat-ca-community-colleges/18496090/">students</a>” are identities puppeted by a criminal organization to siphon federal funding out of community colleges towards accounts controlled by the criminals. (I award myself one cookie for <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/1802036665503899781">correctly predicting this</a>.)</p><p>[1] A heuristic, in industry parlance, is a hard-coded rule or set of rules as opposed to a system which automatically adapts to changes in the underlying data. Compare the difference between “You are less likely to default on loans if you own versus renting”, which is absolutely demonstrable in aggregate data, versus “You are less likely to default on loans at 780 FICO versus 540 FICO.” For a variety of reasons, the culture that is legislators sees the problem with having one heuristic, which will obviously not come to the correct conclusion all of the time. It corrects for this issue by having several hundred pages of heuristics. Just one more heuristic, man, and we’ll have completely anticipated all the complexity of the world.</p><p>Heuristics are wonderful things! They’re cheap to adjudicate, easy to explain, and can be understood by lawyers, even the kind who have ascended from the practice of law to the writing of it. Happily, machine learning systems can have all of these properties if you make them priorities.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://infisical.com/blog/devops-to-solutions-engineering">https://infisical.com/blog/devops-to-solutions-engineering</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46915102">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was good at DevOps. This isn't a story about escaping a job I hated. I spent five years as a DevSecOps engineer at two large financial services companies. I built things I was proud of. I learned a ton. I was respected by my team.</p>
<p>But somewhere around year four, something shifted. The work didn't change. I did.
After five years, I made a change that surprised everyone who knew me: I left for a sales-adjacent role. Today, I'm one year into working as a Solutions Engineer at Infisical, and I want to share what I've learned. I think there are other DevOps engineers out there who might be feeling the same thing I felt, even if they can't quite name it yet.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-was-actually-missing">What I Was Actually Missing</h2>
<p>For a long time, I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong. The job was fine. I was good at it. But I started dreading the monotony of it all.</p>
<p>Part of it was repetition. My days had become predictable: check the dashboards, respond to tickets, debug whatever broke overnight, push some Terraform, go home. Maintain the HashiCorp Vault clusters, manage the secrets pipelines, answer the same support questions. Repeat. The work that used to feel engaging had become routine.</p>
<p>Part of it was stagnation. When I first started, I was learning constantly. Vault architecture, PKI fundamentals, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://infisical.com/blog/secret-rotation-vs-dynamic-secrets" node="[object Object]">secrets rotation</a>, the politics of platform adoption in a large enterprise. But once I'd mastered the core toolset and codebase, the learning curve flattened. I wasn't being challenged anymore. I was just keeping things running.</p>
<p>And part of it was isolation. Most days, it was just me and my pipelines. My primary relationships were with CI/CD tools and YAML files. The humans I did interact with were usually frustrated. They needed something from me, or something I owned was blocking them. I missed working with people, not just unblocking them from behind a ticket queue.</p>
<p>I didn't have a word for what I was looking for. I just knew that what I was doing wasn't it anymore.</p>
<h2 id="discovering-a-role-i-didnt-know-existed">Discovering a Role I Didn't Know Existed</h2>
<p>I had no idea Solutions Engineering was a real career path.</p>
<p>I knew sales existed. I vaguely knew there were "technical sales" people. But I assumed those were salespeople who'd learned enough technical vocabulary to get by, not engineers who actually stayed technical while working with customers.</p>
<p>Some friends in sales pointed it out to me. They'd watched me get animated whenever someone asked how something worked, and one of them eventually said: "You know there's a job where you explain technical stuff to people all day and help them solve problems, right?"</p>
<p>I'd never considered anything sales-adjacent because I assumed it meant leaving the technical world. But the more I learned about SE, the more I realized it might solve everything I was missing. New problems to solve every day. Constant learning. And more people.</p>
<p>I ended up joining Infisical. There's some irony there: I spent years managing HashiCorp Vault, and now I work for a Vault competitor. But that background is exactly why the role made sense. I knew the space. I knew the pain points. I knew what it felt like to be the engineer on the other side, evaluating these tools.</p>
<h2 id="one-year-in-what-actually-changed">One Year In: What Actually Changed</h2>
<p>The biggest change is the simplest one: I talk to people now. A lot of people. Every day.</p>
<p>In a single week, I might have a discovery call with a fintech startup, demo to a platform team at an aerospace company, help a healthcare organization troubleshoot their Kubernetes deployment, and run a workshop for a manufacturing company's security team. Fintech to aerospace to healthcare to manufacturing, all with completely different stacks and problems.</p>
<p>And it's not all over Zoom. I get to visit customers on-site, sit down with their teams face to face, and actually understand how they work. Over time, you build real relationships with these people. You become their trusted technical advisor, not just a vendor they talk to once. That's something I never experienced in DevOps, where my "customers" were internal teams who mostly just wanted me to unblock them.</p>
<p>The contrast with my DevOps days is stark. Monday morning used to mean checking dashboards, then the ticket queue, then the same Slack questions I'd answered last week. Now Monday morning might mean prepping for a demo with a company I've never spoken to, or helping a long-time customer work through a new challenge. I genuinely don't know what most days will look like until they start.</p>
<p>One thing I didn't expect: I'm not just talking to customers. I've become a bridge between the people using our product and the people building it. Every customer conversation surfaces pain points, feature gaps, edge cases our docs don't cover. I take that back to engineering and product. I'm actually influencing what we build next, which is something I never had in DevOps. I was always downstream of decisions, not shaping them.</p>
<h2 id="the-superpower-i-didnt-know-i-had">The Superpower I Didn't Know I Had</h2>
<p>My biggest fear going in was that I'd lose my technical edge. That I'd become "the sales guy" and slowly forget how things actually worked.</p>
<p>That didn't happen. As an SE, I'm exposed to everything. Customers running Kubernetes, ECS, Lambda, bare metal, air-gapped environments. AWS, Azure, GCP, hybrid setups. CI/CD in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI. I have to understand their environment well enough to actually help them, so the learning is constant. The stagnation I felt in DevOps? Gone.</p>
<p>But all those years in DevOps weren't just background. They're the reason I'm useful in this role.</p>
<p>I get on calls and prospects describe problems I've literally lived. They talk about the pain of managing secrets at scale, and I can say "yeah, I've been there" and actually mean it. That shared experience changes the dynamic completely. I'm not a salesperson trying to manufacture urgency. I'm an engineer who dealt with the same problems and found something that helped.</p>
<p>Is it all upside? No. Demoing is a skill I had to build from scratch. The context-switching is intense. The stress is different, more human, more ambiguous. But it's the kind of challenge that makes me better, not the kind that grinds me down.</p>
<h2 id="who-this-might-be-for">Who This Might Be For</h2>
<p>This path isn't for everyone. If you love going deep on a single system and optimizing it over years, SE might feel too scattered. If you genuinely prefer working alone with your tools, the constant human interaction might drain you.</p>
<p>But if any of this resonates, if you're good at DevOps but feel stuck, if the work has become repetitive, if you miss collaborating with people, if you find yourself energized when explaining technical concepts or helping someone work through a problem, Solutions Engineering might be worth exploring.</p>
<p>I didn't know this role existed until someone pointed it out to me. Now, one year in, I can't imagine going back. Not because DevOps is bad. It's critical work, and the people who do it well deserve more credit than they get.</p>
<p>But for me, it was missing something I didn't know how to name until I found it: the chance to be technical and connected. To keep learning, to solve new problems every day, and to do it alongside people instead of behind a queue.</p>
<p>If you're a DevOps engineer feeling something similar, even if you can't quite articulate it, maybe this is what you're looking for too.</p>
<p>I didn't know this role existed until someone pointed it out to me. Consider this me pointing it out to you. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://infisical.com/careers" node="[object Object]">We're hiring at Infisical</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

What riders and local communities don’t see is our Driver navigating billions of miles in virtual worlds, mastering complex scenarios long before it encounters them on public roads. Today, we are excited to introduce the Waymo World Model, a frontier generative model that sets a new bar for large-scale, hyper-realistic autonomous driving simulation.&nbsp;</p><figure><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="auto"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/4WAFYsuPA964qm937ooAm0/bd1e232de236794e89f6daa89b594b93/topline_video_close_loop_sim_cropped.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/MYTRduQ4UI2H6368so4k7/b8229593baf95651606a39348516edd8/topline_video_closed_loop_sim_cropped.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard><figcaption><p>Simulation of the Waymo Driver evading a vehicle going in the wrong direction. The simulation initially follows a real event, and seamlessly transitions to using camera and lidar images automatically generated by an efficient real-time Waymo World Model.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Simulation is a critical component of Waymo’s AI ecosystem and one of the three key pillars of our approach to <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2025/12/demonstrably-safe-ai-for-autonomous-driving"><u>demonstrably safe AI</u></a>. The Waymo World Model, which we detail below, is the component that is responsible for generating hyper-realistic simulated environments.</p><p>The Waymo World Model is built upon <a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/"><u>Genie 3</u></a>—Google DeepMind's most advanced general-purpose world model that generates photorealistic and interactive 3D environments—and is adapted for the rigors of the driving domain. By leveraging Genie’s immense world knowledge, it can simulate exceedingly rare events—from a tornado to a casual encounter with an elephant—that are almost impossible to capture at scale in reality. The model’s architecture offers high controllability, allowing our engineers to modify simulations with simple language prompts, driving inputs, and scene layouts. Notably, the Waymo World Model generates high-fidelity, multi-sensor outputs that include both camera and lidar data.</p><p>This combination of broad world knowledge, fine-grained controllability, and multi-modal realism enhances Waymo’s ability to safely scale our service across more places and new driving environments. In the following sections we showcase the Waymo World Model in action, featuring simulations of the Waymo Driver navigating diverse rare edge-case scenarios.</p><h3 id="emergent-multimod">🌎 Emergent Multimodal World Knowledge</h3><p>Most simulation models in the autonomous driving industry are trained from scratch based on only the on-road data they collect. That approach means the system only learns from limited experience. Genie 3’s strong world knowledge, gained from its pre-training on an extremely large and diverse set of videos, allows us to explore situations that were never directly observed by our fleet.</p><p>Through our specialized post-training, we are transferring that vast world knowledge from 2D video into 3D lidar outputs unique to Waymo’s hardware suite. While cameras excel at depicting visual details, lidar sensors provide valuable complementary signals like precise depth. The Waymo World Model can generate virtually any scene—from regular, day-to-day driving to rare, long-tail scenarios—across multiple sensor modalities.</p><h5 id="extreme-weather"><b>🌪️ Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters</b></h5><div><w-equalize-heights><w-carousel loop="true"><ul data-slot="slides-container"><li id="P0-0-slide-0" data-index="0" aria-current="true"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="auto" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/784EOrH0Jy8s702T8plcx5/3ce22b07dde57095d6e65364cda0a421/020_IP_Straight_Final_W12.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/sGRJJxaoSP2KoutDztOfV/bf02a3ebf193312d4b540973115d0484/world_knowledge_snowy_ggbridge_og_joint.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div><figcaption><p>Simulation: Driving on the Golden Gate Bridge, covered in light snow.

simulator that adheres to specific driving inputs. This enables us to simulate “what if” counterfactual events such as whether the Waymo Driver could have safely driven more confidently instead of yielding in a particular situation.</p><p><i>Counterfactual driving.</i><b> </b>We demonstrate simulations both under the original route in a past recorded drive, or a completely new route. While purely reconstructive simulation methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splats, or 3DGS) suffer from visual breakdowns due to missing observations when the simulated route is too different from the original driving, the fully learned Waymo World Model maintains good realism and consistency thanks to its strong generative capabilities.</p><div><w-equalize-heights><w-carousel loop="true"><ul data-slot="slides-container"><li id="P0-0-slide-0" data-index="0" aria-current="true"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="auto" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/6OYJoJ78BN34vKwiLj4ajm/de0073fdaf96846ae6b1f25104ee6b01/final1_merged.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/3ZSSI5LY0g7MVMuiPrwmVR/2052051441f0cac184e8acc5f443cb3b/final1_merged.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div></figure></w-media></li><li id="P0-0-slide-1" data-index="1"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="none" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/2zTZKR14w9qidRRQt5iSzR/ad61b7935bbc7734215fcd18bd1ddbf2/final2_merged.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/1Ei0koxxgQmnOutUZdyFzN/d062c892b66fa04e38770d27731b3263/final2_merged.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div></figure></w-media></li><li id="P0-0-slide-2" data-index="2"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="none" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/3Q5jVioj0ra78XV2LLYIDl/d37a967c950f21a872cbde017597276d/final3_merged.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/3bpSzfPHEKNNfzDaMLIzCK/9028583da5df9bc09ba7de452e5b3a1a/final3_merged.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div></figure></w-media></li><li id="P0-0-slide-3" data-index="3"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="none" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/5vDoSed8230fQZOPy9cyFA/db0e7acd7b83f51dd662cae4abeabe0d/final4_merged.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/6LPA0otikaS9vXwy7N3sae/2563894f6d6c69285f28b69ebbdd77be/final4_merged.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div></figure></w-media></li><li id="P0-0-slide-4" data-index="4"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="none" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/7tynEJ9qQxAyTMged62Fr7/3471bf1df4d1357f46c795b4b31de4e0/final5_merged.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/5YdYLuoeuDkNoXBPZaSy7q/3012a3ab80c59fe9f7a1a3658bc9659f/final5_merged.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div></figure></w-media></li></ul></w-carousel></w-equalize-heights></div><p><b>Scene layout control</b> allows for customization of the road layouts, traffic signal states, and the behavior of other road users.

After finding out that the city council was considering a housing element that would have bowed to NIMBY pressure, we sent two letters to the city, reminding it of its legal obligations under state law to approve the upzoning — and that a failure to do so would open the city up to a lawsuit. Not only were we well within our rights to send those letters, we were right on the merits too.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJTq_EmAmftTmmeWtEwLXbYBMoca1K5e/edit" rel="">As we wrote in the second letter</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The options in front of you are to respect the efforts of your staff which led to a Housing Element and subsequent rezoning AND an application consistent with those measures, or to waste time and open yourselves to our lawsuit while crippling your ability to meet the statutory RHNA obligation.</p></blockquote><p><span>These letters, which we often send to cities, are frankly delightful to send. Thanks to our work and the work of our allies, city councils in California tempted to vote against fulfilling their housing obligations are hemmed in from three directions — either </span><a href="https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/planning-and-community/sb-9-fact-sheet.pdf" rel="">approving the housing under SB 9</a><span>, facing the </span><a href="https://www.yimbylaw.org/buildersremedy" rel="">builder’s remedy</a><span>, or </span><a href="https://sfyimby.com/2023/03/twelve-years-after-proposal-terrace-of-lafayette-approval-upheld-by-court.html" rel="">a lawsuit under the Housing Accountability Act</a><span>. All roads lead to new housing. It’s delightful.</span></p><p><span>But NIMBYs in SoCal were less delighted. As you might have read in the </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/realestate/article/sonja-trauss-yimby-21309436.php" rel="">San Francisco Chronicle</a><span>, one of them filed a complaint with the California State Bar, saying that I was practicing law without a license. They said because I’m not an attorney (which is true), I was offering “legal analysis,” which only licensed attorneys are allowed to do.</span></p><p>Here’s an excerpt of the letter that the state bar sent me (I’m leaving out the name of the person who filed the complaint, but keeping their typos).</p><blockquote><p>Our office has received a complaint [...] alleging that you are practicing law without a license in California. The complaint alleges that you [and] Yimby Law writes letters to CA cities threatening legal action and stating incorrect housing laws and city ordinance laws.</p><p>REDACTED includes with [their] complaint a copy of a letter you sent to the City of Rancho Palos Verdes/Citty [sic] Council on March 17, 2025. Your letter provides a legal analysis related to removal of certain sites from the “Housing Site Inventory.”</p></blockquote><p><span>This is, to put it mildly, preposterous. Not only am I not holding myself out as an attorney, but, </span><a href="https://ij.org/press-release/public-interest-law-firm-stands-with-california-yimby-advocacy-group-to-protect-first-amendment-rights/" rel="">as the Institute for Justice pointed out in their response to the state bar</a><span>, sending letters like these are protected under not one but two clauses of the First Amendment — the right to free speech and the right to petition the government.</span></p><p><span>As part of our work, YIMBY Law sends letters to cities in California that remind them of their obligations under state laws like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Housing_Accountability_Act" rel="">the Housing Accountability Act</a><span>. Those letters say something different each time, but the general gist usually is: “Hey, we saw you are thinking about taking some action that seems like it would violate state law. You shouldn’t do that. And if you do, we might sue you, and if we do we tend to win.” Most of the time, our letters never turn into lawsuits. We send a letter and city officials realize that not only are we right, it’s not worth the hassle of fighting in court. So they do the right thing. This is the kind of thing that we and other YIMBY groups have done ever since </span><a href="https://sfyimby.com/2023/03/twelve-years-after-proposal-terrace-of-lafayette-approval-upheld-by-court.html" rel="">the lawsuit against the East Bay suburb of Lafayette</a><span>. (You can see the whole list of those cases </span><a href="https://www.yimbylaw.org/past-lawsuits" rel="">here</a><span>.) Most recently, we’re </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-10/pro-housing-group-sues-newsom-over-duplex-ban-in-wildfire-zones" rel="">suing the state of California</a><span> over the governor’s executive order restricting duplexes in the areas affected by the Palisades fire.</span></p><p>I am confident that the state bar will agree with the Institute for Justice here, which cited case after case in which the courts have held that this kind of advocacy work is squarely protected no matter if a person is an attorney, not an attorney, offering legal analysis, not offering legal analysis, right on the merits, wrong on the merits, fighting for a good cause, or fighting for a bad one.  The First Amendment protects our right to lobby the government as much as it protects the rights of the AARP, the NRA, the American Heart Association, the California Nurses Association, Liveable California, the League of California Cities, the Group In Favor of That Thing You Love, and the Group in Favor of That Thing You Absolutely Hate.</p><p>It’s important to be really clear about this — not only do NIMBYs like the one who filed this complaint think that we are wrong about housing, they don’t even think we should be allowed to argue for more housing. They don’t think we are even entitled to a fair hearing. We should all recognize that silencing your political rivals is beyond the pale and that complaints like this one, even if they end up going nowhere, can have a chilling effect on activists and ordinary people who want to exercise their rights.</p><p><span>Speaking as an activist, this kind of delegitimization is a NIMBY tactic we have to put up with all the time. Not only do NIMBYs think we are wrong, a lot of them seem to think that we don’t even get to have a say. There’s a pretty consistent undercurrent to a lot of NIMBYism that can’t even imagine why somebody would be in favor of more housing and laws that make it easier to build it. Something about us breaks their brains. That’s frustrating. Democracy only works when we can have </span><a href="https://thepointmag.com/politics/a-republic-of-discussion-habermas-at-ninety/" rel="">free-ranging conversation with each other</a><span>. The only rules really are that you should give reasons for what you believe and that you shouldn’t force anybody else out of the discussion.</span></p><p><span>There are plenty more examples. One of the first times my colleague Laura Foote, the Executive Director of YIMBY Action sent a San Francisco Supervisor an email expressing her opinion on public policy, they wrote back asking “What’s that area code, where are you from?” The message being — it wasn’t 415 and therefore she didn’t count. One of the most common tropes in the early days of press coverage was journalists implying — or outright stating — that we were shills for the real-estate industry, as if they couldn’t believe someone would actually be in favor of more housing if they weren’t being paid to do it. We still get called shills sometimes, when we aren’t being called </span><a href="https://realprogressives.substack.com/p/yimbyism-is-code-for-gentrification" rel="">gentrifiers</a><span>, </span><a href="https://allaspectreport.com/2025/06/21/the-cruel-inhumanity-of-the-yimby-movement/" rel="">inhuman</a><span>, </span><a href="https://truthout.org/articles/yimbys-the-alt-right-darlings-of-the-real-estate-industry/" rel="">alt-right</a><span>, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@tdfischer_/the-progressive-disinformation-machine-7281184cac3f" rel="">white supremacists</a><span>, and — for some reason I cannot explain — </span><a href="https://www.citywatchla.com/voices/25290-yimbyism-there-s-a-whole-lot-of-shilling-going-on" rel="">Scientologists</a><span>. (Yes In Xenu’s Backyard, I guess.)</span></p><p>It’s not just online delegitimation. It’s distressingly common that when we show up at public meetings that NIMBYs will boo and hiss at us while we are talking. Laura was at a public meeting once in Cupertino where the NIMBYs in the crowd started shouting “Where are you from? Where are you from?” She started quoting Martin Luther King saying that an “injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere,” when a woman who later got elected to the city council ran up and pulled the microphone from her hand.</p><p><span>NIMBYs in Santa Monica convinced the state Fair Political Practices Committee that the mayor pro tem had </span><a href="https://www.smdp.com/state-regulators-say-councilman-zwick-is-conflicted-on-housing-votes/" rel="">to recuse himself</a><span> from votes on housing because he worked for the Housing Action Committee. (If you think that makes sense, ask yourself if a mayor pro tem who also happened to work for a gun control group should have to recuse themselves from voting on a gun control measure? Or, more to the point, if a mayor pro tem who owned property and didn’t want the competition should recuse themselves from a zoning vote?)</span></p><p><span>More recently, a San Rafael </span><a href="https://www.cityofsanrafael.org/public-hearing-for-project-at-700-irwin/" rel="">planning commission</a><span> hearing on a proposal for mixed-income housing became so heated that an opponent spat on a commenter supporting it.</span></p><p>In a democracy, even an imperiled one like ours, one of the most important things we can do is to not spit on each other for having different opinions. That seems pretty minimal and something that we could all agree on, even if we don’t agree on housing.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://inpractice.yimbyaction.org/p/nimbys-arent-just-shutting-down-housing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://inpractice.yimbyaction.org/p/nimbys-arent-just-shutting-down-housing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

					<p>Today, Heroku is transitioning to a sustaining engineering model focused on stability, security, reliability, and support. Heroku remains an actively supported, production-ready platform, with an emphasis on maintaining quality and operational excellence rather than introducing new features. We know changes like this can raise questions, and we want to be clear about what this means for customers.</p>
<p>There is no change for customers using Heroku today. Customers who pay via credit card in the Heroku dashboard—both existing and new—can continue to use Heroku with no changes to pricing, billing, service, or day-to-day usage. Core platform functionality, including applications, pipelines, teams, and add-ons, is unaffected, and customers can continue to rely on Heroku for their production, business-critical workloads.</p>
<p>Enterprise Account contracts will no longer be offered to new customers. Existing Enterprise subscriptions and support contracts will continue to be fully honored and may renew as usual.</p>
<h2>Why this change</h2>
<p>We’re focusing our product and engineering investments on areas where we can deliver the greatest long-term customer value, including helping organizations build and deploy enterprise-grade AI in a secure and trusted way.</p>

you need long-term stability, it may be best to wait for a stable release, or
be prepared to adapt to updates along the way.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">LiteBox is a sandboxing library OS that drastically cuts down the interface to the host, thereby reducing attack surface.  It focuses on easy interop of various "North" shims and "South" platforms.  LiteBox is designed for usage in both kernel and non-kernel scenarios.</p>
<p dir="auto">LiteBox exposes a Rust-y <a href="https://docs.rs/nix" rel="nofollow"><code>nix</code></a>/<a href="https://docs.rs/rustix" rel="nofollow"><code>rustix</code></a>-inspired "North" interface when it is provided a <code>Platform</code> interface at its "South".  These interfaces allow for a wide variety of use-cases, easily allowing for connection between any of the North--South pairs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example use cases include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Running unmodified Linux programs on Windows</li>
<li>Sandboxing Linux applications on Linux</li>
<li>Run programs on top of SEV SNP</li>
<li>Running OP-TEE programs on Linux</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>I’ve been going round and round in my mind about a particular discussion around LLMs: are they really similar to compilers? Are we headed toward a world where people don’t look at the underlying code for their programs?</p>
<p>People have been making versions of this argument since Andrej Karpathy’s “English is the hottest new programming language.” Computer science has been advancing language design by building higher and higher level languages; this is the latest iteration: maybe we no longer need a separate language to express ourselves to machines; we can just use our native tongues (let alone English).</p>
<p>My stance has been pretty rigid for some time: LLMs hallucinate, so they aren’t reliable building blocks. If you can’t rely on the translation step, you can’t treat it as a serious abstraction layer because it provides no stable guarantees about the underlying system.</p>
<p>As models get better, hallucinations become less central (even though models still make plenty of mistakes). Lately I’ve been thinking about a different question: imagine an LLM that never “hallucinates” in the usual sense, one that reliably produces some plausible implementation of what you asked. Would that make it the next generation of compiler? And what would that mean for programming and software engineering in general?</p>
<p>This post is my stab at that question. The core of my argument is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifying systems is <em>hard</em>; and we are <em>lazy</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before getting to what that means in practice, I want to pin down something else: what does it mean for a language to be “higher level”?</p>
<p>Programming is, at a fundamental level, the act of making a computer do something. Computers
are very dumb from the point of view of a human. You need to tell the computer exactly what to do,
there's no inference. A computer fundamentally doesn't even have the notion of a value, type, concept; everything
is a series of bits, which are processed to generate other bits, we bring meaning to this whole ordeal.
Very early on, people have started by building arithmetic and logical instructions into computers,
you would have 2 different bit sequences each denoting a number, you could add, subtract, multiply them.
In order to make a computer do something, you could denote your data in terms of a bunch of numbers, map
your logical operations onto those ALU instructions, and interpret the result in your domain at the end.
Then, you can define a bunch of operations on your domain, which will be compiled down to those smaller ALU
instructions, and <em>voila</em>, you have a compiler at hand.</p>
<p>This compiler is, admittedly, kind of redundant. It doesn't do anything you would be able to do because you
essentially have a direct mapping between your two <em>languages</em>, your higher level language desugars into a
bunch of lower level ALU instructions, so anyone would be able to implement the same mapping very easily,
and even go further, perhaps just write the ALU instructions themselves.</p>
<p>What <em>real</em> higher level languages do is they give you an entirely new language that is eventually mapped
to the underlying instruction set in non-trivial mechanisms in order to reduce the mental complexity
on the side of the programmer. For instance, instruction sets do not have the concept of variables,
nor loops, nor data structures. You can definitely build a sequence of instructions that amount to a binary
search tree, but the mental burden of the process is orders of magnitude higher than any classic programming
language. Structs, Enums, Classes, Loops, Conditionals, Exceptions, Variables, Functions are all properties
that exist in higher level languages that are compiled away when going down the stack.</p>
<p>There's a crucial aspect of compilation, which is that the programmer gives away some control, that's essentially
what removes the mental burden. If a programming language doesn't give away any control, it arguably isn't a very
useful abstraction layer, because it did not absolve you of any responsibility that comes with that control. One
of the first examples of this type of control we gave away is code layout. If you are writing handwritten assembly, you control where the code lives in the program memory. When you go into a language with structured control flow with callable procedures,
you now don't have exact control over when the instructions for a particular piece of code is fetched, how basic
blocks are arranged in the memory. Other examples are more common, the <em>runtime</em> of a language works in the background
to absolve you of other responsibilities such as manual memory management, which itself was an abstraction
for automatically managing how your data is organized in memory in the first place.</p>
<p>This loss of control raises a question: how do we know the abstraction is implemented correctly? More importantly, <strong>what does it mean for an abstraction to be correct?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few layers to the answer. First, mature abstractions are defined against some semantics: what behaviors are allowed, what behaviors are forbidden, and what guarantees you’re meant to rely on. In C, <code>malloc</code> gives you a pointer to a block of memory of at least the requested size (or <code>NULL</code>), suitably aligned, which you may later <code>free</code>. It doesn’t give you “exclusive ownership” in the language-theoretic sense, but it does define a contract you can program against.</p>
<p>Second, we validate implementations with testing (and sometimes proofs), because these guarantees are at least in principle checkable. Third, in practice, guarantees are contextual: most programs care that allocation works; only some care deeply about allocator performance, fragmentation behavior, or contention, those are the cases where people swap allocators or drop down a level.</p>
<p>This highlights a critical point: abstraction guarantees aren’t uniform; they’re contextual. Most of the time, that contextuality is dominated by functional correctness: “does it do what it says?” Programming languages made enormous progress by giving us abstractions whose functional behavior can be specified precisely and tested relentlessly. We can act as if push/pop on a Python list has the same
semantics as a vector in C++ even when the underlying implementation differs wildly across languages and runtimes.</p>
<p>LLM-based programming challenges this domination because the “language” (natural language) doesn’t come with precise semantics. That makes it much harder to even state what functional correctness should mean without building a validation/verification suite around it (tests, types, contracts, formal specs).</p>
<p>This gets to my core point. What changes with LLMs isn’t primarily nondeterminism, unpredictability, or hallucination. It’s that the programming interface is functionally underspecified by default. Natural language leaves gaps; many distinct programs can satisfy the same prompt. The LLM must fill those gaps.</p>
<p>Just as a garbage-collected runtime takes control over how and when memory is reclaimed, “programming in English” relinquishes control over which exact program gets built to fulfill your requirements. The underspecification forces the model to guess the data model, edge cases, error behavior, security posture, performance tradeoffs in your program, analogous to how an allocator chooses an allocation strategy.</p>
<p><strong>This creates quite a novel danger in how we write programs.</strong></p>
<p>Humans have always written vague requirements; that part isn’t new. What’s new is how directly an LLM can turn vagueness into running code, inviting us to outsource functional precision itself. We can leave meaningful behavioral choices to a generator and only react to the outcome.</p>
<p>If you say “give me a note-taking app,” you’re not describing one program, you’re describing a huge space of programs. The LLM can return one of a billion “reasonable” implementations: something Notion-like, Evernote-like, Apple Notes-like, or something novel. The danger is that “reasonable” choices can still be wrong for your intent, and you won’t notice which commitments got made until later.</p>
<p>This pushes development toward an iterative refinement loop: write an imprecise spec, get one of the possible implementations, inspect it, refine the spec, repeat until you’re satisfied. In this mode, you become more like a consumer selecting from generated artifacts than a producer deliberately constructing one.</p>
<p>And you also lose something subtle: when you hand-build, the “space of possibilities” is explored through design decisions you’re forced to confront. With a magic genie, those decisions get made for you; you only see the surface of what you ended up with.</p>
<p>I don’t think this point is widely internalized yet: hallucinations aren’t the only problem. Even in a hallucination-free world, the ability to take the easy way out on specification plays into a dangerously lazy part of the mind. You can see it in the semi-conscious slips (I’m guilty too): accept-all-edits, “one more prompt and it’ll be fine,” and slow drifting into software you don’t really understand.</p>
<p>That’s why I think the will to specify is going to become increasingly important. We already see LLMs shine when they’re given concrete constraints: optimization, refactors, translations, migrations, tasks that used to be so labor-intensive we’d laugh at the timeline, become feasible when the target behavior is well specified and backed by robust test suites.</p>
<p>It’s been true for a long time that specifying a piece of software is often harder than building it. But we may be entering a world where: if you can specify, you can build. If that’s right, then <a href="https://alperenkeles.com/posts/verifiability-is-the-limit/">specification and verification become the bottleneck</a>, and therefore the core skill.</p>
<p>This isn’t my most polished post, but I wanted to get the idea out. I do think it’s possible to treat LLMs as compiler-like, in the loose sense that they translate a specification into an executable artifact. But the control we relinquish to that translation layer is larger than it has ever been.</p>
<p>Traditional compilers reduce the need to stare at lower layers by replacing low-level control with defined semantics and testable guarantees. LLMs also reduce the need to read source code in many contexts, but the control you lose isn’t naturally bounded by a formal language definition. You can lose control all the way into becoming a consumer of software you meant to produce, and it’s frighteningly easy to accept that drift without noticing.</p>
<p>So: I don’t think we should fully accept the compiler analogy without qualification. As LLMs become a central toolchain component, we’ll need ways to strengthen the will to specify, and to make specification and verification feel as “normal” as writing code used to.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			<p>In 2024, Apple signed a deal with Taboola to serve ads in its app, notably Apple News. John Gruber, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/07/apple_taboola_sitting_in_a_tree">writing in Daring Fireball</a> said at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If you told me that the ads in Apple News have been sold by Taboola for the last few years, I’d have said, “Oh, that makes sense.” Because the ads in Apple News — at least the ones I see1 — already look like chumbox Taboola ads. Even worse, they’re incredibly repetitious.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I use Apple News to keep up on topics that I don’t find in sources I pay for (The Guardian and The New York Times). But there’s no way I’m going to pay the exorbitant price Apple wants for Apple News+ – £13 – because, while you get more publications, you still get ads.</p>
<p>And those ads have gotten worse recently. Many if not most of them look like and probably are scams. Here are a few examples from Apple News today.</p>

<p>Here are three ads that are scammy; the first two were clearly generated by AI, and the third may have been created by AI.</p>

<p>This recent registration doesn’t necessarily mean they are scams, but they don’t inspire much confidence.</p>
<p>Here’s one example. This ad from Tidenox, whose website says I am retiring, showing a photo of an elderly woman, who says, “For 26 years, Tidenox has been port of your journey in creating earth and comfort at home.” The image of the retiring owner is probably made by AI.</p>

<p>These fake “going out of business ads” have been around for a few years, and even <a href="https://www.bbb.org/all/consumer/scam/fake-going-out-of-business-sales">the US Better Business Bureau warns about them</a>, as they take peoples’ money then shut down. Does Apple care? Does Taboola care? Does Apple care that Taboola serves ads like this? My guess: no, no, and no.</p>
<p>Note the registration date for the tidenox.com domain. It’s nowhere near 26 years old, and it’s registered in China:</p>

<p>Shame on Apple for creating a honeypot for scam ads in what they consider to be a premium news service. This company cannot be trusted with ads in its products any more.</p>
