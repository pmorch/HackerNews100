Our flagship model, <strong>Qwen3-235B-A22B</strong>, achieves competitive results in benchmark evaluations of coding, math, general capabilities, etc., when compared to other top-tier models such as DeepSeek-R1, o1, o3-mini, Grok-3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro. Additionally, the small MoE model, <strong>Qwen3-30B-A3B</strong>, outcompetes QwQ-32B with 10 times of activated parameters, and even a tiny model like Qwen3-4B can rival the performance of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3/qwen3-235a22.jpg" width="100%"></figure><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3/qwen3-30a3.jpg" width="100%"></figure><p>We are open-weighting two MoE models: <strong>Qwen3-235B-A22B</strong>, a large model with 235 billion total parameters and 22 billion activated parameters, and <strong>Qwen3-30B-A3B</strong>, a smaller MoE model with 30 billion total parameters and 3 billion activated parameters. Additionally, six dense models are also open-weighted, including <strong>Qwen3-32B</strong>, <strong>Qwen3-14B</strong>, <strong>Qwen3-8B</strong>, <strong>Qwen3-4B</strong>, <strong>Qwen3-1.7B</strong>, and <strong>Qwen3-0.6B</strong>, under Apache 2.0 license.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Models</th><th>Layers</th><th>Heads (Q / KV)</th><th>Tie Embedding</th><th>Context Length</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Qwen3-0.6B</td><td>28</td><td>16 / 8</td><td>Yes</td><td>32K</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen3-1.7B</td><td>28</td><td>16 / 8</td><td>Yes</td><td>32K</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen3-4B</td><td>36</td><td>32 / 8</td><td>Yes</td><td>32K</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen3-8B</td><td>36</td><td>32 / 8</td><td>No</td><td>128K</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen3-14B</td><td>40</td><td>40 / 8</td><td>No</td><td>128K</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen3-32B</td><td>64</td><td>64 / 8</td><td>No</td><td>128K</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Models</th><th>Layers</th><th>Heads (Q / KV)</th><th># Experts (Total / Activated)</th><th>Context Length</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Qwen3-30B-A3B</td><td>48</td><td>32 / 4</td><td>128 / 8</td><td>128K</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen3-235B-A22B</td><td>94</td><td>64 / 4</td><td>128 / 8</td><td>128K</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The post-trained models, such as <strong>Qwen3-30B-A3B</strong>, along with their pre-trained counterparts (e.g., <strong>Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base</strong>), are now available on platforms like <strong>Hugging Face</strong>, <strong>ModelScope</strong>, and <strong>Kaggle</strong>. For deployment, we recommend using frameworks like <strong>SGLang</strong> and <strong>vLLM</strong>. For local usage, tools such as <strong>Ollama</strong>, <strong>LMStudio</strong>, <strong>MLX</strong>, <strong>llama.cpp</strong>, and <strong>KTransformers</strong> are highly recommended. These options ensure that users can easily integrate Qwen3 into their workflows, whether in research, development, or production environments.</p><p>We believe that the release and open-sourcing of Qwen3 will significantly advance the research and development of large foundation models. Our goal is to empower researchers, developers, and organizations around the world to build innovative solutions using these cutting-edge models.</p><p>Feel free to try Qwen3 out in Qwen Chat Web (<a href="https://chat.qwen.ai/">chat.qwen.ai</a>) and mobile APP!</p><h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2><ul><li><strong>Hybrid Thinking Modes</strong></li></ul><p>Qwen3 models introduce a hybrid approach to problem-solving. They support two modes:</p><ol><li>Thinking Mode: In this mode, the model takes time to reason step by step before delivering the final answer. This is ideal for complex problems that require deeper thought.</li><li>Non-Thinking Mode: Here, the model provides quick, near-instant responses, suitable for simpler questions where speed is more important than depth.</li></ol><p>This flexibility allows users to control how much “thinking” the model performs based on the task at hand. For example, harder problems can be tackled with extended reasoning, while easier ones can be answered directly without delay. Crucially, the integration of these two modes greatly enhances the model’s ability to implement stable and efficient thinking budget control. As demonstrated above, Qwen3 exhibits scalable and smooth performance improvements that are directly correlated with the computational reasoning budget allocated. This design enables users to configure task-specific budgets with greater ease, achieving a more optimal balance between cost efficiency and inference quality.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen3/thinking_budget.png" width="100%"></figure><ul><li><strong>Multilingual Support</strong></li></ul><p>Qwen3 models are supporting <strong>119 languages and dialects</strong>. This extensive multilingual capability opens up new possibilities for international applications, enabling users worldwide to benefit from the power of these models.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Language Family</th><th>Languages &amp; Dialects</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Indo-European</td><td>English, French, Portuguese, German, Romanian, Swedish, Danish, Bulgarian, Russian, Czech, Greek, Ukrainian, Spanish, Dutch, Slovak, Croatian, Polish, Lithuanian, Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk, Persian, Slovenian, Gujarati, Latvian, Italian, Occitan, Nepali, Marathi, Belarusian, Serbian, Luxembourgish, Venetian, Assamese, Welsh, Silesian, Asturian, Chhattisgarhi, Awadhi, Maithili, Bhojpuri, Sindhi, Irish, Faroese, Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, Oriya, Tajik, Eastern Yiddish, Lombard, Ligurian, Sicilian, Friulian, Sardinian, Galician, Catalan, Icelandic, Tosk Albanian, Limburgish, Dari, Afrikaans, Macedonian, Sinhala, Urdu, Magahi, Bosnian, Armenian</td></tr><tr><td>Sino-Tibetan</td><td>Chinese (Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Cantonese), Burmese</td></tr><tr><td>Afro-Asiatic</td><td>Arabic (Standard, Najdi, Levantine, Egyptian, Moroccan, Mesopotamian, Ta’izzi-Adeni, Tunisian), Hebrew, Maltese</td></tr><tr><td>Austronesian</td><td>Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, Cebuano, Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau, Balinese, Banjar, Pangasinan, Iloko, Waray (Philippines)</td></tr><tr><td>Dravidian</td><td>Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam</td></tr><tr><td>Turkic</td><td>Turkish, North Azerbaijani, Northern Uzbek, Kazakh, Bashkir, Tatar</td></tr><tr><td>Tai-Kadai</td><td>Thai, Lao</td></tr><tr><td>Uralic</td><td>Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian</td></tr><tr><td>Austroasiatic</td><td>Vietnamese, Khmer</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Japanese, Korean, Georgian, Basque, Haitian, Papiamento, Kabuverdianu, Tok Pisin, Swahili</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><strong>Improved Agentic Capabilities</strong></li></ul><p>We have optimized the Qwen3 models for coding and agentic capabilities, and also we have strengthened the support of MCP as well. Below we provide examples to show how Qwen3 thinks and interacts with the environment.</p><h2 id="pre-training">Pre-training</h2><p>In terms of pretraining, the dataset for Qwen3 has been significantly expanded compared to Qwen2.5. While Qwen2.5 was pre-trained on 18 trillion tokens, Qwen3 uses nearly twice that amount, with approximately 36 trillion tokens covering 119 languages and dialects. To build this large dataset, we collected data not only from the web but also from PDF-like documents. We used Qwen2.5-VL to extract text from these documents and Qwen2.5 to improve the quality of the extracted content. To increase the amount of math and code data, we used Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Coder to generate synthetic data. This includes textbooks, question-answer pairs, and code snippets.</p><p>The pre-training process consists of three stages. In the first stage (S1), the model was pretrained on over 30 trillion tokens with a context length of 4K tokens. This stage provided the model with basic language skills and general knowledge. In the second stage (S2), we improved the dataset by increasing the proportion of knowledge-intensive data, such as STEM, coding, and reasoning tasks. The model was then pretrained on an additional 5 trillion tokens. In the final stage, we used high-quality long-context data to extend the context length to 32K tokens. This ensures the model can handle longer inputs effectively.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/qwen3-base.jpg" width="100%"></figure><p>Due to advancements in model architecture, increase in training data, and more effective training methods, the overall performance of Qwen3 dense base models matches that of Qwen2.5 base models with more parameters. For instance, Qwen3-1.7B/4B/8B/14B/32B-Base performs as well as Qwen2.5-3B/7B/14B/32B/72B-Base, respectively. Notably, in areas like STEM, coding, and reasoning, Qwen3 dense base models even outperform larger Qwen2.5 models. For Qwen3-MoE base models, they achieve similar performance to Qwen2.5 dense base models while using only 10% of the active parameters. This results in significant savings in both training and inference costs.</p><h2 id="post-training">Post-training</h2><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen3/post-training.png" width="100%"></figure><p>To develop the hybrid model capable of both step-by-step reasoning and rapid responses, we implemented a four-stage training pipeline. This pipeline includes: (1) long chain-of-thought (CoT) cold start, (2) reasoning-based reinforcement learning (RL), (3) thinking mode fusion, and (4) general RL.</p><p>In the first stage, we fine-tuned the models using diverse long CoT data, covering various tasks and domains such as mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and STEM problems. This process aimed to equip the model with fundamental reasoning abilities. The second stage focused on scaling up computational resources for RL, utilizing rule-based rewards to enhance the model’s exploration and exploitation capabilities.</p><p>In the third stage, we integrated non-thinking capabilities into the thinking model by fine-tuning it on a combination of long CoT data and commonly used instruction-tuning data. This data was generated by the enhanced thinking model from the second stage, ensuring a seamless blend of reasoning and quick response capabilities. Finally, in the fourth stage, we applied RL across more than 20 general-domain tasks to further strengthen the model’s general capabilities and correct undesired behaviors. These tasks included instruction following, format following, and agent capabilities, etc.</p><h2 id="develop-with-qwen3">Develop with Qwen3</h2><p>Below is a simple guide for you to use Qwen3 on different frameworks.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started building <strong>Architect of Ruin </strong>in December 2023 I chose to build it in the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" target="_blank">Bevy</a>&nbsp;game engine. My choice was motivated by a personal interest in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>&nbsp;-- a language I derive a lot of joy in using. This was furthered by <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/ecs/" target="_blank">Bevy's ECS</a> model which I also find fun to work with and the openness of Bevy's community which I have a genuine appreciation for.</p><center><iframe width="500" height="282" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vCEbQXeGc3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Bevy Rap by Tantan"></iframe></center><p>So, it came as a surprise that in&nbsp;January of 2025 we transitioned the game away from Rust and Bevy. I spent about six weeks rewriting the game entirely in C# and we have been using Unity for the past three months.</p><p>Switching engines is a classic project killer. Productivity can nosedive, regressions inevitably emerge, and every step forward seems to lead to three steps back. Not to mention that domain expertise built up in one language and engine doesn't cleanly transfer to a new language and engine.</p><p>But I bit the bullet and I want to explain why.</p><h3>The Bevy Journey</h3><p>A lot of good work was accomplished in Bevy. The tilemap, most of my approach to composing the scene, and a large amount of character and gameplay logic were implemented in Bevy. I learned about the guts of Spine and skeletal animation by tearing apart Rust <a href="https://github.com/jabuwu/rusty_spine" target="_blank">transpiles</a>&nbsp;of the spine runtime. I learned a lot about custom render pipelines by implementing my own rendering features in Bevy's render world. Bevy's pure ECS was a joy to work with and Rust's compile-time checks meant I could refactor large swathes of code quickly and with confidence.</p><p>The Bevy community was also an active source of inspiration - not just ideas about how to use the engine, but a positive community of builders and contributors. This community is very good at being excited about game development and being energetic about debate.</p><p>I had the opportunity to contribute features and fixes to a number of community crates, although most of those contributions were small and were focused on work that moved my own goals forward.</p><p>Despite these positive experiences and the progress made, practical challenges emerged as development continued.</p><h3>Emergent Problems</h3><p>I want to begin by stating that I anticipated many of these challenges before they manifested. I knew that using a game engine early in its development lifecycle would pose unique risks and costs. I considered those costs to be likely worthwhile and surmountable. My love of Rust and Bevy meant that I would be willing to bear some pain that other game developers might choose to avoid. I didn't walk blindly into these specific problems, but they bit harder than I was expecting.</p><p><strong>Collaboration </strong>- I started this project with my brother. While he's sharp and eager, he's new to coding. Onboarding him directly into game dev while simultaneously navigating Rust's unique aspects proved challenging. We found ourselves with a steeper learning curve that slowed his ability to contribute effectively to gameplay logic.</p><center></center><p><strong>Abstraction</strong> - While my initial motivation was the enjoyment of Rust, the project's bottleneck increasingly became the rapid iteration of higher-level gameplay mechanics. As the codebase grew, we found that translating gameplay ideas into code was less direct than we hoped. Rust's (powerful) low-level focus didn't always lend itself to a flexible high-level scripting style needed for rapid prototyping within our specific gameplay architecture. I found that my motivation to build and ship fun gameplay was stronger than my desire to build with Rust.</p><p>I had anticipated that this was going to be a thing, but I wasn't calibrated to the degree it would start to annoy me and slow the project down.</p><p><img src="https://manakeep.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/users/647f40267263835eb33ad65d/2025-04-25/bevyskeleverbose.png" alt="Rust can be verbose."></p><center><em>(A relatively simple gameplay function signature.)</em></center><center><em></em></center><center><em></em></center><p><strong>Migration&nbsp;</strong>- Bevy is young and changes quickly. Each update brought with it incredible features, but also a substantial amount of API thrash. As the project grew in size, the burden of update migration also grew. Minor regressions were common in core Bevy systems (such as sprite rendering), and these led to moments of significant friction and unexpected debugging effort.</p><p>This came to a head on one specific day where I was frustrated with a sprite rendering issue that had emerged in a new release. Blake had run into the same problem at the same time and our shared frustration boiled over into a kind of table flip moment. He turned to me and said something along the lines of "this shouldn't happen, this kind of thing should just be solved" and that triggered the conversation that led to a re-evaluation.</p><p>The point isn't that specific sprite problem, but that because all systems in Bevy are open to tinkering and improvement, all systems were potentially subject to regressions.</p><p><strong>Learning </strong>- Over the past year my workflow has changed immensely, and I regularly use AI to learn new technologies, discuss methods and techniques, review code, etc. The maturity and vast amount of stable historical data for C# and the Unity API mean that tools like Gemini consistently provide highly relevant guidance. While Bevy and Rust evolve rapidly - which is exciting and motivating - the pace means AI knowledge lags behind, reducing the efficiency gains I have come to expect from AI assisted development. This could change with the introduction of more modern tool-enabled models, but I found it to be a distraction and an unexpected additional cost.</p><p><strong>Modding </strong>- Modding means a lot to me. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306093336/http://orangesmoothie.org/" target="_blank">I got my start in the industry as a modder</a>&nbsp;and I want my game to be highly moddable. Over time, as I learned more about how to realize this goal, I came to understand many inherent limitations in Rust and Bevy that would make the task more difficult. Lack of a clear solution to scripting and an unstable ABI (application binary interface) raised concerns. I am not an expert in this area, perhaps these are all easily surmounted. I can only say that I did not find a path (after much searching) that I felt confident trusting.</p><p>These factors combined - the desire for a smoother workflow across experience levels, the need for a high-level abstraction for gameplay, optimizing productivity, and modding - pointed towards a re-evaluation of the project's next phase.</p><h3>The Switch</h3><p>To be honest, I completely disregarded Unity when I started the project.</p><p>Some of this stemmed from unforced errors on the part of Unity. They had just gone through a crisis of pricing that culminated in the resignation of their CEO and they seemed out of touch with indie developers.&nbsp;I also made several assumptions. I felt sick of coding in the outdated form of C++ that pervades older game engines and assumed I'd feel similarly about C#. I figured that since Unreal doesn't offer much for 2D render pipelines that Unity wouldn't either. This led me to fail to give serious thought to using Unity in 2023.</p><p>In the first week of January of 2025, Blake and I decided to do a cost-benefit analysis. We wrote down all the options: Unreal, Unity, Godot, continuing in Bevy, or rolling our own. We wrote extensive pros and cons, emphasizing how each option fared by the criteria above: Collaboration, Abstraction, Migration, Learning, and Modding.</p><p>Having some experience with the other options, I decided I needed to understand Unity better. An afternoon's research led me to conclude that it seemed to score high on the pros over the cons.</p><p>We had a team meeting where I laid out the trade-offs. Ulrick pointed out that a bunch of unknowns, like particles, would just be solved in a packaged engine. Blake pointed out that if things went well, and a new engine meant faster gameplay development, we could end up ahead of schedule.</p><h3>10% for 90%</h3><p>The team decided to invest in an experiment. I would pick three core features and see how difficult they would be to implement in Unity. We would spend no more than 3 weeks on the task.  We would invest 10% of effort to see if we should invest the other 90% in a full port.</p><p><strong>Tilemap</strong> - I figured this one would be straightforward, since the basic logic is simple. It would require implementing custom shaders. We wouldn't be using the built in Unity Tilemap because our needs were specific and well-known to us. This was foundational to the game scene and I had a good mental model for how long it took me to write the first time in Rust.</p><p><strong>Characters </strong>- Our characters use Spine and have unique customization requirements and features. This gave me a lot of trouble in Rust, so I figured it would be a good point of comparison in C#.</p><p><strong>UI</strong> - I wanted UI to be easy to build, fast to iterate, and moddable. This was an area where we learned a lot in Rust and again had a good mental model for comparison. Some research led me to conclude that <a href="https://www.noesisengine.com/" target="_blank">Noesis</a>&nbsp;would be a good fit because of its emphasis on data-driven XAML and the fact that the WPF model is very well documented. Even if I didn't know WPF, I knew I could learn it quickly with AI assistance.</p><p>The first two tasks: Tilemap and Characters, were chosen because they were fundamental, but also because let me check my time-expectations against reality on an easy task and a hard task. This would allow me to project the workload of future tasks and the port more broadly. The UI task was chosen because our game is UI heavy and any significant speed improvement in iterating on UI would have compounding returns on future development.</p><p>We finished all three tasks in 3 days!</p><p>Commit 1 was on Jan 8th and the Tilemap was done the same day.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://manakeep.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/users/647f40267263835eb33ad65d/2025-04-25/tasklog1.png" alt=""></p><p>While I implemented the tilemap, Blake wrote the camera system. This demonstrated a significant boost in his ability to contribute when the technical framework was more scrutable. It was also a huge boost to his confidence and contributed to a new feeling of momentum. I should point out that Blake had never written C# before.</p><p>I implemented the Tilemap shader in Unity Shader Graph, thinking this would be easier for Ulrick to play with. This wasn't the last Shader Graph I wrote, but ultimately, I decided that visual shader creation and iteration was too slow, and refactoring was much slower as well. I now write all shaders in HLSL.</p><p><img src="https://manakeep.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/users/647f40267263835eb33ad65d/2025-04-25/tilemapshader.png" alt=""></p><p>On Jan 10th we had figured out the basics of building UI in Noesis. Blake wrote a few simple UI widgets and then built the main menu and I built the first part of the game HUD, the toolbar.</p><p>The work went far more smoothly than I expected, and nothing was left on the cutting room floor. The tilemap took a day, a basic panel in Noesis was an afternoon including hooking up the plugin. The rest of the time was on wiring up characters. To be clear, I didn't port the entire UI in an afternoon or implement our equipment system. What we did have were customizable character bodies, a fully ported tilemap, some basic menus and enough knowledge to make projections on how long the rest of the port would take.</p><p><img src="https://manakeep.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/users/647f40267263835eb33ad65d/2025-04-25/initialport.png" alt="Very representative of the end of that first week."></p><p><em>This image is very representative of where we were at the end of the first week of porting, although this one is actually from a few days later after items had gone in.</em></p><p>At the end of the week, we convened to discuss what we had learned and made the decision to move ahead with the full port.</p><p>The following six weeks were dedicated to rewriting the remaining systems and content from the Bevy version into Unity/C#. The overall process largely validated the findings from our three-day test. Gameplay systems with the same number of features could be implemented with less verbosity.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://manakeep.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/users/647f40267263835eb33ad65d/2025-04-25/longerconvo.png"></p><center><em>This conversation dates March 4, 2025.</em></center><p>Code size shrank substantially, massively improving maintainability. As far as I can tell, most of this savings was just in the elimination of ECS boilerplate.</p><p>Everything felt tighter and more straightforward. Update migration anxiety was gone and while it was replaced with "we gotta get this done" anxiety, that dissipated quickly as progress was constant.</p><h3>Life Since the Switch</h3><p>We've now been developing <strong>Architect of Ruin</strong> exclusively in Unity for the past three months. The shift has measurably improved our day-to-day development. Iteration feels faster, allowing ideas to flow into the game more easily. We've also been able to leverage ecosystem tools like the <a href="https://arongranberg.com/astar/" target="_blank">AStar Pathfinding Project</a>.</p><p>One area that isn't solved and which will likely cost us some pain is localization. In Rust, the <a href="https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent" target="_blank">Fluent</a>&nbsp;project is excellent and exactly what we needed -- I haven't yet found a comparable solution in Unity.</p><p>I plan to discuss specific elements of the game's implementation in Unity and the porting process in future posts. The goal of today's post was only to explain the reasoning that led us to our current position.</p><p>A few conclusions stand out.</p><p><strong>I failed to fairly evaluate my options at the start of the project. </strong>Rust is great and I love it, but I didn't give alternatives a fair shake. In particular, I didn't spend time examining the differences between Unreal and Unity more closely.</p><p><strong>Sometimes you have to burn time to earn time. </strong>I think we are way ahead of where we would have been had we stuck with Bevy. Our agility in implementing rendering features while also pushing gameplay forward is much higher.</p><p>Rust remains a language I deeply enjoy, and Bevy is an exciting engine with a fantastic community -- I have immense respect for both and may well use them again for different projects. For <strong>Architect of Ruin</strong>, however, the needs for accessible collaboration, rapid gameplay iteration, and leveraging a stable ecosystem pointed towards an alternative.</p><p>It was a difficult decision, one that felt counter to my instincts, but ultimately it put us in a much stronger position to realize our vision for the game.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there is one subject liberals and conservatives can agree on, it might be their shared hatred for California High-Speed Rail. Today, the project is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-high-speed-rail-trump-investigation-5b4d6494a8cdd9a3fe3b8949bb5b1bba">under investigation</a> by the Trump administration and is facing a possible withdrawal of federal funds. Even California Democrats seem disinclined to put up a fight. In Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s <em>Abundance</em>, it is the example par excellence of blue states’ failure to build, a casualty (if it ever lived) of environmental proceduralism, prohibitive regulatory processes, a bloated bureaucracy, and general infrastructural incompetence. &nbsp;</p><p>All of these challenges are real. What critics miss is that many of them have already been overcome. What they ignore is the reason they exist in the first place. The story of CAHSR is not about a state trying and failing to overcome its own bureaucracy and broken political process. It’s about a state that barely tried.</p><p>In 2008, when the state originally put Prop 1A to voters to build a high-speed rail between Los Angeles and San Francisco, the expectation was that the $9.95 billion in state bonds voters approved would be matched or exceeded by federal funding (as is normally the case for highway projects), and perhaps further complemented by private funding (as with the Brightline West project between Las Vegas and Los Angeles). It passed with 52.6% of the vote.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took four years to even begin work, but not solely because of permitting — release of the funds was delayed until 2012. And they were held up further by a series of court cases that prevented the state from selling the bonds allocated by 1A until it identified the source of the rest of the project’s funding. During this time, the project received around $3 billion in federal funds from the Obama-era American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which came with requirements to match federal funds and to begin work in disadvantaged areas of the Central Valley.</p><p>The result was that work on the Central Valley segment’s initial 120 miles was delayed for several years. The first major construction contract, Construction Package 1, was <a href="https://www.railwaygazette.com/high-speed/california-high-speed-rail-authority-invites-interest-in-second-construction-package/38771.article">issued in June 2013</a>. In the meantime, then-Governor Jerry Brown and the legislature worked to grant CAHSR what would be its sole ongoing funding source. In June 2014, the project was awarded a 15% allocation of the revenue from sales in California's cap-and-trade carbon auctions, which in recent years have raised between $3 and $4.7 billion a year. In 2017, this allocation was extended until 2030. With this funding secure, contracts were finally issued for Construction Package 2-3 in 2015 and Construction Package 4 in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>But the delays in issuing these contracts started a vicious cycle. At multiple points in the rail’s history, approvals and construction plans already started for utility reconstructions, interactions with and crossings of existing freight lines, grade separations, and so on were left incomplete. This led to pauses in work and further delays so that plans could catch up to the ground already broken. The lack of continuity between planning and construction — changes in contractors, personnel, and others with expertise — made necessary change orders that only drove the cost up higher.&nbsp;</p><p>Through Trump’s first term, the initial portion of bond funding, combined with funding from the cap-and-trade fund allocation, was enough to keep <em>some</em> progress moving forward in the Central Valley under rail authority CEO Brian Kelly. Concrete viaducts and grade separations began to rise as visible signs of the work in progress. However, there were strict limits on what could be accomplished because of the piecemeal disbursement of cash. The sum of these funds, the only source of persistent cash flow, was generally about a billion dollars a year. They also varied each year due to the fluctuation in the cap-and-trade auction system. As a result, yearly funds couldn’t be reliably planned against, nor could they be borrowed against. Thus, even when work was finally underway, progress was slower than hoped, as change orders resulting from delayed property acquisition and permitting interactions with freight railroads and local municipalities increased costs and complexity.&nbsp;</p><p>To put this into perspective: Brightline West, the high-speed rail project between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, is hoping to spend the $12 billion they have raised in just over four years. It has taken many times as long for California High-Speed Rail to have their first $12 billion <em>in hand</em>. &nbsp;</p><p>Gavin Newsom’s election as governor in 2018 introduced further problems for the project that continue to plague it today. “There simply isn’t a path to get from Sacramento to San Diego, let alone from San Francisco to LA,” he claimed. “I wish there were.” Instead, he directed the project to focus on the 172-mile stretch between Merced and Bakersfield, through which an eventual route from San Francisco to Los Angeles might run. Crucially, Newsom also cut funding that should have gone to the geological surveys needed for designing the tunnels required to punch through the Diablo range south of San Francisco and San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles — thereby fulfilling his own prophecy.</p><p>Initially, Newsom also didn’t put political capital to work to push for more funding for the project. Indeed, for the first few years of his tenure, $4.1 billion in Prop 1A bond funds remained unallocated by the state legislature and thus unavailable for the project to use. It wasn’t until 2021, as debates about Biden-era federal infrastructure funding began, that Newsom finally began to pressure the legislature to release these funds to the project in hopes of attracting new federal matching funds. The legislature released the remaining bond funds in 2022, and that renewed state investment may indeed have played a role in the <a href="https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-announces-landmark-3-billion-federal-investment-california-high-speed">award of $3.07 billion in federal infrastructure funds in the fall of 2023</a>.</p><p>With all this in mind, we can start to look at common criticisms of California High-Speed Rail in a different light. These critiques — maybe you’ve seen them on Twitter — generally glibly identify solutions or alternatives that are insufficient to address the rail’s real issues, and focus attention on the wrong problems.</p><p>&nbsp;One regular snipe is that it’s “easier to build rail in Morocco than in California.” This critique stems from the fact that the French national railroad company, SNCF, which participated early in the planning process before 1A passed, also helped design the Moroccan Al Boraq high-speed rail service. Such critics often note that the Al Boraq service is operational today and claim that the relative failure of the California High-Speed Rail “boondoggle” represents the political dysfunction of either California, the United States, or the West as a whole. This appears to be based entirely on one quote in the <em>New York Times</em>,<em> </em>from an SNCF project manager, that the company left for Morocco, “which was less politically dysfunctional.” In fact, SNCF has employees in 120 countries and has projects in Israel, Taiwan, and South Korea, among others.</p><p>This criticism also misunderstands one of the main challenges that CAHSR has faced. Al Boraq had full funding lined up before the project began. CAHSR did not. This led to delays that reduced support and encouraged critics, which starved it of funding commitments and thus led to further delays. California undermined CAHSR from the start.&nbsp;</p><p>Another common criticism, as laid out in <a href="https://benjaminschneider.substack.com/p/california-high-speed-rails-original">an article by Benjamin Schneider</a>, is that California High-Speed Rail is built in the wrong place, to the wrong standards, and with the wrong goals — and that’s why it failed. The argument goes like this: The currently planned alignment through the Central Valley makes building unnecessarily complicated. Because it goes through major population centers — Bakersfield, Merced, Fresno — it introduces the necessity of grade separations (bridges or tunnels built so that trains and vehicles pass over or under each other) and requires complex property acquisitions. The right place to build the rail alignment is a direct route between Los Angeles and San Francisco paralleling Interstate 5.&nbsp;</p><p>This was, in fact, the route proposed by SNCF prior to Prop 1A’s passing. The I-5 alignment would save mileage, reduce grade separations and utility relocations, and use property already under the control of the state’s department of transportation. These cities could then perhaps be connected with branch lines to the high-speed rail trunk, establishing a line through the Central Valley with a faster build out and lower cost compared with the more expensive “political” route directly through Central Valley cities and towns.</p><p>&nbsp;Although it has intuitive appeal, this proposal suffers from major issues. First, the I-5 route avoids every major population center in the Central Valley, bypassing more than a million people who would be unserved. The only way to connect them to the line would be through stub-end branch lines. Building these lines would add the same kinds of costs as the as-built line directly through the Central Valley cities while offering them worse service. Second, it’s quite possible the I-5 alignment would never have been popular enough to pass as a ballot proposition. The Central Valley population areas only narrowly voted in favor of 1A. Had the original proposal outlined in the ballot initiative offered a different route from which Central Valley residents would not benefit, it’s possible it would not have passed at all.<sup>

</sup>
&nbsp;</p><p>Third, much has been made of the fact that construction has begun on the middle section of the alignment rather than in Los Angeles or San Francisco. This is, in fact, standard practice in building high-speed rail around the world. The route alignment as selected means that even if the Central Valley portion of the rail is all that operates within the next decade, it will still see service, as it will replace the existing Amtrak line that already carries a million riders a year between the Central Valley population centers. Only if the Central Valley alignment had been selected would CAHSR actually the “train to nowhere” that critics deride it as.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Perhaps most importantly, critics appear to forget that the Central Valley alignment, political or not, overambitious or not, <em>is nearly built</em>. The property is acquired and cleared, embankments are under construction, and many viaducts and bridges have been completed. Abandoning it in the current state and switching to I-5 would almost certainly cost more than finishing the current alignment.</p><p>And this alignment isn’t the real problem, anyway. The true cost driver for CAHSR isn’t the difference between I-5 and the Central Valley, but access <em>into</em> Los Angeles and San Francisco. There, the challenge is not permits or politics but geology. While rail services like Metrolink’s Antelope Valley commuter line in Los Angeles and the Altamont Corridor Express in San Francisco do already cross the mountains, these are slow trains — necessarily so, because of the tortuous route demanded by the terrain. According to the 2024 California High-Speed Rail business plan, the total cost of the three major required tunnels is expected to make up approximately half of the total project cost. The Central Valley’s 172 miles under construction and advanced planning are estimated to cost up to $33 billion. The total to get from the Central Valley into the Los Angeles region is expected to be $34 billion, while at the north end of the Central Valley, the link from the Central Valley to the San Francisco Bay region is expected to cost $20 billion, including the tunnel and improvements along existing rail corridors from San Jose to Gilroy. These costs can’t be blamed on Californian political dysfunction: These are tunnels on the scale of the Gotthard Base Tunnel through the Alps in Switzerland, which had a similar cost-per-mile.&nbsp;</p><p>A second line of criticism comes from the abundance movement. <a href="https://archive.ph/pYBxj">Critics like Ezra Klein emphasize</a> the problems created by environmental permitting and cooperating with utilities, and other existing interests like the freight railroads and (mostly Republican) landowners. All of these are real problems, and each has been a factor in delaying CAHSR. Environmental review has taken over a decade. Breaking ground sometimes uncovered new lawsuits. The entire project has been negotiated and renegotiated, inflating prices at each step. But every single one of these problems is also faced by other infrastructure projects — new bridges and highways in particular — that manage to proceed in spite of regulatory difficulties. &nbsp;</p><p>One major reason that highway infrastructure succeeds where CAHSR has failed is that such projects are routine. Highways have assured funding from federal and state sources. They also have significant political support from state and federal officials. More to the point, there is an industry of professionals experienced in both building roads and navigating the red tape necessary to make doing so possible. The equivalent network for American high-speed rail does exist — yet.&nbsp; This is part of the reason that high-speed rail costs many times as much in the United States as it does in European countries. Unless we actually commit to building <em>and finishing</em> high-speed rail, that network will never form.</p><p>Many commentators have suggested the project cut its losses and bow out. But one piece missing from the discourse is an accurate understanding of what the project has cost to date and what it needs to be completed. This problem dates to the earliest days of the project. If the CAHSR has an original sin, it is that the bond issue that went before voters didn’t ask for enough money. Early business plans in 2008 expected a total budget of $33 billion to be sufficient, approximately $50 billion today with inflation. Because the expectation was that federal government or private investment would bear much of this cost, the bond issue requested less than a third of the amount needed even in these early estimates.<sup>

</sup>
&nbsp;</p><p>It was only in 2011, once the project was able to finalize more of the route plan in detail, that the projected price rose to $65 billion. Inflation adjusted, that is $94 billion today — close to the base-cost estimate of $106 billion from the 2024 business plan that so many have critiqued. As many critics have rightfully and fairly noted, this is a higher cost-per-mile of track than in many countries that routinely build high-speed rail. But America, of course, does not routinely build high-speed rail, and the project remains only slightly more expensive than it was forecasted to be 13 years ago. Most important, to date, CAHSR has spent only about $15 billion, which has limited the ability to proceed with extensive planning beyond the Central Valley. It has also stopped the award of any new heavy construction contracts since the initial 119 miles of Construction Packages 1 through 4. Work has begun on the next 50 miles of civil construction to bring tracks to Merced, where they will connect with ACE and San Joaquins train services to San Francisco and Sacramento, and to Bakersfield, where connections are available via Amtrak Thruway bus service into Los Angeles. Contracts are also intended to be issued this year for the tracks, overhead electrical system, and trains to run the initial segments.&nbsp;</p><p>This money has also paid for contributions to the electrification of Caltrain in San Francisco, grade separations removing freight crossings from streets in Los Angeles, and the complete environmental clearance and basic geotechnical design of the entire route from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Completing the Central Valley segment will cost between $4 and $7 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>The additional funding required to reach San Francisco and Los Angeles to complete the core route will be approximately $80 billion. This is a lot of money, but as inflation-adjusted estimates show, it is not due purely to incompetence and cost overruns. More to the point, California can afford projects on a similar scale. The recent BART extension to San Jose is expected to cost $12.75 billion, and Caltrans receives a budget of $15 billion a year. California has had substantial budget surpluses in the past decade. In 2022 alone, the surplus totaled nearly $100 billion (although the budget is now roughly balanced). As a matter of practical economics, the project could be paid for. The question now is if the political will is there to fund it either in whole or in some revised form.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite more than a decade of predictions of its failure, the project has persevered — even if its completion is in limbo. The initial operating segment between Merced and Bakersfield is projected to begin operating in 2030. Progress is invisible to those in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and it can’t be seen just driving along I-5. But everything from satellite imagery to drone footage to a drive along State Route 43 reveals the progress being made along the 119 miles of construction underway in the Central Valley. The 22 miles making up Construction Package 4 are effectively complete, from the massive Wasco Viaduct, where the high-speed rail rises to cross over Burlington Northern and Santa Fe freight railroad tracks, to the numerous smaller-grade separation structures rising from the valley floor.</p><p>A ceremony was held in January 2025 to mark the beginning of work on the “construction railhead,” where 10 miles of freight rail yard will be built to support track laying and the erection of overhead wires in coming years. This will also include some of the first permanent high-speed tracks to be laid on the alignment. Of the 81 structures planned between Construction Packages 1-3, all but seven are underway. Seventeen structures are planned to be completed in 2025, including rail viaducts over low-lying swamps and rivers, and underpasses and overpasses that will remove grade crossings with urban streets in Fresno.&nbsp;</p><p>While no final track has yet been laid, this constitutes the vast majority of the work to prepare the route. For comparison, were this project a highway, at this stage it would need only paving and striping. If funding holds from the state, contracts for track laying and the purchase of the first train sets should go out this year. Work is also proceeding on the remainder of the route: Design work and property acquisition are underway for the next 50 miles of right-of-way extending to Merced and Bakersfield, this time phased to allow utility relocations and other local interference to be cleared ahead of construction on the main structures. All of the environmental permits are complete for extending the tunnels through Pacheco Pass to Gilroy and up to San Francisco and from Bakersfield south to Palmdale and Los Angeles. The only thing holding back construction is money.</p><p>Watching the progress has converted some former skeptics. Kings County Supervisor Doug Verboon was once a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits seeking to stop the project in its tracks. As of this year, he’s expressed support for finishing the sections of the project already underway. In an article in the <em>Hanford Sentinel </em>from December 2024, he expressed that, as chair of the San Joaquin Valley Rail Commission, he now wants to see the structures completed to make use of the investment.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who can see every day the tangible progress of the project, opposition has evolved into something quite different: doubt about whether the funding can be provided to finish the job. The dream of a complete line from San Francisco to Los Angeles remains as popular as it did when 1A first passed with 52% of the vote in 2008. <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/majority-of-californians-still-support-high-speed-rail-project-polling-shows/">An Emerson College poll commissioned by KTLA in February</a> found that 54% of Californians still support the project. When Trump’s secretary of transportation, Sean Duffy, came to Los Angeles to announce the administration was investigating the project, he was met by a large crowd of protestors chanting “build the rail” loud enough to drown him out on press microphones.</p><p>The next four years of the second Trump administration will prove a crucial test of support from the state government. Even before Trump threatened to cut off the awarded federal funding, the Office of the Inspector General raised the possibility that the project could be between $3 and $6.5 billion short of completing the 172 miles from Merced to Bakersfield, depending on the variation in state cap-and-trade auction revenue. The project has sufficient California funds only to last through the Trump administration, complete and electrify the existing 120 miles, purchase train sets, and begin construction of the Merced and Bakersfield extensions — but not fully complete them. &nbsp;</p><p>This is not an easy project. But exaggerating the difficulties of completing it can blind us to both the possibilities and the reasons the project was — and remains — popular. A high-speed rail connection in San Jose would place the Central Valley a mere 30-45 minutes away, opening up options for new housing and commercial opportunities. Effectively, it would make something like the “California Forever” plan possible in a different region of the state, complete with high-speed rail connections directly to Silicon Valley. Long term, connecting Los Angeles to San Francisco by high-speed rail would be time competitive with flying and several times faster than driving.&nbsp;</p><p>If California politicians match action to desires, it is within California’s capability to fund the project itself. Governor Newsom and the California legislature have hinted at such a possibility. Rather than buying into the narratives of predetermined failure pushed by the project’s longtime opposition, Californian citizens and politicians should push for the project’s continuation — and for as much support as the state can give.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

This is where I got my first taste of gaslighting from a </span><em>client relationship manager</em><span> whose job is to keep suckers on the hook.</span><em> </em></p><blockquote><p><em>“We agreed to the previous list of fixations only and never agreed anywhere as the part of the agreement.

The cofounders didn’t have access to the code repo, so I had to spend more time battling the relationship manager for access.</p><p>And eventually, I got it.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Far, far below the deepest delving of FAANG and big consultancies, the world is gnawed by nameless devs. Even Bill Gates knows them not. They are older than he. Now I have walked there, but I will bring no report to darken the light of day.”</em></p><p><em>—Gandalf, a famous staff engineer</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>I saw only one way to bring Fixr to market. </p><p><span>We would need a </span><em>full rewrite</em><span>. </span></p><p>Despite being £20,000 in the hole across 4 apps, the management team didn’t take  much convincing to let go of a sunk costs.

They were sold.</p><p>In order to justify the extra time investment, I was provisionally brought on as cofounder and CTO. But we had a marketplace to build, and two platforms to serve. We needed an “Android guy”. I knew just the person: Gus. </p><p>Like me, he was keen on the idea, and in the market for a new side project. At a pre-lockdown party, I sold the dream: this product lives or dies via the traction we get in the next couple of months.</p><blockquote><p><em>Dragging my good friend into the blender is a regret, but we kept each other sane through the subsequent 9 months.</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>Despite being late to the party, the team valued our potential contributions at 10% apiece—the level required to get into Y Combinator. </p><p>To make things official, and certify our equity stakes, Kim drew up contracts, which were quite obviously rehashed drafts of the contracts they gave the original ill-fated dev agency, plus a very spicy clause pertaining to equity shares.</p><blockquote><p><em>The Management Team may terminate this agreement and reduce or fully remove the equity held by the Developer where the Development Services are not sufficiently met. This clause is to be carried out at the discretion of the Management Team.</em></p></blockquote><p>I was about to sign, when Gus cleverly consulted his dad who, in a brilliant blaze of prescience, suggested we run a mile and block our teammates’ phone numbers. Gus and I knew better, and simply pushed the team to change the wording to “gross negligence”.</p><p>We were officially cofounders. </p><p>It was go-time.</p><p>The prevailing months flew by in a COVID-tinged haze. While everyone else was baking bread and remunerating nursing staff via saucepans, Gus and I spent every free minute turning Fixr into a serious product.</p><p>Our weekly Zoom calls had a regular push-and-pull. Gus and I presented the latest flows. Kim and Jimmy praised our progress, while pushing to expand the scope. We had to add more features to win the market as a one-stop-shop.</p><p>Engineering busywork complete, we turned to our operators.</p><ul><li><p>Kim shared her latest dream for our upcoming “viral marketing campaign” that would land thousands of sign-ups on launch day.</p></li><li><p>Mike spitballed when we might start to acquire mechanics.

We had nothing on either side of our car repair marketplace for anything more than a tech demo.</p><p>Faced with the cold, harsh reality of zero users, zero revenue, and zero funding, Gus and I had a moment of clarity. We asked ourselves one question. </p><blockquote><p><em>WTF had our cofounders been doing this whole time?</em></p></blockquote><p>It’s probably time to tell you that Jimmy and Mike despised each other. Jimmy didn’t respect Mike’s intelligence or commitment. Mike didn’t like Jimmy on a personal level. One of Kim’s primary roles in the business was as mediator between the two.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Gus and myself, our tidy 10% equity packages were mostly carved out of the hog carcass of Mike’s original third share. Jimmy, as chief visionary and de-facto CEO, had a capricious habit of unilaterally reallocating equity based on how much value he thought you brought to the table.</p><p>I was never in the room when these conversations happened, but Gus and I were immune to this chicanery—we’d negotiated our contractual protections up to “gross negligence”—a fairly high legal bar.</p><blockquote><p><em>Gus’ dad is looking preeety smart right now.</em></p></blockquote><p>The incompetence of the original dev agencies concealed a far deeper issue. The apps Gus and I hacked together? Not pretty. Worked brilliantly. </p><p>We were no longer sitting on a product problem, and the abject failure of the startup to achieve anything meaningful in 3 years no longer had anything to hide behind.</p><p>I spent summer hustling to bail out the sinking ship:</p><ul><li><p>I sat with Mike to reach out to mechanics and bootstrap our supply-side, trying to start at the town level.</p></li><li><p>I helped Kim to set up social media ads to bolster the demand-side, running campaigns in target towns to nurture local liquidity. </p></li><li><p>I wanted to go all-in: Jimmy offered to double my equity in exchange for co-signing to the business loan.

Was this going well?</p><p>Astoundingly, Jimmy kept drawing attention to the £50-per-referral banking partnership we had arranged. Did he not realise they offer this to everyone?!</p><p>We staggered when asked about our sign-ups from mechanics (zero) and daily repair jobs (also zero). None of us had the presence of mind to request a more junior, less busy contact point.</p><p><span>Our collective—really, </span><em>my</em><span>, efforts—yielded nothing substantial. We didn’t have the demand to convince mechanics to sign up. We didn’t have the mechanics to supply any demand that might exist. Marketplaces are hard, it turns out. And we were not the team to build it.</span></p><p>I got a much-needed reality check at a post-lockdown family party. I enthusiastically gave my cousin the rundown on Fixr, talking him through our development process and my summer spent hustling. He simply asked, bewildered:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Why are you doing all this work and not being paid?”</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>Come Autumn, things still weren’t going anywhere with Fixr. </p><p>Simultaneously, my underpaid mid-level consultancy role passed me up for promotion again. I wanted out, double-time.</p><p>I performed the reluctant ritual of reaching out to recruiters. On learning about my recent brush with startups, one recruiter suggested they had just the person to introduce me to.</p><p><span>Enter: </span><strong>Carbn</strong><span>. The app for building green habits and offsetting your emissions. </span></p><p>It was everything Fixr was not. </p><ul><li><p>A bootstrapping first-time founder, a commercial strategist who could fund a full-time salary for the right cofounder and was very generous with our equity split. </p></li><li><p>He’d shopped around several ideas, validating a high-potential market niche in the US prepared to spend money on the product.</p></li><li><p>After this validation, he committed: £10k on a solid contractor for a full set of designs; shaping the early roadmap for our early product work and giving us a solid branding foundation. </p></li><li><p>The guy whipped out a rudimentary financial model in a few hours. Turns out it’s not that important—it’s for illustrating your runway and spending plan, not to justify an imaginary revenue number. </p></li><li><p>No clandestine activity with contracts. We hashed it out on SeedLegals over beers.</p></li></ul><p>I tendered my resignation to my cofounders and relinquished my equity. </p><p>Gus quickly followed, immediately landing on his feet as an engineer in the banking sector. With no developers to keep the pretence of activity afloat, Fixr and the team soon dissolved.</p><p>This was cathartic, but bloody hard to write. </p><p>The earliest draft of this article began on August 18, 2023. I wanted to do right by you, and waited until I could tell my story properly.</p><p><span>The temptation to annotate each paragraph with commentary was excruciating. But I wanted my naivety to speak for itself—I hope, by the end, you were also screaming </span><em>“Get out! What are you doing!?”</em><span> to both myself and Gus. </span></p><p>But do you want to know the terrible truth? </p><p><strong>I loved every minute of it.</strong></p><p><span>Like the intrepid doctor, the stoic investment banker, or the wily consultant, suffering is part of the package. I was in my element. I had my finger in every pie. I was </span><em>doing</em><span> a startup. I was </span><em>executing</em><span>, and for the first time in my professional life I wasn’t insulated from the results. I didn’t achieve my destiny of </span><em>great things</em><span>, but I’d </span><em>built</em><span> something.</span></p><p>My story is far from unique—being exploited by a startup is almost a rite of passage. I don’t think I can even call this a cautionary tale, because of what I took out of the experience. My hard-earned learning from Fixr opened another door to Carbn which I was uniquely qualified for.</p><p>If you’re early in your career (and childless), I would even go as far as to recommend a quixotic startup journey. As a 29-year-old developer, I’ve seen first-hand the compounding career benefits of side projects, in many of my colleagues and my friends.</p><blockquote><p><em>Just watch out for some of the red flags which I summarised below!</em></p></blockquote><p>I wanted to end with a quick summary of some red flags you could encounter if you find yourself mired in a satanic side hustle. </p><ol><li><p><span>If a startup has operated for a long time without launching, consider whether the team are serious. Even if you are all very driven, if your cofounders aren’t obviously A-players, your chances of outsized startup success are low (</span><em>but you might still learn a lot).</em></p></li><li><p><span>If your equity share is contingent on being cut in on a business loan, you are being asked to invest your own money. </span><em>Run</em><span>. </span></p></li><li><p>If there is political infighting between cofounders, consider whether you want to raise funds and become legally bound to these people for several years.</p></li><li><p><span>There are 2 jobs at a startup: building and selling. If you aren’t sure what your cofounders are doing, trust your </span><em>git instinct</em><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Building native on multiple platforms is an extremely inefficient allocation of resources when pre-product-market-fit. Building </span><em>two</em><span> apps on each platform is just mad.</span></p></li><li><p>Startup pitch competitions are mostly a waste of time—validation comes from talking to users and iterating, not from impressing a judge. This iterating is the hard part—everyone will tell you they like your app, and most will say they’d pay for it. Unless you have deep domain knowledge, talking to 300 technicians without a working product will not yield useful validation.</p></li><li><p><span>Did I mention that I never met Kim or Mike in person? COVID aside, nothing beats the magic of hacking side-by-side to bring your dream to life. It’s not a great sign if </span><em>all</em><span> your communication is remote.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Marketplace startups are often considered the hardest software startups to build, because you have to create two markets at once. They work best with </span><strong>frequent </strong><span>and </span><strong>inexpensive </strong><span>transactions (from which you can reasonably take a 20% cut).</span></p></li><li><p><span>When VCs tell you “</span><em>talk to us again when you have traction”</em><span>, they mean </span><em><a href="https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/yes-actually-means-no-the-curious" rel="">“if you prove there is a market opportunity and that you can execute as a management team, then we might consider you. But because I don’t believe either of those things will happen, I will not be taking a risk on you”.</a></em></p></li><li><p><span>It’s also a red flag if you aren’t vetted much </span><em>yourself</em><span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I'm sick and god-damn tired of this! I have written tens of thousands of words about this and still, to this day, people are babbling about the "AI revolution" as the sky rains blood and crevices open in the Earth, dragging houses and cars and domesticated animals into their maws. Things are astronomically fucked outside, yet the tech media continues to tell me to get my swimming trunks and <em>take a nice long dip in the pool.</em></p><p>I apologize, this is going to be a little less reserved than usual.</p><p>I don't know why I'm the one writing what I'm writing, and I frequently feel weird that I, a part-time blogger and podcaster, am writing the things that I'm writing. Since I put out <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/"><u>OpenAI Is A Systemic Risk To The Tech Industry</u></a>, I've heard <em>nothing</em> in response, as was the case with<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/to-serve-altman/"> <u>How Does OpenAI Survive?</u></a> and<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/"> <u>OpenAI Is A Bad Business</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There seems to be little concern — or belief — that there is <em>any</em> kind of risk at the heart of OpenAI,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/#:~:text=As%20a%20note,run%20this%20company."> <u>a company that spent $9 billion in 2024 to <em>lose $5 billion</em></u></a><em>. </em>While I'd love to add a "because..." here, if not because it’s important to be intellectually honest and represent views that directly contrast my own, even if I do so in a somewhat sardonic fashion, nobody seems to actually have a cogent response to how they right this ship other than Hard Forker<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3lmkahymkec2t?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Casey Newton throwing a full-scale tantrum on a podcast</u></a> and saying I'm wrong because "inference costs are coming down."</p><p>Newton is a nakedly-captured booster that<a href="https://www.platformer.news/people-are-using-ai-to-learn-more/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>ran an infographic from Anthropic a few weeks ago the likes of which I haven't seen since 2013</u></a>, but he's far from the only one with a flimsy attachment to reality.</p><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-forecasts-revenue-topping-125-billion-2029-agents-new-products-gain?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>The Information ran a piece a couple of weeks ago</u></a> that made me furious, which was a surprise because — for the most part — their coverage of tech, and especially AI, has been some of the best around, and they generally avoid the temptation to be shills for shaky and unsustainable tech companies.&nbsp;</p><p>The story claimed that OpenAI was "forecasting revenue topping $125 billion in 2029" based on "selling agents" and "monetizing free users...as a driver to higher revenue." The piece, reported out based on things "...told [to] some potential and current investors," takes great pains to accept literally everything that OpenAI says as perfectly reasonable, if not gospel, even if said things make absolutely no sense.</p><p>According to The Information's reporting, OpenAI expects "agents" and "new products" to contribute tens of billions of dollars of revenue, both in the near-term (somehow contributing $3 billion in revenue this year, which I'll get to in a little bit) and in the long-term, with an egregious $25 billion in revenue in 2029 projected to come from "new products."&nbsp;</p><p>If you're wondering what those new products might be, I am too, because The Information doesn't seem to know, and instead of saying "OpenAI has no idea what the fuck they're talking about and is just saying stuff," the outlet chooses instead to publish things with the kind of empty optimism that's indistinguishable from GPT-generated LinkedIn posts.</p><p><em>Check out this fucking chart.</em></p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcTvV_KScCMt6maPCLAD5qACLXB0A9UFlxBy7vmR4oO6y99lGkJJOfKhOCB9a3-GeZrY83n6xFepHBUxmf4fUXpDuYAypFPjGBTV-i1B8xYCkhZ1JaIaiAkpUazxVVqwjbiVJF9?key=5iQ8LZzyYfTKSGqXLxb-sOQh" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="624"><figcaption><span>The Information — OpenAI Forecasts Revenue Topping $125 Billion in 2029 as Agents, New Products Gain</span></figcaption></figure><p>I want to be really, really clear: we are nearly in May 2025, and I see no evidence <strong><em>that OpenAI even has a marketable agent product, let alone one that will make it <u>three billion god damn dollars in the next six or seven months.</u></em></strong></p><p><em>For context, that’s triple the revenue OpenAI reportedly made from selling access to its models via its APIs — essentially allowing third-party companies to use GPT in their apps — in the entirety of 2024. And those APIs and models actually exist in a meaningful sense, as opposed to whatever the fuck OpenAI’s half-baked Agents stuff is.&nbsp;</em></p><p>In fact, no, no, I'm not going to be mean, I'm going to explain exactly what The Information is reporting in an objective way, because writing it out really shows how silly it all sounds. I am going to write "they believe" a lot because I must be clear how stupid this is:</p><ul><li>According to The Information's reporting, <strong>they believe that OpenAI will make $3 billion in 2025 from selling access to its agents in 2025</strong>. This appears to come from SoftBank,<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/softbank-pledges-to-spend-3-billion-annually-on-openai?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>which has said it will buy $3 billion worth of OpenAI products annually</u></a>.</li><li>Earlier this year, we got a bit of extra information about how SoftBank would use those products. It plans to <a href="https://group.softbank/en/news/press/20250203_0?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>create a system called Cristal Intelligence</u></a> that will be a kind-of general purpose AI agent platform for big enterprises. The exact specifics of what it does is vague (shocker, I know) but SoftBank intends to use the technology internally, across its various portfolio companies, as well as market it to other large enterprise companies in Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>I also want to add that The Information can't keep its story straight on this issue.<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-forecast-shows-shift-from-microsoft-to-softbank?ref=wheresyoured.at&amp;rc=kz8jh3"> <u>Back in February</u></a>, they reported that OpenAI would make $3 billion in revenue <em>only from agents,</em> with a big, beautiful chart that said $3 billion would come from “it," only to add that “it” would be SoftBank "...[using] OpenAI's products across its companies."&nbsp;</li><li>Based on these numbers, it seems like SoftBank will be the <em>only</em> customer for OpenAI’s agents. While this won’t be the case — and isn’t, because it excludes anyone willing to pay a few bucks to test it out — it nonetheless doesn’t signal good things for Agents as a mass market product.&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Agents do not exist as a product that can be sold at that scale.<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ai-agents-fall-short-shopping?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>The Information's own reporting from last week</u></a> highlighted how OpenAI’s "Operator" agent "struggle[d] with comparison shopping on financial products," and how Operator and other agents are "...tripped by pop-ups or logins, as well as prompts asking for email addresses and phone numbers for marketing purposes," which I think accurately describes <em>most of the internet.</em></li><li><strong>To summarize, The Information is saying that the above product will make OpenAI <em><u>three billion dollars by the end of the year.</u></em></strong></li></ul></li><li>According to The Information's reporting, <strong>they believe that OpenAI will basically double revenue every single year for the next four years</strong> and make $13 billion in revenue in 2025, more than doubling that to $29 billion in 2026, nearly doubling that to $54 billion in 2027, nearly doubling that to $86 billion in 2028, and eventually hitting $125 billion in 2029.<ul><li>Said revenue estimates, as of 2026, include billions of dollars of "new products" that include "free user monetization."<ul><li>If you are wondering what that means, I have no idea. The Information does not explain. They do, however, say that "OpenAI won’t start generating much revenue from free users and other products until next year. In 2029, however, it projects revenue from free users and other products will reach $25 billion, or one-fifth of all revenue," and said that "shopping is another potential avenue."</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>I cannot express my disgust about how willing publications are to blindly publish projections like these, especially when they're so utterly ridiculous. Check out this quote:</p><blockquote>OpenAI has already begun experimenting with launching software features for shopping. Starting in January, some users can access web-browsing agent Operator as part of their pro ChatGPT subscription tier to order groceries from Instacart and make restaurant reservations on OpenTable.</blockquote><p>So you're saying this <strong><em>experimental software launched to an indeterminate amount of people that barely works is going to make OpenAI $13 billion in 2025, and $29 billion in 2026, and later down the line $125 billion in 2029? How? <u>How?</u></em></strong></p><p>What fucking universe are we all living in? There's no proof that OpenAI can do this other than the fact that it has a lot of users and venture capital!&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, I think we have reason to worry about whether OpenAI even makes its current projections.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/#:~:text=Bloomberg%20reported%20recently,to%20%243.43%20billion)."> <u>In my last piece</u></a> I wrote that Bloomberg had estimated that OpenAI would triple revenue to $12.7 billion in 2025, and based on its current subscriber base,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/#:~:text=The%20Information%20reported%20back%20in%20January"> <u>OpenAI would have to effectively double its <em>current</em> subscription revenue <em>and massively increase its API revenue </em>to hit these targets</u></a>.</p><p>These projections rely on <strong><em>one entity (SoftBank) spending $3 billion on OpenAI's services, meaning that it’d make enough API calls to generate more revenue than OpenAI made in subscriptions in the entirety of 2024, and something else that I can only describe as “an act of God.”</em></strong></p><blockquote>That, I admit, assumes that Softbank’s spending commitment is based on usage, and not a flat fee (where Softbank pays $3bn and gets a set — or infinite — level of access). Assuming it’s the former, I’d be stunned if SoftBank’s consumption hits $3bn this year, even with the massive cost of the reasoning models that Cristal Intelligence will be based on. Softbank announced its deal with OpenAI in February.&nbsp;<p>Cristal Intelligence, if it works — and that is possibly the most load-bearing “if” of all time — will be a massive, complicated, ambitious product. Details are vague, but from what I understand, SoftBank wants to create an AI that handles the infinitely varied tasks that knowledge workers perform on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, OpenAI’s agents cannot consistently do, well… <em>anything</em>.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>What I believe is happening is that reporters are taking<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>OpenAI's rapid growth in revenue from 2023 to 2024</u></a> (from tens of millions a month at the start of 2023 to $300 million in August 2024) to mean that the company will always effectively double or triple revenue every single year forever, with their evidence being "OpenAI has projected this will be the case."</p><p>It's bullshit! I'm sorry!<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/#:~:text=ChatGPT%20is%20popular,and%20unsustainable."> <u>As I wrote before</u></a>, OpenAI effectively <em>is</em> the generative AI industry, and nothing about the <em>rest</em> of the generative AI industry suggests that the revenue exists to sustain these ridiculous, obscene and fantastical projections. Believing this — and yes, reporting it objectively is both endorsing and believing these numbers — is engaging in childlike logic, where you take one event (OpenAI's revenue grew 1700% from 2023 to 2024! Wow!) to mean another will take place (OpenAI will continue to double revenue literally every other year! Wow!), consciously ignoring difficult questions such as "how?" and "what's the total addressable market of Large Language Model subscriptions exactly?" and "how does this company even survive when it "expects the costs of inference to triple this year to $6 billion alone"?</p><p>Wait, wait, sorry, I need to be really clear with that last one, this is a direct quote from The Information:</p><blockquote>The company also expects growth in inference costs—the costs of running AI products such as ChatGPT and underlying models—to moderate over the next half-decade. Those costs will triple this year, to about $6 billion and rise to nearly $47 billion in 2030. Still, the annual growth rate will fall to about 30% then.</blockquote><p>Are you <em>fucking kidding me?</em></p><p><em>Six billion fucking dollars for inference alone? </em>Hey Casey, I thought those costs were coming down! Casey, are you there? Casey? <em>Casey?????</em></p><p><strong>Anyway, </strong>that's not great at all! That's really bad! The Information reports that OpenAI will make "about $8 billion" from subscriptions to ChatGPT in 2025, meaning that <strong><em>75% of OpenAI's largest revenue source is eaten up by the price to provide it</em></strong>. This is meant to be the cheaper part! This is the one fucking thing people say is meant to come down in price!</p><p>Are we living in different dimensions?

It's proof that something is broken in society. Generative AI has never had the kind of meaningful business returns or utility that actually underpins something meaningful, but it has <em>enough to make people give it a try.</em></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="you-know-what-lets-talk-about-why-this-bubble-actually-inflated"><strong>You know what? Let's talk about why this bubble actually inflated!</strong></h2><p>So, let's start simple: the term "artificial intelligence" is bastardized to the point it effectively means nothing and everything at the same time. When people hear "AI" they think of an autonomous intelligence that can do things <em>for them</em>, and generative AI can "do things for you" like generate an image or text "from a simple prompt." As a result, it's easy to manipulate people who don't know much about tech into believing that this will naturally progress from "it can create a bunch of text for me that I have to write for my job just by me typing in a prompt" to "it can do my job for me just by typing in a prompt."</p><p>Basically everything you read about "the future of AI" extrapolates generative AI's ability to <em>sort of generate something a human would make</em> and turns it into <em>do whatever a human can do</em>, all because tech has, in the past, been bad at the beginning and linearly improved as time drags on.&nbsp;</p><p>This illogical thinking underpins the entire generative AI boom, because we've found out exactly how many people do not know what the fuck they're talking about and are willing to believe the last semi-intelligent person they talked to. Generative AI is a remarkable con — a just-good-enough simulacrum of human expression to get it past the gatekeepers in finance and the media, knowing that neither will apply a second gear of critical thinking beyond "huh guess we're doing AI now."</p><p>The expectation that generative AI will transform into something much, much more powerful requires you to first ignore the existing limitations, believing it to be more capable than it is, and also ignore the fact that these models have yet to show meaningful improvement over the past few years. They still hallucinate. They’re still ungodly expensive to run. They’re still unreliable. <em>And they still don’t do much</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Worse still, ChatGPT's growth has galvanized these people into believing that this is a legitimate, meaningful movement, rather than the most successful PR campaign of all time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Think of it like this: if almost every single media outlet talked about one thing (generative AI), and that one thing was available from one company (OpenAI), wouldn't it look exactly how things look today? You've got OpenAI with hundreds of millions of monthly active users, and then a bunch of other companies — including big tech firms with multi-trillion dollar market caps —<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/#:~:text=Is%20Generative%20AI%20A%20Real%20Industry%3F"> <u>with somewhere between 10 and 69 million monthly active users</u></a>.</p><p>What we're seeing is one company taking most of the users and money available and doing so <em>because the media fucking helped them.</em>&nbsp; People aren't amazed by ChatGPT — they're curious! They're curious about why the media won't shut up about it!</p><h2 id="this-bubble-was-also-inflated-by-the-failure-of-google-search"><strong>This Bubble Was Also Inflated By The Failure of Google Search</strong></h2><p>Everybody I talk to that uses ChatGPT regularly uses it as either a way to generate shitty limericks or as a replacement for Google search,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/"> <u>a product that Google has deliberately made worse as a means of increasing profits</u></a>.</p><p>ChatGPT is, if I'm honest, better at processing search strings than Google Search, which is not so much a sign that ChatGPT is <em>good</em> at something as it is that <em>Google has stopped innovating in any meaningful way.</em> Over time, Google Search should've become something that was able to interpret your searches into the perfect result, which would require the company to <em>improve how it processes your requests.</em> Instead, Google Search has become <em>dramatically worse</em>, mostly because the company's incentives changed from "help people find something on the web" to "funnel as much traffic and show as many ad impressions as possible on Google.com."</p><p>By this point, Google Search should have been <em>more</em> magical, <em>more</em> capable of taking a dimwitted question and turning it into a great answer, with said answer being a result on the internet. Note that nothing I'm writing here is actually about generating a result — it's about processing a user's query and presenting an answer, the very foundation of computing and the thing that Google, at one point, was the best in the world at doing.<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-man-that-destroyed-google-search/id1730587238?i=1000653621646&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Thanks to Prabhakar Raghavan</u></a>, the former head of ads that led a coup to become head of search, Google was pulled away from being a meaningful source of information.</p><p>And I'd argue that ChatGPT filled that void by doing the thing that people wanted Google Search to do: answer a question, even if the user isn't really sure how to ask it. Google Search has become clunky, obfuscatory, putting the burden of using the service on the user rather than helping fill the gap between query and answer in any meaningful way. Google's AI summaries don't even try to do what ChatGPT does — they generate summaries based on search results and say "okay man, uhh, is this what you want?"&nbsp;</p><blockquote>One note on Google’s AI summaries: They’re designed to answer a question, rather than provide a right answer. That’s a distinction that needs to be made, because it speaks to the underlying utility of this product.&nbsp;<p>One good illustration of this came earlier this week, when someone noticed that you could ask Google to explain the meaning of a completely made-up phrase, and it would dutifully obey. “</p><a href="https://x.com/rose_matt/status/1915355300506325282?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Two dry frogs in a situation</u></a>,” Google said, referred to a group of people in an awkward or difficult social situation.&nbsp;<p>“</p><a href="https://x.com/enfyscheese/status/1915356621716307979?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Not every insect has a mortgage</u></a>,” Google claimed,” is a humorous way of explaining that not everything is as it seems. My favorite, “<a href="https://x.com/shagbark_hick/status/1915560564065218845?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>big winky on the skillet bowl</u></a>,” is apparently a slang term that refers to a piece of bread with an egg in the middle.&nbsp;<p>Funny? Sure. But is it useful? No.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>With all its data and all its talent, Google has put the laziest version of a Large Language Model on top of a questionably-functional search product as a means of impressing shareholders.</p><p>None of this is to say that ChatGPT is <em>good</em>, just that it is better at understanding a user's request than Google Search.</p><p>Yes, I fundamentally believe that 500 million people a week could be using ChatGPT as some sort of search replacement, and no, I do not believe that's a functional business model, in part because if it was, ChatGPT would've been a functional business.&nbsp;</p><p>That, and it appears that Google's ability to turn search into such a big business was because<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/17/google-hit-with-second-antitrust-blow-adding-to-concerns-about-ads.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>it held a monopoly on search, search advertising and the entire online ads industry</u></a>, and if it was a truly competitive market and it wasn’t allowed to be vertically integrated with the entire digital advertising apparatus of the web, it would likely be making much less revenue per user. And that’s bad if your Google Replacement costs many, many times more than Google to run.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>As an aside: if you're wondering, no, OpenAI cannot "just create a Google Search competitor."<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/burst-damage/#:~:text=What%27s%20that%3F%20SearchGPT%3F%20Sam%2C%20you%27re%20crazy!%20There%27s%20no%20way%20you%20can%20build%20a%20Google%20Search%20competitor!%20Trust%20me%2C%20I%20know.%C2%A0"> <u>SearchGPT will be significantly more expensive to run at Google's scale than ChatGPT</u></a> — both infrastructurally and in the cost of revenue, with OpenAI forced to create a massive advertising arm that currently doesn't exist at the company.</blockquote><p>People love the ChatGPT interface — the box where they can type one thing and get another thing out — because it resembles how everybody has always wanted Google Search to work. Does it actually work? Who knows. But people feel like they're getting more out of it.</p><h2 id="lets-talk-about-agi-really-quick"><strong>Let's Talk About AGI Really Quick</strong></h2><p>This newsletter has been a break from the extremely deep and onerous analysis I've been on for the last few months, in part because I needed to have a little fun writing.</p><p>It also comes from a place of frustration. None of this has ever felt substantive or real because the actual things that you can do with generative AI never seem to come close to the things that people like Sam Altman and Dario Amodei seem to be promising, nor do they come close to the bullshit that people like Casey Newton and<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3ln4p3ms7522j?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Kevin Roose are peddling</u></a>. None of this ever resembled "artificial general intelligence," and if I'm honest, very little of it seems to even suggest it's a functional industry.</p><p>When cynical plants like Roose bumble around asking theoretical questions such as "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3ln4p3ms7522j?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>do you think that there is a 50% chance or greater that AGI, defined as an AI system that outperforms human experts at virtually all cognitive tasks, will be built before 2030</u></a>," we should all be terrified, not of AGI, but that the lead tech columnist at the New York Times appears to have an undiagnosed concussion. Roose's logic (as with Newton's) is based on the idea that he's talked to a bunch of people that say "yeah dude AGI is right around the corner" rather than any kind of proof or tangible evidence, just "the curve is going up."</p><p>Roose’s most egregious example of this company-forward credulousness came last week, when he published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/technology/ai-welfare-anthropic-claude.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a thinly-veiled puff piece</u></a> about what to do if AI models become conscious in the near future. He interviewed two people — both employed by Anthropic, with one holding the genuinely hilarious job description of “AI welfare researcher” — who said batshit things like “there’s only a small chance (maybe 15 percent or so) that Claude or another current A.I. system is conscious” and “It seems to me that if you find yourself in the situation of bringing some new class of being into existence… then it seems quite prudent to at least be asking questions about whether that system might have its own kinds of experiences.”</p><p>What makes this so appalling is that Roose acknowledges that this shit is seen by most level-headed people as nothing less than utter fantasy. He describes the concept of AI consciousness as “a taboo subject” and that many critics will see this as “crazy talk,” but doesn’t bother to speak to any actual critics. He does, however, speculate on the motives of said critics, saying that “they might object to an A.I. company’s studying consciousness in the first place, because it might create incentives to train their systems to act more sentient than they actually are.”</p><p>Yeah Kevin, wouldn’t it be terrible if a company somehow convinced someone that their AI was more powerful than it was? Also, do you bark at the mirror every time you walk past it because you think you see another guy?</p><p>Nothing about anything that Anthropic or OpenAI is building or shipping suggests we are anywhere near any kind of autonomous computing. They've used the concept of "AI safety" — and now, AI welfare — as a marketing term to convince people that their expensive, wasteful software will somehow become conscious because they're having discussions about what to do if it does so, and anyone — literally any reporter — accepting this at face value is doing their readers a disservice and embarrassing themselves in the process.</p><p>If AI safety advocates cared about, say, safety or AI, they'd have cared about the environmental impact, or the fact these models train using stolen material, or the fact that if these models actually delivered on their promises, it would deliver a shock to the labor market that would meaningfully hurt millions — if not billions — of people, and we don’t have anywhere near the social safety net to support them.&nbsp;</p><p>These companies don't care about your safety and they don't have any way to get to AGI. They are full of shit and it's time to start being honest that you don't have any proof they will do <em>anything</em> they say they will.</p><h2 id="oh-by-the-way-the-bubble-might-be-bursting"><strong>Oh, By The Way, The Bubble Might Be Bursting</strong></h2><p>Hey, remember in August of last year when I talked about the pale horses of the AIpocalpyse? One of the major warning signs that the bubble was bursting was<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/burst-damage/#:~:text=Any%20suggestion%20that%20Google%20or%20Microsoft%20is%20reducing%20their%20capex%3A%20Venture%20capital%20isn%E2%80%99t%20really%20what%E2%80%99s%20propping%20up%20generative%20AI%20%E2%80%94%20it%E2%80%99s%20Google%20or%20Microsoft.%20If%20either%20of%20them%20decide%20it%E2%80%99s%20time%20to%20slow%20down%20investment%2C%20the%20boom%20is%20done%2C%20as%20referenced%20above."> <u>big tech firms reducing their capital expenditures</u></a>, a call I've made before, with a little more clarity, on April 4 2024:</p><blockquote>While I hope I'm wrong, the calamity I fear is one where the massive over-investment in data centers is met with a lack of meaningful growth or profit, leading to the markets turning on the major cloud players that staked their future on unproven generative AI. If businesses don't adopt AI <em>at scale</em> — not experimentally, but at the core of their operations — the revenue is simply not there to sustain the hype, and once the market turns, it will turn hard, demanding efficiency and cutbacks that will lead to tens of thousands of job cuts.</blockquote><p>We're about to find out if I'm right.</p><p>Last week, Yahoo Finance reported that analyst Josh Beck<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-stock-falls-as-raymond-james-downgrades-shares-citing-tariff-headwinds-and-limited-ai-monetization-144747355.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>said that Amazon's generative AI revenue for Amazon Web Services would be $5 billion</u></a>, a remarkably small sum that is A) not profit and B) a drop in the bucket compared to Amazon's projected $105 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, its $78.2 billion in 2024, or its $48.4 billion in 2023.</p><h3 id="is-that-really-it-are-you-kidding-me-amazon-will-only-make-5-billion-from-ai-in-2025-what"><strong>Is That Really It? Are you kidding me? Amazon will only make $5 billion from AI in 2025? What?</strong></h3><p>5 billion dollars? <em>Five billion god damn dollars? Are you fucking kidding me?</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G07sWzYObnk&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>You'd make more money auctioning dogs</u></a>! This is a disgrace! And if you're wondering, yes! All of this is for AI:</p><blockquote>CEO Andy Jassy said in February that the vast majority of this year’s $100 billion in capital investments from the tech giant will go toward building out artificial intelligence capacity for its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS).</blockquote><p>Well shit, I bet investors are gonna love this! Better save some money, Andy!</p><p>What's that? You already did? How?</p><p>Oh, shit!<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-has-halted-some-data-center-leasing-talks-wells-fargo-analysts-say-2025-04-21/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>A report from Wells Fargo analysts</u></a> (called "Data Centers: AWS Goes on Pause") says that Amazon has "paused a portion of its leasing discussions on the colocation side...[and while] it's not clear the magnitude of the pause...the positioning is similar to what [analysts have] heard recently from Microsoft, [that] they are digesting aggressive recent lease-up deals...pulling back from a pipeline of LOIs or SOQs."</p><blockquote>Some asshole is going to say "LOIs and SOQs aren't a big deal," but they <em>are</em>. I wrote about it<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/power-cut/#:~:text=Sidebar%3A%20Let%27s%20explain%20some%20terms!"> <em><u>here</u></em></a><em>.</em></blockquote><p>"Digesting" in this case refers to when hyperscalers sit with their current capacity for a minute, and Wells Fargo adds that these periods typically last 6-12 months, though can be much shorter. It's not obvious <em>how much</em> capacity Amazon is walking away from, but they are walking away from capacity. <em>It's happening.</em></p><p>But what if it wasn't just Amazon? Another report from friend of the newsletter (read: people I email occasionally asking for a PDF) analyst TD Cowen put out a report last week that, while titled in a way that suggested there wasn't a pull back, actually said there was.</p><p>Let's take a look at one damning quote:</p><blockquote>...relative to the hyperscale demand backdrop at PTC, hyperscale demand has moderated a bit (driven by the Microsoft pullback and to a lesser extent Amazon, discussed below), particularly in Europe, 2) there has been a broader moderation in the urgency and speed with which the hyperscalers are looking to take down capacity, and 3) the number of large deals (i.e. +400MW deals) in the market appears to have moderated.</blockquote><p>In plain English, this means "demand has come down, there's less urgency in building this stuff, and the market is slowing down. Cowen also added that it "...observed a moderation in the exuberance around the outlook for hyperscale demand which characterized the market this time last year."&nbsp;</p><p>Brother, isn't this meant to be the next big thing? We need more exuberance! Not less!</p><p>Worse still, Microsoft appears to have pulled back <em>even further</em>, with TD Cowen noting that there has been a "slowdown in demand," and that it saw "very little third-party leasing from Microsoft" this quarter, and, most damningly, and I'll bold this for effect, "<strong>these deals in totality suggest Microsoft's run-rate demand has decelerated materially,</strong>" which for those of you wondering means <strong><em>it’s not getting the fucking demand for generative AI.</em></strong></p><p>Well, at least Meta and Oracle aren't slowing down, right?</p><p><em>Well...</em></p><p>TD Cowen reported that it received "reverse inquiries from industry participants around a potential slowdown in demand from Oracle," leading the analyst to ask around and find that "there had been a NT (near-term) slowdown in decision-making amid organizational changes at Oracle," though it adds this might not mean that this is changing its needs or the speed at which it secures capacity. If you're wondering what else this could mean, you are correct to do so, because "slowing down" traditionally refers to a change in speed.</p><p>TD Cowen also adds that Meta has continued demand "albeit with less volume of MW (Megawatt) signings quarter-over-quarter..." then adding that "Meta's data center activity has historically been characterized by short periods of strong activity followed by digestion." In essence, Meta is signing less megawatts of compute and has, in the past, followed periods of aggressive buildouts with, well, fewer buildouts.</p><h2 id="if-im-wrong-how-am-i-wrong-exactly"><strong>If I'm Wrong, How Am I Wrong Exactly?</strong></h2><p>I dunno man, all of this sure seems like the hyperscalers are reducing their capital expenditures at a time when tariffs and economic uncertainty are making investors more critical of revenues. It sure seems like nobody outside of OpenAI is making any real revenue on generative AI, and they're certainly not making a profit.</p><p>It also, at this point, is pretty obvious that generative AI isn't going to do much more than it does today. If Amazon is only making $5 billion in revenue from <em>the literal only shiny new thing it has, sold on the world's premier cloud platform, at a time when businesses are hungry and desperate to integrate AI,</em> then there's little chance this suddenly turns into a remarkable revenue-driver.</p><p>Amazon made <em>$187.79 billion in its last quarterly earnings</em>, and if $5 billion is all it’s making at the very height of the bubble, it heavily suggests that there may not actually be that much money to make, either because it's too expensive to run these services or because these services don't have the kind of total addressable market as the rest of Amazon's services.</p><p><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/microsoft-earnings-2/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Microsoft reported that it was making a paltry $13 billion a year</u></a> — so the equivalent of $3.25 billion a quarter — selling generative AI services and model access.<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ai-giving-salesforce-boost?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>The Information reported that Salesforce's "Agentforce" bullshit isn't even going to boost sales growth in 2025</u></a>, in part because it’s pitching it as "digital labor that can essentially replace humans for tasks" and it turns out that it doesn't do that very well at all, costs $2 a conversation, and requires paying Salesforce to use its "data cloud" product.</p><p>What, if anything, suggests that I'm wrong here? That things have worked out in the past with things like the Internet and smartphones, and so it surely must happen for generative AI and, by extension, OpenAI? That companies like Uber lost money and eventually worked out (<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/to-serve-altman/#:~:text=As%20another%20aside%2C%20Uber%2C%20a%20company%20famed%20for%20burning%20%2425%20billion%20dollars%20to%20achieve%20profitability%2C%20raised%20a%20total%20of...well%2C%20%2425%20billion%2C%20which%20included%20four%20different%20funding%20rounds%20in%20the%20year%202018%20alone."><u>see my response here</u></a>)? That OpenAI is growing fast, and that somehow discounts the fact it burns billions of dollars and does not appear to have any path to making a profit? That agents will suddenly start working and everything will be fine?</p><p>It's a fucking joke and I'm tired of it!</p><p>Large Language Models and their associated businesses are a $50 billion industry masquerading as a trillion-dollar panacea for a tech industry that’s lost the plot. Silicon Valley is dominated by management consultants that no longer know what innovation looks like, tricked by Sam Altman, a savvy con artist who took advantage of tech’s desperation for growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Generative AI is the perfected nihilistic form of tech bubbles — a way for people to spend a lot of money and power on cloud compute because they don’t have anything better to do. Large Language Models are boring, unprofitable cloud software stretched to their limits — both ethically and technologically — as a means of tech’s collapsing growth era, OpenAI’s non-profit mission fattened up to make foie gras for SaaS companies to upsell their clients and cloud compute companies to sell GPUs at an hourly rate.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/" rel="noreferrer">The Rot Economy</a> has consumed the tech industry. Every American tech firm has become corrupted by the growth-at-all-costs mindset, and thus they no longer know how to make sustainable businesses that solve real problems, largely because the people that run them haven’t experienced them for decades.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, none of them were ready for when Sam Altman tricked them into believing he was their savior.&nbsp;</p><p>Generative AI isn’t about helping you or me do things — it’s about making new SKUs, new monthly subscription costs for consumers and enterprises, new ways to convince people to pay more for the things that they already used to be slightly different in a way that often ends up being worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Only an industry out of options would choose this bubble, and the punishment for doing so will be grim. I don’t know if you think I’m wrong or not. I don’t know if you think I’m crazy for the way I communicate about this industry. Even if you think I am, think long and hard about why it is you disagree with me, and the consequences of me being wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>There is nothing else after generative AI. There are no other hypergrowth markets left in tech. SaaS companies are out of things to upsell. Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta do not have any other ways to continue showing growth, and when the market works that out, there will be hell to pay, hell that will reverberate through the valuations of, at the very least, every public software company, and many of the hardware ones too.</p><p>And I fear it'll go much further, too. The longer this bubble inflates - the longer everybody pretends - the worse the consequences will be.</p>

I guess they had to limit themselves to under 1K pages or something, so they had to step down the font size slightly.  I mean, it’s not uncomfortable, but it’s just a smidgen too small.  And since the pages are so big, they felt the need to increase the line height, so that your eyes can snap back to the left side of the page without losing place.</p><p>I just thing the look of these pages isn’t ideal.  But it does give you the feeling you’re reading some old huge grimoire, which is probably what they were going for, and that’s fun.</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC01805.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC01805-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC01805-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC01805-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC01805-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC01805-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC01805-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC01805-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></p><p>But since it’s uncomfortable to hold, and also slightly uncomfortable to read, I just read the old editions I had.  D’oh!  But I did look at the illustrations, too.</p><p>(And I couldn’t find The Other Wind, so I read that from this new collection, along with the afterwords and the extra included short stories and stuff.)</p><p>So how is it?  Presumably, you’ve all read these books — or at least the first three.</p><p>I had forgotten how oldee tymey the first book is.  It’s written in a style halfway between fairy tales and modern “classic” fantasy.  That is, people are introduced like “and then he met Grumbledork, who would go on to sail to Vinklebump and vanquish Zomplefart, the dragon, but that’s a story for another day”, etc etc.  As someone who hates fairy tales…  I really enjoyed it.  As much as I did when I was 11.</p><p>I think the second book, The Tombs of Atuan is generally considered to be the best?  It’s written in a very different way, and it is indeed very good.  But I think of the first three books, I prefer the third, The Farthest Shore.  It’s like a remake of the first book (a road movie, but at sea), but the encounters are more memorable and vivid — like the people who live at sea all their lives, in the floating cities, and so on.  And it has the most moving end.</p><p>Then 30 years passed, and the fourth book came, Tehanu.  If you were 11 years old in 1991, and read the four books in quick succession, you’d get whiplash when you got to the fourth one: It starts with a five year old girl who was raped and then put into a campfire to burn to death.  (And that’s just the first page.)  But if you grew up with the first three books, and then got to the fourth as an adult (as I did), then it seemed quite natural:  It’s a brutal, angry book, and it’s fantastic.</p><p>Ten more years passed, and we got a short story collection — but times have moved on, and “short” isn’t the same as in the olden days.  The first story in the collection is about two thirds the length of the first novel.  All the stories are solid, and we retrench a lot from the harshness of Tehanu.  Le Guin says she wrote the stories to figure out herself how to finish off the series with the fifth novel, and to explore things about Earthsea.  Now, nothing strikes more fear into a reader’s heart than an author who wants to “explore things” in their universe: You’re likely to get a story filling you in on the “lore” of the second lieutenant mentioned in half of a sentence in book two, and nothing in the short story must affect the “proper” novels whatsoever.  But of course, Le Guin does nothing of the kind: She writes interesting stories that fill in the milieu and enriches your love for the world, and not trite info dumps or backstory you’ve never asked for.</p><p>And finally, the sixth and final book came hot on the heels of the fifth, and it’s a novel that manages to be a wonderful ending to the entire series.  I had totally forgotten that.  It echoes the first and third books storytelling wise, and concludes the storylines started in the fourth book, while starring (sort of) Tenar from the second book.  Some people when they finish a series like this seem to have a checklist of points they go through and make everything neat — Le Guin is way too smart to do something like that, but it’s a really solid ending to the cycle.</p><p>(Except that there are a few more short stories included in this collecion.  The final story was published in The Paris Review originally in 2018, after Le Guin had died, and is a very moving coda.)</p><p>So to sum up: These books are still darn good, and even better than I remembered.</p><p>And now I want to read something that’s not fantasy.</p><p><b>The Books of Earthsea (2018)</b> by Ursula K.

    <section>
      <h2>What is PyXL?</h2>
      <p>PyXL is a custom hardware processor that executes Python <strong>directly</strong> — no interpreter, no JIT, and no tricks. It takes regular Python code and runs it in silicon.</p>
      <p>A custom toolchain compiles a <code>.py</code> file into CPython ByteCode, translates it to a custom assembly, and produces a binary that runs on a pipelined processor built from scratch.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What PyXL is not</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ Not a native C or inlined loop</li>
        <li>❌ Not MicroPython or JIT</li>
        <li>❌ Not running Linux or any OS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's a real processor for Python, built for determinism and speed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Where does it run?</h2>
      <p>PyXL runs on a <strong>Zynq-7000 FPGA</strong> (Arty-Z7-20 dev board). The PyXL core runs at 100MHz. The ARM CPU on the board handles setup and memory, but the Python code itself is executed entirely in hardware.</p>
      <p>The toolchain is written in Python and runs on a standard development machine using unmodified CPython.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Wait — what’s a GPIO?</h2>
      <p>
        GPIO stands for <strong>General Purpose Input/Output</strong>. It’s a simple hardware pin that software can read from or write to — a way to control the outside world: LEDs, buttons, sensors, motors, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        In MicroPython (like on the PyBoard), your Python code interacts with C functions that handle hardware registers underneath. It’s reasonably fast, but still goes through a Python VM and a software stack before reaching the pin.
      </p>
      <p>
        PyXL skips all of that. The Python bytecode is executed directly in hardware, and GPIO access is physically wired to the processor — no interpreter, no function call, just native hardware execution.
      </p>
    </section>    

    <section>
      <h2>Now for the GPIO test. What was the video?</h2>
      <p>I have connected two pins in the Arty board with a jumper cable.</p>
      <p>Then, I wrote a python program that measures the time from when GPIO pin1 is set to 1, until 1 is measured on the other pin connected to it.</p>
      <p>The video shows a comparison between PyXL and PyBoard that runs MicroPython VM.<br>Let's focus on how PyXL does its thing.</p>

      <h2>The program</h2>
      <pre>from compiler.intrinsics import *


def main():
    pyxl_write_gpio_pin1(0)              # Reset output pin

    c1 = pyxl_get_cycle_counter()        # Cycle counter (100 MHz)

    pyxl_write_gpio_pin1(1)              # Set output pin
    while pyxl_read_gpio_pin2() == 0:    # Wait until input pin is set to 1
        continue

    c2 = pyxl_get_cycle_counter()        # Cycle counter (100 MHz)

    return (c2 - c1) * 10                # Return result in nano seconds (each cycle is 10 ns)
          </pre>

      <p>As you can see, this is a regular python program, but it also has some unfamiliar function calls.<br>
        These functions originate from compiler.intrinsics module.</p>
        <pre>pyxl_get_cycle_counter()</pre>
        <p>Gets the current cycle counter from the PyXL CPU. This counter advances by 1 on every tick</p>

        <pre>pyxl_write_gpio_pin1()</pre>
        <p>Writes a value (0/1) to a GPIO pin. These are low-level intrinsics exposed by the compiler — currently hardcoded for this test, but will evolve into a more general pyxl_gpio_write(pin, value) API.</p>

        <pre>pyxl_read_gpio_pin2()</pre>
        <p>Reads the value from Pin2. Same API comment is true here as well.</p>
      
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Wait, why isn't there a call to the main function?</h2>
      <p>The main function is just defined, but not invoked. why?</p>
      <p>At current stage, PyXL calls the main function automatically when it runs a program.</p>
      <p>This is just a convenience feature (for dev) and will change in the future.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>So how does it work?</h2>
      <p>As described above, the program is compiled to a CPython Bytecode and then compiled again to PyXL assembly. It is then linked together and a binary is generated.</p>
      <p>This binary is sent via network to the Arty board, where an ARM CPU gets the application, copies it to a shared memory with the PyXL HW and starts running it.</p>
      <p>A typical Python runtime (CPython or MicroPython in case of the PyBoard or Python for embedded in general) has a big overhead that is caused by running the ByteCode on a Software based VM. In PyXL there's no VM, the HW does everything.</p>
      <p>As for reading and writing the GPIO - The GPIO headers are directly mapped to FPGA pins, and physically wired into PyXL's core top-level module. Think of it as the main function of the HW.</p>
      <p>In this test, all code and data reside in predictable low-latency memory, ensuring deterministic behavior (real-time behavior). This means that for the same input, it'll take the exact same time to run.
      </p>
    </section>
      
    <section>
      <h2>So how do these platforms compare?</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>GPIO Roundtrip Latency (ns). Lower is better.</h3>
        
        
        
        <div>
          <p><span>MicroPython (PyBoard)</span><span>14,741ns</span>
          </p>
          
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>As you can see, PyXL is 30x faster than PyBoard.</p>
      <p>Also, remember that PyXL's clock speed is lower than PyBoard.</p>
      <p>The reason for not operating at a higher clock is that PyXL is prototyped on an FPGA and PyBoard has an ASIC. But the gist of it is that it's not a limitation of PyXL and higher clocks can be achieved.</p>
      <p>Since a higher clock is achievable, we need to compare apples-to-apples and normalize the clock frequencies.<br>
      That brings PyXL’s normalized advantage to ~50x over PyBoard.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why don't both tests run the exact same code?</h2>
      <p>To the keen eyes among you, you may have noticed in the video that the PyBoard code and the PyXL code aren't the same.</p>
      <p>Both are Python, this is obvious, but there're two main differences:</p>
      <p>1. API calls for measuring time and reading/writing GPIO pins. The reason being that this is not CPython that runs on a host, but systems that are aware of the underlying hardware, bringing their own runtime environment with them.<br>
      Each platform has its own hardware access API calls, but regular python code is still portable between the platforms (as long as they support whatever Python feature you want to use).</p>
      <p>2. The PyBoard runs the test in a tight loop to compensate for jitter and cold cache.<br>
      MicroPython running on the PyBoard has runtime jitter. The results are between 14-25 micro seconds in my test. So I wanted to compare to PyBoard after significant warm up to show how much better PyXL is even in such case.<br>
      PyXL, by contrast, is fully deterministic. So long as the jumper is connected, PyXL returns a consistent 480ns every time.<br>
      This makes PyXL suitable for real-time use cases.
    </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Big deal, who cares about making a signal go a bit faster?</h2>
      <p>
        This isn’t just a performance boost — it's an unlock. PyXL brings a level of responsiveness and determinism that Python has never had in embedded or real-time contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python VMs — even those designed for microcontrollers — are still built around software interpreters. That introduces overhead and complexity between your code and the hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        PyXL removes this barrier. Your Python code is executed directly in hardware. GPIO access is physical. Control flow is predictable. Execution is tight and consistent by design.
      </p>
      <p>With this unlock, PyXL can be further developed and adapted to these use cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🕹 Real-time control systems in pure Python</li>
        <li>🧠 ML inference + sensor response loops with hard timing budgets</li>
        <li>🤖 Robotics tasks like motor feedback and sensor fusion with cycle-level precision</li>
        <li>🔧 Embedded industrial systems where timing and reliability matter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With PyXL, you can write performance-critical code once — in Python — and ship it as-is.
      </p>

    <p>I’ve recently rediscovered an old game called “The Games: Winter Challenge”, a Winter Olympics sports game developed by MindSpan and published by Accolade in 1991 for DOS and Sega Genesis.
I had the DOS version of the game when growing up, so when I was randomly reminded of its existence, I was driven by a mix of nostaliga and curiosity to dig it up again.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/winter_titlescreen.webp" alt="Animation of the game's title screen"></p>

<p>Having grown up to become a computer scientist, I was not as much insterested in replaying it (though hearing the iconic music again was fun), but much more how it worked under the hood.
I had spent hours as a kid playing especially the ski jumping event, trying to reach the elusive mark of 100 meters, without success, and was determined to find out not only whether it was possible to achieve, but also what the theoretical optimum would be.
Conveniently, the game features a replay system that allows you to save and rewatch past attempts, which opens up great opportunities for creating a TAS and manufacture a perfect replay file, and push the game to its limts.</p>

<p>My initial plan of attack was simple: Find a copy of the game, crack it open in Ghidra, disassemble it to find out how the ski jumping works, and optimize based on the discovered mechanics.
As it turned out, each step of this plan was way more involved than anticipated, and created more questions along the way that demanded answers, opening up a rabbit hole of early 90s video game development intricasies.
This write-up will take you along on this ride of discovery, learning about how DOS-based programs worked, how video video game developers worked around the hardware limitations, how early copy protection worked, and how GOG sells you a broken version of the game (as of March 2025).</p>

<h2 id="taking-stock---version-chaos-and-copy-protection-circumvention">Taking stock - version chaos and copy protection circumvention</h2>

<p>The game has had multiple releases, including the original release in 1991, two bundle releases with its successor “Summer Challenge” in 1992 (Europe) and 1996 (US), and a GOG release of the bundle in 2020, based on DOS emulation through <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>.
While the original floppy disks from my childhood are likely buried somewhere, they are of limited use today for lack of a floppy drive to read them with, so I searched the internet for the game.
Acquiring these different versions wasn’t too difficult thanks to the Internet Archive hosting various versions of the original media, and of course purchasing it from GOG.</p>

<p>The original game used a code wheel for copy protection.
Code wheels were a typical copy protection of the time: They are a physical set of disks sliding against each other, which you got together with the floppy disks containing the game.
At startup, the game asks you to turn them in a specific configuration, which reveals a code you need to enter into the game for it to work.
For those who are not old like me and have never seen a code wheel before, there is an <a href="https://www.oldgames.sk/codewheel/games-winter-challenge">interactive online version</a> of this game’s code wheel available.</p>

<p>The original 1991 release as expected asks for this code when you try to play any discipline, and boots you out if you answer incorrectly twice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigation 1:</strong> how is the code wheel check implemented?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/winter_code_wheel_input.png" alt="Screen shot of the code wheel input in-game"></p>

<p>The GOG version does not ask you for the code and lets you play without it, so presumably they have removed the copy protection from it instead of distributing the code wheel.
Where it get very insteresting is that multiple people are complaining in the discussion of this game on GOG that the game is “improperly cracked” and doesn’t work correctly as a result.
The descriptions of some of the behaviors, like that you can’t land a ski jump beyond a certain distance, or that you always crash in the last lap of speed skating, actually resonated with my recollection of playing the game as a kid, which means either we had a poorly cracked version back then as well, or that this is not related to copy protection at all and the game is just buggy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigation 2:</strong> Are there hidden copy protection measures which affect gameplay?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 1996 US release actually comes with a separate crack, presumably officially sanctioned: Next to the main <code>WINTER.EXE</code>, it has a <code>WINTER.COM</code>, only 879 bytes in size, which when executed removes the code wheel check from the game, otherwise the game still asks for it.</p>

<p>But the version confusion doesn’t end there.
While searching for different versions, I also found other versions of the game, often in the form of online playable images loaded in DOSBox in the browser.
None of these needed a code wheel, and while some were based on the 1996 US release, others used entirely different cracks, created by different release groups of the early 90s.</p>

<p>And to complete the mess, the original game actually offers an option to install the game to disk instead of playing it from floppy, including its very own set of mysteries.
The installation does not work like you might expect, just copying files from floppy to disk; instead, it actually creates a whole new <code>WINTER.EXE</code> executable each time.
During installation, you can choose different options, including which graphics modes to support, and a “fast loading” mode which according to the manual makes the game load faster at the cost of additional hard drive space, and each combination of the options creates a different executable for you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigaton 3:</strong> How are these different versions of the executable being created, and how do they differ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So taking stock and comparing all different acquired versions, there are a lot of distinct binaries:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The original floppy version of the game</li>
  <li>Six different versions of the game when installed to hard disk, for each combination of “fast loading” and either or both of the EGA and VGA graphics modes</li>
  <li>The GOG version of the game, which is based on the installed VGA+EGA fast-load version with individual bytes modified</li>
  <li>A cracked binary of unknown origin, which is based on the installed VGA fast-load version with individual bytes modified</li>
</ol>

<p>Furthermore, there are three different stand-alone cracks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The official <code>WINTER.COM</code> crack (879 bytes) which was provided with the 1996 US release alongside an unmodified floppy version</li>
  <li>A <code>WG.COM</code> crack (366 bytes) by release group “The Humble Guys” from October 17, 1991, within days after the game’s release</li>
  <li>A <code>WINTER.COM</code> crack (291 bytes) by release group “Razor1911” from October 17, 1991, the same day(!) as the other crack</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

<h2 id="cracking-the-binary-open---obfuscation-and-memory-constraints">Cracking the binary open - obfuscation and memory constraints</h2>

<p>So to start somewhere, I loaded up the floppy version in Ghidra, and was immediately underwhelmed. It only managed to analyze a tiny fraction of the inital code, with most of it remaining binary blobs.
Opening the same file in IDA revealed much of the same picture, but IDA also provided accompanying warnings: It thinks the binary may be packed, and there are lots of unused bytes beyond the end of the code.
I figured that the binary must be packed or obfuscated in some way, and the tiny bit of initial code is the routine to unpack the rest of the binary.</p>

<p>So I began reverse-engineering the unpacking routine, and discovered a suspicious string in the binary, nestled between the assembly: <strong>*FAB*</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/FAB.png" alt="A calling card left by Fabrice Bellard"></p>

<p>As it turns out, “FAB” stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrice_Bellard">Fabrice Bellard</a>, who next to being the original developer of widely used programs such as FFmpeg and QEMU, is also the creator of an executable compression utility called <a href="https://bellard.org/lzexe.html">LZEXE</a>, developed in 1990.
Luckily, the inner workings of LZEXE are widely documented and understood.
I won’t go into the details of how the compression works here, there are great existing write-ups by <a href="https://cosmodoc.org/topics/lzexe/">Scott Smitelli</a> and <a href="https://www.lodsb.com/reversing-lz91-from-commander-keen">Sam Russell</a> if you want to dig deeper.
We just want to unpack the binary to get to the good stuff, and there are plenty existing unpacking utilities available, including UNLZEXE by Mitugu Kurizono from the same era.
The packing and unpacking is its own arms race microcosm, with protectors to prevent the unpacking, and more sophisticated unpackers to do it anyway, but luckily no additional unpacking protections were employed for this game.</p>

<p>The resulting unpacked binary has two surprises right off the bat: Firstly it is only 168kB in size, much smaller than the original executable despite extraction presumably making it grow in size, and secondly the result of unpacking it is identical across all different versions of the game.
This gives us a hint for how the game is structured: It contains a chunk of business logic, which is what we have unpacked and is the same across versions, and then it contains some resrouces, like sprites and sounds, which are included into the executable file and loaded out of it at runtime.
This assumption is supported by the fact that the extracted binary actually still works properly as long as it is placed beside the original <code>WINTER.EXE</code> binary to load the assets out of.</p>

<p>But it also is somewhat surprising for the two cracked versions of the binary, I would have expected those to contain modified business logic in order to facilitate skipping the code wheel check.
The answer to that mystery becomes apparent quickly after opening the new extracted binary in a disassembler.
By looking around some, we find suspicious interrupt calls to <code>int 3fh</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/int3fh.png" alt="Instances of a mysterious interrupt 3fh"></p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="side-bar-interrupts">Side bar: Interrupts</h3>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">Interrupts</a> are the main way DOS programs used to communicate with the operating system, analogous to today’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">syscalls</a>.
Whenever a program wants to interact with something outside it’s own code, it would call an interrupt and ask DOS to perform that task for it, handing back control to the operating system temporarily, and resuming when it is complete.
Anything from printing text to the screen, reading and writing files from disk, to allocating heap memory, is done through the main interrupt DOS provides, <code>int 21h</code>.
Which action is requested and any arguments are determined by the value of the CPU registers when the interrupt is called.
Other interrupts exist like <code>int 33h</code> for mouse interactions, but notably <code>int 3fh</code> is not one of the DOS-provided interrupts.
Under the hood, the routing of interrupts is handled by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_vector_table">interrupt vector table</a>, which contain for each interrupt the address of the routine that is executed from when the interrupt is called.
Programs can modify this table (using an interrupt) to add their own custom interrupts, and <code>int 3fh</code> is likely used-defined this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IDA provides a helpful comment to these, that this interrupt is typically used for calling an “Overlay manager”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="side-bar-overlays">Side bar: Overlays</h3>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_(programming)">Overlaying</a> is a technique for loading additional pieces of code at runtime, where multiple such pieces, called overlays, can be swapped out in the same place in memory.
This was useful in programs of the time to save on RAM usage: DOS only allowed a maximum of 640kB of memory to be used by a program (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_memory">Conventional memory</a>), and large applications might themselves already be too big to fit all their code into that limit, not even considering any data.
Overlays are used to circumvent this limitation: By breaking the program code up into multiple overlays, the program only needs to load whatever overlay is needed for the current operation into memory.
Other overlays are loaded from disk as they are needed, replacing the previous overlay, allowing the program to have complex functionality with a small memory footprint.
Loading and managing overlays was the responsibility of an overlay manager, a library which kept track of which overlays are needed when and loaded and unloaded them accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As it turns out, the game was written in C and compiled with the Microsoft C compiler version 6, as hinted by an embedded string <code>MS Run-Time Library - Copyright (c) 1990, Microsoft Corp</code> in the binary.
Perusing the compiler’s manual, the linker of that compiler did natively support overlays and would install its own overlay manager as <code>int 3fh</code> by default, so this was my first suspicion for how this structure was created.</p>

<p>Overall, this was not good news.
It means that the unpacked binary is in fact not all the business logic that exists, and there are more pieces of code, presumably in the resources packaged with the executable.
Disassemblers don’t understand these overlays, can’t detect them or automatically disassemble them, so the work to understand the business logic will be more manual than planned.
In order to progress further, we need to find and extract all these overlays, to get a complete picture of the game’s code.</p>

<p>By finding where the interrupt 3fh is installed at the start of the program, we can identfy the overlay manager routine which is called each time an overlay is needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/int3f_initialization.png" alt="Installing the int3fh"></p>

<p>Based on documentation for how Microsoft’s overlay manager worked, each interrupt call is followed by 3 bytes, one byte for the index number of the overlay that is needed, and two for the 16-bit address within that overlay.
Calling the interrupt then works like a function call: The overlay is loaded, the function at the given address is invoked, and afterwards the control flow returns directly after the interrupt call.
In fact the interrupts are literal replacements for function calls: a the 5 bytes typically needed for a far call instruction (1 byte opcode, 2 bytes address offset, 2 bytes address segment) are replaced by the Linker with the 5 bytes for the interrupt (2 bytes opcode, 1 byte overlay index, 2 bytes address offset) where needed.</p>

<p>This is where the good news ended though.
According to the documentation, each overlay should be appended to the main program, including its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_MZ_executable">MZ header</a>, but this is not what we find in our binary.
Worse still, when using DOSBox’ debugger to step through an invocation of the interrupt, the code that was loaded is nowhere to be found in the binary file.
Also, unlike typical overlays, they are not actually occupying the same space in memory, instead new memory is dynamically allocated for each overlay, and deallocated after use.
That is useful because it allows multiple overlays to be loaded at the same time, but also means this game is not actually using the overlay mechanism from Microsoft C, instead it uses what appears to be a bespoke overlay management implementation.</p>



<p>Statically reverse-engineering the overlay manager routine turned out to be a very time-consuming endeavor, but luckily there were still some hints that can help us take some shortcuts.
The DOS emulator <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/">DOSBox-X</a> is a fork of DOSBox, and has additional useful debugging features, including logging of all file IO, and all <code>int 21h</code> interrupts.
Watching those while the game starts up reveals that the game is seeking through the binary to specific locations, which happen to be directly after the bytes of the main program, and then reading many chunks of 22 bytes each.</p>

<p>These are likely the start of the resources, and when checking the binary at that location we find that the secion begins with two bytes spelling out <code>MB</code>, similar to how the executables themselves start with an <code>MZ</code> magic number.
Looking for this magic number in the disassembly brings us directly to the routine which parses out the structure of the embedded resources.</p>

  <h3 id="sidebar-16-bit-architecture-and-segments">Sidebar: 16-bit architecture and segments</h3>

  <p>This program, and all DOS programs at the time, were built for a 16-bit architecture, compared to the 64-bit architecture today’s computers are using.
What that means is that all registers in the CPU can hold only 16-bit values, including any pointers.
Since 16-bit registers can only have 2^16 = 65536 different values, it can only address 64kB of memory.
This was too little, even back then, so in order to be able to address more memory, pointers typically consisted of 2 parts, a segment and an offset.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_segmentation">Segments</a> are chunks of memory, at most 64kB in size, which were typically assigned different roles: there are typically one or multiple code segments holding the program code, a data segment holding the work memory for any data the program stores, and a stack segment to hold the values which are put on the stack.
Those segments can be considered independent parts of the memory, and to interact with something from another segment, you would need a far pointer, consisting of both a segment and offset within that segment, whereas for referencing something within a segment a near pointer using only the offset is sufficient.</p>

  <p>Under the hood, the memory is still one linear chunk, and the resulting memory address of a far pointer is simply <code>segment * 16 + offset</code>.
That means segments can technically overlap with different segment-offset pairs pointing to the same physical address, but conventionally they were chosen to be distinct blocks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The resources are all tabulated in a simple header structure, in entries of 22 bytes each.
Each entry contains two 4-byte numbers, indicating the length of the data and the offset in the file where they are located.
The remaining bytes contains a 0-terminated string spelling out the name of the resource (any byte after the 0 terminator is garbage).
However, this name is obfuscated by adding <code>0x60</code> to all bytes, so they don’t show up in any strings analysis of the binary.
By de-obfuscating the names, we can learn that these additional binary blobs contain both the assets like images, meshes, music and SFX files, and the code overlays in the form of pairs of files with extensions <code>COD</code> and <code>REL</code>.</p>

<p>One fun pattern to observe is that the garbage data after the file names are leftovers from the previous name, suggesting that when the entries were written, it used the same buffer for all names in order.</p>

<p>Just from the names, we can assume that the <code>COD</code> files contain the actual machine code, and the <code>REL</code> files contain some relocation data.</p>

<blockquote>
  

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_(computing)">Relocation</a> is a concept that allows code to become location-independent: When a program is loaded into memory, it may not be loaded at the same address every time.
However, parts of the program refer to other parts by address (e.g. a function call), and in order for those to continue to work regardless of the actual location in memory, they need to be modified.
To achieve this, all addresses are written into the binary as if the program is located at memory address 0, and all the places which correspond to segment values are put in a long list called the relocation table.
For the main program, this is handled by DOS: the MZ header of the executable contains a relocation table with addresses in the code that need to be updated.
After copying the program into memory at some offset, DOS goes through this list and adds the chosen offset to each of the addresses it contains, making all far pointers point to the correct locations again.</p>

  <p>When loading these code overlays, the same problem of relocation will exist, and the <code>REL</code> files likely contain the needed information to facilitate their proper relocation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When looking at the different versions of the installed game, we can see that the resources they are bundled with are indeed different.
This finally resolves the first of our side mysteries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigaton 3 complete!</strong>
Depending on the chosen graphics mode, more or fewer assets are included, and each asset can come in two variants, the uncompressed version (e.g. <code>TITLE.MGS</code>), and a compressed version (e.g. <code>TITLE.PMG</code>), indicated by prepending a <code>P</code> to its extension.
The “fast loading” versions of the installation bundle the uncompressed resources, while the floppy version contains the packed versions, providing a trade-off between speed of loading the assets at runtime and the size they take up on disk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s difficult to imagine nowadays, but hard drive space was a serious concern back then, and the additional kilobytes the unpacked asstes take up could matter a lot.</p>

<p>However, it seems that even in the fast-loading versions, not all assets are actually uncompressed.
Specifically some of the code overlays stay packed even there, presumably as a means to keep them obfuscated even when fast loading is selected during installation.
However, through disassembly we already know where the resources are loaded now, so using a debugger with appropriate breakpoints, we can easily dump the uncompressed versions for these as well out of the program memory, without needing to understand how the compression of the resources actually works.
(If you are still curious how the compression works, I did end up disassembling it to find that it’s a surprisingly sophisticated custom variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate">DEFLATE</a> compression.
You can find a JS re-implementation of it <a href="https://github.com/MrWint/winter/blob/70da5ba230a2161955d2fb9094f3d47bdea46026/patcher/patcher.js#L79">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Conveniently, the game also provides us with a fairly easy way to check whether we extracted all the resources correctly.
It turns out the game is more flexible with where it tries to load the resources from, and not only checks the embedded resources in the binary, but also checks for individual files of the same name, in the root folder or a subfolder called “ART”.
As long as the resource can be found in any of these places, it will use it.
So by writing a program to extract all these recources into their own files and placing them in the ART subfolder, and then manually modifying the binary to delete all embedded resources, we can make the game use our extracted assets instead.
Doing this and running the game, it is indeed still working, confirming that our extracted resources are accurate and we’re not missing anything else coming from the binary file.</p>

<h2 id="combining-all-overlays">Combining all overlays</h2>

<p>So now we finally have all the code comprising the business logic of the game, but they are spread out over 17 files, the main executable and 16 overlays, making them very annoying to work with.
What we would like is one single binary with all the code in it, making it much easier to analyze.
To achieve this, we can try to embed the overlays into the binary, essentially undoing the overlaying and having all of them loaded at once side-by-side.
Even more, doing this allows us to undo the replacement of the function calls with overlay interrupts, eliminating <code>int 3fh</code> altogether and making the automatic analysis by common disassemblers much more accurate.
Available RAM is obviously not a concern anymore today, but we will still need to stay within the 640kB limit DOS imposes.
Luckily, all overlays combined are only around 100kB in size, so together with the main binary of 168kB it should still leave enough room to load the assets as needed, especially since it won’t need to reserve heap space anymore loading the overlays.</p>

<p>Actually fusing the binaries together is not that easy unfortunately.
My first idea of just concatenating all overlays onto the main binary in memory and baking in the relocations to make them all connect sadly wouldn’t work, because of the stack and how dynamic memory allocations work.
The main binary is set up in a way where all code segments come first, then the data segment holding all the work memory the program uses, and lastly the stack segment.
Trying to append the overlays to this will always create some issues: Adding them before the data segment would mean we need to re-write all references to it throughout the code, which are hard to identify because the line between the data and stack areas are fuzzy and the code might do some pointer arithmetic that relies on the relative positions of the segments.
Adding the overlays after data segment by moving the stack back is also impossible, because the game does some weird shenanigans where it sets the stack segment to equal the data segment, adjusting the stack pointer accordingly to compensate.
This is probably useful as an invariant for optimization, but also means that the data and stack segments need to be close together in memory to allow that.
And finally, placing it after the stack, where they are typically loaded using the overlay manager, has problems as well because it would conflict with heap allocations.</p>

<blockquote>
  

  <p>Memory management worked completely differently back in the DOS days compared to now.
While modern operating systems all work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a> where each program has its own address space completely to itself, and the operating system translates them to the physical RAM addresses, DOS programs ran in what is called 16-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode">Real Mode</a>, which uses the actual physical addresses directly.
That means programs had direct control over the entire RAM of the system, and could just read and write to it as they pleased.
This worked, mostly because you could only run one DOS program at a time anyway, so they didn’t need to share memory with others.</p>

  <p>So allocating memory really didn’t mean much since it was all yours anyway, and programs typically started out with “owning” the entire memory space.
DOS still provided an allocator, but in order to use it your program first needed to deallocate some of the memory space and give it back to DOS, so that new blocks can be allocated in this space.
This game does this, and in order to determine how much it can free up, it performs some calcuations based on the addresses it happens to be loaded into.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So by just appending the overlays, we would interfere with the allocated memory, and while we could try to patch the program to avoid this, it may cause other unexpected side effects.</p>

<p>The solution to this conundrum, as always obvious only in hindsight, is to not add the overlays after the main program, but before it.
Since programs are created to be location-independent and can work anywhere in memory, moving it back in order to make space for the overlays can be done completely safely.
And since the overlays are normally heap allocated and can be anywhere in relation to the main program, there is no reason why that anywhere couldn’t be also before the main program.</p>

<p>To test this concept, I first created a new binary which only padded out the beginning of the binary by the needed amount without actually placing the overlays into it.
This can be done without needing to disassemble its contents at all, just using the relocation information in the MZ header to identify all the places where addresses need to be adjusted, and updating the header information to push the segments backwards.
The resulting binary still works perfectly, proving not only that the concept works, but also that the remaining memory is sufficient for everything else the game still needs to load.</p>

<p>In a second step, we can now place all the overlay code in the newly available space, and wire it up.
For each call of the <code>int 3fh</code> interrupt, we can extract which overlay and which location in the overlay it would normally go to, and replace it with a direct <code>far call</code> to that address in the now-embedded overlays.</p>

<p>The overlays themselves also need to be adjusted using their relocation information, with a small additional caveat: within the overlays there are two types of relocations, the addresses that point back into the main program, and the addresses which point to other areas within the same overlay.
The game contains special logic to handle both cases when it loads the overlays, which we need to replicate here, by checking which area of memory an address points to before applying the relocations.</p>

<p>We also need to append all the relocation information for the overlays to the relocation table of the main program, because the new combined binary can of course still be loaded into memory at any location, so the addresses need to be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>What we end up with is a completely self-contained binary, which does not need to load any more overlays to work, and which doesn’t contain any overlay interrupts anymore.
Together with the extracted art assets in separate files, we now have an unpacked and unobfuscated, still perfactly playable, version of the game.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that this was not guaranteed to actually work.
Replacing the overlay interrupts with function calls has the same behavior, but the overlay manager itself which is now sidestepped has additional side effects which could be critical for the game to work.
One notable instance of this in the game is the logic it uses to unload overlays: To detect which memory addresses to deallocate, it inspects the actual code of the program, parses the interrupt call opcodes, and extracts the information out of it in order to determine which overlay is affected.</p>

<div><pre><code>seg000:D91F maybe_unload_overlay_for_call:
seg000:D91F                 push    bp                      ; save base pointer register on the stack, to restore it later
seg000:D920                 mov     bp, sp                  ; set base pointer to current stack pointer. This means all arguments are some fixed offset from bp
seg000:D922                 les     bx, [bp+6]              ; Read the far pointer that was provided as an argument, and store it in es:bx
seg000:D925                 cmp     byte ptr es:[bx], 0CDh  ; Check if at the given address is a CD byte, which is an int instruction
seg000:D929                 jz      short unload            ; if it is any int instruction, proceed (doesn't check what interrupt it actually is)
seg000:D92B                 jmp     short skip_unloading
seg000:D92D ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
seg000:D92D unload:
seg000:D92D                 mov     bl, es:[bx+2]           ; Read the overlay index following the int instruction to know which overlay to unload
seg000:D931                 call    unload_overlay          ; unload the overlay
seg000:D934
seg000:D934 skip_unloading:
seg000:D934                 pop     bp                      ; restore the base pointer stored at the start of the function
seg000:D935                 retf
</code></pre></div>

<p>Luckily, the game has built-in fallbacks to skip this step if the code locations don’t actually contain an interrupt but instead a far call.
Presumably, because it was not known ahead of time which pieces of code would end up in which overlay, they couldn’t know for sure which calls would end up being interrupts instead so they needed to handle both cases.
For us this is lucky because it means that even after replacing all interrupts with function calls, the overlay management code can handle it correctly and doesn’t try to unload our baked-in overlays.</p>

<h2 id="the-anti-debugger-check---part-1-obfuscation-and-assembly-trickery">The anti-debugger check - Part 1: obfuscation and assembly trickery</h2>

<p>With all the prep work done, we can now take a look at the inner workings of the game in earnest, starting with looking at the copy protection and the claims of improperly cracked versions causing gameplay issues.
Besides the main code wheel protection, the game actually has another defense mechanism, an anti-debugger check.
That anti-debugger check consists of two parts.</p>

<p>The first and simplest one is that the game checks for the existence of known debuggers in its path.
It tries to open three files with the file names <code>NU-MEGA</code>, <code>SOFTICE1</code> and <code>TDHDEBUG</code>, and if any of these exist, the game will not let you get past the main menu.
As you might guess, these names correspond to popular DOS-based debuggers, so if it detects you are using any of these, it will refuse operation.
The names of these files is obfuscated in the code using the xor operation, similar to the resource file names, and the check is buried inbetween other code initializing the intro sequence, but by logging the file IO the program performs they are easy to spot.</p>

seg010:0054                 add     [bp+4], 6       ; The magic happens here: Because of the modified bp, this doesn't modify the argument, but the return address of the function

seg010:0059                 retn                    ; because of the changed return address, it will skip the instructions at seg010:000E and seg010:0011 after returning!

<p>This is a <strong>very misleading</strong> piece of code that would make any malware developer jealous.
At first glance, it appears to read the current time and process it, and then write a constant <code>4A52h</code> to register cx and later into <code>debugger_check_result_4E62A</code>.
However, the <code>process_current_time_result</code> does some weird things instead.
For one, most of the operations (I marked them with question marks) don’t actually contribute anything, they are purely there to confuse you.
The operation that actually matters and is trying to hide is the modification of the base pointer at <code>seg010:003F</code>.
This, in combination with the instruction at <code>seg010:0054</code>, modify the return address of the function, increasing it by 6.
This means instead of returning at <code>seg010:000E</code> like it should, it will instead return at <code>seg010:0014</code>, skipping setting cx to the constant value.
So the value that is actually propagated into <code>debugger_check_result_4E62A</code> is the <code>detected_debugger_binary</code> which was loaded into cx, all the other operations are just misdirection.</p>

<p>This kind of misdirection is clearly intended to make disassembly deliberately harder and stop people from reverse engineering the copy protections.
We will see more of it as we move on.</p>

<h2 id="the-anti-debugger-check---part-2-modern-computers-are-too-fast">The anti-debugger check - Part 2: Modern computers are too fast</h2>

<p>The debugger check result flag is moved around two more times:</p>

seg011:0040                 mov     bx, seg segment_39
seg011:0043                 mov     es, bx
seg011:0045                 mov     es:debugger_check_result_47A70, al
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>and finally</p>

<div><pre><code>...
seg000:0355                 mov     al, es:debugger_check_result_47A70
seg000:0359                 sub     ah, ah
seg000:035B                 mov     debugger_check_result, ax
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>These two moves are the second debugger check the game does, which is more technical and based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8253">Intel 8253</a> timer chip.</p>

<p>The first move is performed inside a timer interrupt handler which the game installs, and which is triggered by the aforementioned timer chip.
Later during the initialization, the game then runs the second move of the flag to its final location, which is ultimately the one that is checked to decide whether you passed or failed.
That means that this timer interrupt is expected to be triggered at the right moment, after the initial known debugger check has been performed, but before the value is looked up later during initialization.
If the timer is triggered too early or too late with respect to the initialization, the the check won’t pass.
This check would prevent you from stepping through the initialization code, because the timer interrupt will fire too early, or emulate it in some way that doesn’t consider hardware interrupts.</p>

<p>For modern DOS emulators like DOSBox, this is not a problem and they are accurate enough to be able to pass the check easily.
The main issue arises from modern computers being <em>too fast</em>: if your emulation speed is too high, especially if you use the fast-loading version of the game, it breezes through the initialization so fast that it is done before the timer interrupt could trigger, making you fail the check.
The simple solution to this problem therefore is to slow down the emulator before starting the game.
After it is in the main menu, you can speed it up again without adverse effects.
Especially our home-cooked fully unpacked version loads so blazingly fast, that I need to slow down the emulator to a crawl in order to still pass the check.
This is because unpacking the resources from the executable is itself much slower than loading individual files, even if they are not compressed, because it needs to linearly scan through the whole resource list for every resource, whereas the (emulated) file IO takes no time at all.</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Slowing down the emulator each time to pass the check gets annoying quickly though.
Luckily, the debugger check is done in a single place, and is easily removed without any adverse effects, by modifying the conditional jump at <code>seg000:0D47</code> to be an unconditional jump instead.
We have now partially cracked the game, hurray!
That was the appetizer though, the main course is still to come and it’s a doozy.</p>

<h2 id="the-code-wheel-check---a-honey-pot-for-crackers">The code wheel check - A honey pot for crackers</h2>

<p>The code wheel protection is in principle less technical and more straight-forward: The game reads the number you enter, it then looks up what the answer should have been, and checks whether they match.
Thanks to our fully unpacked executable, finding where this check is made is as simple as finding the error message (“That ticket number is incorrect.  Try again.”) in the binary, and looking for references to it, places in the code where it is used.
Placing debugger breakpoints on this function and stepping through it lets us identfy which sections are roughly responsible for which parts of the process.</p>

<p>Through this process, we can identify the heart of the protection: a function which takes the randomly generated code wheel configuration and the entered ticket number as an input, and decides whether it was entered correctly or not.
It doesn’t do any assembly trickery, but it contains some unnecessary operations as misdirection.
We can translate it to some more compact pseudo code:</p>

<div><pre><code>code_wheel_check_answer(city_index, flag_index, country_index, discipline_index, ticket_number):  # at seg007:0260
    # determine how high the slot cutout for the chosen city is on the inner wheel, values 0(innermost) - 5(outermost)
    slot_height = slot_height_table[city_index]
    code_wheel_ticket_number_4A890 = ticket_number

    # determine slot position relative to chosen discipline, values 0-11 clockwise
    slot_position = (city - ((city + 1) &gt;&gt; 2)) - discipline_index
    code_wheel_ticket_number_4A892 = ticket_number
    if slot_position &lt; 0:
        slot_position += 12

    # determine which sector of the outer wheel is under the slot
    flag_wheel_sector = (flag_index + slot_position) % 12
    code_wheel_ticket_number_4A894 = ticket_number

    # do unnecessary operations as misdirection
    rand = random_number()
    alloc = allocate_memory(rand % 1000)
    deallocate_memory(alloc)

    # determine which sector of the middle wheel is under the slot
    country_wheel_sector = (country_index + slot_position) % 12

    # read expected answer from obfuscated table
    obfuscated_ticket = country_wheel_data[country_wheel_sector * 6 + slot_height]
    code_wheel_ticket_number_4A898 = ticket_number
    if obfuscated_ticket == 0xa283:  # hole in the middle wheel, use outer wheel data instead
        obfuscated_ticket = flag_wheel_data[flag_wheel_sector * 6 + slot_height]

    code_wheel_ticket_number_4A89C = ticket_number
    return ticket_number ^ 0xa283 == obfuscated_ticket
</code></pre></div>

<p>Apart from the random memory allocation and deallocation providing some red herrings, the actual checking logic is fairly straight-forward and directly simulates how the physical code wheel functions.
It considers how the discs are rotated, and then checks which number will be visible on the wheel based on a table of all the possible answers.</p>

<p>But besides the immediate check, it also places the ticket number into 5 different places in memory.
Those 5 memory locations are where it gets interesting, because looking at where they are used, they all re-appear in the same location:</p>

<p>In this code snippet, the 5 copies of the ticket number are modified in various ways to create 6 new values derived from it, with some arbitrary opertaions to make them all different.
Each of these six values is used some specific place elsewhere in the code, where it is compared against some reference value.
If we try to find out where those reference values come from, what we find it a second copy of the code wheel answer checking routine from above, complete with a second instance of the table containing all correct answers!
The only difference between the two is that is uses a different value to xor the ticket numbers with, using <code>0xc514</code> instead of <code>0xa283</code>.
Afterwards, the same arbitrary operations are applied to them to create the 6 reference values.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigaton 2 complete!</strong></p>

  <p>The hidden copy protection checks are real!
The game performs more hidden code wheel checks throughout the game, in each of these 6 locations.
If the main code wheel check is merely skipped, these hidden checks will fail and the game knows you tried to circumvent the copy protection.
When that happens, it will mess with the game in more subtle ways, to sabotage your illegitimate play session.
This is a sneaky additional layer of copy protection, where if you try to crack the game and remove the obvious checks, you might not even realize these additional checks exist, unless you pick up on the gameplay alterations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To find out what gameplay alterations the game performs when the checks fail, the easiest way is to set breakpoints at each of these locations, and then play the various disciplines waiting for them to trigger.
This lets us easily discover what each of the hidden checks do.</p>

<p>Even better, thanks to the replay feature, we can record a replay with a proper version, and then play it back in a version where the hidden checks activate, in order to see what difference they make on the same set of inputs.</p>

<h3 id="ski-jump">Ski Jump</h3>

<p>One of the most obvious changes we find in the skip jump event: When the copy protection check fails, any attempt land a ski jump beyond a certain distance fails.
More specifically, beyond a distance of 86.7m, the game won’t recognize you pressing Enter to land your jump anymore:</p>

<p>In Biathlon, the copy protection check happens during the shooting sections.
If the check fails, it will move your shot by a random amount to the top right, on the second and fourth target in each segment:</p>

<p>The alteration in the Bobsled event is probably the most subtle.
When the copy protection check fails, after the first couple of turns, the physics change to give you more drag, slowing you down more than usual:</p>

<h3 id="luge">Luge</h3>

<p>The last of the copy protection checks is the most drastic.
During the Luge event, if you are close to the end of the track with a time of below 57.7s, the game just instantly forfeits your run, preventing you from finishing it:</p>

<p>Now that we know what a failed copy protection check looks like, we can check each of the  game versions and cracks we found to see whether they work correctly.</p>

<p>As it turns out, <strong>ALL OF THEM, except for one, FAIL THE COPY PROTECTION CHECK!
That includes even the official releases: Both the 1996 US release and the 2020 GOG release are broken.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s take a look under the hood of each of them and see what they do</p>

<h3 id="the-gog-version-2020">The GOG version (2020)</h3>

<p>The GOG version comes with a pre-patched binary, which is based on the installed VGA+EGA fast-load version of the original 1991 release.
When looking for what has been changed, beside a couple of padding bytes that do nothing, there are only 2 bytes that are different:</p>

<p>The first is at position 0x12bcdd in the file, which corresponds to offset 0xd47 in overlay 1.
That is the location of the debugger check, and if does the exact same modification we did above ourselves: it changes the jump instruction from a conditional <code>je</code> (0x74) to an unconditional <code>jmp</code> (0xeb), skipping the debugger check.</p>

<p>The other modification is similarly simple and happens at position 0x12bca4 in the file, which corresponds to offset 0xd0e in overlay 1.
This is where the code wheel check is started from, and it replaces the initial <code>cmp</code> opcode (0x83) with a simple <code>retn</code> opcode (0xc3), returning immediately and skipping the code wheel check.</p>

<p>But as we saw, simply skipping the code wheel will trigger the hidden copy protection checks, and the GOG version makes no attempt to circumvent these, causing the game to be broken.</p>

<h3 id="the-unknown-cracked-version">The unknown cracked version</h3>

<p>The second of the pre-patched binaries we found, is based on the VGA fast-load version instead.
It has only one meaningfully change compared to the original.
At position 0x122b42, which corresponds to offset 0x406 in overlay 1, it replaces a <code>call</code> instruction with <code>nop</code>s (0x90).
That function is the one leading to the code wheel check, so it is very similar to the GOG version, it just skips the function entirely instead of calling it and then immediately returning from it.
The effects are of course also the same: It trips the hidden copy protections and the game behavior is broken.</p>

<h3 id="the-the-humble-guys-crack-1991">The “The Humble Guys” crack (1991)</h3>

<p>Instead of a pre-patched binary, this crack comes in the form of a program <code>WG.COM</code> which you run separately before the main executable.
It’s only 366 bytes in size, and when we disassemble it we see this (with some unimportant parts omitted):</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The crack works by overriding interrupt handlers and injecting its own code into them.
It first overrides the main DOS interrupt <code>int 21h</code>, and looks for a specfic interrupt the game triggers during initialization, at which point it overrides the overlay manager interrupt <code>int 3fh</code> as well.
The reason it needs to do this in two steps is that the <code>int 3fh</code> interrupt is only installed during runtime, so it can only be overridden afterwards.
Why it is looking for that specific random interrupt is beyond me, since there were way more obvious targets, like the interrupt that actually installs the <code>int 3fh</code> handler.</p>

<p>In the overlay manager interrupt, it then looks for one very specific invocation, by checking the register values and return address.
That specific invocation happens from offset 0xd26 in overlay 1, where it tries to load and perform the code wheel check.
When it finds this interrupt, it will simply skip executing it, effectively skipping the code wheel check.</p>

<p>This has essentially the same effect as the modifications from the pre-patched binaries above.
It notably also trips the hidden copy protections and breaks the game.</p>

<p>The opcodes are different, but the check that is performed is exactly the same as the one as in the “The Humble Guys” crack.
It checks the same register state, and it even uses the same weirdly specific <code>int 21h</code> invocation to install the overlay manager shim.</p>

<p>If I were to guess, I’d say someone has taken some “inspiration” from the “The Humble Guys” crack when creating this version.
It’s also just shoddily bolted together, with snippets of unused code everywhere.
It looks like someone repurposed some other similarly structured crack, and insterted the specifics of the “The Humble Guys” crack into it to make it work for this game.</p>

<p>It of course therefore also has the same problem: it trips the hidden copy protections and the game is broken.</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The basic mechanism is the same as in the other two cracks: it injects its own code into the <code>int 21h</code> and <code>int 3fh</code> interrupt handlers.
But the logic it performs in the <code>int 3fh</code> shim is slightly more complicated, and makes 5 individual modifications.</p>

<p>The first one skips the check for known debuggers which we looked at before, simply skipping its execution.
The second case is for the main anti-debugger check, hooking the interrupt that is called after it is failed and instead skipping over it back to the success case.</p>

<p>The remaining three all deal with the code wheel check.
The third case hooks the interrupt that is called when the code wheel dialog is being opened, and sets <code>si</code> to 1 which will simulate confirming the dialog instantly.
The fourth case is just a helper, it hooks the next interrupt after the dialog is closed, and overrides two bytes at the end of the routine that checks the provided input to inject an artificial <code>int 3f</code> instruction there.
This is not actually a valid overlay interrupt, it is only used as a place for the fifth case to hook into, because there are no other interrupts to hook into in that function.</p>

<p>So finally, the last case is where the code wheel check is actually defeated.
It hooks at the end of the input checking routine, after the game has computed the expected result to compare the input against, and it overrides all 5 copies of the ticket number with the correct value the game expects, then pretends the comparison was successful.
This way, the code wheel check succeeds, and all the hidden code wheel checks the game will perform later will also work because the correct value has been written everywhere.</p>

<p>With this, the game’s copy protection is completely defeated, with no adverse effects during gameplay.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigaton 4 complete!</strong></p>

<h2 id="help-i-have-a-broken-version-of-the-game">Help, I have a broken version of the game!</h2>

<p>In case you have bought this game from GOG or have one of the many other broken versions out there, I have created a <a href="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/patcher/index.html">tool to fix the game for you</a>.
You can use the tool to patch your binary to remove the hidden copy protection checks (as well as the debugger and code wheel checks themselves in case they are not removed already), so you can enjoy this game without any limitations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion---what-about-creating-the-perfect-ski-jump">Conclusion - What about creating the perfect ski jump?</h2>

<p>My original goal was to deconstruct the game mechanics, specifically for the ski jumping event, but that quest got so thoroughly side-tracked by all the copy protection related investigations that it moved somewhat into the background.
Now that the copy protection mysteries are solved, I will be able to focus on that, and it will likely end up being its own write-up.</p>

<p dir="auto">Still WIP and in very early stage. A tutorial on LLM serving using MLX for system engineers. The codebase
is solely (almost!) based on MLX array/matrix APIs without any high-level neural network APIs, so that we
can build the model serving infrastructure from scratch and dig into the optimizations.</p>
<p dir="auto">The goal is to learn the techniques behind efficiently serving a large language model (i.e., Qwen2 models).</p>
<p dir="auto">Why MLX: nowadays it's easier to get a macOS-based local development environment than setting up an NVIDIA GPU.</p>
<p dir="auto">Why Qwen2: this was the first LLM I've interacted with -- it's the go-to example in the vllm documentation. I spent some time looking at the vllm source code and built some knowledge around it.</p>

		<p><strong>This post takes a look at the experiences of political activists in East Germany (GDR) who had to deal with Stasi informants and infiltration before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.</strong><span id="more-473"></span><br>
The invasive spying and disorientation tactics used by the East German secret police (<b>Stasi</b>) meant there were significantly fewer possibilities for civil disobedience and direct action than political grassroots activists have today in places such as Western Europe and North America. Nevertheless political activists in East Germany managed to start a grassroots revolution in 1989.</p>
<p><em>This text is based on interviews with people who were politically active in East German times, and reflects their experiences. Those familiar with how police spies have been used, for example in Britain may recognise the tactics used by both contemporary secret police and GDR activists.</em></p>

<h3>East German opposition and activism</h3>
<p>Because non-state organisations were prohibited in the GDR, networking and co-ordination between activists was informal: independent groups and networks stayed in contact through newsletters and the exchange of campaign materials, and there was a mix of local and regionally co-ordinated covert and open actions.</p>
<p>Activists in the GDR also campaigned on issues that will feel familiar to many campaigners today: anti-nuclear and peace issues, challenging economic paradigms of growth and consumption at any cost; resistance to an undemocratic state and its activities; propagating and practising sustainable choices versus exploitation of environment and animals. There was a strong emphasis on DIY culture with egalitarian, equitable principles – politically most activists in the GDR in the 1980s self-defined as socialist or anarchist.</p>

<p>Between 1945 and 1990 Germany was (to simplify a little) divided in two – <strong>West Germany</strong>, integrated into NATO and Western markets, and <strong>East Germany</strong> (German Democratic Republic: <strong>GDR</strong>), in the Soviet dominated Eastern Bloc.</p>
<p>The <strong>Stasi</strong> (<em>Ministerium für Staatssicherheit</em>) was the East German secret police, and that country had the highest proportion of informants and secret police in history: 1 in 60 people were involved by 1989.</p></div></div>
<h3>The Stasi and <em>Zersetzung</em></h3>
<p>After the East German popular uprising of June 1953 (suppressed by Soviet troops) the government gave the Stasi the task of systematic surveillance and prevention of unrest in the population. Initially this took the form of brutal physical repression: imprisonment and physical abuse (including torture) by police and secret police. But this changed during the 1970s when the GDR became more interested in gaining a positive international image, and the repression of activists became more subtle. The Stasi redefined the military term <b>Zersetzung</b> (<i>attrition </i>or<i> corrosion</i>) to name their harassment tactics: the aim was to disrupt the working of groups and the lives of individuals to such a degree that their activism became ineffective, or more preferably, ceased altogether.</p>
<p>The aim of the <i>Zersetzung</i> was to ‘switch off’ the group by rendering it ineffective, with an interim goal of hindering any positive media or public exposure. The usual ways to switch groups off were to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>create conflict between members</b> – particularly useful subjects for sowing discord were those of a philosophical or political nature, money and personal (sexual) relations;</li>
<li><b>hinder and sabotage activities</b> by the use of one or more infiltrators, who would agree to do tasks, but not get round to doing them, lose materials and equipment, repeatedly request changes and further edits of materials to slow down production, attempt to divert the group into more harmless activities etc;</li>
<li><b>isolate the groups</b> from other activists, eg by spreading rumours regarding unacceptable behaviour and political views etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of tactics in any particular case was based on extensive psychological profiling and intelligence on the group members, particularly: who plays what role, who fulfills what kind of task; what are relationships within the group like, who hangs out with whom.</p>
<p>Informants (IM: <i>Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter</i>) were the usual way to gain information on a group and were also used to implement the plans to incapacitate a group and sabotage its activities. In activist circles the informants were almost never Stasi or police officers, but were usually existing members of the groups who had been pressured, persuaded or blackmailed into helping the Stasi. Alternatively,a suitable outsider would be recruited to infiltrate the group.</p>
<div id=""><p>How did the Stasi persuade people to become informants?</p><div>
<ul>
<li>Appeals to patriotism</li>
<li>Cash or material reward</li>
<li>Blackmail (eg offers of immunity from threatened prosecution)</li>
<li>Making the mission sound like an exciting adventure</li></ul></div></div>

<h3>Zersetzung of individuals</h3>
<p>As in the case of groups, the <i>Zersetzung</i> of individuals had the aim of ‘switching off’ that person’s efficacy by undermining their confidence and their belief in the value of their activities. The Stasi did not usually care whether an individual was switched off through disillusionment, fear, burn-out or mental illness: all outcomes were acceptable, and people’s mental health and social standing during or after an operation were of no concern to the officers involved.</p>
<div id=""><p>Worrying about informants</p><p>The Stasi made little secret of the fact that they used informants, and in fact deliberately helped spread rumours about informants. This was the cheapest and most efficient way to incapacitate individuals and groups.</p></div>
<p>The <i>Zersetzung </i>of individuals was usually carried out by systematically undermining the target’s quality of life (both socially and in the workplace) with the intention of simply destroying the target’s confidence. The tactics took various forms, such as spreading slanderous rumours, causing trouble at work etc. Rumours and information (such as about unacceptable political viewpoints, inappropriate behaviour, the possibility they may be an informant etc) that were passed on to work colleagues, bosses and social circles might be based on true facts, but were often plausible untruths that were difficult or impossible to refute.</p>
<p>The first stage of <i>Zersetzung </i>was a comprehensive evaluation of state-held data and information, eg medical records, school reports, police records, intelligence reports, searches of target’s residence. At this point they were looking for any weak points (social, emotional or physical) that could be used to put pressure on the target, eg extra-marital affairs, criminal records, alcoholism, drug use, differences between the target and their group (eg age, class, clothing styles) that could be exploited to socially isolate them.</p>
<p>After this a detailed <i>Zersetzung </i>strategy was drawn up: What was the specific aim?<i> </i>What tactics should be used to exploit the target’s personal situation and character traits? What was the timescale?</p>
<p>The next stage was often to supplement covert surveillance with overt observation in order to communicate to the target that they were of interest to the Stasi and to create a sense of insecurity and paranoia. Tactics included questioning, repeated stop and searches, strange noises on telephone lines, conspicuous visits to the workplace so that bosses and colleagues were aware of the police interest etc.</p>
<p>The final stages entailed psychological and physical harassment: moving things around at home (<i>one morning the alarm clock goes off at 5am instead of 7am, and the socks are in the wrong drawer, there’s no coffee left&nbsp;…</i>); damage to bikes and vehicles (eg slashing tyres); the spreading of rumours as mentioned above; ordering goods and making appointments in target’s name etc.</p>
<p>Families were often used as leverage against activists at this stage – either as a method of blackmail (eg family members subjected to oppression as a way of putting indirect pressure on the activist), or persuasion (“your daughter will land in deep trouble if she remains involved in that group, can’t you make her see sense? It’s her career at stake&nbsp;…”). </p>
<p>Physical harassment often included repeated arrests, physical attacks on the street (eg by plain clothes officers), or abuse and assault could be incited by the rumours that had been spread (eg bullying at work, avoidance by neighbours).</p>
<h3>How effective was the Stasi?</h3>
<h4>1) Paralysing individuals and groups</h4>
<figure id="attachment_4350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4350"><a href="https://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/couple.gif"><img decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20262%20300'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/couple-262x300.gif" alt="A couple embracing, while one takes notes behind the other's back" width="262" height="300" data-srcset="https://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/couple-262x300.gif 262w, https://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/couple-894x1024.gif 894w, https://www.maxhertzberg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/couple-768x880.gif 768w" data-sizes="auto, (max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4350">A couple embracing, while one takes notes behind the other’s back</figcaption></figure>
<p>The militarily organised Stasi simply couldn’t understand how many activist groups functioned without leaders and hierarchies. They often mistook informal hierarchies (caused for example by differences in empowerment levels or dominant behaviour patterns) for organisational structure – they would target those who talked the most, or took on the most tasks, and didn’t realise that even if these individuals were ‘switched off’, the rest of the group could continue to function and wouldn’t necessarily fall apart.</p>
<p>The dedication of groups was also often underestimated – even if an informant successfully sabotaged a group’s activities, the group would rarely be completely disheartened, but would try all the harder to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>The tactics of <i>Zersetzung</i> had a significant control function, if you were engaged in (or merely suspected of) activities that the Stasi didn’t like then repression was a way to punish you (not unlike the commonly used extra-judicial punishment practiced by the police in Britain today: the threat of ASBOs, severe bail conditions, the requirement to repeatedly answer bail etc).</p>
<p>The human cost of <i>Zersetzung </i>is hard to quantify – many GDR activists are still suffering from burnout, trauma and chronic mental health issues as a result of being targeted: on a personal level the Stasi was frighteningly effective.</p>
<h4>2) Gathering and using intelligence</h4>
<p>Informants weren’t just deployed to sabotage group activities and implement <i>Zersetzung</i> plans, but also to gather intelligence on individuals and groups (around 160km worth of Stasi archives survived the end of the GDR). Most intelligence was used to evaluate relationships and activities (which then led to an extension of intelligence gathering to previously untargeted individuals and groups), and as a basis for planning <i>Zersetzung</i> operations. Obviously plans for actions and activities were also reported, but these were acted upon only in rare and serious cases – if intelligence were used to disrupt the activities in any obvious way then suspicion could be drawn to the informant.</p>
<p>Intelligence from surveillance and the use of informants was rarely used to actually gain evidence for a prosecution – the Stasi desperately needed the huge amount of information it was processing in order to justify its own existence (along with the salaries and expenses of its officers and staff). If anything, this made the Stasi more dangerous to activists – the Stasi’s dependency on gathering intelligence and mounting operations made the surveillance, <i>Zersetzung</i> and sabotage more likely to happen, along with the associated human cost.</p>
<p>Informants were regularly found out – mostly because of poor preparation (at one infamous meeting, several rather conspicuous figures all introduced themselves with the same name), and chance (eg groups who came across evidence that an informant was passing information to the Stasi). But it is significant that most informants were only discovered after 1989 when the Stasi files were opened.</p>
<h3>Dealing with <em>Zersetzung</em></h3>

<p>Many people succumbed to pressure from the Stasi and other security forces, often because of mental health difficulties (brought about by the pressure) or through a process that was commonly called ‘inner migration’: giving up political and social beliefs, following the path of least resistance and ceasing oppositional activity.</p>
<p>On the other hand resistance to <i>Zersetzung </i>was remarkably commonplace, and activists found ways to remain both healthy and active. When East German activists talk today about how they managed to continue their activism, the same points come up again and again. These are summarised below.</p>
<p><b>Support from friends and other activists</b> was essential – a circle of close friends who shared an understanding of the political and policing situation was probably the most effective way to counter the Stasi. With such friends activists could talk openly about fears, suspicions and needs – they could work out ways to deal with the pressure. They spent time with these friends doing non-activism related activities which helped to build trust in the group. This helped them to know that if things got bad for them, they could both trust their friends, and be trusted by them; they would be there if help and support were needed. As a group they would make plans for possible situations – for example, who would take care of the children in case of arrest or even imprisonment, or who could provide a ‘safe house’ if somebody was being shadowed and needed a break.</p>
<p>On a wider level the <b>solidarity between groups</b> was an important factor in their survival and freedom to remain active: those groups that had strong relationships with others around the country were generally subject to less repression. In later years, particularly in East Berlin, even when repression happened, widespread solidarity actions and concerted efforts to gain publicity led to quick results (arrested or imprisoned individuals released, the work of the group allowed to resume etc). On the other hand, those groups that weren’t so well networked (usually those in small towns and rural areas where they might be the only activists) were easy pickings for the Stasi – at times whole regions of the country were ‘cleansed’ of grassroots activism.</p>
<p><b>Groups openly discussed the possibility of surveillance and intervention</b>. The groups would aim to work out what oppression measures they might be subject to (currently and in future) and think of ways they could deal with them. The hard bit was not to get lost in paranoia (particularly since there was a good chance that the group already had an informant present!), nor to be naïve or ignorant about the possibilities, but to find a middle ground of sensible measures that would, if needed, help, while not bogging the group down in extensive security measures that would just hinder the work of the group.</p>
<p>Part of working out the level of threat from the Stasi, and how to deal with it, was to consider the way the group worked, and how open the group was to newcomers. It is tempting to think that preparing and carrying out actions in the utmost secrecy would be the best defence against an opponent like the Stasi, but of the groups we know about which worked covertly in the GDR, all were subject to brutal <i>Zersetzung </i>measures, while those working openly were often subject ‘only’ to surveillance and sabotage by informants, but could nevertheless carry on their activities to a greater or lesser extent. When open groups were subject to extraordinary repression levels, they were in a good position to mobilise support from other groups and interest from West German media. (It’s difficult to draw conclusions though – generally only those from open groups are willing to speak of their experiences, and any covert group that might have survived would be, by definition, hard to find out about.) Working openly also did not preclude the need to work secretly at times, particularly when planning an action or dealing with sensitive issues, and steps would often be taken to avoid surveillance.</p>
<p><b>If a group identified an individual as a possible informant</b> they might have decided not to take any obvious initial action. An immediate reaction would be to assess whether there might be any merit in the suspicions rather than to spread rumours. The usual way of dealing with the situation would be for a few trusted individuals to discreetly research the suspect. Backgrounds would be checked (are there any family members? Do they exist? Has anyone else from the group spoken to them? What about friendships outside the group? Did the suspect actually work where they said they did? Are they familiar with the town they say they grew up in? etc) This worked well enough for informants who had been provided with a cover story and infiltrated into the group by the Stasi, but couldn’t provide clear results if the informant was a ‘real’ person who had been turned.</p>
<p>By making notes of behaviour patterns and movements of a suspect the group might think they were finding evidence of Stasi involvement, but equally, they might be framing an innocent individual. Discovering reports to handling officers would be a clear sign. But if an individual were guilty only of losing materials and not getting round to completing agreed tasks, it could not be simply assumed that they were an informant or saboteur – no matter how regularly it might happen! In other words, groups needed to be extremely careful when they thought they might have discovered an informant – it was all too easy to start a witch hunt against innocents, something that would easily paralyse groups and individuals and play right into the hands of the Stasi.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It is easy to get lost in analysing the techniques the Stasi used, and the more you look into it, the more frightening it gets. But it’s worth mentioning that, in our assessment, the grassroots opposition movements made the biggest contribution to the revolution that started in East Germany in autumn 1989 – despite the horrifying levels of repression and surveillance that they had faced for decades. Quite simply, the Stasi failed to predict the events of that year, and once things had started, their <i>Zersetzung</i> tactics became ineffective.</p>

It’s the first evening of May, and the window is open, letting mild air and the sound of a blackbird singing into the room.</p><p>“This is the kind of weather you love the most. When you usually stand and fish at the sandbank,” says his niece, 53-year-old Mette Damgaard. She is leaning over the bed, her face very close to his. She has been sitting like this for a long time.</p><p>René has his eyes closed, and his mouth is slightly open. The evening light falls across his gaunt face, and he looks as though he is sleeping. He is not; he is dying.</p><p>“I will take care of you,” Mette whispers.</p><p>He nods. She strokes his hand and squeezes it.</p><p>“You can let go now, René.”</p><p>There is a moment of silence. Then he whispers: “Remember to say goodbye to everyone from me.”</p><p>“I will, René. I promise.”</p><p>The way we die is a topic of a heated debate in Denmark, as in many other countries including the UK. The government wants to introduce medical aid in dying, and in 2023 set up a committee, which presented its various opinions in January this year. Palliative care is often highlighted as a counterweight to the offer of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/assisted-suicide" data-link-name="in body link">assisted dying</a>. To witness the treatment of terminally ill patients, I was given access to the palliative care unit, section 126, at Hvidovre hospital for 10 days in April and May 2024.</p><p>Unlike the rest of the hospital, section 126 isn’t focused on cure but on relief. In this unit, terminally ill patients like René receive help to deal with their pain, nausea, and other symptoms from doctors and nurses specialising in palliative care. But the staff in this section don’t just administer morphine and methadone through IVs and injections. They also assist patients and their families with the grief of saying goodbye, the pain of leaving life and the fear of death.</p><p>“Many of the patients we receive are referred due to physical pain, but they can also experience breathlessness, anxiety and existential suffering. We call this ‘total pain’,” says Dr Johan Randén. Originally from Malmö, he trained as a general practitioner in 1996 and has been working in palliative care for more than 10 years. He has encountered several patients who talk about assisted dying: “Some of them think, on receiving their diagnosis, that they want to end their life then and there, and might as well get it over with. But they can also live. And I find that when they receive the right support, they let go of that thought.”</p><p>Sigrid Nielsen, 65, an experienced nurse, adds: “It’s healthy people who want to introduce assisted dying. But the patients we meet here want to live. They do not want to die.”</p><p>Every morning in the palliative care unit starts with a meeting in the staff room at the end of the hallway. On this Monday in April, doctors, nurses, and the unit’s psychologist and social worker gather around a table to talk through the patients in their care. A middle-aged man is in such severe pain that he can barely be touched; another needs to be discharged to a hospice; a third patient requires a Polish-speaking interpreter; and then there’s a male patient who is in a very bad psychological state. He feels lonely, hasn’t slept all night and wants to hold hands all the time, says Nielsen. “He is really in a deep crisis.”</p><p>The man is not psychotic or suicidal, but he needs someone who listens. “We can’t change his life circumstances, but I’ve told him: ‘You need to stay here until you feel safe’,” she says.</p><p>The psychologist has made an appointment with him, and he has also been asked if he wants to talk to a priest. After half an hour, everyone gets up. An alarm flashes above the door, nurses are needed in several rooms and doctors are preparing for rounds. Some of them are going on home visits with the unit’s palliative mobile care team.</p><hr><p><strong>A small sign outside each room </strong>has a handwritten message, name and a drawing. “Welcome René” it says outside room 14 next to a drawing of a tree.</p><p>René was admitted on Monday morning. He came from the hospital’s pulmonary unit, where he had been for almost a month. René’s eyes look large in his hollow face, and his hair is a bit dishevelled. His bones are prominent at his shoulders and wrists, and his muscles have shrunk. He started having back pain before Christmas, and the doctor thought it might be a herniated disc. He also got tired a lot and felt cold. He was sent to a physiotherapist, who couldn’t help him, and one day in late March an ambulance brought him to the hospital with severe pain. The paramedics thought it was intestinal obstruction.</p><p>“But then they found cancer everywhere,” he says. The disease had started in his lungs but had spread to his liver and bones.</p><p>Nielsen enters the room and reminds him to drink more. He promises. “As long as it’s only water,” he says. He quit drinking in 1996, he tells Dr Randén. “Well done,” says Randén. He sits on the bed and asks how they can help him. He’s short of breath, lacks appetite, he says, and then there’s the pain, a burning sensation. It sits under his shoulder blade.</p><figure id="56bfeb03-a65a-471c-b1ed-5cdc7ce44cf3" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A man, with an oxygen tube in his nose, smiles as he lies under a duvet and looks at a woman with shoulder-length hair sitting next to his hospital bed, her hands in her lap and also smiling" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8347ec26797c015bccfcb56bb4245d559aefef5c/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.8115234375" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>René Damgaard with his niece Mette.</span> Photograph: Jacob Ehrbahn/Polfoto</figcaption></figure><p>“I know what’s going to happen,” says René.</p><p>“What’s going to happen?” asks Randén.</p><p>“My life is coming to an end.”</p><p>“What do you think about that?” asks Randén.</p><p>“It’s too early, but it is not up to me to decide.”</p><p>He was offered chemotherapy but declined. He doesn’t know if he has a week or a month left to live. “And chemo makes you really sick. I’d rather spend my time feeling good.”</p><p>Randén understands, he says. “That’s not how you should spend your energy.”</p><p>He explains that it’s important to speak up as soon as he feels the pain. “Pain is like fire. You can easily blow out a candle. But if the fire spreads and the whole kitchen goes up, it’s hard to extinguish. It takes time for the medicine to work, so you need to tell us as soon as you feel the first flame.”</p><p>René nods. “I’ve never been good at asking for help,” he says.</p><p>As soon as the pain is under control, he wants to move back to his flat, where he lives alone. His niece has rearranged his flat, and everything is ready for him to spend his final days there.</p><p>“Do you have any children?” asks Randén.</p><p>“I have a son,” says René.</p><p>“Do you have a good relationship with him?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Does he know you’re sick?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Out in the hallway, Randén stops and talks to Nielsen. “Maybe we should ask René if he wants to write a letter to his son,” he suggests.</p><hr><p><strong>Randén says one of his most </strong>important tasks is to listen to the patients.</p><p>“You can run all kinds of blood tests and scans, but if you don’t talk to the patients about what they want, it’s pointless. You must talk to them. And touch them,” he says.</p><p>It’s the experience of Randén and his colleagues in the palliative care unit that no one else in the healthcare system has talked to the patients about the fact that treatment could extend life yet diminish its quality, especially towards the end. “Many doctors shy away from talking about death. They keep treating the patients until the very last moment before they finally say: ‘Now there is nothing more we can do.’ But then there is no time left for the patient to prepare themselves for death,” says Randén.</p><p>There are three things that are important for someone dying to get the opportunity to say to the right people, Randén says: “Forgive me. I forgive you. And I love you.”</p><hr><p><strong>“Life is too short for bad coffee,”</strong> says Niels Abrahamsen, who is 63.</p><p>He pours freshly ground coffee into a glass pot from a small bag his wife, Rikke, has brought. He smells the freshly ground beans and says: “Ahhh.” On his bedside table is a box of luxury chocolates. Life is also too short for bad chocolate.</p><p>Abrahamsen often uses that phrase. He is a bon vivant. He was diagnosed with stomach cancer in January 2020, but even with a death sentence hanging over him for four years, he has not lost hope, he says. In February, he had a stomach bleed, and after radiation therapy to stop it, he experienced severe pain. In recent weeks there has been a buildup of fluid in his abdomen, and a few days ago he was admitted to the palliative care unit to relieve his discomfort.</p><p>Abrahamsen’s approach to illness is holistic, he explains. On his bedside table are various “exquisite” dietary supplements, as he calls them. He does not like medication – especially not chemotherapy, of which he has had about 30 treatments. He likes the palliative unit compared with the gastro unit in the hospital where he was initially admitted and where everything was “complete chaos”. “They are more professional here, more experienced, and they have time to sit down and hold your hand,” he says.</p><p>He has settled into his room with a yoga mat and a stack of magazines. He also unpacks a Bluetooth speaker his wife has brought so he can listen to good music. Because life is also too short for bad sound.</p><figure id="179daa2c-f2ed-4514-a316-a753377b0683" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Man in a T-shirt and glasses smiles as he puts his hand on the hand of a man in a fleece, smiling, who is lying in a hospital bed under a duvet" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4708512350e0f4bfc230fa7a27781d9fe70054da/0_0_8192_5462/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.702880859375" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Dr Johan Randén with Niels Abrahamsen.</span> Photograph: Jacob Ehrbahn/Polfoto</figcaption></figure><p>The doctor enters to check on him. His abdomen is swollen with fluid, and during the night he paces the hallway restlessly. Randén wheels in an ultrasound machine, sits on the edge of the bed, scans, and gently feels Abrahamsen’s stomach. They discuss whether to try to drain some of the fluid or wait a while.</p><p>“We’ll take it step by step and see what we can do for you,” says Randén. He sits for a moment, quietly, patting his patient’s hand. Abrahamsen begins to cry.</p><p>“What’s happening?” Randén asks.</p><p>“It’s you, Johan. You are the most attentive doctor I have ever met,” says Abrahamsen. He covers his face with his hands as tears stream down.</p><p>“It’s not easy, I know,” says Randén.</p><hr><p><strong>The nurses move quickly </strong>down the corridors, keeping an eye on the clock and the flashing alarms. However, when they enter the patients’ rooms, the pace is often different.</p><p>They speak softly and take their time. Patients and relatives talk about a unique calm atmosphere in the unit – a stark contrast to the hospital’s other departments.</p><p>One afternoon, a middle-aged man enters the corridor. In his hands, he holds two large boxes of cream puffs, which he places in the nurses’ office. His wife died in the unit a month ago. They were admitted together up until her death.</p><p>“We had talked about her coming home to die, but she felt most secure here,” he says. Now he wants to say thank you. “I promised my wife that I would come back and properly say goodbye to the staff.” But it was difficult to walk through the door to the unit. “This is where I saw my wife for the last time,” he says.</p><p>The man gets a cup of coffee and talks at length with two of the nurses. One of them places a hand on his shoulder. His eyes fill with tears.</p><p>“We don’t just take care of the patients – we also take care of the relatives, their emotions and their grief,” says Nielsen later.</p><p>She has saved some of the many thank-you cards and letters she has received over the years. There are also several memorial cards from patients’ funerals she has attended. “You don’t just distribute food, make the beds and give medication. You also embrace them and care for them,” she says.</p><hr><p><strong>In room 11, Liv Simonsen </strong>is being visited by one of her three daughters and two grandchildren.</p><p>The youngest crawls into her bed and cuddles up to her. The girl doesn’t say much but shows with her hand how old she is. Five fingers. On the wall of the room hangs a child’s drawing of a princess in a castle.</p><p>Simonsen is 70 and had just retired from her job as a speech therapist when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020. She was declared cancer free in 2021. But in January she experienced back pain. “The doctor thought it was muscle pain and just wanted to give me pills,” she says.</p><p>But when she was admitted to casualty with severe pain, they sent her for further examination. It turned out that the cancer was back and had spread to her spinal cord and bones. Now it is incurable. When Simonsen was admitted to the palliative unit last week, the pain was so intense she couldn’t get out of bed. She has never been able to sit still. Three months ago, she was swimming and playing volleyball and padel.</p><p>“And now here I am,” she states quietly. She lives in a townhouse in Albertslund with her husband, Jens. Together they have five children and 10 grandchildren. He is also admitted in the room – his bed is placed close to hers.</p><p>The oncologist’s plan is to keep the disease at bay with oral chemotherapy. But only if Simonsen recovers strength enough to move around. Otherwise they will have to stick to life-prolonging treatment, she explains. And first the pain must be under control.</p><p>A nurse brings a small brown pill that Simonsen needs to take to muster the strength for later when her sister comes to visit. Randén prescribed the morphine-based drug oxycodone. Initially, she wouldn’t take it.</p><p>“I freaked out when he mentioned it because I’ve heard on TV how people can become addicted to opioids.” Randén explained to her that it was for the pain. Not for fun. “And now I’m glad. It’s really nice not to be in so much pain.”</p><p>But when the pain is under control, you start to think, she says. “And then you get sad. I told Sigrid earlier that if I start crying, it feels as if I can’t stop,” she says. “But when my grandchildren are here, I don’t cry.”</p><hr><p><strong>Randén looks at the CT scans</strong> of René Damgaard on a computer.</p><p>It looks like a map – his bones, lungs, and other internal organs depicted like islands in a sea of white and grey. Randén scrolls, zooms in and points to numerous small and large black spots and shadows. Cancer.</p><p>“There, there and there. It’s everywhere and it’s causing him pain,” Randén says. Even though they can’t cure or treat the cancer, there is plenty they can do to give him relief, he says.</p><p>In room 14, René has dozed off with a Crossword &amp; Quiz magazine in front of him on the duvet. His niece, Mette, drops by straight from her job as a department head at a school nearby. She has brought a Popsicle for him called Champagne.</p><p>“This is the only type of champagne we use to celebrate,” she says. They both laugh. She has big curly hair and smiles a lot. She is the daughter of René’s older brother, and there are only 14 years between uncle and niece.</p><p>Her father died of cancer. “When René is no longer here, there won’t be anyone around any more who has known me my entire life,” says Mette.</p><p>René worked in shipping, as a hospital porter and in IT. While he has been in the hospital, he turned 67 and is now officially retired. He was supposed to be spending all his time on his hobby: fishing. Instead, he is scheduled to be discharged on Monday to die at home, and his niece has applied for care leave so she can be with him as much as possible.</p><p>“You can sit by the window and see the new leaves on the beech hedge, and we’ll eat good food. I’ve stocked up on frozen meals,” she says. She has arranged home care from the municipality up to 12 times a day. Still, she worries about her uncle being in pain.</p><p>For the doctors and nurses in the unit, it’s important to prepare the family and the patients for death so it doesn’t end in helplessness and chaos. But it’s not always possible, says Randén. The patients hardest to handle are those who don’t want to talk about death and do everything they can to avoid facing it. “Especially young people, and mothers with small children. They fight with everything they have – understandably,” he says.</p><p>Even though most dying people want to be at home, patients and relatives can become uncertain or overwhelmed in the final days and hours. And then the dying person gets admitted to hospital, stabilised and perhaps sent home again, only to end up in the hospital again a few days later.</p><p>“Sometimes it ends up in what I call ‘blue-light deaths’, where a patient is rushed in by ambulance, dies on the way, is resuscitated, and maybe doesn’t regain consciousness and never gets a chance to say goodbye. That’s not a dignified death,” says Randén.</p><p>During the night just before the weekend, René gets a fever. He wakes up with chattering teeth. The next morning his skin is still sweaty. Randén examines him first thing.</p><p>“I think you have pneumonia. So take it easy – no dancing today,” the doctor says, prescribing antibiotics. “We need to get you back on your feet. You still want to go home on Monday, right?”</p><p>René struggles through a handful of pills with the help of a protein drink. Nielsen arrives.</p><p>“I’ll open the curtains so we can get some sunlight in. It’ll make the day a bit better,” she says.</p><p>She starts preparing everything for his discharge so he will get all the help and care he needs for his final days. Wound care for his bedsores; a form to say his condition is terminal so all medication is free of charge. She also notes down the phone number for the emergency nurse so he and his niece have someone to call. But Nielsen doubts he will make it until Monday morning. Pneumonia is serious in his condition.</p><p>“He might die over the weekend,” she says, adding: “I’m just being realistic.” The most important thing is that he is not in pain.</p><p>“We are chasing the good days.”</p><hr><p><strong>For Liv Simonsen in room 11</strong>, it’s a bad day after several good ones.</p><p>She feels nauseous and sits up in bed with a small plastic pill cup of medicine in front of her and a smoothie beside her bed. She can’t get either of them down because she has an upset stomach. It started last night.</p><p>“I threw up and got really tired. Like I was hit with a hammer,” she says.</p><p>Three small pills remain. Randén enters and sits down on the edge of the bed. He listens to her stomach with a stethoscope.</p><p>“Nausea can have many causes. Sometimes it’s an imbalance in the body. Sometimes it’s the medication. Sometimes it’s anxiety. It all feels the same,” he says.</p><p>Nielsen has joined them. She wants Simonsen to get out of bed. “You need to get up and brush your teeth, and then we’ll get you in the wheelchair and wrapped up so you can sit on the terrace in the sunshine. It’s better for your appetite, and your mood,” she says firmly. Simonsen is grateful for the way she is treated. That Nielsen constantly reminds her to make the most of the time she has left.</p><hr><p><strong>Niels Abrahamsen has had </strong>trouble sleeping. He usually stays active by doing exercises but hasn’t had the energy in recent days.</p><p>He is increasingly worried that the fluid in his abdomen is due to the cancer spreading. He has asked for a CT scan. He keeps up with music – both big stars and new names – and he has tickets for a Bruce Springsteen concert in July and a local music festival in August. He also bought tickets for the Euros in Germany, which he hopes to attend with his 19-year-old son, who graduates from high school in a couple of months. “It’s going to be huge. I must be there,” he says.</p><p>However, he knows he can’t travel in his current condition. He takes more morphine than he’d like. “And then my stomach gets constipated, and I get sluggish and forgetful,” he says.</p><figure id="7e75abd5-b825-41e5-a188-7e172d14b328" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04842fff251a4278ba00a983bd45c302d9f7ccb/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04842fff251a4278ba00a983bd45c302d9f7ccb/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04842fff251a4278ba00a983bd45c302d9f7ccb/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04842fff251a4278ba00a983bd45c302d9f7ccb/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04842fff251a4278ba00a983bd45c302d9f7ccb/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04842fff251a4278ba00a983bd45c302d9f7ccb/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A man in a fleece jacket, leggings and socks stands on a lawn outside a two-storey hospital building exercising by lifting his right leg, hand on his knee" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04842fff251a4278ba00a983bd45c302d9f7ccb/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.8115234375" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Abrahamsen doing his daily exercise routine.</span> Photograph: Jacob Ehrbahn/Polfoto</figcaption></figure><p>He takes a walk on the grass outside the hospital and performs an exercise routine in his socks among daisies and bushes. He does this every day, all year round, at home in his own garden, he says.</p><p>“Now I feel almost reborn,” he says afterwards.</p><hr><p><strong>René is scheduled</strong> to be discharged on Monday morning, but that doesn’t happen.</p><p>Over the weekend, he gets delirium – a condition with hallucinations that often affects the dying and very sick. He has seen visions of his mother and father, and when Nielsen arrives, he is crying.</p><p>Nielsen doesn’t think he’s well enough to go home.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? Are you afraid to die?”</p><p>The way she says it sounds like a mix between a question and a statement. Damgaard doesn’t respond.</p><p>“I will make the decision for you now. I can’t send you home when you’re in this state,” she says.</p><p>René cries so hard the bed shakes. He raises his hands to his face. “Bullshit,” he finally says.</p><p>“It’s good for you to cry. It’s OK to let it out,” says Nielsen, stroking his short grey hair. A little later she gives him a shot of sedative and makes a call to cancel the transport home. She also gets hold of his niece, Mette.</p><p>René was supposed to get a visit at home from his son, whom he hasn’t seen in years. Mette arranged it. She promises to make sure the son pays a visit to his father at the unit instead.</p><p>Randén has just arrived. He hasn’t even taken off his backpack when he goes in to see René. He is still crying and upset about having to cancel the transport home. The doctor explains the hallucinations. About 80% of dying patients experience them. It feels like dreaming while you’re awake. Sometimes the patients see people from their past. It can be frightening.</p><p>The room is quiet. Randén holds his patient’s hand and just sits there. For a long time. Eventually René calms down. The medicine is working. Nielsen walks down to the nurses’ office with the bag of medication René was supposed to take home.</p><p>“I had packed everything. But things never go as planned here,” she says.</p><p>She talks about a young female patient who was severely troubled by hallucinations before she died. “It was very scary. She saw shadows that wanted to take her. They surrounded her in the room.” Nielsen moved her patient’s bed into the hallway and lay down with her, holding her. “It was the only thing that helped. She was terrified.”</p><hr><p><strong>Every Monday, a musical duo</strong> visits the unit to play for the patients.</p><p>It consists of a guitarist and a singer who knock on each door and ask if they can come in to sing a song. They are welcomed into three rooms. They play Somewhere Over the Rainbow to an 80-year-old woman who has been in the ward for a few days. She appears to be asleep, and 20 minutes after the musicians leave, she takes her last breath.</p><p>Later that day René’s niece, Mette, arrives. He feels better after the decision has been taken about staying in the ward. He has eaten two cups of yoghurt, and in a few hours his 39-year-old son, whom he hasn’t seen in four years, is coming to visit.</p><p>Now that the meeting is approaching, he is worried that his son might be angry with him. “But he wouldn’t come if he was very mad, I guess,” he says. Although he has been sober since 1996, many things remain unsaid between them. “And I know I was a jerk at some point,” he says.</p><p>“But a lot of good things have happened since,” Mette reminds him.</p><p>René’s son arrives precisely at the agreed time. Randén and nurse Nielsen greet him at his father’s bed. When they leave, Nielsen shows that she has goose bumps on her arm. Randén takes off his glasses and wipes away a tear. He and Nielsen hug.</p><p>“They get to say goodbye, and it’s good for the son and good for René. He can leave at peace with himself,” Randén says. He often finds himself crying.</p><p>René’s son stays for a long time. When darkness falls, he is still there.</p><figure id="c43186a7-03ed-45f0-ae54-f003d4333ce7" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A nurse with short hair in a ponytail and a short-sleeved uniform walks down a hospital corridor with a doctor in a T-shirt holding his glasses in his right hand and putting his left hand over his eyes" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150b9473884cd227ff6341ad671397a345124a22/0_0_6054_4035/master/6054.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.59316154608524" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Nurse Sigrid Nielsen (left) and Dr Johan Randén in the palliative care unit at Hvidovre hospital.</span> Photograph: Jacob Ehrbahn/Polfoto</figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong>Liv Simonsen </strong><strong>in room 11 </strong>has felt better over the weekend. The pills are working, reducing her nausea.</p><p>She has been out on the hospital’s roof terrace in a wheelchair several times. She has eaten ice-cream and had many visitors. “When the pills work I become weightless,” she says.</p><p>Randén and Nielsen want to persuade Simonsen to accept a temporary stay at a hospice facility where she can regain more strength before possibly going home. They sit down in her room.</p><p>“Last week, we talked about apathy. You were very sad, but it seems like you’re in a different place now,” says Randén.</p><p>“Yes, it was a low point. But I feel better. I can talk about the future,” she says. Her home is not set up to provide the necessary help yet, so she accepts the suggestion of receiving care at a hospice facility.</p><p>Randén walks towards his office to write the referral. As he makes his way down the hallway, he performs small, joyful dance steps.</p><hr><p><strong>The next day, </strong>René’s condition has worsened. His hallucinations have intensified during the night, and now he is crying again, feeling frightened.</p><p>After a conversation with Randén and Nielsen, he agrees to a combination of sedatives and painkillers that might cause him to fall asleep and not wake up.</p><p>“We talked to him about the possibility that he might not see Mette and his son again. But he was completely at peace. He wants to go to sleep now,” says Nielsen afterwards.</p><p>This process is known as palliative sedation, when terminally ill patients are given medication to relieve pain and reduce anxiety and distress, with the possible side-effect of shortening life and causing loss of consciousness.</p><p>“He shouldn’t have to experience what he went through last night again. It’s too cruel,” says Nielsen as she prepares the mixture in the medication room. She sets up a pump by René’s bed that will provide him with a continuous dose. She inserts a drip into his upper arm just above a tattoo of the logo from FC København – the silhouette of a blue lion’s head. The muscle and the lion have shrunk.</p><p>René opens his eyes. She strokes his hair.</p><p>“Are you in pain?”</p><p>He shakes his head and points to his mouth.</p><p>“But your lips are dry … ”</p><p>Nielsen fetches small sticks with foam tips, which she dips in water and uses to moisten his lips and tongue.</p><p>He says something. It’s hard to hear. He repeats it in a barely audible whisper: “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“No need to apologise. Now sleep,” she says.</p><p>Nielsen calls his niece and explains what is happening. On his way home, Randén passes by René’s room. “The frown line on his forehead is gone,” he says.</p><hr><p><strong>After a few frustrating days </strong>of waiting, Niels Abrahamsen finally gets the CT scan he requested.</p><p>It takes place in the hospital basement. He performs stretching exercises against the machine before lying down on the bed and being rolled into the scanner tube.</p><p>“Soon I’ll find out if it’s the worst case scenario. If the cancer has gone wild. Or if it’s just fluid accumulation,” he says when he gets back to his room.</p><p>The next day, Abrahamsen is informed that the cancer has spread. He is offered a place at a hospice facility, which he accepts.</p><p>Just before midnight, the night nurse assesses that René doesn’t have much time left. She calls Mette, who along with her husband arrives at the hospital and sits by her uncle’s bed. René’s breathing rattles slightly, but otherwise the room is quiet, with only a single lamp lit.</p><p>“There’s not much left of you,” says Mette, stroking his bony hand.</p><p>A few days ago, they had talked about the funeral. Mette suggested that her uncle’s ashes be scattered over the sea at the sandbank where he used to fish. “So you’ll be out there when we swim and sail,” she said. He liked the idea. She reminds him again. She tells him to imagine fishing at sunrise – the water shimmering like gold.</p><p>“And you’re in your boat sailing towards the sun,” she says.</p><p>Time passes in silence. René’s breathing is bubbling and rasping, but behind his chest, his heart is still pounding hard. He has trouble letting go, Mette thinks.</p><p>“Yesterday, he said he would miss all of us.”</p><figure id="491c1c4f-4e81-4b7a-8561-c0c23660e0a2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:162,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘My death is not my own’: the limits of legal euthanasia&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;491c1c4f-4e81-4b7a-8561-c0c23660e0a2&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/10/my-death-is-not-my-own-the-limits-of-legal-euthanasia&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>René dies just after sunrise at 5.57am.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Thursday morning, a bit before 10 am in Austin and nearly 11 pm in Singapore, Joe Lonsdale had enough of Balaji Srinivasan’s views on China.</p><p>“This is insane CCP thinking,” Lonsdale, a co-founder of Palantir, wrote to a 300-member Signal group. “Not sure what leaders hang out w you in Singapore but on this you have been taken over by a crazy China mind virus.”</p><p>Srinivasan, a former Coinbase chief technology officer and influential tech figure who now lives in the city-state, responded that China “executed extremely well over 45 years. Any analysis that doesn’t take that into account makes it seem like the US could have held it back.”</p><p>It was a normal, robust disagreement among friends in a friendly space (as <a href="https://x.com/balajis/status/1916172428818173977" rel="noopener" target="_blank">both</a> <a href="https://x.com/JTLonsdale/status/1916173526542815609" rel="noopener" target="_blank">raced</a> to X to declare, after I emailed them about it).</p><p>And it was just another day in Chatham House, a giant and raucous Signal group that forms part of the sprawling network of influential private chats that began during the fervid early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and which have fueled a new alliance of tech and the US right. That same week in Chatham House, Lonsdale and the Democratic billionaire Mark Cuban sparred over affirmative action, and Cuban and Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro discussed questions of culture and work ethic.</p><p>This constellation of rolling elite political conversations revolve primarily around the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and a circle of Silicon Valley figures. None of their participants was surprised to see Trump administration officials <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">firing off</a> secrets and emojis on the platform last month. I did not have the good fortune to be accidentally added to one of the chats, which can be set to make messages disappear after just 30 seconds.</p><p>But their influence flows through X, Substack, and podcasts, and constitutes a kind of dark matter of American politics and media. The group chats aren’t always primarily a political space,&nbsp;but they are the single most important place in which a stunning realignment toward Donald Trump was shaped and negotiated, and an alliance between Silicon Valley and the new right formed. The group chats are “the memetic upstream of mainstream opinion,” wrote one of their key organizers, Sriram Krishnan, a former partner in the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (typically styled a16z) who is now the White House senior policy adviser for AI.</p><p>Of course, these are hardly the only power group chats. Anti-Trump liberals are now coordinating their responses on Signal. There are group chats for Black political elites and morning show producers. A vast and influential parallel set of tech conversations take place on WhatsApp. There’s a big China-friendly group over on WeChat. Elite podcasters have one.</p><p>“It’s the same thing happening on both sides, and I’ve been amazed at how much this is coordinating our reality,” said the writer Thomas Chatterton Williams, who was for a time a member of a group chat with Andreessen. “If you weren’t in the business at all, you’d think everyone was arriving at conclusions independently —&nbsp;and [they’re] not. It’s a small group of people who talk to each other and overlap between politics and journalism and a few industries.”</p><p>But there is no equivalent to the intellectual counterculture that grew up over the last five years on the tech right, and no figure remotely like Andreessen, the towering, enthusiastic 53-year old who co-founded a16z and, before that, invented the modern web browser.</p><p>In February, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBC16R6ocCc&amp;t=1s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">described</a> the group chats to the podcaster Lex Fridman as “the equivalent of samizdat” — the self-published Soviet underground press —&nbsp;in a “soft authoritarian” age of social media shaming and censorship. “The combination of encryption and disappearing messages really unleashed it,” he said. The chats, he <a href="https://a16z.com/introducing-erik-torenberg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a> recently, helped produce our national “vibe shift.”</p><p>The chats are occasionally marked by the sort of thing that would have gotten you scolded on Twitter in 2020, and which would pass unremarked-on on X in 2025.</p><p>They have rarely been discussed in public, though you can catch the occasional mention in, for instance, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmuEH3OX1l8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">podcast debate</a> between Cuban and the Republican entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, which started in a chat.</p><p>But they are made visible through a group consensus on social media. Their effects have ranged from the mainstreaming of the monarchist pundit Curtis Yarvin to a particularly focused and developed dislike of the former Washington Post writer Taylor Lorenz.</p><p>They succeeded at avoiding leaks (until, to a modest extent, this article) in part because of Signal’s and WhatsApp’s disappearing message features, and in part because the groups had formed out of a mix of fear and disdain for journalists they believed were “out to get us,” as one member put it.</p><p>Many of the roughly 20 participants I spoke to also felt a genuine sentimental attachment to the spaces, and believed in their value. One participant in the groups described them as a “Republic of Letters,” a reference to the long-distance intellectual correspondence of the 17th century. Others often invoked European salon culture. The closed groups offered an alternative to the Twitter and Slack conversations once dominated by progressive social movements, when polarizing health debates swept through social media and society in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>“People during 2020 felt that there was a monoculture on social media, and if they didn’t agree with something, group chats became a safe space to debate that, share that, build consensus, feel that you’re not alone,” said Erik Torenberg, an entrepreneur who was the first employee of the tech community hub Product Hunt. As Krishnan was setting up a set of tech group WhatsApp chats at a16z, Torenberg independently founded a group of tech chats on WhatsApp and some more political Signal chats.</p><p>“They’re having all the private conversations because they weren’t allowed to have the public conversations,” Andreessen told Torenberg on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8X8jecivWw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a recent podcast</a>, after joking in the name of secrecy that he’d never heard of such groups. “If it wasn’t for the censorship all of these conversations would have happened in public, which would have been much better.”</p><p>Their creations took off: “It might not seem like it, because of all the sh*t that people still post on X, but the internet has fragmented,” the <a href="https://x.com/Noahpinion/status/1916185096757146022" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Substack author Noah Smith wrote</a> after my inquiries for this story spilled into public Saturday. “Group chats are now where everything important and interesting happens.”</p><h3>Time to Build</h3><p>It can be hard to date the beginning of the Group Chat Era exactly. They began bubbling up in 2018 and 2019, and accelerated in earnest in the spring of 2020. As the scale of the pandemic set in that April and the weaknesses of both the US supply chain and government became clear, Andreessen fired off what would become a profoundly influential essay, “<a href="https://a16z.com/its-time-to-build/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">It’s Time to Build</a>,” calling for a revival of patriotic industry and innovation.</p><p>Conversations about the essay and the pandemic bubbled on Clubhouse, a flash-in-the-pan social conversation app where Krishnan&nbsp;was also trying to build communities. Andreessen and Krishnan discussed trying to replicate the free-flowing early Hacker News bulletin board online, and then settled on group chats, as the story they’ve told friends goes. They discussed three platforms, Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram, and discarded the third over lingering questions about its security and Russian ties.</p><p>That spring, Krishnan, working as a consultant, launched a group called “Build” on WhatsApp with a dozen of Silicon Valley’s elite figures. Andreessen loved it, and Krishnan began launching more —&nbsp;dozens, within a year, on topics from engineering to design to project management to artificial intelligence.</p><p>To the degree these chats strayed into politics, two participants said, they rarely mentioned Donald Trump. They revolved around the specific political challenges of Silicon Valley’s leaders: In the chats, executives commiserated about how to handle employee demands that they, for instance, declare that “Black Lives Matter” or support policies they didn’t actually believe in around transgender rights. And they strategized about how to defeat San Francisco’s progressive district attorney, Chesa Boudin.</p><p>In an essay on his blog, <a href="https://sriramk.com/group-chats-rule-the-world" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Group Chats Rule the World</a>, Krishnan described how “every group chat usually has one or two people that like to talk… a lot. They are critical: you need the provocateurs who inject new ideas consistently. However, almost all of them have a tendency to dominate these groups.”</p><p>Andreessen was a nuclear reactor who powered many groups. Srinivasan was another. A good community-builder, Krishnan wrote, would act as a “cooling rod,” preventing meltdown.</p><p>Someone who sat next to Andreessen at a conference during this period recalled watching with awe as he flipped on his phone from group chat to group chat, responding and engaging with manic speed.</p><h3>‘How does he have the time?’</h3><p>Occasionally over the past few years, I’ve had a friend or source tell me in wonder that Andreessen was blowing up their phone. His hunger for information was “astonishing,” one participant in the group chat said. “My impression is Marc spends half his life on 100 of these at the same time,” another correspondent marveled. “This man should be a lot busier than I am and I can barely keep up with his group chat. How does he have the time?”</p><p>Andreessen has told friends he finds the medium efficient —&nbsp;a way to keep in touch with three times the people in a third of the time. The fact that he and other billionaires spend so much time writing to group chats prompted participants to joke that the very pinnacle of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is&nbsp;posting.</p><p>Along with the tech-centric WhatsApp groups Krishnan had organized out of a16z, Andreessen joined a slew of others, including ones that Torenberg set up for tech founders and for more political discussions. The tech chats tended to be on WhatsApp and the political ones on Signal, which is more fully encrypted, and they had different settings. (“Every group chat ends up being about memes and humor and the goal of the group chat is to get as close to the line of being actually objectionable without tripping it,” Andreessen told Fridman. “People will set to 5 minutes before they send something particularly inflammatory.“)</p><p>After a group of liberal intellectuals published a <a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">letter</a> in Harper’s on July 7, 2020, some of its signers were invited to join a Signal group called “Everything Is Fine.” There, writers including Kmele Foster, who co-hosts the podcast <em>The Fifth Column</em>, Persuasion founder Yascha Mounk, and the Harper’s letter contributor Williams joined Andreessen and a group that also included the anti-woke conservative activist Chris Rufo.</p><p>The new participants were charmed by Andreessen’s engagement: “He was the most available, the most present, the most texting of anybody in the group — which shocked me because it seemed like he was the most important person in the group,” one said.</p><p>But the center didn’t hold. The Harper’s types were surprised to find what one described an “illiberal worldview” among tech figures more concerned with power than speech. The conservatives found the liberal intellectuals tiresome, committed to what Rufo described to me as “infinite discourse” over action.</p><p>The breaking point came on July 5, 2021, when Foster and Williams, along with the never-Trump conservative David French and the liberal academic Jason Stanley, wrote a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/05/opinion/we-disagree-on-a-lot-of-things-except-the-danger-of-anti-critical-race-theory-laws.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">New York Times op-ed</a> criticizing new laws against teaching “critical race theory.”</p><p>“Even if this censorship is legal in the narrow context of public primary and secondary education, it is antithetical to educating students in the culture of American free expression,” they wrote.</p><p>The conservatives had thought the Harper’s letter writers were their allies in an all-out ideological battle, and considered their position a betrayal. Andreessen “went really ballistic in a quite personal way at Thomas,” a participant recalled. The group ended after Andreessen “wrote something along the lines of ‘thank you everybody, I think it’s time to take a Signal break,’” another said.</p><p>The meltdown of this liberal-tech alliance was, to Rufo, a healthy development.</p><p>“A lot of these technologists hoped that the centrist path was a viable one, because it would permit them in theory to change the culture without having to expose themselves to the risk of becoming partisans,” he said. “By 2021, the smartest people in tech understood that these people were a dead end — so the group chats exploded and reformulated on more explicitly political lines.”</p><p>Rufo had been there all along: “I looked at these chats as a good investment of my time to radicalize tech elites who I thought were the most likely and high-impact new coalition partners for the right.”</p><h3>‘What really matters is defeating the left’</h3><p>The messages in “Everything Is Fine” are all long gone from the chats. So are many of the liberals. By then, Silicon Valley was moving right. In May of 2022, Andreessen asked the conservative academic Richard Hanania to “make me a chat of smart right-wing people,” Hanania recalled. As requested, he assembled eight or ten people —&nbsp;elite law students and federal court clerks, as well as Torenberg and Katherine Boyle, a former Washington Post reporter then at a16z and focused on investing in “American Dynamism.” Later, Hanania added the broadcaster Tucker Carlson.</p><p>The substance of the chats no longer exists, but Signal preserved the group’s rotating names, which Andreessen enjoyed changing. The names, Hanania said after checking Signal, included:</p><p><em>Last Men, apparently</em></p><p><em>Matt Yglesias Fan Club</em></p><p><em>James Burnham Fan Club</em></p><p><em>Biden 2024 Reelect Committee</em></p><p><em>Journalism Deniers and Richard</em></p><p>The tone was jesting, but “Marc radicalized over time,” Hanania recalled. Hanania said he found himself increasingly alienated from the group and the shift toward partisan pro-Trump politics, and he came to see the chat he’d established as a “vehicle for groupthink.” (A friend of Andreessen’s said it was Hanania, not Andreessen, who had shifted his politics.) The group continues without him.</p><p>Hanania argued with the other members “about whether it’s a good idea to buy into Trump’s election denial stuff. I’d say, ‘That’s not true and that actually matters.’ I got the sense these guys didn’t want to hear it,” he said. “There’s an idea that you don’t criticize, because what really matters is defeating the left.” He left the group in June of 2023.</p><h3>Chatham House Rule</h3><p>Torenberg launched Chatham House the summer of 2024, naming it after a British think tank that <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule" rel="noopener" target="_blank">formalized</a> the insight that trusted conversations require a degree of privacy. Two of its conservative participants said they see the group as a way to shift centrist Trump-curious figures to the Republican side, but its founder said he’d begun it to have “a left-right exchange where we could have real conversations because of filter bubble group chats.”</p><p>Chatham House includes high-profile figures like the economist Larry Summers and the historian Niall Ferguson, and more partisan figures like Shapiro and the Democratic analyst David Shor. Andreessen lurks. But several participants described it to me as something like a gladiatorial arena with Cuban most often in the center, sparring with conservatives.</p><p>(“no idea what you are talking about :)” Cuban emailed in response to an inquiry about his arguments on Chatham House.)</p><p>The Group Chat Era depended on part of the American elite feeling shut out from public spaces, and on the formation of a new conservative consensus. Both of those are now fading (though Torenberg has invested in a company called ChatBCC that wants to commercialize the heady experience of sitting in on texts among the power elite).</p><p>Since Elon Musk turned X to the right and an alternative media ecosystem emerged on Substack, “a tremendous amount of the verboten conversations can now shift back into public view,” Andreessen told Fridman. “It’s much healthier to live in a society in which people are literally not scared of what they’re saying.”</p><p>And Trump’s destabilizing “Liberation Day” has taken its toll on the coalition Andreessen helped shape. You can see it on X, where investors joke that they’ll put pronouns back in their bios in exchange for a return to the 2024 stock prices, and where Srinivasan has been a <a href="https://x.com/balajis/status/1897542165750014079" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leading critic</a> of Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>“Group chats have changed on the economy in the last few weeks,” said Rufo. “There’s a big split on the tech right.”</p><p>The polarity of social media has also reversed, and while participants used to keep their conservative ideas off social media, “now the anti-Trump sentiment is what you’re afraid to say on X,” one said.</p><p>By mid-April, Sacks had had enough with Chatham House: “This group has become worthless since the loudest voices have TDS,” he wrote, shorthanding “Trump Derangement Syndrome.” Then he addressed Torenberg: “You should create a new one with just smart people.”</p><p>Signal soon showed that three men had left the group: The Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire, the bitcoin billionaire Tyler Winklevoss, and Carlson.</p><figure><img alt="Chatham House Rule" loading="lazy" width="800" height="610" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://img.semafor.com/15c94736885544d28723ccb76cb759f138eceef9-2560x1952.png?w=828&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format 1x, https://img.semafor.com/15c94736885544d28723ccb76cb759f138eceef9-2560x1952.png?w=1920&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format 2x" src="https://img.semafor.com/15c94736885544d28723ccb76cb759f138eceef9-2560x1952.png?w=1920&amp;q=75&amp;auto=format"></figure></div></div>]]></description>
