<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content">
        <p>March 1, 2025</p>
<h2 id="a-letter-to-the-american-people" tabindex="-1"><strong>A letter to the American People:</strong></h2>
<p>For over 11 years, 18F has been proudly serving you to make government technology work better. We are non-partisan civil servants. 18F has worked on hundreds of projects, all designed to make government technology not just efficient but effective, and to save money for American taxpayers.</p>
<p>However, all employees at 18F – a group that the Trump Administration GSA Technology Transformation Services Director called "the gold standard" of civic tech – were terminated today at midnight ET.</p>
<h2 id="18f-was-doing-exactly-the-type-of-work-that-doge-claims-to-want-yet-we-were-eliminated" tabindex="-1">18F was doing exactly the type of work that DOGE claims to want – yet we were eliminated.</h2>
<p>When former Tesla engineer Thomas Shedd took the position of TTS director and met with TTS including 18F on February 3, 2025, he acknowledged that the group is <strong>the “gold standard” of civic technologists</strong> and that “you guys have been doing this far longer than I’ve been even aware that your group exists.” He repeatedly emphasized the importance of the work, and the value of the talent that the teams bring to government.</p>
<h2 id="despite-that-skill-and-knowledge-at-midnight-et-on-march-1-the-entirety-of-18f-received-notice-that-our-positions-had-been-eliminated" tabindex="-1">Despite that skill and knowledge, at midnight ET on March 1, the entirety of 18F received notice that our positions had been eliminated.</h2>
<p>The letter said that 18F "has been identified as part of this phase of GSA’s Reduction in Force (RIF) as non-critical”.</p>
<p>"This decision was made with explicit direction from the top levels of leadership within both the Administration and GSA," Shedd said in an email shortly after we were given notice.</p>
<p>This was a surprise to all 18F staff and our agency partners. Just yesterday we were working on important projects, including improving access to weather data with NOAA, making it easier and faster to get a passport with the Department of State, supporting free tax filing with the IRS, and other critical projects with organizations at the federal and state levels.</p>
<p>All of that work has now abruptly come to a halt. Since the entire staff was also placed on administrative leave, we have been locked out of our computers, and have no chance to assist in an orderly transition in our work. We don’t even have access to our personal employment data. We’re supposed to return our equipment, but can’t use our email to find out how or where.</p>
<h2 id="dismantling-18f-follows-the-gutting-of-the-original-us-digital-service-these-cuts-are-just-the-most-recent-in-a-series-of-a-sledgehammer-approach-to-the-critical-us-teams-supporting-it-infrastructure" tabindex="-1">Dismantling 18F follows the gutting of the original US Digital Service. These cuts are just the most recent in a series of a sledgehammer approach to the critical US teams supporting IT infrastructure.</h2>
<p>Before today’s RIF, DOGE members and GSA political appointees demanded and took access to IT systems that hold sensitive information. They ignored security precautions. Some who pushed back on this questionable behavior resigned rather than grant access. Others were met with reprisals like being booted from work communication channels.</p>

<p>We’re still absorbing what has happened. We’re wrestling with what it will mean for ourselves and our families, as well as the impact on our partners and the American people.</p>
<p>But we came to the government to fix things. And we’re not done with this work yet.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>

In association with Berlin's long-time hacker space <a href="https://c-base.org/">c-base</a> we're hosting the first of a quarterly Swapfest at their space in Kreuzberg.
      This is a place to buy, sell, and swap electronics, computer equipment, and
      tools.
</p> <p>
In tune with the spirit of right-to-repair as well as re-use; the goal of
      the Berlin Swapfest is for people to bring electronics, equipment, and
      tools they no longer use, but want to bring to a good home. If you've been
      trying to find the perfect equipment to build your home-lab or looking for
      new electronic components or tools, this should be the place for you.
</p> <h2> <span>F</span><span>A</span><span>Q</span> </h2>  <div> <p>
Being a seller will always be free. Depending on the size of the item
        you're bringing you may be asked for a deposit to handle disposal of
        your items should you not bring it back home with you.
</p> <p>
However, we highly encourage you to only bring items you're comfortable
        bringing back home with you.
</p> </div>  <di> <p>
Yes, c-base will provide space and tables for sellers. Space will be
        allocated based on registration information. If you forgot to register
        as a seller, it may be possible to sell items at a table
        space-permitting.
</p> </di>  <p>
We have no requirements with how to exchange goods; if you choose to use
        PayPal, Cryptocurrency, or cash, it is entirely up to you. Any disputes
        must be taken up with the seller. Only in the case of a breach of c-base
        rules will a team member step in.

<h3>February 24 2025</h3>

<p>Building <a href="https://underpassapp.com/StopTheMadness/">StopTheMadness Pro</a> in Xcode is usually very fast, because my project doesn't use any Swift. It's a combination of Objective-C, which compiles much more quickly than Swift, and JavaScript, which doesn't need to be compiled. However, sometimes the builds were very slow for some strange reason. Checking the Xcode build transcripts, I found that the delay was in the "Gather provisioning inputs" build phase.</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2025/2/5.png" width="425" height="145" alt="Xcode build messages"></p>
<p>This one phase took 50.6 seconds when the entire build was 56.8 seconds!</p>
<p>I tested with my internet disabled, and the slow builds did not occur. Obviously, though, it's impractical to disable my internet every time I want to build and run. After all, my project is a Safari extension! I do use <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/">Little Snitch</a>, but I had previously allowed all connections from Xcode to <code>apple.com</code>, because that's required to upload builds to App Store Connect. When I scrutinized the individual Xcode connections with Little Snitch, I saw that <code>developerservices2.apple.com</code> was responsible for the slow "Gathering provisioning inputs" build phase. When I denied those connections with Little Snitch, my builds were always fast. And successful. The build phase is <em>mostly</em> unnecessary.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/756120">thread in the Apple Developer Forums</a> that discusses the problem, mentioning the <code>-allowProvisioningUpdates</code> option of the command-line <code>xcodebuild</code> tool. From the <code>man</code> page:</p>
<blockquote>Allow xcodebuild to communicate with the Apple Developer website.
           For automatically signed targets, xcodebuild will create and update
           profiles, app IDs, and certificates. For manually signed targets,
           xcodebuild will download missing or updated provisioning profiles.
           Requires a developer account to have been added in Xcode's Accounts
           preference pane.</blockquote>
<p>Connecting to <code>developerservices2.apple.com</code>, and to some other domains, is required in order to upload a build to App Store Connect. For most local builds, on the other hand, the "Gathering provisioning inputs" build phase is unnecessary and can slow down the build considerably. Thus, I've now denied Xcode connections to <code>developerservices2.apple.com</code> by default in Little Snitch and disable the rule only when uploading to App Store Connect.</p>
<p>During my investigation of slow builds, I noticed some other frequent Xcode connections. For example, Xcode connects to <code>devimages-cdn.apple.com</code> every time it launches. According to Apple's support document <a href="https://support.apple.com/101555">Use Apple products on enterprise networks</a>, that domain is used for "Xcode downloadable components". I assume this refers to platform support in the Components pane of Xcode Settings. (Note that the document doesn't mention <code>developerservices2.apple.com</code>.) Again, though, it's unnecessary to check for updates on every launch. I'd rather not tell Apple whenever I launch Xcode, or whenever I make a local build of my app. It certainly doesn't align with Apple's claim that they believe privacy is a fundamental human right. Or perhaps Apple believes that developers are subhuman…</p>
<p>I've saved the worst for last. For some reason, Xcode phones home to <code>appstoreconnect.apple.com</code> every time I open an Xcode project. This also appears to be unnecessary, and I experience no problems after denying the connections in Little Snitch, so I do! I assume that the connections send identifying information about the Xcode project to Apple, otherwise why even make the connections when opening a project? And all of these connections from Xcode, to every domain, require login to your Apple Developer account, so Apple is definitely receiving identifying information about you in any case.</p>
<p>In effect, Xcode is a developer analytics collection mechanism, whether you like it or not, which I don't.</p>

Then, something interesting happened at her local coffee shop, her employer's healthcare costs, and the global economy.</p><p>In six months, Lisa stopped buying her daily morning muffin, causing the coffee shop to lose $600 in annual revenue from one customer. Within a year, she canceled her beer-of-the-month subscription and stopped ordering late-night DoorDash. By 2023, her grocery bill dropped 40%, alcohol spending fell 85%, and impulse Amazon purchases plunged 60%.</p><p>Lisa is one person. Her story will become the story of hundreds of millions. That's where this becomes intriguing.</p><p>Economic revolutions rarely come from expected sources. Despite the AI hype, the biggest transformation of our lifetime might come from diabetes drugs.</p><p>Let me explain why this is more important than you realize.</p><p>If you told someone in 1850 that air conditioning would reshape the global economy, they'd think you were crazy. But it made the American South habitable year-round, revolutionized manufacturing in hot climates, and enabled computing by keeping servers cool. The most significant changes arise from the most surprising sources.</p><p>GLP-1 drugs are our air conditioner moment.</p><p>We're not just talking about weight loss. We're discussing the first medication that effectively regulates human impulse control. Think about that.</p><p>Our economy is built on impulses.

But those projections, impressive as they seem, fail to capture the full picture like 1995 internet forecasts.</p><p>They're focusing on the first-order effects: weight loss, healthcare savings, reduced food consumption.</p><p>The significant economic impact occurs in the second and third-order effects.</p><p>Consider this: When alcohol consumption drops 40% (as it does for many people on these medications), we're not just talking about lower beer sales. We're talking about:</p><p>- 45% reduction in DUIs</p><p>- A 28% drop in violent crime</p><p>- A fundamental restructuring of the social economy</p><p>- A transformation of dating apps and social media engagement</p><p>- A reimagining of every restaurant's business model</p><p>When companies like Google see their healthcare costs drop by $12,000 per employee annually and productivity increase by 25%, we observe a restructuring of corporate America that makes remote work a minor adjustment.</p><p>The real economic impact occurs in the second and third-order effects. In complex systems, the most interesting changes occur at the edges.</p><p>Let me show you what I mean.</p><p>A movie theater chain recently analyzed their user data and discovered that 72% of their profits came from concessions, primarily from impulse purchases made by people who swore they "wouldn't buy anything."</p><p>Imagine a world where those impulses are chemically regulated.</p><p>AMC Theaters is testing "micro-portion" concessions and "experience-focused" premium seating. But they're missing the bigger picture: When human impulse control changes, the entire entertainment venue business model must change.</p><p>The NFL understands this better than most. They're redesigning stadiums for 2026, converting 40% of their concession space into "experience zones." They know that in five years, selling $14 beers and $8 hot dogs won't pay the bills. The future is about selling experiences that don't rely on impulse purchases.</p><p>But here's where it gets interesting.</p><p>Consider your struggling local mall. About 40% of its remaining retail tenants rely on impulse purchases for profitability. When those impulses disappear, so does the traditional retail model.</p><p>America's largest mall operator, Simon Property Group, is converting anchor stores into medical centers and wellness spaces. They're doing this because they recognize the writing on the wall.</p><p>The advertising industry is the most fascinating case study.</p><p>For decades, the advertising model was simple: Trigger an emotional response, create an impulse, convert it into a purchase. This foundation supports the $400 billion global advertising industry.</p><p>What happens when those emotional triggers stop working?</p><p>Early consumer data on GLP-1s shows:</p><p>- 65% reduction in response to food advertising</p><p>- 40% lower click-through rates on impulse products</p><p>- 85% decrease in late-night online shopping</p><p>Madison Avenue is quietly panicking. One major agency (which asked not to be named) estimates that 50% of their current advertising strategies will be obsolete by 2027. They are right to worry.</p><p>Here's the plot twist: A new marketing economy is emerging while traditional advertising declines.</p><p>Companies that understand this are adapting:</p><p>- Whole Foods is shifting from endcap promotions to subscription services.</p><p>- Nike is shifting from "Just Do It" impulse messaging to long-term wellness partnerships.</p><p>- American Express is restructuring rewards from dining cashback to health incentives.</p><p>The real estate market is undergoing a transformation.</p><p>A commercial real estate firm modeled the impact of 30% of restaurants reducing their footprint by 40% (current 2028 projection). The result? About 95 million square feet of retail space will need repurposing.</p><p>That's equivalent to 57 Mall of Americas.</p><p>The interesting part isn't the empty space. It's what's filling it: Medical clinics, wellness centers, experience venues, and micro-fulfillment centers for the new economy.</p><p>The pattern here isn't just about decline; it's about transformation.</p><p>Industries built on immediate gratification must answer an uncomfortable question: What's your business model when humans can regulate their impulses?</p><p>Some industries are finding fascinating answers:</p><p>- Movie theaters becoming "social experience centers"</p><p>- Retail spaces becoming venues to "try before you subscribe"</p><p>- Restaurants becoming "social nutrition centers"</p><p>- Shopping malls converting to "wellness districts"</p><p>The smartest players aren't fighting the change. They're surfing the wave.</p><p>Look at Las Vegas. Five major casinos are redesigning their floor plans, shrinking restaurant and bar space by 35% and expanding wellness spas and medical tourism facilities. Vegas, the city built on impulse spending, is investing in the post-impulse economy.</p><p>But here's where it gets darker, and why this story is more significant than the raw numbers suggest.</p><p>Throughout history, every major advancement in human capability has created winners and losers. The industrial revolution created unprecedented wealth while displacing millions. The internet democratized information while decimating traditional industries.</p><p>These drugs create the biggest capability gap between humans since literacy.</p><p>Imagine two employees. One can afford these medications, the other cannot. One has regulated impulses, higher energy, better focus, and lower healthcare costs. The other doesn't. In a few years, data shows the first is three times more likely to be promoted.</p><p>Scale that across society.</p><p>We expect by 2030:</p><p>- 80% coverage in the top income quintile</p><p>- 5% coverage in the bottom quintile</p><p>- An 8:1 access ratio between urban and rural areas</p><p>- A 35% productivity gap between users and non-users</p><p>This isn't just about economics anymore. It's about the society we're creating.</p><p>The optimist in me sees the potential: A healthier, more productive society with lower healthcare costs, less crime, and higher economic output. The $612 billion annual savings could transform American society.</p><p>The realist in me sees the challenges: 8.5 million jobs at risk, widening inequality, and a two-tier society divided not by education or wealth, but by behavioral control.</p><p>The historian in me knows every major economic transformation has been messy, complicated, and unstoppable.</p><p>Here's what I keep returning to: In 1903, the Wright brothers flew their first plane. By 1914, we conducted aerial warfare. By 1969, we were on the moon. The gap between invention and transformation is shrinking with each technological leap.</p><p>We're at the beginning of something similar. This time, we're not transforming transportation, information, or manufacturing. We're transforming human behavior.</p><p>The $100 trillion figure in the title isn't hyperbole; it's conservative. When you change how hundreds of millions of people make decisions, the economic impact is incalculable.</p><p>Ask Lisa's coffee shop.</p><p>The question isn't whether this transformation is coming, but whether we're ready for it and can manage it better than previous economic revolutions.</p><p>History suggests we won't get it right. Trying to stop it would be like halting the internet in 1995.</p><p>The future is coming, one injection at a time. The only question is whether we will shape it or let it shape us.</p><p>______</p><p>Did this post resonate with you? If you found value in these insights, let us know!

  <p>A quick-fun story.</p><p>My (ops-but-sometimes-writes-scripts-to-help-out) coworker just tapped on my shoulder and asked me to look at his code that wasn't working. It was a bit something like this:</p><pre><code>User.includes(investments: -&gt; { where(state: :draft) })...</code></pre><p>This is <em>not</em> a feature of <code>ActiveRecord</code> or any libraries that I'm aware of. I asked him why he thought this was valid syntax, and he pulled up his ChatGPT history. It looked something like this:</p><blockquote><p>Ask: How can I dynamically preload an association with conditions in rails? (Potentially followed up with - no custom has_many associations, no preloader object, don't filter the base query, etc.)</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, you're routed to the correct answer. Which is to add the filter you want on the associated record as a standard where clause, and also add a <code>.references(:association)</code> to the query chain. Like so:</p><pre><code>User.includes(:investments).where(investments: { state: :draft }).references(:investments) </code></pre><p>However, with just a few tests, you're usually routed to that bizarre, non-existent syntax of including a lambda as a keyword argument value to the association you want it applied to. I recreated this a few times below:</p><div><action-text-attachment sgid="eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ImdpZDovL2hhaGFoYWNvcm4vQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi8xP2V4cGlyZXNfaW4iLCJwdXIiOiJhdHRhY2hhYmxlIn19--7e4233327ddf1c739bdd5ab7ddce6b63c9eeeb55" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://bengarcia.dev/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f8e927e75208ce1a199268fe64cb81eb97003c7e/o3-mini.jpg" filename="o3-mini.jpg" filesize="100324" width="1548" height="518" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="o3-mini"><figure>

<p>This is the story of our three year long journey to turn a fleet of laptops into what can only be described as the world’s most unhinged video wall.</p>
<p>This project was a collaboration with my friend <a href="https://akselsalmi.com/">Aksel Salmi</a>. I was responsible for the software, and he designed the incredible hardware, see <a href="https://akselsalmi.com/blog/videowall">his blog</a> to learn about the unexpectedly complex hardware needed to mount these dismantled computers<a href="#common-app-note" id="common-app-ref" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>About three years ago, my Design teacher (The amazing Mr. Bush) came to us with an idea - our school was about to dispose of its fleet of Chromebooks, and he was wondering if we could build anything with them.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/fleet.avif 766w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/fleet.webp 766w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/fleet.png" alt="Tons of Chromebooks" width="766" height="536"></picture></p>
<h2 id="meet-the-lenovo-thinkpad-11e" tabindex="-1">Meet the Lenovo ThinkPad 11e <a href="#meet-the-lenovo-thinkpad-11e">#</a></h2>
<p>The Lenovo ThinkPad 11e could very well be the world’s worst laptop. It is also the standard-issue school laptop that reinforced eight-year-old me’s interest in computers.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/5th-grade.avif 1280w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/5th-grade.webp 1280w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/5th-grade.jpeg" alt="Picture of me using a ThinkPad 11e in 5th grade" width="1280" height="853"></picture>
<em>We used this school-issued laptop through primary and the start of middle school. This is me in 5th grade using a school laptop while working on my PYP Exhibition project (a game on Scratch)<a href="#scratch-note" id="scratch-ref" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a>.</em></p>
<p>Despite my emotional connection to them, today these devices are, for all intents and purposes, junk. And for that reason, my school began the process of replacing them (with marginally less junky laptops)</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/thinkpad-product-image.avif 1500w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/thinkpad-product-image.webp 1500w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/thinkpad-product-image.png" alt="Product photo of Lenovo ThinkPad 11e Chromebook" width="1500" height="1500"></picture></p>
<p>These things don’t receive software updates from Google anymore, they struggle loading most webpages and to top it off, they’re tied to some long forgotten Enterprise Enrolment system, so they can’t even be used without a school Google account.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-video-wall" tabindex="-1">What is a video wall? <a href="#what-is-a-video-wall">#</a></h2>
<p>A video wall is a large display made up of multiple screens arranged together to create a single, seamless display across all the screens. In the case of our project, we decided to try reusing the laptop screens to build a video wall.</p>
<h2 id="can-we-drive-the-screens-using-separate-hardware" tabindex="-1">Can we drive the screens using separate hardware? <a href="#can-we-drive-the-screens-using-separate-hardware">#</a></h2>
<p>Our first idea was to harvest just the laptop display panels and somehow drive them using a powerful computer that could power the 10 screens simultaneously. We did not go this route (due to the fact that we had no idea what we were doing, and a quick estimate of the time and costs involved scared us away).</p>
<h2 id="okay-before-we-try-anything-else-let-s-just-try-synchronising-a-video-across-two-devices" tabindex="-1">Okay, before we try anything else, let’s just try synchronising a video across two devices <a href="#okay-before-we-try-anything-else-let-s-just-try-synchronising-a-video-across-two-devices">#</a></h2>
<p>Since the screens were attached to perfectly functional laptops, it was quickly apparent that we’d probably be better off letting each screen be driven independently by their own laptop motherboards.</p>
<p>At this point, there were still many questions (eg. how were we going to do that on <em>Chromebooks</em>), so we put aside that challenge to focus on the new issue this brings up: Can we synchronise a single video across multiple computers?</p>
<p>Our experiments brought us to the school’s computer lab, where we experimented with VLC’s streaming abilities to get a stream synchronised across devices on a single network, but this posed two challenges: This system is not designed for videos being <em>perfectly</em> in sync, nor was it designed for two clients to receive different video inputs (because the whole point of the video wall is to display one loooooong video across the screens, not 10 repeat copies of the same video).</p>
<p>We were stuck here until my ““breakthrough””.</p>
<p>For context, the story is currently in 2022. Two years earlier, I had been locked up in my room due to the COVID lockdown, and in this time, I had loads of fun building random realtime web apps, like a chat app and multiplayer drawing game. These apps worked thanks to <code>socket.io</code>, a (primarily) WebSocket based library that allows for low-latency, bi-directional communication.</p>

<em>Screenshot of a chat site I made to pass the time during the 2020 lockdown</em></p>
<p>I realised that my best bet to get videos synchronised would be by using a web page that used <code>socket.io</code> to sync the video playback across clients. Yes, there are better approaches, but simply doing something like this worked unreasonably well, all things considered.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>video</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>...<span>"</span></span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>video<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>video</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>

	videoElement<span>.</span><span>play</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>I named this ExpressJS server/client system <code>c-sync</code><a href="#c-sync-note" id="c-sync-ref" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to c-sync (and tons of tinkering), after some time we had decently synchronised videos across computer screens through a webpage (or at least it seemed like it, testing on these desktop computers)</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/3-screen-sync.avif 1280w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/3-screen-sync.webp 1280w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/3-screen-sync.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720"></picture></p>
<p>As it turns out, in reality, the Chromebooks are too slow for this to be a reliable approach to synchronising playback, and tiny discrepancies in loading times + latency + system clocks etc. lead to videos not being synchronised.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not entirely sure <em>why</em> this works so well, but I came up with a ridiculous solution by accident. When videos reach the end of playback, each client emits the start event.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>video<span>.</span><span>onended</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
	socket<span>.</span><span>emit</span><span>(</span><span>"start"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
	<span>// yes seriously, this is all I needed</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>This means that the slowest computers hold back the fastest computers, and get the chance to load the videos. This also means looping can be a very slightly jittery process (with each screen receiving 10 ‘start’ events), but as long as the first couple frames of the video are identical, nobody would even notice.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Sidenote: why not schedule with timestamps
</summary>
Modern computers have clocks you can rely on to be extremely precise. This plus regular NTP synchronisations means a reasonable person might just try to ensure the full video is cached, then just send a 'start' event to each client that schedules the client to start playback at a given timestamp. Unfortunately, these Chromebooks could not reliably keep track of time within milliseconds of each other, so this method didn't work for us.
</details>
<p>Using this method, we have nearly perfectly synchronised video playback, and can play any video on any screen (meaning we can split a wide video into 10 segments, and each computer displays its respective part, all in sync with eachother)</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-together" tabindex="-1">Putting it together <a href="#putting-it-together">#</a></h2>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/chromebook-parts.avif 1016w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/chromebook-parts.webp 1016w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/chromebook-parts.jpeg" alt="Bare laptop motherboard, keyboard and screen" width="1016" height="1280"></picture>
<em>A disassembled Chromebook open to a test video</em></p>
<p>We reached this stage within a month or two. Believe it or not, this project still had three years of work ahead of us. The biggest issue was Chromebook software. At this point, we had a website that we could manually open on each laptop to display a fullscreen synchronised video.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would want this to be entirely automated, so that as soon as a Chromebook receives power, it boots up automagically to the c-sync client page. Unfortunately, right now, booting the Chromebook would just take you to a Google login page (and one that was locked to our school domain <em>to boot</em>).</p>
<p>Also, just to add insult to injury, when batteries are removed, the laptops don’t turn themselves on when they receive power (you have to hold down the power button)</p>
<p>This meant that our next step would have to be to replace ChromeOS with something else.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/fwscript.html#overview">‘ChromeOS Firmware Recovery Script’</a> is a magical piece of technology that somehow supports many different Chromebook motherboards. Ours was called ‘GLIMMER’. We just had to enter the built-in ‘Recovery Mode’, enable ‘Developer Mode’ and use the ChromeOS Shell to run the script.</p>
<p>Now we’re basically on the home stretch. All we needed to do was pick up some stable Linux distro, write a hacky startup script that loads up Chromium and simulates the keystrokes to fullscreen the video and we’re done!</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/xfce-chromebooks.avif 1280w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/xfce-chromebooks.webp 1280w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/xfce-chromebooks.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="960"></picture></p>
<p>We ran in to two main issues: Some Chromebooks (roughly half of our working laptops) would refuse to enter developer mode due to the enterprise enrolment, and while we were able to get the other half onto a Linux distro, video playback would consistently freeze after some time (actually they would lock up entirely).</p>
<p>It took us several months of on-and-off experimentation to figure out what to do. Essentially, the solution was to overwrite the entire default firmware with <code>coreboot</code> (which is also possible using MrChromebox’s script). We just needed to remove the ‘Write Protection’ screw from each laptop motherboard, and this seemed to bypass the enrolment too.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/write-protection-diagram.avif 1155w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/write-protection-diagram.webp 1155w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/write-protection-diagram.png" alt="Write protection screw diagram" width="1155" height="833"></picture>
<em>Lenovo’s handy Write Protection screw diagram</em></p>
<p>Doing this for 20+ computers was slow and tedious. We only really needed the WiFi, motherboard and screen in working condition, but we decided to be (mostly) gentle and keep the laptops looking like laptops so that we had a keyboard and mouse for the rest of the installation steps.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/remove-write-protection-screw-with-this-easy-trick.avif 1536w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/remove-write-protection-screw-with-this-easy-trick.webp 1536w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/remove-write-protection-screw-with-this-easy-trick.jpeg" alt="Efficiently removing write protection screw by bending plastic enclsoure" width="1536" height="2048"></picture>
<em>By the end, we got quite efficient at removing the write protection screw</em></p>
<p>After ‘corebooting’ the Chromebooks, we were also pleasantly surprised to find out that ‘Wake on AC’ was a feature of the firmware, and that video playback no longer randomly breaks. By this point we had enough non-bricked Chromebooks left over for a line of 10 screens and a handful of spares.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-stretch" tabindex="-1">The Final Stretch <a href="#the-final-stretch">#</a></h2>
<p>Now we’re really on the final stretch. Aksel worked on the mounting hardware, which you can <a href="https://akselsalmi.com/blog/videowall">read about on his blog</a>, while I worked on figuring out a less flaky way to ‘boot to a webpage’ than the keystroke simulation and startup script I bodged together.</p>
<p>I previously used <a href="https://github.com/guysoft/FullPageOS">the aptly named ‘FullPageOS’</a> for a different project (which I briefly mention in <a href="https://youtu.be/gzc1p_QlO2I?t=457">my TED talk, which you should watch</a>), but it doesn’t run on x86 hardware.</p>
<p>I landed on using ‘Porteus Kiosk’, which is just a minimal Linux distro that opens a fullscreen Chromium browser with all the correct flags for hands-off usage (eg. allowing video playback without user interaction)</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/porteus.avif 768w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/porteus.webp 768w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/porteus.jpeg" alt="Dismantled laptop with Porteus installer" width="768" height="1024"></picture></p>
<p>This honestly worked totally fine, but left me unsatisfied for two reasons. Firstly, I didn’t like how we couldn’t customise the splash screen, so our project would be forever stamped with the Porteus logo on every startup (which would be every morning). And secondly, in search of a better issue to justify the extra work, I realised we can’t remotely do anything to the installations (eg. changing the page URL) without re-doing them, which would be definitely a problem once these get mounted on the wall.</p>
<p>For those good reasons, I embarked on the journey of building ‘my own distro’ that we could install on the laptops. The system should start with something minimal (no desktop environment), and have an elegant script to autostart a kiosk mode Chromium instance.</p>
<p>I first tried NixOS before quickly realising there was no way it would work with the tiny amount of storage on these Chromebooks (and it failed to install with every single attempt).</p>
<p>Then I gave up, started with a Debian minimal install and just wrote a script that would provision a client (generate a ‘KIOSK_ID’, set its hostname to <code>csync-client-$KIOSK_ID</code>, connect to the school’s WiFi, create users/permissions and set up <code>openbox</code> to autostart a fullscreen kiosk mode Chromium).</p>
<p>Then after attempting to repeat this on a second machine, I realised I would be wasting so much time (installing Debian is very ‘hands-on’ - you need to press lots of buttons), and I discovered ‘FAI - Fully Automatic Installation’ and the web <a href="https://fai-project.org/FAIme/">FAI.me</a> tool. To cut a long story short<a href="#fai-note" id="fai-ref" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[4]</a>, after redoing everything for the millionth time, I had a single USB that I can plug in to any ‘corebooted’ Chromebook which provisions it as a c-sync client. Woohoo!</p>
<p>I also built out a ‘controller’ for c-sync which lets us manage connected clients and assign them videos.</p>

<p>After a successful three day stress test where the playback remained butter-smooth (and I sacrificed my ability to sleep for the greater good of testing with the backlight on), we were ready to mount these laptops on the wall.</p>

<h2 id="one-last-thing" tabindex="-1">One last thing… <a href="#one-last-thing">#</a></h2>
<p>After we painstakingly mounted everything, I realised something sort-of important. Computers generate heat. Somewhere along the way of wiping away the firmwares, the laptop fans stopped spinning, which meant things get quite hot quite quickly. I had to figure out a way to get those working again before we could comfortably leave this up 24/7 (well, actually 12/7).</p>
<h3 id="embedded-controllers" tabindex="-1">Embedded Controllers <a href="#embedded-controllers">#</a></h3>
<p>You can apparently interface with the <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/embedded-controller">‘ChromeOS Embedded Controller’</a> using a tool called <code>ectool</code>, which should allow you to manually set fan speeds (among other things). The online documentation for this is lacking, and there’s apparently a slightly different <code>ectool</code> from <code>coreboot</code> and from Google directly. None of this made much sense at all to me, and no built <code>ectool</code> binary I could find would work. At some point, I found a dead link, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tree123.org/files/utils/ectool">thanks to the magic of the Wayback Machine</a>, I was able to get my hands on something that wouldn’t immediately crash.</p>
<p>By some miracle, this version of the tool actually works perfectly fine at setting fan speeds, and after some testing, I found some goldilocks values that balance noise and temperature.</p>
<h2 id="aside-making-videos-for-the-thing" tabindex="-1">Aside: Making Videos for the Thing <a href="#aside-making-videos-for-the-thing">#</a></h2>
<p>As it turns out, making such a wide video is actually not easy. Each display has a resolution of 1366× 768, and very few pieces of software will let you edit a 13660 × 768 video. Final Cut Pro and Blender are the only programs we were able to do anything this wide in.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/blender.avif 2032w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/blender.webp 2032w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://varun.ch/posts/videowall/blender.png" alt="Screenshot of Blender" width="2032" height="1167"></picture>
<em>Blender is one of the greatest pieces of software ever created (alongside c-sync)</em></p>

<p>Our video wall is imperfect. TN panel viewing angles suck, and the screens vary in colours and stuff. Yes, the synchronisation isn’t <em>perfect</em>, and yes, I’m sure there were better alternatives for nearly every decision we made along the way.</p>
<p>Yet I love our video wall, despite how absurdly weird it is. It’s a perfect representation of the iterative design process and a true testament to teamwork and collaboration. We turned E-Waste into something interesting. And maybe, just maybe, the real video wall was the friends we made along the way.</p>
<hr>
<p>This project was made possible by the incredible work of so many people. Aside from my collaborator Aksel Salmi, our Design teacher Daniel Bush played a huge role in guiding us through the project.</p>
<p>Additionally, I wanted to thank the <a href="https://coreboot.org/">coreboot project</a> and Matt ‘MrChromebox’ DeVillier for hacking together <a href="https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/">the firmware and tools</a> that allowed any of this to work. I would also like to thank Thomas Lange of the <a href="https://fai-project.org/">FAI project</a> for his help in building the FAI.me based automated installer that saved us so many many many hours, as well as his support over email.</p>
<p>As silly as it sounds, this project was a backbone in my high-school experience. We hacked away at it over years, and grew up along the way too.</p>

        <p>Servo aims to empower developers with a lightweight, high-performance alternative for embedding web technologies in applications. Servo is a web browser rendering engine written in Rust, with WebGL and WebGPU support, and adaptable to desktop, mobile, and embedded applications.</p>
<p>Created by Mozilla Research in 2012, the Servo project is a research and development effort. It is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, taking advantage of the memory safety properties and concurrency features of the language. Work on Servo has helped contribute to W3C and WHATWG web standards, reporting specification issues and submitting new cross-browser automated tests, and core team members have co-edited new standards that have been adopted by other browsers. As a novel engine without origins in Gecko or WebKit, the Servo project helps drive the entire web platform forward.</p>
<p>In 2020, Mozilla Research handed stewardship over to the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>.  In 2023, thanks to some external funding and investment of their own, <a href="https://thenewstack.io/igalia-the-open-source-powerhouse-youve-never-heard-of/">Igalia</a> got involved and the project moved to <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/">Linux Foundation Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Funds from this collective will be used first to cover infrastructure costs that keep engine releases available, integrated with Web Platform Tests, and so on. Once those needs are met, extra available funds can be applied toward sponsoring more infra costs related to improvements or development.</p>
<p>Once those needs are met, extra available funds can be applied toward sponsoring more infra costs related to improvements or development. The Servo Technical Steering Committee will collectively discuss how to prioritize the spending of available funds in the <a href="https://github.com/servo/project/blob/main/governance/tsc/README.md">public monthly calls</a>.</p>

As part of the process of compilation with Webpack a minifier step combines all the source code into this file and truncates the symbols.</p><figure><img src="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/03/CleanShot-2025-03-01-at-17.14.43.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="831" height="598" srcset="https://ghuntley.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/CleanShot-2025-03-01-at-17.14.43.png 600w, https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/03/CleanShot-2025-03-01-at-17.14.43.png 831w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="so-lets-pull-it-apart">so let's pull it apart</h2><p>If you want to this at home. Your first task to is open up <code>cli.mjs</code> within your favourite AI coding assistant or even Claude Code itself. Due to the "safety rails and AI alignment" you'll need to strip the top comments from the application otherwise they will kick in unless you use an LLM such as Grok which has no guard rails.</p><p>Here's the prompt that I used.</p><blockquote>CLI.js is a commonjs typescript application which has been compiled with webpack. <br>The symbols have been stripped. <br>Inspect the source code thoroughly (extra thinking) but skip the SentrySDK source code. <br>Create a specification library of features of the application. <br>Convert the source code into human readable. <br>Keep going until you are done!</blockquote><p>Because <code>cli.mjs</code> is close to 5mb - which is way bigger than any LLM context window out here. It shouldn't work but it does. You're going to need babysit it for a while and feed it reward tokens of kind words ("<em>your doing good, please continue</em>") and encourage it to keep on going on - even if it gives up.

This is when you need to do the "new meta" of asking the LLM to write out the technical specification library. I say new meta because - hi folks - welcome, I haven't talked about this yet publicly yet but the results of this technique when used in combination with the "<a href="https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/">old meta</a>" are truly absurd.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Zen 5 is AMD's first core to use full-width AVX-512 datapaths. Its vector execution units are 512 bits wide, and its L1 data cache can service two 512-bit loads per cycle. Intel went straight to 512-bit datapaths with Skylake-X back in 2017, and used fixed frequency offsets and transition periods to handle AVX-512 power demands. Later Intel CPUs did away with fixed fixed frequency offsets, but Skylake-X's AVX-512 teething troubles demonstrate the difficulties that come with running wide datapaths at high clock speeds. Zen 5 benefits from a much better process node and also has no fixed clock speed offsets when running AVX-512 code.</p><blockquote><p>Through the use of improved on-die sensors, AC capacitance (Cac) monitors, and di/dt-based adaptive clocking, "Zen 5" can achieve full AVX512 performance at peak core frequency.</p><p>"Zen 5": The AMD High-Performance 4nm x86-64 Microprocessor Core</p></blockquote><p><span>But if a Zen 5 core is running at 5.7 GHz and suddenly gets faced with an AVX-512 workload, what exactly happens? Here, I'm probing AVX-512 behavior using a modified version of my boost clock testing code. I wrote that code </span><a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/p/how-quickly-do-cpus-change-clock-speeds" rel="">a couple years ago</a><span> and used dependent integer adds to infer clock speed. Integer addition typically has single cycle latency, making it a good platform-independent proxy for clock speed. Instead of checking clock ramp time, I'm switching to a different test function with AVX-512 instructions mixed in after each dependent add. I also make sure the instructions I place between the dependent adds are well within what Zen 5's FPU can handle every cycle, which prevents the FPU from becoming a bottleneck.</span></p><p>I started by placing two fused multiply-add (FMA) instructions in each iteration, each of which operates on a 512-bit vector of packed FP32 values. After the Ryzen 9 reaches 5.7 GHz running the scalar integer function, I switch over to AVX-512 instructions.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png" width="1456" height="716" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:716,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:63918,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/158152986?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ffc7d0-e256-4457-9560-79b8ad8586bf_1530x752.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Impressively, nothing changes.

Travis Downs used vector integer instructions, and I used floating point ones. And I want to focus on Zen 5.</p><p>After the transition finishes, the i9-10900X levels out at 3.7 GHz, then briefly settles at 3.8 GHz for less than 0.1 ms before reaching its steady state 4 GHz speed.</p><p>Zen 5 also doubles L1D load bandwidth, and I’m exercising that by having each FMA instruction source an input from the data cache. I used the following pattern above:</p><pre><code><code>  add rbx, r8
  vfmadd132ps zmm16, zmm1, zmm0
  vfmadd132ps zmm17, zmm2, zmm0
  
  add rbx, r8
  vfmadd132ps zmm18, zmm3, zmm0
  vfmadd132ps zmm19, zmm4, zmm0

  etc</code></code></pre><p>I’m changing those FMA instructions to use a memory operand. Because Zen 5 can handle two 512-bit loads per cycle, the core should have no problems maintaining 3 IPC. That’s two 512-bit FMAs, or 64 FP32 FLOPS, alongside a scalar integer add.</p><pre><code><code>  add rbx, r8
  vfmadd132ps zmm16, zmm1, [r15]
  vfmadd132ps zmm17, zmm2, [r15 + 64]

  add rbx, r8
  vfmadd132ps zmm18, zmm3, [r15 + 128]
  vfmadd132ps zmm19, zmm4, [r15 + 192]

  etc</code></code></pre><p>With the load/store unit’s 512-bit paths in play, the Ryzen 9 9900X has to undergo a transition period of some sort before recovering to 5.5 GHz. From the instruction throughput perspective, Zen 5 apparently dips to 4.7 GHz and stays there for a dozen milliseconds. Then it slowly ramps back up until it reaches steady state speeds.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png" width="1456" height="658" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:658,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:79917,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/158152986?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247c5fe6-4ef1-451b-9893-f36a2e18c271_1532x692.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The Ryzen 9 9900X splits its cores across two Core Complex Dies, or CCDs.

Perhaps it’s measuring voltage. From this observation, I wouldn’t be surprised if another 9900X example shows slightly different behavior.</p><p>Zen 5’s frequency appears to dip during the transition period, based on how fast it’s executing instructions compared to its expected capability. But while my approach of using dependent scalar integer adds is portable, it can’t differentiate between a core running at lower frequency and a core refusing to execute instructions at full rate. The second case may sound weird. But Travis Downs concluded Skylake-X did exactly that based on performance counter data.</p><blockquote><p>[Skylake-X] continues executing instructions during a voltage transition, but at a greatly reduced speed: 1/4th of the usual instruction dispatch rate</p><p><a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/01/17/avxfreq1.html#512-bit-integer-simd-avx-512" rel="">Gathering Intel on Intel AVX-512 Transitions</a><span>, Travis Downs</span></p></blockquote><p>Executing instructions at 1/4 rate would make me infer a 4 GHz core is running at 1 GHz, which is exactly what I see with the Skylake-X transition graph above. Something similar actually happens on Zen 5. It’s not executing instructions at the usual rate during the transition period, making it look like it’s clocking slower from the software perspective.</p><p>But performance counter data shows Zen 5 does not sharply reduce its clock speed when hit with AVX-512 code. Instead, it gradually backs off from maximum frequency until it reaches a sustainable clock speed for the workload it’s hit with. During that period, instructions per cycle (IPC) decreases. IPC gradually recovers as clock speeds get closer to the final steady-state frequency. Once that happens, instruction execution rate recovers to the expected 3 IPC (1x integer add + 2x FMA).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png" width="1456" height="642" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:642,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:92699,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/158152986?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F291aaf1f-93cf-47bb-ae95-ab4227f0a537_1523x672.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>I do have some extra margin of error when reading performance counter data, because I’m calling Linux’s </span><code>perf</code><span> API before and after each function call, but measuring time within those function calls.

It gains 200 MHz over the first 50 ms, but takes longer than 50 ms to recover the last 100 MHz. I think this behavior is deliberate and aimed at avoiding frequent transitions. If heavy AVX-512 code might show up again, keeping the core clock just a few percent lower is bettert than throttling IPC by over 30%. As clock speed goes higher and potential transitions become more expensive, the core becomes less brave and increases clocks slower.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png" width="1342" height="721" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:721,&quot;width&quot;:1342,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:115224,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/158152986?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24bc6e6e-df67-4b99-8e7e-c3035aac239e_1342x721.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The way IPC drops more while clock speed (from perf counters) remains constant makes it feel like voltage droop.

Therefore Zen 5’s frontend and renamer are running at full speed. The IPC throttling is happening somewhere further down the pipeline. Likely, Zen 5’s FP scheduler is holding back and not issuing micro-ops every cycle even when they’re ready. AMD doesn’t have performance counters at the schedule/execute stage, so that theory is impossible to verify.</p><p>Running 512-bit execution units at 5.7 GHz is no small feat, and it’s amazing Zen 5 can do that. The core’s FPU by itself is very efficient. But hit more 512-bit datapaths around the core, and you’ll eventually run into cases where the core can’t do what you’re asking of it at 5.7 GHz. Zen 5 handles such sudden, heavy AVX-512 load with a very fine grained IPC throttling mechanism. It likely uses feedback from per-core sensors, and has varying behavior even between cores on the same CCD. Load-related clock frequency changes are slow in both directions, likely to avoid repeated IPC throttling and preserve high performance for scalar integer code in close proximity to heavy AVX-512 sequences.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png" width="1124" height="1080" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1080,&quot;width&quot;:1124,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1633165,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/158152986?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff47eab0e-3168-4170-81d6-62a92c9d95b2_1124x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The tested chip</figcaption></figure></div><p>Transient IPC throttling raises deep philosophical questions about the meaning of clock frequency.

Pretty eh?</figcaption></figure></div><p>Stepping back though, Zen 5’s AVX-512 clock behavior is much better than Skylake-X’s. Zen 5 has no fixed frequency offsets for AVX-512, and can handle heavier AVX-512 sequences while losing less clock speed than Skylake-X. Transitions triggered by heavier AVX-512 sequences are interesting, but Zen 5’s clocking strategy seems built to minimize those transitions. Maybe corner cases exist where Zen 5’s IPC throttling can significantly impact performance. I suspect such corner cases are rare, because Zen 5 has been out for a while and I haven’t seen anyone complain. And even if it does show up, you can likely avoid the worst of it by running on a slower clocked CCD (or part). Still, it was interesting to trigger it with a synthetic test and see just how AMD deals with 512-bit datapaths at high speed.</p><p><span>If you like the content then consider heading over to the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese" rel="">Patreon</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ" rel="">PayPal</a><span> if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.
