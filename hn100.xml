          <p>Note that Keith could have got his answer minutes sooner, and needn't have kept Tim waiting. In fact, Tim could have started thinking about the question right away!</p>
<p>People who do this are generally trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like one would in person or on the phone - and that's great! But it's 2022 and chat is neither of those things. For most people, typing is much slower than talking. So despite best intentions, <strong>you're actually just making the other person wait</strong> for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity (and kinda annoying).</p>
<p>The same goes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Hello, are you around?"</li>
<li>"hi sophie - quick question."</li>
<li>"You got a sec?"</li>
<li>"yt?"</li>
<li>"ping"</li>

          <p>If you feel it's a bit brusque to simply say "Hi" and ask the question, <strong>you can still preface your message with as many pleasantries as you see fit.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"hey man, what's up? also, any idea when that thing's due?"</li>
<li>"Hi there! Hope you're well. I'm after the latest deck, when you get a sec :)"</li>
<li>"hey, if you're not busy, could you update those NFRs?"</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may seem trivial, but asking your question before getting that initial salutatory reply also allows for <strong>asynchronous communication</strong>. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.</p>
<p>When done right - everyone's happy! üéâ</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>This is the lead story of the new issue of Works in Progress, </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue-19/" rel="">Issue 19</a><span>.

When these railway networks entered cities, however, they faced a crucial problem: they had to stop. Rather than carrying on through the city, it was common for them to terminate on its edge.</p><p><span>In part, this was due to the high cost of acquiring land in urban areas. It was also a technological problem: the </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-stopped-building-cut-and-cover/" rel="">tunneling technologies</a><span> that would enable railways to run into the centre underground without destroying everything in their path had not yet been invented. Finally, the problem was sometimes regulatory as well: in cities such as London railways </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission_on_Metropolitan_Railway_Termini" rel="">were prohibited</a><span> from penetrating too deep into the urban area.</span></p><p><span>The result was that nineteenth century railways often terminated roughly wherever the city limits were when they were built. Some Victorian urban networks, like those of London and Paris, thus resemble a vast hubless wheel whose spokes do not quite join one another in the middle. In other cases, the lines circled round the city and then all entered it at the same point, terminating together in one huge station. This model was common in Germany, so that stations of this sort are still sometimes known by the German name </span><em>Hauptbahnhof</em><span> (literally: main station).</span></p><p>At the end of the nineteenth century, electrification and improvements in tunneling technology led to the emergence of a new kind of railway: the modern metro. Metros were a huge advance in three ways. First, they could go anywhere in the city. Second, metro lines could easily interconnect with one other, meaning that passengers could use the network to travel swiftly from any part of the city to any other part of the city, rather than merely going from a suburb to the edge of the center. Third, the lines were not bottlenecked by the capacity of a central terminus.</p><p>Inner-city termini like London Waterloo and the Gare du Nord in Paris have always handled a complex range of intercity and suburban trains, so delays on any one service can easily propagate over to others. To stop every small delay from generating a huge chain of further delays, tracks and platforms have to be used far below their theoretical maximum capacity: the system can only operate smoothly by preserving a great deal of redundancy. Trains therefore wait around at the terminus for longer than strictly necessary, to recover from delays.</p><p>This, in turn, means that termini have to be massive, and in the age of steam, this was compounded by needing to have room to turn around and store steam locomotives and carriages. Today, the Gare du Nord has 28 tracks above ground, and Waterloo has 24.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png" width="593" height="445.56456043956047" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1094,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:593,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F415ead64-7938-4cea-84c9-00e54f60e35f_1600x1202.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>The giant Gare du Nord (right) and the Gare de l‚ÄôEst in Paris.

But expanding central termini is rarely straightforward: they are typically surrounded by expensive land containing dense urban fabric which would have to be demolished. Furthermore, they are often located on viaducts or in a trench, which makes their expansion technically difficult. Over time, terminus capacity thus generally became the binding constraint on the number of trains that could be run in and out of the urban core, limiting the frequency of both the suburban trains and intercity services.</p><p>Metros, by contrast, could get away with much smaller termini. A typical metro runs a very simple service pattern: every train stops at every station, with few branch lines, and shares no track with any other services, so delays are much less likely. A metro train can easily turn around in well under five minutes, so its terminus only requires two or three platforms.</p><p>In the first decades of the twentieth century, metro lines were built in cities across Europe and North America like Paris, Tokyo, London, Barcelona, and New York. In all of these cities, however, metro lines were built to supplement the Victorian legacy networks, rather than to replace them. As a result, the legacy networks are still there today.</p><p><span>Since building tunneled metro lines is so expensive, these legacy networks are often more extensive than modern metros. The map on the above is London‚Äôs metro network (and even this, as we will see, incorporates some bits of legacy lines). The map below shows London‚Äôs whole</span><em> </em><span>railway network. Nearly all of the additional lines are Victorian: the pre-metro legacy system is actually far greater than the modern metro.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png" width="619" height="961.845220030349" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:659,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:619,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4148f4c8-f234-47c2-b0b5-28ecc67964a4_659x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>London is not an anomaly. In Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago, the suburban railway network is much bigger than the metro, and the same is true in Paris, Tokyo and Berlin. A small number of expensive modern metro lines operate alongside vast Victorian networks, a legacy from the golden age of railways. In Britain, nearly all cities have a Victorian legacy network, but only three ‚Äì London, Glasgow and Newcastle ‚Äì have something that is unambiguously a metro.</p><p>One of the Holy Grails of transport policy has thus been a way to turn these legacy lines into something like a modern metro system. The solution developed by many transit authorities is known as through running. This means taking suburban lines on opposite sides of the city, and joining them up by running trains through the city center, usually in a tunnel. This tunnel does not necessarily have to be very long: in some cities, only a handful of kilometers is needed, because the rest of the infrastructure (the legacy lines that are joined together by the tunnel) is already there. For the price of a comparatively small section of tunnel, a large number of suburbs can get metro-like service directly into the city center.</p><p>Through running has convergently evolved in many places. This article looks at two of them, Munich and London. Munich is distinctive in having used through running to create what is probably the best transit network on earth, relative to the size of the city. London is distinctive in the sheer size of its legacy network, due to its enormous size in the nineteenth century. This means that through running has offered it opportunities of unique scale and complexity.</p><p>For countries with extensive Victorian legacy networks, through running is one of the most important themes in modern transport policy. Across the world, many cities puzzle over how they can pay for the vast costs of developing an all-new metro system. But if they can get through running right they don‚Äôt necessarily have to. Often 90 percent of their modern rail network is already there and has been for 150 years. The stories of Munich and London show how they might fill in the remaining ten percent to create world-leading transit systems at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>A terminological note. In the language of railway engineers, the Victorian legacy networks we are discussing are generally called ‚Äòsuburban railways‚Äô. This is confusing, because metros are also railways and also run in suburbs, and also because the Victorian systems in question are often the suburban sections of intercity lines. But we bow to convention, and in what follows the surface-level Victorian terminating lines are called ‚Äòsuburban railways‚Äô and the underground networks are called ‚Äòmetros‚Äô.</p><p><span>Munich has a good claim to the best rapid-transit system of any medium-sized city in the world. Within ten kilometers of the center of Munich, </span><a href="https://www.tomforth.co.uk/circlepopulations/" rel="">there are 1.6 million people</a><span>, who are served by 284 stations and 194 tram stops, all of which receive a fast, frequent service.</span></p><p>Munich has two different railway systems. The U-Bahn (short for ‚Äòunderground railway‚Äô in German) is a conventional metro system, which serves only the urban area. But there is also the S-Bahn, which is a network of through-running trains that connect the city to outlying towns up to 40 kilometers away as the crow flies.</p><p>Before its metro system was built in the 1960s, Munich had two networks of commuter trains. One network radiated out of the Hauptbahnhof, the city‚Äôs main station, which is on the western edge of the city center. Another radiated out of Ostbahnhof, the eastern station, which is much further away from the center. For the reasons described above, neither reached the heart of the city. There was (and still is) an above-ground connection between the two stations, but it is quite a detour, with trains taking about ten minutes to travel 3.5 kilometers as the crow flies. It loops round the city center to the south, and much of its capacity is taken up by long-distance trains traveling to south-eastern Bavaria and Austria.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png" width="662" height="451.4876373626374" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:993,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:662,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6932013-80ba-49c6-9f82-2038d5b3a0c0_1600x1091.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>According to this 1893 map, the connection between Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof was not used by suburban trains at all.

In France, Britain, and the United States, the railways were initially built by competing companies that saw each other as rivals, and had little interest in sharing stations. New York City ended up with Pennsylvania Station, operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and Grand Central Terminal, operated by the New York Central Railroad. Paris had eight termini at its peak. London has had as many as fifteen, depending on how they are counted.</p><p><span>Even where railways were more centrally planned (including Munich), linking separate networks together was challenging. In Germany, Britain, America, and France, the period of explosive growth of railways mainly took place in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. In this period, tunneling technologies were still in their infancy. The only way railways could run tracks underground was by digging an enormous trench, laying the tracks in it, and then covering it over, a method called </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-stopped-building-cut-and-cover/" rel="">‚Äòcut and cover‚Äô</a><span>. In urban areas, this was expensive and inconvenient: unless the line could be dug underneath a wide street, all the buildings above the future underground line had to be demolished to clear the way for the trench. The other option, which was equally disruptive and expensive, was to build large viaducts through the city center. Berlin did this in 1882 because it was essential for military maneuvers between the eastern and western parts of Germany, but Berlin was the exception rather than the rule.</span></p><p>By the 1920s, the shortcomings of the system were becoming increasingly obvious. The population of Munich increased sevenfold between 1850 and 1930, with most of the growth in newly built suburbs. But the capacity of the suburban network could not be easily increased to meet rising demand. For the reasons explained above, the two central termini were the key constraints on capacity. There was also continued discontent at the fact that suburban services did not reach the city center, a fact that had been made more obvious by the development of trams that could do so.</p><p>On the other hand, there were fewer capacity constraints in the termini at the suburban end, because they usually only handled one type of service (i.e. just a single suburban service, not multiple suburban and intercity ones). This meant they could handle more trains per hour without major risk of generating chains of delays. If they did face capacity constraints, it was normally easier to solve them through expanding termini, since suburban termini are surrounded by less development, and land is cheaper.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png" width="651" height="420.7355769230769" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:651,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e85c403-fcd2-491f-a948-121b5caf7292_1600x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption> Geltendorf station, the terminus of Munich S-Bahn route S4.

Previously, somebody travelling from the eastern suburb of Erding had to get a suburban train to Ostbahnhof, get off, go to the station forecourt, and finish their journey with a 15-minute tram ride. Today, the S-Bahn whisks them directly to the heart of the city, and the S-Bahn tunnel has six central stations, which means that different parts of the center are accessible without changing trains.</p><p><span>Just as importantly, the S-Bahn tunnel was not planned as an isolated project, but as one component of a wider public transport network.

Source: City of Munich.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Today‚Äôs S-Bahn and U-Bahn network is similar to what was planned in 1963, although only three of the four U-Bahn trunk lines were built, and the circular line never came to fruition. It is a single network: the S-Bahn tunnel intersects with each U-Bahn line, and the interchanges were designed coherently: with the exception of Hauptbahnhof, none of the interchange stations has more than </span><a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2018/01/16/transit-and-scale-variance-part-2-soviet-triangles/" rel="">two lines intersecting</a><span>, which prevents any station from being overloaded. The fares are also </span><a href="https://springbett.substack.com/p/how-to-simplify-rail-fares" rel="">integrated</a><span> between the two systems, so that passengers are not penalised for changing trains. The S-Bahn tunnel would have been useful in itself, but its integration with the U-Bahn has a ‚Äòmultiplier‚Äô effect: with one change of train to the U-Bahn, an S-Bahn passenger can get nearly anywhere in the city.</span></p><p><span>This principle of ‚Äòone network, two systems‚Äô enables Munich to manage the trade-off between station spacing and speed, so that both the dense urban core and the suburbs can be served by rapid transit. Other cities try to achieve the same result by running both express trains, and trains that stop at every station, on the same lines, but this is </span><a href="https://springbett.substack.com/p/how-to-improve-the-elizabeth-line" rel="">difficult to do effectively</a><span>, for the obvious reason that the fast trains tend to get bottlenecked behind the stopping ones.</span></p><p><span>The S-Bahn has also relieved the main station. Today, Munich Hauptbahnhof has 32 terminal tracks above ground which handle about 30 departures per hour in the evening peak, because nearly all of the suburban trains run into the S-Bahn tunnel. One train per track per hour is very low utilization, which means there is plenty of room to make sure delays do not cascade across the network, expand the service in future, or possibly to rationalize the station by selling off part of the track space for development.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-166071620" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-magic-of-through-running#footnote-2-166071620" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p><span>But beyond the better connections and the relief provided to the main station, the most important benefit of the Munich S-Bahn has been its frequency. The trunk is able to handle 32 trains per hour in each direction because the branches start in one outlying suburban town, go through the trunk, and then terminate in another suburban town. (Munich has, since December 2024, started temporarily running one branch into Hauptbahnhof due to reliability issues in the trunk.)

Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Leipzig, Vienna, and Zurich all have networks very similar to the Munich S-Bahn, using tunnels to link up lines on opposite sides of the city. Not all S-Bahns require an expensive tunnel: some cities like Cologne, Nuremberg, and Hanover do not have a terminus, so they can simply run their trains through the main station. The S-Bahn model has also been influential on cities in neighbouring countries, such as Copenhagen, Stockholm, Prague, Brussels, and Milan.</p><p>Karlsruhe, a small city in the south-west of Germany near the French border, developed an interesting variation on through running in the 1990s: the tram-train S-Bahn. A ‚Äòtrain‚Äô from the big town of Pforzheim starts off running on ordinary rails, then through runs on the city streets of Karlsruhe as a tram, before becoming a train again on the other side of the city. Although the tram portion is slow, the city is small enough that this does not have a large effect on journey times. The ‚ÄòKarlsruhe model‚Äô has been emulated around the world, including in Sheffield in the United Kingdom.</p><p>In all of these cities, the principle is the same: to enable all of the suburban railway lines to through run onto a trunk that goes through the city center, whether that trunk be a tunnel, platforms at the main station, or occasionally a tram network.</p><p>Through running has convergently evolved in several different places. One of these was Germany. Another was London.</p><p>In the nineteenth century, London was the world‚Äôs largest city, and it had an enormous network of suburban railways. These were originally built by competing, private companies, which were set up in the mid-nineteenth century to connect the capital with other major cities like Birmingham, Bristol, and Brighton. Each company built its own London terminus almost always on the edge of the urban area. The theoretical opportunity for through running in London was thus gigantic, uniting the enormous and disorganized system of suburban railways.</p><p>The problem with London‚Äôs suburban railway system has been obvious from a start. As soon as underground railways became possible, companies began designing networks to connect the various termini together, beginning with what later became the Metropolitan and District lines of the London Underground. Their aim was to allow commuters to move between the various disconnected ‚Äòspokes‚Äô of the suburban ‚Äòwheel‚Äô. This was not, however, through running: passengers would need to change trains at a terminus like King‚Äôs Cross to get to the early Underground lines. The suburban lines were not directly linked together.</p><p><span>The Victorians managed only one true example of through running, the Snow Hill Tunnel. This went south from Farringdon to a station called Ludgate Hill, which enabled the lines north and south of the Thames to be connected. London‚Äôs first crossrail can thus be dated to 1 August 1866, when the first trains used this new connection to run from Herne Hill, in the south of London, to Barnet, in the north of London.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-166071620" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-magic-of-through-running#footnote-5-166071620" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> Although the service was initially fairly successful, the slow, infrequent, steam-operated suburban service was outcompeted by electric trams after the Kingsway tunnel allowed them to cross the river, and closed to passengers in 1916.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-166071620" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-magic-of-through-running#footnote-6-166071620" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png" width="610" height="337.25961538461536" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:805,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:610,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd16077ac-ff7d-4810-8ce1-578c5772b830_1600x885.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>The Snow Hill tunnel briefly enabled an early form of the through running in London.

One problem was that through running would have involved railway companies letting one another‚Äôs trains run on their tracks, which they were often unwilling to do. Another was that through running would require more </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-stopped-building-cut-and-cover/" rel="">cut-and-cover</a><span> tunnels to be built, which meant digging a huge trench, laying the track in it, and covering it over. Cut and cover requires the total destruction of everything in the way of the trench, which makes it phenomenally expensive, unless it follows the line of a wide street. Some cities, like New York and Paris, had lots of wide streets for this purpose, but central London has only one, Euston Road, which already had the Metropolitan Line running underneath it.</span></p><p><span>At the end of the nineteenth century, advances in tunneling technology meant a new generation of underground lines could be built. These ‚Äòdeep level‚Äô lines, powered by electricity, ran far beneath the surface of the earth and were bored rather than excavated, so they no longer required destructive trenches to be cut through the urban fabric. This did not, however, solve London‚Äôs through-running problem. The suburban lines remained operated by steam, so none was suitable for through running without expensive investment in electrification.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-166071620" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-magic-of-through-running#footnote-7-166071620" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p>Through running began to get underway again in the 1930s, after London‚Äôs railway services were nationalized and schemes began to be developed to coordinate them more effectively. As part of its New Works Program, the London Passenger Transport Board joined a short Edwardian underground line with two suburban railway lines on either side, resulting in what we now know as the Central Line. The suburban lines were electrified so that their trains could run through the underground line, and then out into the suburban line at the other end. A total of 14 kilometers of tunnel were built to join the lines together.</p><p>By the 1940s, there was high enthusiasm for further through-running schemes. In 1943, planners prepared the County of London Plan for rebuilding London after the Second World War, which included grand designs to through run nearly all of London‚Äôs suburban railways with a series of tunnels. The Plan‚Äôs rail proposals were mainly downstream of its plans for improving the South Bank of the River Thames, an area criss-crossed by three huge railway viaducts which, the planners judged, impeded rational planning of the area. The Plan therefore suggested removing the stations and their attached viaducts, and building a series of tunnels which would enable through running of nearly all traffic.</p><p><span>However, these schemes came to nothing. The British state was virtually bankrupted by the Second World War, with </span><a href="https://obr.uk/box/post-world-war-ii-debt-reduction/" rel="">government debt rising to 270 percent of GDP</a><span>, and struggled to initiate major infrastructure projects in its aftermath. Resources were channeled into finishing the pre-war extensions, with the Central Line Extension being finally completed in 1948.</span></p><p><span>In any event, new through-running schemes seemed less attractive. London‚Äôs population began to decline: from 8.6 million people in 1939, to 8 million in 1961, to 6.8 million in 1981. Cars drew passengers away from railways. Furthermore, the Green Belt in particular, and more generally </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-britain-doesnt-build/" rel="">the introduction of Britain‚Äôs planning system</a><span>, made it impossible to build new housing around commuter railways, reducing the value of more frequent services to these stations.</span></p><p><span>Even today, the outer reaches of the Central Line extensions go to places like Grange Hill and Theydon Bois, which are </span><a href="https://www.createstreets.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BRM_CreateStreets_New-Towns-Report_111224.pdf" rel="">‚Äòmirror towns‚Äô</a><span>: on one side of the tracks there is suburban development, on the other there are just fields. It was assumed in the 1930s that suburbia would rapidly spring up on the fields next to the stations, but in many cases there are streets that, quite literally, end when their builders were conscripted or redirected into war industries in 1939, and were never finished due to the Green Belt.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png" width="1456" height="690" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:690,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F188344ba-dc12-4f8a-8cae-0bc918d4da03_1600x758.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption> Trentwood Side in Enfield, North London.

London‚Äôs population began to recover from its 1981 nadir, and the economic boom of the 1980s brought more traffic to the railways, many of them commuters into London.</p><p>In 1988, London implemented a through running project called Thameslink. This involved reopening the disused Snow Hill Tunnel, thereby restoring London‚Äôs first through-running service. Thameslink was an unusual project: although the passenger service had closed in 1916, the tunnel had been in use for freight until 1971, which meant it was easy to resurrect the service 15 years later. Although this brought immediate benefits, it was done cheaply, and 30 years later London had to spend six billion pounds on untangling track layouts, rebuilding stations and resignaling the route to get the most out of the Snow Hill Tunnel.</p><p><span>Unlike the original Thameslink, other through running projects would require much more substantial investment. But in the boom years of the late 1980s, it looked as though this would come. In 1989, the </span><a href="https://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=1294" rel="">Central London Rail Study</a><span>, commissioned jointly by the national government, British Railways and London Transport, proposed what eventually became the Elizabeth Line, a huge through-running scheme joining a suburban line running east from Liverpool Street into Essex with one running west from Paddington into Berkshire. It also proposed two other through-running schemes, which it expected to have lower benefits relative to their costs.</span></p><p>These proposed schemes were intended to kill two birds with one stone. As London grew, both the central trunks of the Tube and the suburban branches grew busier. The route that eventually became the Elizabeth Line would relieve the Central Line by providing a new parallel east-west route, as well as enabling through running of some of the suburban branches.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png" width="1183" height="838" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:838,&quot;width&quot;:1183,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35d03a4a-b894-4038-bf14-55f0a19c600e_1183x838.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The early plan for what is now the Elizabeth line.

In 1991, a bill to build the line was put before Parliament. In 1994, however, it was rejected, partly because an economic downturn had led to fewer commuters in London, but also perhaps because decision makers did not understand the benefits of through running: one cabinet minister was quoted as saying, ‚ÄòIt went from nowhere to nowhere.

But in total, the Elizabeth Line trains travel 117 kilometers because of the two existing suburban lines it cannibalized.</p><p><span>The Elizabeth Line has been a huge success: within a year of opening, quarterly fare revenue </span><a href="https://content.tfl.gov.uk/tfl-quarterly-performance-report-q2-2023-24-acc.pdf" rel="">exceeded predictions</a><span> by ¬£22 million. Nearly every station on the Line has surpassed its pre-COVID passenger numbers, even though in 2024 the average London station not on the Elizabeth Line had 10 percent fewer people than before COVID.</span></p><p>The Elizabeth Line has been transformative for places like Romford, a suburb of eastern London. Romford used to get direct trains to only Liverpool Street: it now has them to most of central London, Heathrow Airport, and the western suburbs. The trains also run twice as frequently as they used to. The rest of the city center (plus most of its suburbs) can be reached with one change of train. Because the trains to Romford no longer run into the terminus part of Liverpool Street, other services using the station have become more reliable as well.</p><p><span>Most importantly, this has been done cost-effectively. Although the Elizabeth Line tunnel was </span><a href="https://transitcosts.com/london-crossrail/" rel="">expensive</a><span>, for the price of 21 kilometers of tunnel, London got a 117 kilometer-long railway network. In short, Romford has got most of the benefits of a connection to the London Underground, without needing to build an underground line all the way to the suburb.</span></p><p>The Elizabeth Line was a success, but a costly one. It became viable only when London was booming and its railway lines were crying out for more capacity. If all through running schemes were like the Elizabeth Line, we might conclude it was an expensive luxury, useful only in the wealthiest and most transport-constrained cities.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not the case. For one thing, through running does not need to be as costly as the Elizabeth Line. As the table below shows, cities differ greatly in the costs at which they build through-running projects. These costs are usually correlated with the costs for railway projects in that country generally, suggesting their variation is mainly the result of regulatory and procurement systems rather than the particular physical features of the individual lines.</p><p><span>But as important as the cost per kilometer of track is the amount of track that needs to be made. Some cities, like Cologne, do not need to tunnel to allow trains to run through: they only need works to expand the city‚Äôs main station, or alter its layout. Where tunneling is necessary, it does not necessarily need to be on the scale of the Elizabeth Line. London is a megacity, but owing to its smaller size, a tunnel to connect Manchester‚Äôs suburban railway lines together would only be a couple of kilometers long, roughly a tenth of the length of the Elizabeth Line‚Äôs tunnel and more similar to the scale of the trunk tunnel of the Munich S-Bahn. Indeed, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070911034934/http://www.metromapsoftheworld.com/PipeDreams/PiccVic/" rel="">such a scheme was approved and was almost built in the early 1970s</a><span>. It never went ahead due to pressures on the public finances, but similar projects were built in Liverpool, which used 1.5 kilometers of tunnel, and Newcastle, which used 5 kilometers.</span></p><p>Through running has potential in any city with a network of legacy suburban lines. In general, this is likely to be the case in countries that industrialized in the nineteenth century, when railways had been invented but metros had not.</p><p>Britain is a particularly striking example of this. British cities outside of London are notorious for their lack of metro and tram systems, but many of them actually have enormous suburban railway networks. The problem with these systems is not that they have poor coverage, but they have low frequency and poor interconnectivity. These are problems that can be solved by through running, turning them into something similar to modern metro systems, at a small fraction of the cost of developing such a metro from scratch.</p><p>Not all countries are so fortunate. China, for instance, developed large cities in the twentieth century with neither suburban railways nor modern metros. Today, the Chinese authorities want to improve their urban rail systems. But in the absence of suburban railways that can through run, that means developing vast underground metro systems from scratch at enormous expense.</p><p>Through running is a cost-effective way of upgrading pre-existing railway lines.

In the 1930s, Copenhagen developed a high-capacity through-running system called the S-tog, which works much like the Munich S-Bahn. In the 1940s, Copenhagen developed its celebrated ‚Äòfinger plan‚Äô for further development, with the city extending outward in urban ‚Äòfingers‚Äô along the lines of the S-tog, leaving open countryside in the areas between. Dozens of neighbourhoods are now clustered around S-tog stations, enjoying its fast, frequent, and highly interconnected service across Copenhagen and its environs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png" width="469" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:469,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb9f62af-2123-4fdb-9424-eb666a77d6f8_469x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The famous 'finger plan', with the five fingers corresponding to S-tog routes.

The reverse is usually true with metro schemes: due to their higher costs, they can only be financially viable if they are surrounded by high-density development. If that development does not materialize, either because of an economic downturn or because land-use regulations make it prohibitively expensive to build, the metro line will be an economic failure.</p><p>It is tempting to think that the most important ways to improve transport involve new technology: self-driving cars, flying taxis, or even e-scooters. But often, the best investments involve getting the most out of existing technology, through smaller investments that have a strong multiplier effect. Through running involves using a fairly old technology, deep bore tunneling, to improve an even older technology, commuter railways. 90 percent of London‚Äôs S-Bahn network is already built, and with Manchester this is closer to 95 percent. The opportunity is great in North America: Boston only needs a mile of tunnel, and Toronto and New York City already have the infrastructure for through running, but choose not to use it. By weaving together Victorian lines, these cities can get the best railway networks in the world. It‚Äôs not a free lunch, but most of it has already been paid for.</p><p><em><span>Benedict Springbett is a </span><a href="http://springbett.substack.com/" rel="">writer</a><span> and Bar student.</span></em></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><!--[--><!----><!----><main>  <img src="https://www.brainonllm.com/brainonllm.png" alt="Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task"> <div><p>as seen on:</p> <p><img src="https://www.brainonllm.com/media/NewYorkTimes.svg" alt="The New York Times"> <img src="https://www.brainonllm.com/media/salon-logo.svg" alt="Salon"></p></div> <p>With today's wide adoption of LLM products like ChatGPT from OpenAI, humans and businesses
		engage and use LLMs on a daily basis. Like any other tool, it carries its own set of advantages
		and limitations. This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM in the
		educational context of writing an essay.</p> <p>We assigned participants to three groups: LLM group, Search Engine group, Brain-only group,
		where each participant used a designated tool (or no tool in the latter) to write an essay. We
		conducted 3 sessions with the same group assignment for each participant. In the 4th session we
		asked LLM group participants to use no tools (we refer to them as LLM-to-Brain), and the
		Brain-only group participants were asked to use LLM (Brain-to-LLM). We recruited a total of 54
		participants for Sessions 1, 2, 3, and 18 participants among them completed session 4.</p> <p>We used electroencephalography (EEG) to record participants' brain activity in order to assess
		their cognitive engagement and cognitive load, and to gain a deeper understanding of neural
		activations during the essay writing task. We performed NLP analysis, and we interviewed each
		participant after each session. We performed scoring with the help from the human teachers and
		an AI judge (a specially built AI agent).</p> <p>We discovered a consistent homogeneity across the Named Entities Recognition (NERs), n-grams,
		ontology of topics within each group. EEG analysis presented robust evidence that LLM, Search
		Engine and Brain-only groups had significantly different neural connectivity patterns,
		reflecting divergent cognitive strategies. Brain connectivity systematically scaled down with
		the amount of external support: the Brain‚Äëonly group exhibited the strongest, widest‚Äëranging
		networks, Search Engine group showed intermediate engagement, and LLM assistance elicited the
		weakest overall coupling. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed weaker neural
		connectivity and under-engagement of alpha and beta networks; and the Brain-to-LLM participants
		demonstrated higher memory recall, and re‚Äëengagement of widespread occipito-parietal and
		prefrontal nodes, likely supporting the visual processing, similar to the one frequently
		perceived in the Search Engine group. The reported ownership of LLM group's essays in the
		interviews was low. The Search Engine group had strong ownership, but lesser than the Brain-only
		group. The LLM group also fell behind in their ability to quote from the essays they wrote just
		minutes prior.</p> <p>As the educational impact of LLM use only begins to settle with the general population, in this
		study we demonstrate the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills based on the
		results of our study. The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the
		benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM
		group's participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all
		levels: neural, linguistic, scoring.</p> <p>We hope this study serves as a preliminary guide to understanding the cognitive and practical
		impacts of AI on learning environments.</p> <p>Distributed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></p> <p>¬© Copyright 2025: <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/nkosmyna/overview/" target="_blank">Nataliya Kosmyna</a>, Eugene Hauptmann</p></main><!----><!----><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/06/16/selfish-reasons-for-building-accessible-uis/">https://nolanlawson.com/2025/06/16/selfish-reasons-for-building-accessible-uis/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44294853">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>All web developers know, at some level, that accessibility is important. But when push comes to shove, it can be hard to prioritize it above a bazillion other concerns when you‚Äôre trying to center a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and you‚Äôre on a tight deadline.</p>
<p>A lot of accessibility advocates lead with the moral argument: for example, that disabled people should have just as much access to the internet as any other person, and that it‚Äôs a blight on our whole industry that we continually fail to make it happen.</p>
<p>I personally find these arguments persuasive. But experience has also taught me that ‚Äúeat your vegetables‚Äù is one of the least effective arguments in the world. Scolding people might get them to agree with you in public, or even in principle, but it‚Äôs unlikely to change their behavior once no one‚Äôs watching.</p>
<p>So in this post, I would like to list some of my personal, completely selfish reasons for building accessible UIs. No finger-wagging here: just good old hardheaded self-interest!</p>
<h2>Debuggability</h2>
<p>When I‚Äôm trying to debug a web app, it‚Äôs hard to orient myself in the DevTools if the entire UI is ‚Äúdiv soup‚Äù:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div class="css-1x2y3z4"&gt;
  &lt;div class="css-c6d7e8f"&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-a5b6c7d"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-e8f9g0h"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Library&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Version&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Size&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="css-c6d7e8f"&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;UI&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;React&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;19.1.0&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;167kB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;Style&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;4.0.0&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;358kB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;Build&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;Vite&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;6.3.5&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;2.65MB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>This is actually a table, but you wouldn‚Äôt know it from looking at the HTML:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="14927" data-permalink="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/06/16/selfish-reasons-for-building-accessible-uis/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-10-50-44/" data-orig-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-10-50-44.png" data-orig-size="585,275" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot from 2025-06-15 10-50-44" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-10-50-44.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-10-50-44.png?w=570" src="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-10-50-44.png?w=570" alt="Screenshot of an HTML table with column headers library, version, and size, row headers UI, style, and build, and values React/Tailwind/Vite with their version numbers and build size in the cells." width="570" height="268"></p>
<p>If I‚Äôm trying to debug this in the DevTools, I‚Äôm completely lost. Where are the rows? Where are the columns?</p>
<pre title="">&lt;table class="css-1x2y3z4"&gt;
  &lt;thead class="css-a5b6c7d"&gt;
    &lt;tr class="css-y3z4a5b"&gt;
      &lt;th scope="col" class="css-e8f9g0h"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th scope="col" class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Library&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th scope="col" class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Version&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th scope="col" class="css-i1j2k3l"&gt;Size&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody class="css-a5b6c7d"&gt;
    &lt;tr class="css-y3z4a5b"&gt;
      &lt;th scope="row" class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;UI&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;React&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;19.1.0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;167kB&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class="css-y3z4a5b"&gt;
      &lt;th scope="row" class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;Style&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;4.0.0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;358kB&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class="css-y3z4a5b"&gt;
      &lt;th scope="row" class="css-q7r8s9t"&gt;Build&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;Vite&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;6.3.5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class="css-u0v1w2x"&gt;2.65MB&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
<p>Ah, that‚Äôs much better! Now I can easily zero in on a table cell, or a column header, because they‚Äôre all <em>named</em>. I‚Äôm not wading through a sea of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s anymore.</p>
<p>Even just adding ARIA <code>role</code>s to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s would be an improvement here:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div class="css-1x2y3z4" role="table"&gt;
  &lt;div class="css-a5b6c7d" role="rowgroup"&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-e8f9g0h" role="columnheader"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l" role="columnheader"&gt;Library&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l" role="columnheader"&gt;Version&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-i1j2k3l" role="columnheader"&gt;Size&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="css-c6d7e8f" role="rowgroup"&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t" role="rowheader"&gt;UI&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;React&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;19.1.0&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;167kB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t" role="rowheader"&gt;Style&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;4.0.0&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;358kB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="css-m4n5o6p" role="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-q7r8s9t" role="rowheader"&gt;Build&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;Vite&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;6.3.5&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="css-u0v1w2x" role="cell"&gt;2.65MB&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Especially if you‚Äôre using a CSS-in-JS framework (which I‚Äôve simulated with <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/08/css-modules-in-css-modules/#:~:text=Can%20CSS%20Modules%20be%20more%20like%20CSS%20Modules%3F">robo-classes</a> above), the HTML can get quite messy. Building accessibly makes it a lot easier to understand at a distance what each element is supposed to do.</p>
<h2>Naming things</h2>
<p>As all programmers know, naming things is hard. UIs are no exception: is this an ‚Äúautocomplete‚Äù? Or a ‚Äúdropdown‚Äù? Or a ‚Äúpicker‚Äù?</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="14944" data-permalink="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/06/16/selfish-reasons-for-building-accessible-uis/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20/" data-orig-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png" data-orig-size="273,315" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot from 2025-06-15 11-10-20" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png?w=260" data-large-file="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png?w=273" src="https://nolanlawson.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot-from-2025-06-15-11-10-20.png" alt="Screenshot of a combobox with &quot;Ne&quot; typed into it and states below in a list like Nebraska, Nevada, and New Hampshire." width="273" height="315"></p>
<p>If you read the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/examples/combobox-autocomplete-both/">WAI ARIA guidelines</a>, though, then it‚Äôs clear what it is: a ‚Äúcombobox‚Äù!</p>
<p>No need to grope for the right name: if you add the proper <code>role</code>s, then everything is already named for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>combobox</code></li>
<li><code>listbox</code></li>
<li><code>option</code>s</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, you can use <code>aria-*</code> attributes or <code>role</code>s as a CSS selector. I often see awkward code like this:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div
  className={isActive ? 'active' : ''}
  aria-selected={isActive}
  role='option'
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>The <code>active</code> class is clearly redundant here. If you want to style based on the <code>.active</code> selector, you could just as easily style with <code>[aria-selected="true"]</code> instead.</p>
<p>Also, why call it <code>isActive</code> when the ARIA attribute is <code>aria-selected</code>? Just call it ‚Äúselected‚Äù everywhere:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div
  aria-selected={isSelected}
  role='option'
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Much cleaner!</p>
<p>I also find that thinking in terms of roles and ARIA attributes sharpens my thinking, and gives structure to the interface I‚Äôm trying to create. Suddenly, I have a <em>language</em> for what I‚Äôm building, which can lead to more ‚Äúobvious‚Äù variable names, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-area">grid area names</a>, etc.</p>
<h2>Testability</h2>
<p><a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2019/11/05/what-ive-learned-about-accessibility-in-spas/#:~:text=Easier%20integration%20testing">I‚Äôve written about this before</a>, but building accessibly also helps with writing tests. Rather than trying to select an element based on arbitrary classes or attributes, you can write more elegant code like this (e.g. with Playwright):</p>
<pre title="">await page.getByLabel('Name').fill('Nolan')

await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'OK' }).click()
</pre>
<p>Imagine, though, if your entire UI is full of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and robo-classes. How would you find the right inputs and buttons? You could select based on the robo-classes, or by searching for text inside or nearby the elements, but this makes your tests brittle.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/making-your-ui-tests-resilient-to-change">Kent C. Dodds has argued</a>, writing UI tests based on <em>semantics</em> makes your tests more resilient to change. That‚Äôs because a UI‚Äôs semantic structure (i.e. the accessibility tree) tends to change less frequently than its classes, attributes, or even the composition of its HTML elements. (How many times have you added a wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> only to break your UI tests?)</p>
<h2>Power users</h2>
<p>When I‚Äôm on a desktop, I tend to be a keyboard power user. I like pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close dialogs, <kbd>Enter</kbd> to submit a form, or even <kbd>/</kbd> in Firefox to quickly jump to links on the page. I do use a mouse, but I just prefer the keyboard since it‚Äôs faster.</p>
<p>So I find it jarring when a website breaks keyboard accessibility ‚Äì <kbd>Esc</kbd> doesn‚Äôt dismiss a dialog, <kbd>Enter</kbd> doesn‚Äôt submit a form, <kbd>‚Üë</kbd>/<kbd>‚Üì</kbd> don‚Äôt change radio buttons. It disrupts my flow when I unexpectedly have to reach for my mouse. (Plus it‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/">Van Halen brown M&amp;M</a> that signals to me that the website probably messed something else up, too!)</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre building a productivity tool with its own set of keyboard shortcuts (think Slack or GMail), then it‚Äôs even more important to get this right. You can‚Äôt add a lot of sophisticated keyboard controls if the basic <kbd>Tab</kbd> and focus logic doesn‚Äôt work correctly.</p>
<p>A lot of programmers are themselves power users, so I find this argument pretty persuasive. Build a UI that you yourself would like to use!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The reason that I, personally, care about accessibility is probably different from most people‚Äôs. I have a family member who is blind, and I‚Äôve known many blind or low-vision people in my career. I‚Äôve heard firsthand how frustrating it can be to use interfaces that aren‚Äôt built accessibly.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I were disabled, I would probably think to myself, ‚Äúcomputer programmers must not care about me.‚Äù And judging from the <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">miserable WebAIM results</a>, I‚Äôd clearly be right:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Across the one million home pages, 50,960,288 distinct accessibility errors were detected‚Äîan average of 51 errors per page.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As a web developer who has dabbled in accessibility, though, I find this situation tragic. It‚Äôs not <em>really</em> that hard to build accessible interfaces. And I‚Äôm not talking about ‚Äúideal‚Äù or ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù ‚Äì the bar is pretty low, so I‚Äôm just talking about something that <em>works at all</em> for people with a disability.</p>
<p>Maybe in the future, accessible interfaces won‚Äôt require so much manual intervention from developers. Maybe AI tooling (on either the production or consumption side) will make UIs that are usable out-of-the-box for people with disabilities. I‚Äôm actually sympathetic to the Jakob Nielsen argument that <a href="https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/accessibility-generative-ui">‚Äúaccessibility has failed‚Äù</a> ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to look at the WebAIM results and come to any other conclusion. Maybe the ‚Äúeat your vegetables‚Äù era of accessibility has failed, and it‚Äôs time to try new tactics.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why I wrote this post, though. You can build accessibly without having a bleeding heart. And for the time being, unless generative AI swoops in like a <em>deus ex machina</em> to save us, it‚Äôs our responsibility as interface designers to do so.</p>
<p>At the same time we‚Äôre helping others, though, we can also help ourselves. Like a good hot sauce on your Brussels sprouts, eating your vegetables doesn‚Äôt always have to be a chore.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People keep asking me If I use Generative AI tools for coding and what I think of them, so this is my effort to put my thoughts in writing, so that I can send people here instead of having to repeat myself every time I get the question.</p>
<p>From the title you already know that this isn't a pro-AI blog post. But it isn't an anti-AI post either, at least I don't think it is. There are already plenty of articles by AI promoters and AI critics, so I don't feel there is a need for me to write one more of those. While I'm definitely not neutral on the subject, in this article I'm just going to share my personal experience with these tools, from a strictly technical point of view.</p>
<h2>AI is not faster</h2>
<p>Really the main and most important reason why GenAI tools do not work for me is that <strong>they do not make me any faster</strong>. It's really that simple.</p>
<p>It would be easy to use GenAI coding tools to have code written for me. A coding agent would be the most convenient, as it would edit my files while I do something else. This all sounds great, in principle.</p>
<p>The problem is that I'm going to be responsible for that code, so I cannot blindly add it to my project and hope for the best. I could only incorporate AI generated code into a project of mine after I thoroughly review it and make sure I understand it well. I have to feel confident that I can modify or extend this piece of code in the future, or else I cannot use it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately reviewing code is actually harder than most people think. It takes me at least the same amount of time to review code not written by me than it would take me to write the code myself, if not more. There is actually a well known saying in our industry that goes something like "it‚Äôs harder to read code than to write it." I believe it was Joel Spolsky (creator of Stack Overflow and Trello) who formalized it first in his <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Things You Should Never Do, Part I</a> article.</p>
<p>You could argue that code that was written by AI can be considered a black box. I guess you can convince yourself that as long as the code works as intended it is safe to use without the need to review it, which would translate into some productivity increase. I think this is highly irresponsible, because the AI is not going to assume any liability if this code ever malfunctions. I'm always the responsible party for the code I produce, with or without AI. Taking on such a large risk is nuts, in my opinion.</p>
<p>This is even more important for some of the work that I do where there are contracts signed, with associated legal obligations and money payments. If I'm hired as a professional, I really have no other choice than to be one. AI tools cannot help me make more money or do my work in less time. The only way I could achieve those things is by degrading the quality of the work and introducing risk, and I'm not willing to do that.</p>
<h2>AI is not a multiplier</h2>
<p>I've heard people say that GenAI coding tools are a multiplier or enabler for them. Basically those who make this claim say that they are able to work faster and tackle more difficult problems when using GenAI. Unfortunately these claims are just based on the perception of the subjects themselves, so there is no hard data to back them up. I guess it is possible that some people can be more efficient reviewing code than I am, but I honestly doubt it. What I think happens is that these people save time because they only spot review the AI generated code, or skip the review phase altogether, which as I said above would be a deal breaker for me.</p>
<p>Another common argument I've heard is that Generative AI is helpful when you need to write code in a language or technology you are not familiar with. To me this also makes little sense. The part that I enjoy the most about working as a software engineer is learning new things, so not knowing something has never been a barrier for me. The more you practice learning the easier and faster it gets! In recent times I had to learn Rust, Go, TypeScript, WASM, Java and C# for various projects, and I wouldn't delegate this learning effort to an AI, even if it saved me time. Which it wouldn't, because of all the reasons above about being responsible for the code that I produce. Sorry if I'm a bit repetitive on this.</p>
<h2>AI code is different than human code</h2>
<p>I made all these points to a friend the other day and he asked me why then I gladly accept open source contributions to my projects when they are made by people. Aren't those also code that is not written by myself? Why are those okay but AI generated code is not?</p>
<p>The truth that may be shocking to some is that open source contributions submitted by users do not really save me time either, because I also feel I have to do a rigorous review of them. But I enjoy working with users who have an interest in my projects and take time to report bugs, request new features or submit code changes. These interactions are a source of new ideas more than anything, so they directly help me do better work. This is what I love the most of working in open source!</p>
<p>My friend, who is still unconvinced, suggests I could launch a bunch of AI agents in parallel to create PRs for all my open bugs. It's a game changer, he says. Unfortunately that would cost me money and likely make me slower, for the reasons explained above. Even if we assume that AI coding tools are sophisticated enough (they are not) to fix issues in my projects with little or no supervision, I'm still the bottleneck because all that code has to be reviewed before it can be merged.</p>
<p>The unfortunate side of AI coding tools being widely available is that some users now also generate low effort pull requests with them. I have received some of these, and it's interesting that there is a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a> effect that triggers in me when I start reading AI generated code that hasn't been edited and refined by a real person. When I come across pull requests of this type I start asking questions to the submitters about the weird parts of their submissions, because I consider them responsible for the code they want me to merge. They rarely respond.</p>
<h2>AI is not the same as an intern</h2>
<p>Many AI advocates say that you should treat your AI coding tool as an intern that is eager to please. I think the people who say this never worked with interns!</p>
<p>In the beginning, delegating work to an intern causes a productivity decrease for you, for the same reasons I enumerated above. Interns need a lot of hand-holding, and all the code they produce needs to be carefully reviewed before it is accepted.</p>
<p>But interns <em>learn</em> and get better over time. The time that you spend reviewing code or providing feedback to an intern is not wasted, it is an investment in the future. The intern absorbs the knowledge you share and uses it for new tasks you assign to them later on. The need for close supervision goes down throughout the duration of the internship. In the end, interns are often hired by their companies as full time employees because they become successful independent contributors.</p>
<p>An AI tool can only resemble an intern with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia">anterograde amnesia</a>, which would be a bad kind of intern to have. For every new task this "AI intern" resets back to square one without having learned a thing!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope with this article I've made the technical issues I have with applying GenAI coding tools to my work clear.</p>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as a free lunch with AI coding. I believe people who claim that it makes them faster or more productive are making a conscious decision to relax their quality standards to achieve those gains. Either that or they just say this because they personally benefit from selling AI to you.</p></div><p>Thank you for visiting my blog!

            <p><span>A</span>lmost a decade ago, a Baptist Biblical scholar, a Catholic priest, several rabbis, an Islamic leader, a Zen Buddhist roshi, and more than a dozen other religious leaders walked into a lab‚Äîand took high doses of magic mushrooms.</p>
      
    <p>All of them said it was their first time taking the drug. The <a href="https://nautil.us/what-hallucinogens-will-make-you-see-308247/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mind-altering details</a> of these guided trips were recorded at the time and over the following 16 months, but it wasn‚Äôt until recently that the results of the controversial experiment came to light.</p><p>One might wonder how a single psilocybin trip could compare to the catalog of rich transcendent experiences that might accumulate over a lifetime of religious devotion. But according to the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/psymed.2023.0044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">findings</a>, which were published in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Psychedelic Medicine</em>, the vast majority of the 33 clergy who participated in the study‚Äîmore than 90 percent‚Äîsaid taking psilocybin was one of the most spiritually meaningful and deeply sacred experiences of their lives. Almost half said it was the most profound thing they had ever experienced, period. Many of them also said it made them better religious leaders.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Now, years later, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/05/26/this-is-your-priest-on-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some of these clergy</a> have become evangelists for psychedelics, incorporating them into their own religious teachings. For some of them, the experience led to a release from attachment to dogmas and greater openness to other forms of religious experience. For at least one participant, it was a dark, empty, terrifying trip. Still, none of them ruled out using psilocybin again in the future.</p><p>Publication of the study took so long in part due to charges of ethical lapses, including potential conflicts of interest related to funding sources, as well as the direct involvement of a funder in the research itself. But these conflicts were eventually resolved through disclosure, which the authors say they always intended. Questions also swirled around certain flaws in the study‚Äôs execution, which even the authors, scientists at Johns Hopkins University and New York University, admit. </p><p>One issue was bias: Participants may have been primed to see their experiences as sacred by language used in recruitment ads and by the expectations of those running the experiment. (Many of those who chose to participate were also considering leaving the profession at the outset and so could have been seeking a way to reconnect with the divine.) The sample was also small, heavily white, male, and Christian; and representation of a number of major world religions, including Indigenous religious traditions, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism, was absent.</p></div>

          </div><p>Still the results raise questions about the relationship between hallucinogens and religious experience. Most of the major world religions today (Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam) do not advocate the use of mind-altering substances.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
Version 0.2.0 of the Chawan TUI browser has been released.
</p><p>
A tarball of the source tree is available
<a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-src.tar.xz">here</a>.  Please refer to the README
file for compilation instructions.
</p><p>
A static binary distribution for
<a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-linux-amd64.tar.xz">amd64 Linux</a> also exists.
To install it, extract the archive somewhere and run <code>make install</code>
as root.  (To uninstall, run <code>make uninstall</code>.)
</p><p>
The same distribution is also available as a <a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-amd64.deb">.deb
package</a>.
</p><h2 id="information-for-package-maintainers"><a href="#information-for-package-maintainers">##</a> Information for package maintainers</h2>
<p>
The current list of mandatory runtime dependencies is:
</p><ul>
<li>libssh2.
</li><li>libbrotli (more precisely, libbrotlicommon and libbrotlidec).
</li><li>OpenSSL or LibreSSL.  For OpenSSL, you will want 3.0 or later.
For LibreSSL, the version in OpenBSD 7.7 has been tested.
</li></ul>
<p>
Previous development versions had other dependencies which no
longer apply, and can be dropped.  In particular, zlib, libseccomp,
termcap/ncurses and libcurl are no longer used.
</p><p>
If you run into an issue while packaging Chawan, please contact me
before trying to patch over it.  Chances are we can solve it upstream.
</p><h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next">##</a> What's next</h2>
<p>
It took a bit longer than expected, but I finally feel OK putting a
version on this.  It has all features I wanted from an MVP, and no known
fatal bugs.
</p><p>
The v0.2 branch in git will only receive bugfixes.  Further work on new
features will continue on the master branch.
</p><p>
For the next release, I hope to improve upon the layout module's
performance &amp; correctness, and to make the UI somewhat more user
friendly.  Stay tuned :)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elsewhere I've been asked about the task of replaying the bootstrap process for rust. I figured it would be fairly straightforward, if slow. But as we got into it, there were <em>just</em> enough tricky / non-obvious bits in the process that it's worth making some notes here for posterity.</p><p>UPDATE: someone has <a href="https://github.com/LegionMammal978/rust-from-ocaml">also scripted many of the subsequent snapshot builds</a> covering many years of rust's post-bootstrap development. Consider the rest of this post just a verbose primer for interpreting their work.</p><h3>context</h3><p>Rust started its life as a compiler written in ocaml, called <b>rustboot</b>. This compiler did <em>not</em> use LLVM, it just emitted 32-bit i386 machine code in 3 object file formats (Linux PE, macOS Mach-O, and Windows PE).</p><p>We then wrote a <em>second</em> compiler <em>in Rust</em> called <b>rustc</b> that <em>did</em> use LLVM as its backend (and which, yes, is the genesis of today's rustc) and ran rustboot on rustc to produce a so-called "stage0 rustc". Then stage0 rustc was fed the sources of rustc again, producing a stage1 rustc. Successfully executing this stage0 -&gt; stage1 step (rather than just crashing mid-compilation) is what we're going to call "bootstrapping". There's also a third step: running stage1 rustc on rustc's sources again to get a stage2 rustc and checking that it is bit-identical to the stage1 rustc. Successfully doing <em>that</em> we're going to call "fixpoint".</p><p>Shortly after we reached the fixpoint we <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/6997adf76342b7a6fe03c4bc370ce5fc5082a869">discarded rustboot</a>. We stored stage1 rustc binaries as snapshots on a shared download server and all subsequent rust builds were based on downloading and running that. Any time there was an incompatible language change made, we'd add support and re-snapshot the resulting stage1, gradually growing a long list of snapshots marking the progress of rust over time.</p><h3>time travel and bit rot</h3><p>Each snapshot can typically only compile rust code in the rust repository written between its birth and the next snapshot. This makes replaying the entire history awkward (<a href="https://github.com/LegionMammal978/rust-from-ocaml">see above</a>). We're not going to do that here. This post is just about replaying the initial bootstrap and fixpoint, which happened back in April 2011, 14 years ago.</p><p>Unfortunately all the tools involved -- from the host OS and system libraries involved to compilers and compiler-components -- were and are moving targets. Everything bitrots. Some examples discovered along the way:</p><ul><br><li>Modern clang and gcc won't compile the LLVM used back then (C++ has changed too much -- and I tried several CXXFLAGS=-std=c++NN variants!)<br></li><li>Modern gcc won't even compile the gcc used back then (apparently C as well!)<br></li><li>Modern ocaml won't compile rustboot (ditto)<br></li><li>14-year-old git won't even connect to modern github (ssh and ssl have changed too much)<br></li></ul><h3>debian</h3><p>We're in a certain amount of luck though:</p><ul><br><li>Debian has maintained both EOL'ed docker images and still-functioning fetchable package archives at the same URLs as 14 years ago. So we can time-travel using that. A VM image would also do, and if you have old install media you could presumably build one up again if you are patient.<br></li><li>It is easier to use i386 since that's all rustboot emitted. There's some indication in the Makefile of support for multilib-based builds from x86-64 (I honestly don't remember if my desktop was 64 bit at the time) but 32bit is much more straightforward.<br></li><li>So: <tt>docker pull --platform linux/386 debian/eol:squeeze</tt> gets you an environment that works.<br></li><li>You'll need to install rust's prerequisites also: g++, make, ocaml, ocaml-native-compilers, python.<br></li></ul><h3>rust</h3><p>The next problem is figuring out the code to build. Not totally trivial but not <em>too</em> hard. The best resource for tracking this period of time in rust's history is actually the rust-dev mailing list archive. There's <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/rust-dev@mozilla.org/info.html">a copy online at mail-archive.com</a> (and Brian keeps <a href="https://github.com/brson/rust-dev-archives">a public backup of the mbox file</a> in case that goes away). Here's <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/rust-dev@mozilla.org/msg00329.html">the announcement that we hit a fixpoint</a> in April 2011. You kinda have to just know that's what to look for. So that's the rust commit to use: 6daf440037cb10baab332fde2b471712a3a42c76. This commit still exists in the rust-lang/rust repo, no problem getting it (besides having to copy it into the container since the container can't contact github, haha).</p><h3>LLVM</h3><p>Unfortunately we only started pinning LLVM to specific versions, using submodules, <em>after</em> bootstrap, closer to the initial "0.1 release". So we have to guess at the LLVM version to use. To add some difficulty: LLVM at the time was developed on subversion, and we were developing rust against <a href="https://github.com/brson/llvm">a fork of a git mirror of their SVN</a>. Fishing around in that repo at least finds a version that builds -- <a href="https://github.com/brson/llvm/commit/45e1a53efd40a594fa8bb59aee75bb0984770d29">45e1a53efd40a594fa8bb59aee75bb0984770d29</a>, which is "the commit that exposed </p><tt>LLVMAddEarlyCSEPass</tt><p>", a symbol used in the rustc LLVM interface. I bootstrapped with that (brson/llvm) commit but subversion also numbers all commits, and they were preserved in the conversion to the modern LLVM repo, so you can see the same svn id 129087 as <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/e4e4e3758097d7967fa6edf4ff878ba430f84f6e">e4e4e3758097d7967fa6edf4ff878ba430f84f6e</a> over in the official LLVM git repo, in case brson/llvm goes away in the future.</p><p>Configuring LLVM for this build is also a little bit subtle. The best bet is to actually read the rust 0.1 configure script -- when it was managing the LLVM build itself -- and work out what it would have done. But I have done that and can now save you the effort: </p><tt>./configure --enable-targets=x86 --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --host=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --target=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --disable-docs --disable-jit --enable-bindings=none --disable-threads --disable-pthreads --enable-optimized</tt><p>So: configure and build that, stick the resulting bin dir in your path, and configure and make rust, and you're good to go!</p><pre>root@65b73ba6edcc:/src/rust# sha1sum stage*/rustc
639f3ab8351d839ede644b090dae90ec2245dfff  stage0/rustc
81e8f14fcf155e1946f4b7bf88cefc20dba32bb9  stage1/rustc
81e8f14fcf155e1946f4b7bf88cefc20dba32bb9  stage2/rustc
</pre><h3>Observations</h3><p>On my machine I get: 1m50s to build stage0, 3m40s to build stage1, 2m2s to build stage2. Also stage0/rustc is a 4.4mb binary whereas stage1/rustc and stage2/rustc are (identical) 13mb binaries.</p><p>While this is somewhat congruent with my recollections -- rustboot produced code faster, but its code ran slower -- the effect size is actually much less than I remember. I'd convinced myself retroactively that rustboot was produced <em>abysmally</em> worse code than rustc-with-LLVM. But out-of-the-gate LLVM only boosted performance by 2x (and cost of 3x the code size)! Of course I also have a faster machine now. At the time bootstrap cycles took about a half hour each (<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/rust-dev@mozilla.org/msg00331.html">according to this: 15 minutes for the 2nd stage</a>).</p><p>Of course you can still see this as a condemnation of the entire "super slow dynamic polymorphism" model of rust-at-the-time, either way. It may seem funny that this version of rustc bootstraps faster than today's rustc, but this "can barely bootstrap" version was a mere 25kloc. Today's rustc is 600kloc. It's really comparing apples to oranges.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The identity of the reviewers will remain anonymous, unless they choose otherwise ‚Äî as happens now. But the exchanges between the referees and the authors will be accessible to all. Our aim in doing so is to open up what many see as the ‚Äòblack box‚Äô of science, shedding light on how a research paper is made.

These discussions, which can last for months, aim to improve a study‚Äôs clarity and the robustness of its conclusions. It is a hugely important process that should receive increased recognition, including acknowledgement of the reviewers involved, if they choose to be named. For early-career researchers, there is great value in seeing inside a process that is key to their career development. Making peer-reviewer reports public also enriches science communication: it‚Äôs a chance to add to the ‚Äòstory‚Äô of how a result is arrived at, or a conclusion supported, even if it includes only the perspectives of authors and reviewers. The full story of a paper is, of course, more complex, involving many other contributors.</p><p>Many people think of science as something fixed and unchanging. But scientific knowledge evolves as new or more-nuanced evidence comes to light. Scientists constantly discuss their results, yet these debates are not contained in research papers and often remain unreported in wider science-communication efforts.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01162-1" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-01880-9/d41586-025-01880-9_17620936.jpg"><p>Three-year trial shows support for recognizing peer reviewers</p></a></article><p>The COVID-19 pandemic provided a brief interlude during which much of the world got to see how research works, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01444-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01444-z" data-track-category="body text link">almost in real time</a>. It‚Äôs easy to forget that, right from the start, we were continuously learning something new about the nature and behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. On television screens, in newspapers and on social media worldwide, scientists were discussing among themselves and with public audiences the nature of the virus, how it infects people and how it spreads. They were debating treatments and prevention methods, constantly adjusting everyone‚Äôs knowledge <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01173-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01173-7" data-track-category="body text link">as fresh evidence came to light</a>. And then, it went mostly back to business as usual.</p><p>We hope that publishing the peer-reviewer reports of all newly submitted <i>Nature</i> papers shows, in a small way, that this doesn‚Äôt need to remain the case. <i>Nature</i> started mandating peer review for all published research articles only in 1973 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2015.0029" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2015.0029" data-track-category="body text link">M. Baldwin <i>Notes Rec.</i> <b>69</b>, 337‚Äì352; 2015</a>). But the convention in most fields is still to keep the content of these peer-review exchanges confidential. That has meant that the wider research community, and the world, has had few opportunities to learn what is discussed.</p><p>Peer review improves papers. The exchanges between authors and referees should be seen as a crucial part of the scientific record, just as they are a key part of doing and disseminating research.</p>

It‚Äôs a sentiment eagerly embraced by The Dull Men‚Äôs Club. Several million members in a number of connected Facebook groups strive to cause dullness in others on a daily basis.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   

  <div><p>Picture this, you‚Äôre a teenager in the middle of the ocean on a cruise ship. All is good, except you‚Äôre lacking your lifeblood: internet. You could pay $170 for seven days of throttled internet on a <em>single</em> device, and perhaps split it via a travel router or hotspot, but that still seems less than ideal.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been travelling Europe with family and am currently on REDACTEDCRUISELINE Cruises‚Äô REDACTEDCRUISELINE cruise ship. For the past two days, the ship has mostly been in port, so I was able to use a cellular connection. This quickly became not feasible as we got further from land, where there was no coverage. At around the same time, I wanted to download the REDACTEDCRUISELINE Cruises app on my phone, and realized that it would give me a <em>one-time 15-minute</em> internet connection. I activated it, and quickly realized that it didn‚Äôt limit you to just the Play Store or App Store: all websites could be accessed. I soon realized that this ‚Äúone-time‚Äù download was MAC-address dependent and thus, could be bypassed by switching MAC addresses. However, doing so logs you out of the REDACTEDSERVICE portal, which is required to get the 15-minutes of free internet.</p>
<p>This means that in order to get just 15 minutes of internet, the following is required:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change MAC address</li>
<li>Login to REDACTEDSERVICE with date-of-birth and room number, binding the MAC address to your identity</li>
<li>Send a request with your booking ID activating 15 minutes of free internet, intended to be used for downloading the REDACTEDCRUISELINE app
<ul>
<li>Not completely sure, but it did initially seem that to activate unrestricted access to the internet, you would need to send a simple HTTP to play.google.com, although I don‚Äôt think this is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process, on the surface, seems extremely arduous. But if this could be automated, it would suddenly become a much more viable proposition. After looking at the fetch requests the REDACTEDSERVICE portal was sending to log in and activate the free sessions, I realized that it shouldn‚Äôt be <em>too</em> hard to automate.</p>
<p>Conveniently, my family also brought a travel router running OpenWRT as we were planning on purchasing the throttled single-device plan (which is ~$170 for the entire cruise) and using the router as a hotspot so we could connect multiple devices to the internet. This router (a GL.iNet) allows you to change the MAC address via the admin portal, needing only a single POST request. This meant that if I could string together the API requests to change the MAC address (after getting a token from the router login endpoint), login to REDACTEDSERVICE, and request the free internet session, I would have free internet.</p>
<p>I first tried copying the requests as cURL commands via DevTools into Notepad and using a local LLM to vibe-code a simple bash file. Realizing this wasn‚Äôt going to work, I began work on a Python script instead. I converted the cURL commands to <code>requests</code> via Copilot (yes, I used LLMs to an extent when building this) and started chaining together the requests.</p>
<p>The only issues I faced that took some time to overcome were figuring out how to repeat the requests when needed and being resistant to unexpected HTTP errors. For the former, I initially tried repeating it on an interval (first through a <code>while True</code> loop and later via shell scripting in the container) but later realized it was much easier by checking if internet access expired by sending a request to example.com and checking if it fails. For the latter, I used <code>while True</code> loops to allow the requests to be retried and executed <code>break</code> when the requests succeeded. The only other issue, that still exists, is that occasionally, the connection will drop out while the session is refreshed, although this seems to happen less than every 15 minutes and only lasts for a minute or two.</p>
<p>After comparing speeds with another guy I met on the cruise (who also happens to be a high-school programmer), who had the highest-level REDACTEDSERVICE plan, there seems to be no additional throttling (7+ Mbps). Even better, after connecting my power bank‚Äôs integrated USB-C cable to the router, I‚Äôm able to move around the ship for hours. So far, I‚Äôve been using the router for nearly ~7 hours and my 10,000 mAh power bank is still at 42% battery. In fact, I‚Äôm writing this very post while connected to the router.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/darklang-goes-open-source/">https://blog.darklang.com/darklang-goes-open-source/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44290653">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>As part of <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/goodbye-dark-inc-welcome-darklang-inc/" rel="noreferrer"><u>shutting down Dark Inc.</u></a> and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-steps-of-darklang-inc/" rel="noreferrer"><u>forming Darklang Inc.</u>,</a> we've finally open-sourced all of our repositories. <a href="https://github.com/darklang?ref=blog.darklang.com"><u>Our source code</u></a> is now under the Apache License 2.0.</p><p>For years, we wrestled with questions of sustainability and how to build something that truly empowers developers. We've long believed in open source philosophically, but felt that Darklang's unique architecture and business model required a different approach.</p><h2 id="why-we-initially-chose-source-available"><strong>Why We Initially Chose Source-Available</strong></h2><p>We originally designed Darklang as a hosted-only platform where you'd code at darklang.com and programs would instantly be live in production. We believed this centralized approach was necessary for features like safe code migration and unified deployment, and that offering self-hosting would undermine our sustainability model.</p><p>The core challenge was building something valuable while ensuring we could continue working on it long-term. Traditional open source funding models all had limitations, so Darklang was designed as "a language with a business model" - users with serious workloads would fund ecosystem development through our hosting platform.</p><h2 id="what-changed-our-thinking"><strong>What Changed Our Thinking</strong></h2><p>Three key shifts changed our perspective:</p><p><strong>Product maturity and user feedback</strong>: The real barrier to Darklang's adoption was never licensing - it was product maturity. As we've gotten closer to building something people love, staying source-available started feeling like an unnecessary risk. We consistently heard that people wanted us to be more open.</p><p><strong>Building for local-first development</strong>: Our technical direction evolved significantly. We're now building Darklang to run locally as a CLI, with the ability to deploy to our cloud or elsewhere. Nobody wants to run a proprietary language binary on their own machine.</p><p><strong>New business opportunities</strong>: The developer tools market has matured since 2017. We now see successful companies charging for team collaboration features and AI-powered tools while keeping the core platform accessible. These create value that teams are willing to pay for, while always having the option to self-host.</p><h2 id="why-open-source"><strong>Why Open Source</strong></h2><p>Open source enables Darklang to be accessible, inspectable, and community-owned. It aligns with our philosophy of democratizing programming and ensures the platform can persist and evolve regardless of any single company's fate.</p><p>We've learned how to deliver Darklang's key benefits - invisible infrastructure, deployless deployment, trace-driven development - without requiring our specific editor or hosting environment. This makes open source viable while preserving what makes Darklang special.</p><h2 id="open-questions"><strong>Open Questions</strong></h2><p>We're still exploring some interesting technical challenges around licensing in the Darklang ecosystem. GitHub handles this by attaching LICENSE.md files, but in a world where a package manager syncs types and functions directly, there are some neat challenges to think through. The core platform being open source gives us a solid foundation to build on.</p><hr><p>Comment on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44290653&amp;ref=blog.darklang.com" rel="noreferrer">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://x.com/darklang/status/1934633874610643126?ref=blog.darklang.com" rel="noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://mas.to/@darklang/114693755778778354?ref=blog.darklang.com" rel="noreferrer">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/q0zon6/goodbye_dark_inc_hello_darklang_inc?ref=blog.darklang.com" rel="noreferrer">Lobste.rs</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7340415295649423360/?ref=blog.darklang.com" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a></p>

        Abstract
        
      </h2>
      
        
          
            <p>
      
      Object personification is the attribution of human characteristics to non-human agents. In online forums, autistic individuals commonly report experiencing this phenomenon. Given that approximately half of all autistic individuals experience difficulties identifying their own emotions, the suggestion that object personification may be a feature of autism seems almost paradoxical. Why would a person experience sympathy for objects, when they struggle to understand and verbalise the emotions of other people as well as their own? An online survey was used to assess tendency for personification in 87 autistic and 263 non-autistic adults. Together, our results indicate that object personification occurs commonly among autistic individuals, and perhaps more often (and later in life) than in the general population. Given that in many cases, autistic people report their personification experiences as distressing, it is important to consider the reasons for the increased personification and identify structures for support.
