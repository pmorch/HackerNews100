<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this post, I’ll walk you through how to create a custom shader in Three.js that simulates the look of a foil sticker, complete with angle-dependent iridescence and sparkling metallic flakes. The goal is to capture that premium, holographic effect you see on collectible stickers, trading cards, and high-end packaging, but to render it in real time directly in the browser.</p><p><img src="https://www.4rknova.com/img/post/20250830/anim01.gif" alt="Foil sticker animation"></p><h2 id="iridescence">Iridescence</h2><p>If you’ve ever tilted a holographic sticker or watched sunlight catch on a soap bubble, you’ve seen iridescence in action. In the real world, this rainbow shimmer comes from thin-film interference. When light waves bounce between layers of a surface, some wavelengths are reinforced while others cancel out, causing colors to shift depending on your viewing angle.</p><p>In real-time computer graphics, we don’t need to simulate the exact physics. Instead, we can approximate this by mapping view angle to hue, as the surface tilts relative to the camera, its color smoothly shifts through a spectrum. This gives that dynamic, “alive” quality you expect from foil stickers.</p><h2 id="foil-flakes">Foil Flakes</h2><p>Alongside the shifting colors, there’s another key detail: foil flakes. Real metallic foils have tiny reflective particles embedded in them, creating hundreds of bright, sharp highlights that twinkle as you move. These aren’t smooth reflections but randomized sparkles, giving the surface its tactile, premium feel.</p><p>To replicate this in a shader, we’ll introduce procedural noise to generate small random patches of brightness across the surface. When combined with lighting, they look like metallic specks catching the light. Together, angular hue shifts and flake sparkles create a convincing illusion of printed holographic foil without expensive rendering tricks.</p><h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2><p>This implementation simulates a peeling, iridescent sticker with foil flakes using Three.js. While I will borrow concepts such as metalness, roughness, and Fresnel from Physically Based Rendering (PBR), this shader is not physically based. The goal is to create a visually plausible, artistic effect.</p><p>Below is a live demo of the shader, where you can modify its parameters and experiment with different configurations. Use your mouse to rotate the sticker around and see how the material reacts to the lighting.</p><h2 id="vertex-shader">Vertex Shader</h2><p>The vertex shader handles the peel geometry and passes useful information to the fragment shader.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Uniform / Varying</strong></th><th><strong>Type</strong></th><th><strong>Purpose</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>uPeelAmount</code></td><td>float</td><td>Overall peel strength (0 = flat, 1 = fully peeled).</td></tr><tr><td><code>uPeelAngle</code></td><td>float</td><td>Peel direction in degrees.</td></tr><tr><td><code>vUv</code></td><td>vec2</td><td>UV coordinates for texture mapping.</td></tr><tr><td><code>vWorldPos</code></td><td>vec3</td><td>Vertex position in world space.</td></tr><tr><td><code>vNormal</code></td><td>vec3</td><td>Transformed normal for lighting.</td></tr><tr><td><code>vAOIntensity</code></td><td>float</td><td>Distance moved by vertex, used to darken lifted areas.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The shader goes through the following simple steps:</p><ol><li>Compute vector from hinge to current vertex.</li><li>Calculate the peel factor and angle.</li><li>Define the rotation axis and apply Rodrigues’ rotation formula to rotate the vertex around that axis.</li><li>Apply the same rotation to the normal.</li><li>Calculate a fake ambient occlusion term.</li></ol><p>Here’s the full vertex shader code:</p><div><pre><code><span>uniform</span> <span>float</span> <span>uPeelAmount</span><span>;</span>  <span>// Strength of peel (0.0 → no peel, 1.0 → full peel)</span>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries (in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

It called on Israel to halt “deliberate attacks on civilians, including children; starvation; deprivation of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other essentials; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement”.</p><p data-start="2077" data-end="2374">Sergey Vasiliev, professor of international law at the Open University of the Netherlands, told Reuters the declaration reflected a consensus that has taken root in academia. “This legal assessment has become mainstream within academia, particularly in the field of genocide studies,” he said.</p><p data-start="2077" data-end="2374">Ismail al-Thawabta, head of Gaza’s Government Media Office, said the “prestigious scholarly stance reinforces the documented evidence and facts presented before international courts”. He added that the resolution “places a legal and moral obligation on the international community to take urgent action to stop the crime, protect civilians, and hold the leaders of the occupation accountable”.</p><h2 id="israel-s-growing-legal-woes" data-start="2376" data-end="2708">Israel’s growing legal woes</h2><p data-start="2376" data-end="2708">The resolution came as Israel faces a separate case at the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/2/28/israel-icj-and-the-movement-for-a-principled-and-just-world-order">International Court of Justice</a> at The Hague, where it is already accused of genocide.</p><p data-start="2376" data-end="2708">The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-israeli-pm-netanyahu-for-war-crimes-in-gaza">International Criminal Court</a> has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p data-start="2710" data-end="3146">Since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023, more than 63,000 Palestinians have been killed, nearly all residents have been displaced at least once, and most of Gaza’s buildings have been destroyed or damaged.</p><p data-start="2710" data-end="3146">A UN-backed global hunger monitor has confirmed the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/27/starvation-strategy-how-israel-created-famine-in-gaza">famine</a> in parts of Gaza, a direct result of Israel’s blockade and bombing campaign that has deliberately restricted food, water, and medicine.</p><p data-start="3546" data-end="3789">IAGS has previously recognised genocides in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Armenia, and Myanmar. The UN convention it cites defines genocide as crimes committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.</p><p data-start="3791" data-end="3952">The resolution also said Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023 constituted international crimes but emphasised that these acts do not justify genocide.</p><p data-start="3954" data-end="4132">Hundreds of UN human rights staff last week urged High Commissioner Volker Turk to explicitly label Israel’s campaign as genocide, underscoring growing international consensus.</p></div><div><p>Source: </p><!-- --><p>Al Jazeera and news agencies</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>When I started building Bear I made the code available under an <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit" target="_blank">MIT license</a>. I didn't give it much thought at the time, but knew that I wanted the code to be available for people to learn from, and to make it easily auditable so users could validate claims I have made about the privacy and security of the platform.</p>
<p>Unfortunately over the years there have been cases of people forking the project in the attempt to set up a competing service. And it hurts. It hurts to see something you've worked so hard on for so long get copied and distributed with only a few hours of modification. It hurts to have poured so much love into a piece of software to see it turned against you and threaten your livelihood. It hurts to believe in open-source and then be bitten by it.</p>
<p>After the last instance of this I have come to the difficult decision to change Bear's license from MIT to a version of copyleft called the Elastic License—created by the Elastic Search people.</p>
<p>This license is almost identical to the MIT license but with the stipulation that the software cannot be provided as a hosted or managed service. You can view the specific wording <a href="https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/blob/master/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>After spending time researching how other projects are handling this, I realise I'm not alone. Many other open-source projects have updated their licenses to prevent "free-ride competition" in the past few years.<sup><a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-licenses" target="_blank">1</a><a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom" target="_blank">2</a><a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2021/04/20/grafana-loki-tempo-relicensing-to-agplv3/" target="_blank">3</a><a href="https://snowplow.io/blog/introducing-snowplow-limited-use-license" target="_blank">4</a><a href="https://www.scylladb.com/2024/12/18/why-were-moving-to-a-source-available-license/" target="_blank">5</a><a href="https://blog.sentry.io/introducing-the-functional-source-license-freedom-without-free-riding/" target="_blank">6</a></sup></p>
<p>We're entering a new age of AI powered coding, where creating a competing product only involves typing "Create a fork of this repo and change its name to something cool and deploy it on an EC2 instance".</p>
<p>While Bear's code is good, what makes the platform special is the <a href="https://bearblog.dev/discover/" target="_blank">people who use it</a>, and the <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/manifesto/" target="_blank">commitment to longevity</a>.</p>
<p>I will ensure the platform is taken care of, even if it means backtracking on what people can do with the code itself.</p>

            <guid>45091493</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 10:39:25 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/">https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45091493">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><strong>TLDR: In two years we plan to turn CocoaPods trunk to be read-only. At that point, no new versions or pods will be added to trunk.</strong> - Note, this post has been updated in May 2025.</p>

<p>Last month I wrote about how CocoaPods is currently being maintained, I also noted that we were discussing converting the main CocoaPods spec repo "trunk" to be read-only:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are discussing that on a very long, multi-year, basis we can drastically simplify the security of CocoaPods trunk by converting the Specs Repo to be read-only. Infrastructure like the Specs repo and the CDN would still operate as long as GitHub and jsDelivr continue to exist, which is pretty likely to be a very long time. <strong>This will keep all existing builds working</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I plan to implement the read-only mode so that when someone submits a new Podspec to CocoaPods, it will always be denied at the server level. I would then convert the "CocoaPods/Specs" repo to be marked as "Archived" on GitHub which should cover all of our bases.</p>

<p>Making the switch will not break builds for people using CocoaPods in 2026 onwards, but at that point, you're not getting any more updates to dependencies which come though CocoaPods trunk. This shouldn't affect people who use CocoaPods with their own specs repos, or have all of their dependencies vendored (e.g. they all come from npm.)</p>

<p><em>May 2025</em> Update: Since this post was originally written, we've had enough security researchers abusing scripting capabilities in CocoaPods that we are now introducing a block on allowing new CocoaPods to use the <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#prepare_command"><code>prepare_command</code></a> field in a Podspec. Any existing Pods using <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#prepare_command"><code>prepare_command</code></a> are hard-coded to bypass this check.</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

<p>My goal is to send 2 very hard-to-miss notifications en-masse, and then do a test run a month before the final shutdown.</p>

<h3 id="may-2025">May 2025</h3>

<p>We are stopping new CocoaPods from being added which use the <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#prepare_command"><code>prepare_command</code></a> field</p>

<h3 id="mid-late-2025">Mid-late 2025</h3>

<p>I will email all email addresses for people who have contributed a Podspec, informing them of the impending switch to read-only, and linking them to this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="september-october-2026">September-October 2026</h3>

<p>I will, again, email all email addresses for people who have contributed a Podspec, informing them of the impending switch to read-only, and linking them to this blog post, noting that they have roughly a month before we do a test run of going read-only.</p>

<h3 id="november-1-7th-2026">November 1-7th 2026</h3>

<p>I will trigger a test run, giving automation a chance to break early</p>

<h3 id="december-2nd-2026">December 2nd 2026</h3>

<p>I will switch trunk to not accept new Podspecs permanently. This is a Wednesday after American Thanksgiving, so I think folks won't be in rush mode.</p>



<p>These dates are not set in stone, and maybe someone out there has a good reason for us to amend the timeline. I don't think I'm amenable to moving it forwards, but within reason there's space for backwards.</p>

		              <h5>By Finn J.D. John<br>
			                <em>January 26, 2025</em>
                            <figure>
                        </figure>
		              </h5>
		              <p><strong>AS LEWIS AND CLARK’S</strong> Corps of Discovery made its way across the continent to Oregon, the men (and woman) of the party probably weren’t thinking much about their place in history. So they weren’t taking any particular pains to document their every movement.</p>
            <p>There were, however, some particular pains they were experiencing with every movement, so to speak ... as a result of a relentlessly low-fiber diet: Everyone was constipated, all the time.</p>
            <p>Luckily, they had something that helped with that — a lot. The Corps of Discovery left on its journey with a trove of 600 giant pills that the men called “thunder-clappers,” which the soldiers and travelers used to jump-start things when they got bound up. And everyone used them pretty regularly.</p>
            <figure>
              <div> <p><a href="https://offbeatoregon.com/assets-2010/1006d_BiliousPills/fort_clatsop_1800x1013.jpg"><img src="https://offbeatoregon.com/assets-2010/1006d_BiliousPills/fort_clatsop_400.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="133"></a></p><figcaption>
                  <h6>The reproduction of Fort Clatsop, built at or near the site of the Corps of Expedition's original buildings. Dr. Rush's Bilious Pills have not been particularly helpful in locating the original Fort Clatsop, long since rotted away — either because it hasn’t been found yet, or because the site of the old pit latrine has been disturbed by farming or logging activities in the years since. (Image: National Parks Service)</h6>
                </figcaption>
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>And, strange as it seems, that fact is why we know several of their campsites along the way. The main active ingredient in “thunder-clappers” was a mercury salt, which is a pretty stable compound. Archaeologists simply have to search for dimples in the ground — which is what old latrine pits often end up looking like, hundreds of years later, after Nature has partly filled them in — and take samples of the dirt in them. </p>
            <p>If it comes up with an off-the-charts reading for mercury, well, that’s a Corps of Discovery pit toilet — and the layout of the rest of the campsite can be extrapolated with considerable precision by consulting the military manuals they used to lay out their camps.</p>
            <p><br>
              <strong>THESE PILLS WERE</strong> the pride and joy of Dr. Benjamin Rush, one of the Founding Fathers and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Rush was also the man President Thomas Jefferson considered the finest physician in the republic. </p>
            <p>In that opinion, Jefferson was probably alone, or at least in a small minority. Dr. Rush’s style of “heroic medicine” had caused his star to fall quite a bit by this time — especially after the Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic of 1793, when his patients died at a noticeably higher rate than untreated sufferers. </p>
            <p>At the time, of course, very little was known about how the human body worked. Physicians were basically theorists, who made educated guesses and did their best. </p>
            <p>The problem was, the education on which those educated guesses were based varied pretty wildly depending on what school you came from. Homeopathic physicians theorized that giving patients a tiny amount of something that mimicked their symptoms would stimulate the body to cure itself. Eclectic physicians sought cures from herbs and folk remedies. Hydropathic physicians believed hot and cold water, applied externally or internally, was all that was needed. </p>
            <p>Dr. Rush wasn’t from one of these schools. He was from the school of mainstream medicine — also known as allopathic medicine (although that term is a perjorative today).</p>
            <p>Allopathic medical theory, in the early 1800s, dated from the second century A.D., courtesy of a Roman doctor named Galen. </p>
            <p>Galen theorized that the human body ran on four different fluids, which he called “humours”: Blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. All disease, he claimed, stemmed from an imbalance in these humours.</p>
            <p>Thus, too much blood caused inflammation and fever; the solution was to let a pint or two out. Too much bile caused problems like constipation; the solution was to administer a purgative and let the patient blow out some black bile into a handy chamber-pot, or vomit up some yellow bile — or both.</p>
            <p>These interventions sometimes helped, but most of the time they had little or no good effect. So by Rush’s time, a number of physicians were going on the theory that what was needed was a doubling-down on their theory — in a style of practice that they called “heroic medicine.”</p>
            <p>If a sensible dose of a purgative didn’t get a patient’s bile back in balance, a “heroic” dose might. If a cup or two of blood didn’t get the fever down, four or five surely would.          </p>

        <p>“Some people have stated that the Lewis and Clark Expedition would have been better off if they had taken a trained physician along to care for the numerous problems that they encountered. I totally disagree,” says physician and historian David Peck. “I think a trained physician would have been overly confident and possibly would have been much more aggressive in their treatment of illnesses, often times to the detriment of the patient.”</p>
        <p>In lieu of a trained physician, the Corps of Discovery’s leaders got some basic medical training, along with a bag full of the tools of allopathic intervention: lancets for bleeding patients, blister powder for inducing “heat,” opium products for relieving pain and inducing sleep — and purgatives.</p>
        <p>Those purgatives are the heroes of our story today. They came in the form of beefy pills, about four times the size of a standard aspirin tablet, which Rush called “Dr. Rush’s Bilious Pills.” They contained about 10 grains of calomel and 10 to 15 grains of jalap.</p>
        <figure>

              <h6>This recipe for a milder version of Rush's Bilious Pills comes from the National Formulary in 1945. This image appears in the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation's Web site, at which there's a lot more information about the ingredients in this compound. Mercury was still being used as an internal medicine in the 1960s and as a topical antiseptic (chiefly as Mercurochrome) into the 1990s.</h6>

          </div>
        </figure>
        <p>Jalap, the powdered root of a Mexican variety of morning glory, is a natural laxative of considerable power. </p>
        <p>And calomel ... ah, calomel. Calomel was the wonder drug of the age. Its chemical name is mercury chloride. In large doses (and they don’t get much larger than 10 grains, or 20 if a fellow takes two of them, as Dr. Rush recommended!) it functions as a savage purgative, causing lengthy and productive sessions in the outhouse and leaving a patient thoroughly depleted and hopefully in full restoration of his bile balance. </p>
        <p>Calomel also was the only thing known to be effective against syphilis, which was always an issue with military outfits. Whether picked up from a friendly lady in a waterfront St. Louis “sporting house” before the journey, or from an equally friendly Native lady met along the way, syphilis went with soldiers like ice cold milk with an Oreo cookie.</p>
        <p>When symptoms broke out, the patient would be dosed with “thunder clappers” and slathered with topical mercury ointments until he started salivating ferociously, which was a symptom of mild mercury poisoning but at the time was considered a sure sign that the body was purging the sickness out of itself. </p>
        <p>And yes, a few of the men did end up needing treatment for syphilis. But everyone in the party needed a good laxative “on the regular” (sorry about that). Week after week, hunting parties went out and brought back animals to eat. The explorers lived on almost nothing but meat.</p>
        <p>And this low-fiber diet had predictable results.</p>
        <p>It had another result, too, which was less predictable — although highly convenient for later historians. The fact is, mercury chloride is only slightly soluble in human digestion. Plus, the reason it works is, it irritates the tissues of the digestive tract severely, causing the body to expel it just as fast as it possibly can before more damage can be done. So, most of the calomel in any given “bilious pill” gets blown out post-haste in the ensuing “purge.”</p>
        <p>Then, once out of the body and in the earth, it lasts literally for centuries without breaking down or dissolving away.</p>
        <p>So as Lewis and Clark and their crew made their way across the continent, and across Oregon, they were unknowingly depositing a trail of heavy-metal laxatives along the way — a trail that historians and scientists have been able to detect and use to document almost their every, uh, movement.        </p>
