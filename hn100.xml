<p>Missing a connection can turn a routine trip into a real slog.</p>



<p>There’s good news, though. Airlines who operate flights from/within Europe (or from anywhere on an EU carrier) are required by law to get you to your final destination within a specific timeframe. If they don’t, you’re entitled to a good amount of cash thanks to the EU 261/2004 legislation. Outside of the EU; countries like Brazil, Canada, and the UK all have similar laws. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, there is nothing stopping an airline from denying a legit claim. They know you wont chase them down in courts, and there’s no automatic oversight.</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>



<p>Airlines are so focused on their bottom line that they will outright lie to passengers, denying totally valid compensation claims. They do this by giving affected passengers incorrect departure/arrival information, or worse, blaming Air Traffic Control, in an attempt to shift focus and avoid payout. (Non-EU-based airlines will straight up ignore EU261/2004 requests!)</p>



<p>“It was an air traffic control delay” is a convincing excuse, but generally not a valid one. Under the law, burden of proof is on the airline.</p>



<p>Air France played dirty with me recently—and now <em>you</em> get to read about it! Let this article serve as a tutorial on how to handle an airline dispute on your own. Take note of which proof to keep, which laws mean what, and how to word emails. </p>



<h2>The Incident</h2>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="520" height="210" src="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chart.png 520w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chart-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px"><figcaption><sup><em><sub>Original schedule (booking e-mail)</sub></em></sup> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The first leg of the itinerary was AF1225, a quick shot from LIS to CDG on Air France.</p>



<p>Everything started normally, with a smooth check-in around 08:00 and a departure time of 09:40 posted on the departures screens. As long as everything went to schedule, I would arrive in Miami at 18:05 (EST). </p>



<p>My itinerary allowed for just an hour to disembark the first segment, go through immigration in Paris, then board the international segment. The connection was going to be tight—doable, but tight. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, things went south.</p>



<p>Right off the bat, the arrival plane (F-GTAY) from Paris (AF1224) was delayed into Lisbon by about ten minutes, arriving at the gate at 09:00. This gave Air France just 40 minutes to disembark all the passengers, clean, and off/load all the hold luggage. </p>






<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="346" src="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/incoming.png" alt="" srcset="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/incoming.png 400w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/incoming-300x260.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption><sup><em><sub>Incoming aircraft F-GTAY (AF1224) on June 1st (FlightAware)</sub></em></sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The gate agents made an announcement of a short delay due to a “late incoming aircraft,” and put a new departure time up of 09:56. Once the plane was ready, we were quickly boarded and things seemed to be back on track.</p>



<p>Then we waited. </p>



<p>And waited. </p>



<p>At one point, I checked FlightAware, which said the plane had already taken off. The aircraft hadn’t even left the gate.</p>

<p>By the time the flight left the gate at 10:48, it was clear there was going to be no time to make the connection. This was confirmed by a flight attendant, who told me during the flight to proceed directly to the customer service booth once we arrived at CDG.</p>



<p>The flight landed at 13:55, and it wasn’t until about 14:20 that all passengers (including myself) were fully unloaded. It took about ten more minutes to get myself to the customer service booth. </p>

<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="947" height="53" src="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled.png" alt="" srcset="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled.png 947w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-300x17.png 300w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-768x43.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px"><figcaption><sup><sub><i>(PlaneFlightTracker)(estimated arrival vs actual arrival)</i></sub></sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Customer Service</h2>



<p>The AF customer service agents at Charles de Gaulle were helpful enough. I was ultimately rebooked on AF686 to Atlanta, and then on DL1399 to Miami. My new ETA: 00:53(+1 day)—roughly 6 hours after my original scheduled landing time, triggering Article 6(1)(c) and Article 7(1)(c) of EU 261/2004.</p>



<p>At one point I asked about my right to compensation, but they would not provide any information related to EU 261/2004. This could be considered a violation of Article 251 (20) of the original treaty: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>(20) Passengers should be fully informed of their rights in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, so that they can effectively exercise their rights.  </p>
<cite>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A32004R0261</cite></blockquote>



<p>“I don’t know anything about that law,” I was told. “You’ll have to call.” Instead, I was handed an €11 voucher for food (which buys nothing at CDG, by the way).</p>



<h2>The Claim</h2>



<p>Within the next 30 minutes, I had a claim filed through Air France’s <a href="https://wwws.airfrance.fr/en/information/legal/reclamation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online form</a>. This is a really simple form that just requires photos of your boarding pass, flight details, an explanation for the claim, and bank information. The entire process from submission to decision should take roughly a week. </p>



<p>For the record, the rest of my flights were also delayed, getting me into Miami at 02:15 (+1 day) and making the total delay about eight hours.</p>



<p>Within ten days I got a response from Air France: <strong>denied</strong>.</p>


<div>

<p>Blaming ATC and weather are common “get-out-of-jail-free cards” airlines use—mostly because it’s initially hard to prove wrong. Most people don’t think an airline would lie to them. I responded to the denial asking for clarification before I escalated.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="607" height="514" src="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Second.png" alt="" srcset="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Second.png 607w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Second-300x254.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px"><figcaption><em><sup>Second Denial</sup></em></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Escalation</h2>



<p>Rule of thumb: never trust a company that owes you money to fairly investigate themselves. Once I realized Air France was sticking to the script, I informed them I plan on escalating to the Portuguese Civil Aviation Authority (also known as <a href="https://www.anac.pt/vPT/Generico/Paginas/Homepage00.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ANAC</a>). </p>



<p>In Europe, each country has a Civil Aviation Authority that is responsible for enforcing EU 261/2004. To escalate a claim, fill out a complaint form and send all the requested documents to the Civil Aviation Authority in the departure country — in my case Portugal. You may have to write the email in the local language, however ANAC has an English contact. It can take up to 30 days to receive a response.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Lucky for me, it took just five days for ANAC to come back with a response: <strong>OVERRULED!</strong></p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA2.png" alt="" width="654" height="529" srcset="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA2.png 825w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA2-300x243.png 300w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA2-768x621.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px"></figure></div>


<p>Just to be clear: ANAC requested clarification from Air France, and instead of blaming weather or ATC, AF simply rolled over without challenge. Why? Because the burden of proof falls on the airline and they were presumably lying to me. </p>



<p>Instead of reopening my original claim, Air France opened a brand new claim. I was ultimately paid out $658. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>
					'Round these parts, we write about old Sierra games and their rich inner lives. As I'm often at pains to point out, this is thanks to the brilliant script decompiler written by Phil Fortier for <a href="http://scicompanion.com/">SCI Companion</a>. Released in 2015, it was the first and only decompiler for SCI games — at least as far as the world is concerned. And now lo, for there is another.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Last year, I had a vision and began writing my own decompiler — a <i>mass decompiler</i> — with the goal of wiring it up to my script tools for annotations. Annotations are comments and symbols that transform decompiled code from something you <i>can</i> read into something you want to. That's how I learned the scripts in the first place: by writing automatic annotators and reading the results. I&nbsp;wanted to share this with the community<a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/community">*</a> but the particulars of SCI Companion made it a thorny problem. The decompiler I envisioned could unlock the solution, but I didn't know how to write it. I wasn't sure I ever would. The only certainty was that win or lose, it would take a while.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					In the meantime, I slowly obtained as many games and variants as I could. What's a mass decompiler without the masses? There are only about sixty games, but they were heavily revised, ported, and translated. Software scavenger hunts are fun and this one as been successful. I've now amassed over three hundred versions of SCI games from 1988 through 1996. While that's not <i>every</i> single one, you have my permission to say it is.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Today, with one command and a couple of cores, I've decompiled and annotated every Sierra SCI game, and <i>practically</i> every version, and dumped the results on github for everyone to enjoy. <b>Gentlemen...&nbsp;<i>BEHOLD!</i></b>
					</p>

					</p>
			
					<p>
					<i>You're still here??</i> Look, you're welcome to stay, but I just linked to half a gig of <b>way</b> more interesting text. I even got out the big font! (When do we <i>ever</i> get out the big font?) In fact, I'm counting on the crowd thinning out so I can indulge in some inside baseball.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					I just want to kick back and tell the story of how this came to be. We'll see where Sierra's script language came from, what reverse engineers have done with it, and why I'm cheerfully undermining the blog with today's release. I've got <i>a lot</i> of meta-rules to break. You go outside and play with your scripts!
					</p>
			
					<p>
					When I talk about Sierra code, I break it into three categories:
					</p>
			
					<ul>
					<li><p>
					<b>Game Scripts:</b> This is the unique code that defines a game. Every room in every game gets its own script. You care about this if you want to solve <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/super-sleuth">murder mysteries</a> or find <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/gabriel-knight-1-easter-eggs">easter eggs</a>. This is probably the only code you care about.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					<b>System Scripts:</b> These are the supporting scripts that appear in every game. They form a common runtime library that the games are built on. You'll find generic classes for rooms and actors and icon bars, and utility functions for things like message boxes and math. Even the game loop lives here. As you get deeper into SCI mechanics, you care more about these scripts, although perhaps reluctantly.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					<b>The Interpreter:</b> This is the program that runs the show; you know it as SIERRA.EXE or SCIV.EXE. The interpreter was written in C and a lot of assembly, and then rewritten in C++ and slightly less assembly. It loads drivers, decodes resources, and runs the first game script in a virtual machine. It's the "VM" in <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a>. From there, it just follows orders until a script sets the quit flag or it famously crashes. It also contains over a hundred kernel functions that scripts call to do work. You care about the interpreter if you want to solve <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/case-cracked">bonus mysteries</a> or find <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/sierras-macintosh-timebomb">timebombs</a>. Or if you're <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/credits/#engine_teams">crazy enough</a> to replace the whole thing.
					</p></li>
					</ul>
			
					<p>
					Today is all about the scripts. Let's see what one looks like! Remember that Sierra programmers wrote these in their proprietary language (also called Script) and compiled them with their in-house compiler to SCI bytecode. Those are the bytes that shipped with the games. Decompiling can <i>never</i> recover the original text. Symbols are lost. Control flow is ambiguous. Compilers have bugs. Optimizations ruin everything.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					But God is alive, and Magic is afoot.

					<p>
					This is the code that runs when you click the mint dish in King's Quest VI. And thanks to the annotations, you know what it does. Each comment was generated by an annotator. The message annotator is usually the most helpful. Without the comments, you're just staring at numbers. The global variables were renamed by two annotators: one that handles system globals and another that knows KQ6 details. As you can see in the first version, some symbols come straight from the game. Sierra generously included them for debugging. Combine those names with annotations and you get highly readable code.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Annotations aside, scope out that language. SCI Script is often described as LISP-like, but that's just a curvy stereotype. It <i>looks</i> like LISP because of parenthesis and prefix notation, but if that's all it takes... well please tell that to a LISP programmer. They deserve it. This language doesn't even have LISts! The syntax does make it easy to parse, but I haven't seen anyone take advantage of that; except compiler authors and me. So join the rest of the world and forget about LISP. The real inspiration for SCI Script is Smalltalk.

						In any case I started learning about object oriented programming and it just really resonated with me. And then suddenly we were able to start displaying more than 16 colors on monitors, and Ken wanted of course to take advantage of that, but AGI was written in such a way that it was going to take a major rework of the entire game engine and language and everything in order to support 256 colors. And so that's when I pitched Ken on SCI and basically saying okay let's go with a whole new language, we're going to have to rewrite this thing anyway, let's make things better. And he was pretty dubious, but I guess he figured since we were having to rewrite everything anyway, he might as well let me do it.

					<p>
					BYTE Magazine dedicated one issue to a language each year. In August 1981, that was Smalltalk. Reading through, I was first struck by the magazine cover. Oh... it has a back story. It's a charming retort to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1978-08">Pascal cover</a> from 1978 that painted Smalltalk as aloof and inaccessible. I love it; did that allegorical slight really fester at Xerox PARC for three years? Of course it did! <i>They're nerds!</i> And&nbsp;their response? A textbook <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/clapback-meaning-origin">clapback</a> from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNTARSM-Fjc&amp;list=PL10CF667591857A2D">Yacht Rock</a> era.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Reading further, I was surprised by how much terminology made its way into SCI: selectors, method dictionaries, temporary variables, receivers — they're all in those pages. Even SCI's ubiquitous <i>doit</i> method is a Smalltalk convention. The influence is clear.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Jeff also mentioned Objective C, and I'm sure that contributed too, but I refused to research it. Sorry, it's a personal prejudice. That&nbsp;language is just so damned ugly that, like a <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/wildlife/2023/04/14/an-opossums-arrival-in-homer-spurs-capture-efforts-memes-and-a-campaign-to-freegrubby/">filthy</a> <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/wildlife/2023/05/25/opossum-that-ran-loose-in-homer-for-weeks-finds-a-home-at-the-alaska-zoo/">freakin'</a> <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/wildlife/2023/06/02/wildlife-officials-seek-help-as-additional-invasive-opossums-are-discovered-in-homer/">opossum</a>, it triggers my fight-or-flight. And I'm done breaking laptops! So we're sticking with the Smalltalk narrative. And breaking meta-rules instead.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					My one exposure to Smalltalk was in school. The assignment was to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma cipher</a> in a language you didn't know. For&nbsp;extra credit, you could write a program to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma">crack</a> it. Excuse me? Breaking Nazi encryption is <i>optional??</i> Not in my family! We&nbsp;<b>really</b>&nbsp;need <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anchors-Aweigh-Lynden-Benshoof-ebook/dp/B00AT35E40">Grandpa Benshoof</a> to survive D-Day! Smalltalk did the trick and I remember it fondly. My fascist decoder worked, but as the messages got longer it got slower. Really slow. Even on the expensive machines. Oh well, I wasn't getting graded on speed. Later, the department chair left a handwritten note about my impressive use of CPU cycles. The polite implication was that I would have lost us the war for want of a hash table.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Speaking of impressions! I'm impressed with the shelf life on that Smalltalk issue. SCI was developed in 1988 and yet these technical articles from 1981 were still relevant. In a way, they're timeless. Just not timely.
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						<b>When Can I Buy It?</b>
						</p>
			
						<p>
						There are currently no personal computer implementations for the Smalltalk-80
						language. Because of this, I'm sure we'll be criticized by some for introducing
						the language too early and frustrating our readers. Nevertheless, I feel that
						the time to begin exposing people to object-oriented language is <i>now</i>. Only by challenging and enticing the personal computer community can we stimulate the industry to create the machines we all dream of.

					<p>
					Smalltalk fans had the programming language, but not the software. SCI fans had the opposite problem. They had years of games, and years to reverse engineer them, but the source language was a secret. How do you decompile that? What syntax do you use? If&nbsp;SCI Script was internal to Sierra, and the games only contain bytecode, then how do we know what the language looks like at all?
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<b><i>We didn't!</i></b> Not exactly. And not for a long time. But all that's over. Now we know everything.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/brief.png" alt="SCI Programming Language document by Jeff Stephenson, 1988">
					</p>
			
					<p>
					To see how far we've come, take a look at this snapshot of Lance Ewing's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110729181959/http://www.scriptinterpreter.com/syntax">SCI Syntax page</a> from 2011. Lance thoroughly documented the publicly available clues to establish what was known and could be inferred about the language. Here In The Future, we have things a bit easier. Here's the original <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/files/sci-programming.language.txt">language spec</a> by Jeff Stephenson himself. This document is a monument to getting things right the first time. Throughout SCI's successful nine year run, the language never changed. The details that drifted are unspeakably dull. The games from 1988 are radically different than 1996, but underneath it's all the same bytecode from the same language. This was a design goal from the start.
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						The whole goal was flexibility in programming, and trying to push as much of the programming capabilities up to the game developer level rather than having them have to go into the engine as we could, and decoupling graphics and so forth to the point where you could keep extending the graphical capabilities. Because at that point it was pretty clear we're going to be getting more and more changes in hardware and everything.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					To a reverse engineer, this sounds like great news. It sounds like if you want to work with SCI scripts, you can do so universally. And&nbsp;that's true! Kinda? But also not really, because even though the bytecode is consistent, everything else is all over the map.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					When I joined the ScummVM team, Martin Kiewitz told me that the hardest part of SCI was all the versions. Now that ScummVM runs even more of them, I joke that the entire codebase is version checks. The SciVersion <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/engines/sci/detection.h">code</a> is a window into the madness:
					</p>
			
<pre>
<span>enum</span> <span>SciVersion</span> {
	<span>SCI_VERSION_NONE</span>,
	<span>SCI_VERSION_0_EARLY</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_0_LATE</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_01</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_1_EGA_ONLY</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_1_EARLY</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_1_MIDDLE</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_1_LATE</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_1_1</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_2</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_2_1_EARLY</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_2_1_MIDDLE</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_2_1_LATE</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_3</span> 
};
</pre>
			
					<p>
					Depending on your perspective, thirteen versions could be a little, could be a lot. But these aren't <i>real</i> versions; they're high level buckets invented by reverse engineers. Games don't cleanly fall into them. Sierra typically had three or four games in various stages of development. Meanwhile, the interpreter evolved at its own pace. Think of each release as a fork with who knows what fixes and features backported in or taken out or tweaked. Resource formats, container formats, and compression formats each change over time. So apply those fuzzy versions to every layer. And then multiply the combinations across all the patches and ports.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					If you want to write SCI software that works with more than a handful of games then these are your problems to deal with.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/kq4-disks.jpg" alt="King's Quest 4 floppy disks">
					<br>
					<i>One of these is a typo that's also a real version</i>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					God help you if you turn to SCI's version numbers. Assuming Sierra didn't typo the floppy labels, or leave the placeholder x.yy.zzz, or release a non-release version, or get the odometer stuck on 2.100.002, then they're best treated as based on a true story. Versions that start with "L.rry" aren't Leisure Suit Larry games; they're whatever Larry Scott compiled that day. Consider that ScummVM is the most comprehensive SCI software and it doesn't even attempt to look at these version numbers.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Instead, each piece is felt out at runtime with careful heuristics, deductive inference, and deep vats of hard-coded exceptions. And&nbsp;then someone finds a German Amiga version full of anachronisms and blows it all up.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Believe it or not, <i>I'm not complaining!</i> If these things were easy then there wouldn't be any left for me.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					But I do want to convince you that <b>Universal SCI is hard</b> and the versions are a heavy tax. We're going to talk about the reverse engineers who took on the scripts, and I want you to know what they were getting into, and appreciate how far they got.

					<p>
					Brian Provinciano is an SCI pioneer. In 1999 he wrote SCI Graphics Studio and set a dangerous precedent with a resource editor for Windows. This grew into SCI Studio, the first program that allowed fans to create their own EGA games. By 2002 it was out of beta and included a script editor, script compiler, and a full template game. SCI Studio was a legitimate Integrated Development Environment — the era of fan games had begun.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					What an exciting time that must have been. And so much work! Sierra's Script was still a secret, so to write a compiler you first had to <i>reinvent the language</i>. At least there were clues to what it should look like. And the bytecode wasn't a total mystery; the names of opcodes and kernel functions were included with games for debugging. Still — <i>sounds hard!</i> Brian took all this and developed his own script syntax with the necessary features that captured the spirit of the original, and then wrote a compiler for it. Sierra's 1980s executables happily ran the results. Nowadays we call this SCI Studio Syntax, but at the time it was the only game in town.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Okay so you have the world's first third party SCI compiler. Now what? Well, Sierra's game programmers didn't start from scratch, they had all those system scripts we discussed earlier. So I guess you need those scripts! But if all you have is bytecode...
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						I am now working on decompiling Leisure Suit Larry 2 to create the template game. It is TONS of work because my program can only disassemble, not decompile. I am having to do it all by hand. In order to write a decompiler, I would basically have to mimic the interpreter. It would be a lot of work, more work than it's worth.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					Brian later said that he spent weeks on this "long and grueling task" and manually decompiled 50-60 scripts and over 130 classes from several games. If you've never decompiled assembly code by hand then it's hard to explain this sacrifice. And I won't try, because you shouldn't be punished for good life choices. But I will say that once it's done it's done, and <i>is</i> less work than writing a decompiler.

					<i>Brian Provinciano with SCI Studio 3 on TechTV, March 7 2003</i>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					March 2003 was a big month. Brian released SCI Studio 3 and flew from Canada to San Francisco to appear on the TechTV show <i>Call For Help</i> to present it with Sierra fan Aaron Wester. Afterwards, he... sorry can we back up for a sec?
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Let me get this straight... you're saying that in <i>2003</i>... a <i>real</i> television studio recorded a <i>real</i> show about <b><i>SCI fan software?</i></b> And this was broadcast across real satellites to real hotel rooms all over the world? And you want <i>me</i> to believe that <i>U.S. Customs</i> believed all this?? No. Absolutely not! As&nbsp;an SCI nerd in 2023, I can't accept any of this. Nope nope nope. The Wayback Machine must have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030608080619/http://www.bripro.com/news.php">crawled</a> an alternate timeline<a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/alternate-timeline">*</a>.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					That same month, Brian announced he was working on supporting VGA games, and had even begun writing a <i>script decompiler</i>. Over the next two years he posted status updates. He even posted entire scripts he'd decompiled from a variety of games.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					And then a hellbeast ate him.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					In 2006 Brian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060418054504/http://www.bripro.com/scistudio/index.php">retired</a> from SCI and posted his remaining code, but without mentioning the decompiler. He worked on SCI Studio for many years, some while in school, and set the bar for all future tools. His goal was for people to make games and <a href="https://sciprogramming.com/fangames.php">they did</a> and they were <a href="https://sciprogramming.com/fangames.php?action=review&amp;id=32">weird</a> and that is good. ScummVM happily supports fan games so you can still run them today, and probably forever.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					As you can imagine, this left some people disappointed. Not me though. <b><i>I just found out!</i></b> Oh man... so here I am, thinking I'm ushering in the second decompiling, finish the dang thing, do the research for the announcement, and only <i>then</i> find out I've been bumped down to third.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					I'm thrilled that the SCI decompiler story is a trilogy with a lost first volume. Brian's samples and posts are now highly relevant to my interests, so I read them all. Here's the executive summary:
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Brian's decompiler was a standalone program that targeted the full range of SCI versions. The hardest part of decompiling is analyzing control flow, and when the decompiler couldn't figure that out, it generated code with goto statements. That's also what professional programs like IDA Pro and Ghidra do. Goto code isn't very readable, but the alternative is all or nothing. An impressive amount of the samples he posted were right. At one point he said that he was 90% done, but I said the same thing — right before the other 90%. Brian's decompiler was the real deal and on track to do everything.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/scicompanion.jpg" alt="SCI Companion">
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Phil Fortier is our SCI savior. In 2007 he released SCI Companion 2 to replace SCI Studio. Phil is an independent <a href="http://www.icefallgames.com/">game developer</a> and one of his motivations was to make his own game. SCI Companion supported Brian's script syntax and the existing fan games. Like SCI Studio, it was limited to EGA games. After a few updates, things quieted down, and then got real quiet.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<i>Eight years later</i> Phil returned with SCI Companion 3. And it had <a href="https://sciprogramming.com/community/index.php?topic=1420.0">everything</a>! There was support for VGA games, a sound editor, and... AND... an&nbsp;end to the twelve year thirst: the world finally had a script decompiler.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					When I describe SCI reverse engineering, I stress that not only have we been graced with a latter day decompiler — against all odds — but an excellent one. It works so well that there's little to talk about except its limitations.
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						The decompiler isn't perfect, but typically it can decompile about 95 to 99 percent of a game into source code. Success is typically on a function-by-function basis. Luckily, if an error or unexpected condition occurs anywhere during the decompilation of a function, we can have the entire function fallback to assembly. This at least retains the ability to recompile code correctly, and also retains some symbol information.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					Compare this approach to Brian's goto statements. If just one thing goes wrong then SCI Companion fails a function and produces no code. The larger the function, the more likely it fails. But gotos aren't an option anymore, and for a good reason.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Phil created a new script syntax based on the original and named it Sierra Script. It's so close to Sierra's that I can't remember the differences. I think Phil's is stricter but my parsers can't tell the difference so neither can I. Decompiled scripts look like the real thing, and that's great, and that means no gotos — also great.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					That leaves the bugs where the decompiler silently produces incorrect code. I'm familiar with these because my decompiler stumbled on the same scripts, just louder. Causes include: unexpected optimizations, nonsensical source scripts, and impossible instructions due to compiler bugs. But these instances are so rare that you can pretend they don't exist. So sure, trust but verify, but in practice don't worry about it.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/scicompanion-version.png" alt="SCI Companion version dialog">
					</p>
			
					<p>
					The decompiler's biggest limitations aren't in its algorithms, but its ergonomics. It's a complex component in a huge Windows GUI whose primary purpose is to let fans make games. In order to even find the bytecode it has to survive the SCI version nightmare. Phil&nbsp;borrowed the version logic from ScummVM, so it supports most, but he understandably skipped some of the more annoying bits. Some versions fall between these cracks. And the SCI3 script format from the last four games is unsupported. And there's no concept of multiple CDs or Macintosh. If it's outside the mainstream then it's unavailable to the decompiler.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					These are all reasonable priorities for a program that makes fan games. No fan was going to make a seven disc Fantasmagoria. If&nbsp;you want to add support for these extras, you'll have to touch a lot of unfun C++ before you even get to the decompiler. It's been <a href="https://github.com/icefallgames/SCICompanion/">open source</a> for many years so nothing has stopped you, but that brings us to the real limitation...
					</p>
			
					<p>
					SCI Companion is a Microsoft Foundation Classes Win32 C++ codebase that no one wants to work on<a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/prove-me-wrong">*</a>. <i>Oh, I get it!</i> Long ago I wrote some of my favorite programs in that stuff, and I still love running them today, but I can't bring myself to look at the code again.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					There are signs of life. The Cat has a <a href="https://github.com/Kawa-oneechan/SCICompanion">fork</a> with some fixes, and Laurence Myers recently added <a href="https://github.com/Kawa-oneechan/SCICompanion/pull/15">automatic builds</a>. That's exciting, but let's not quibble over commits: Phil finished a long time ago and no one else has touched the decompiler. <i>Including me!</i> As&nbsp;you'll see, I don't even know how it works. Maybe today's release will spark some interest. For now, the decompiler is done, and that's okay.
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						With a bunch more work, it should be possible to have the decompiler 100% effective (except for corrupted scripts, of course) — but I decided that the effort vs reward wasn't worth it beyond this point, especially given the fallback to assembly.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					Phil split SCI reverse engineering into two eras: Before Companion and After Decompiler. Reverse engineering generates countless unknowns that are too impractical to investigate. There's a threshold there, and it's determined by the tools. SCI Companion's decompiler sent that threshold plummeting. I'm hoping that today's release finishes the job.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Think of all the SCI details that were too difficult to figure out before 2015. Turn all the bytecode into high quality text, and people like us can knock them out with one grep. It's fun! It has to be — <i>it's cheating!</i>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					But you can have too much fun, so you have to be careful. Or else you could end up with a hobby.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/sluicebox.png" alt="my avatar" title="my original sin: forgot to adjust the aspect ratio">
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Here's where I enter the story:
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						It's important to have goals, or so I'm told by several reputable hashtags. In the 90s mine were to solve The Colonel's Bequest, and more importantly, The Dagger of Amon Ra. It was clear that merely playing them wasn't going to cut it. As&nbsp;time passed I would occasionally check in on the Sierra scene and when SCI Viewer dropped so did my hopes.
						</p>
			
						<p>
						SCI Viewer revealed that there was indeed a lot more to these cases but that the answers were all in the scripts. At the time, this meant reams of intolerably low level disassembly text. This wouldn't do for the high level answers I sought. "I'll&nbsp;come back later." In 2015 it was later, and lo, for Phil Fortier released from the heavens SCI Companion 3.0 with an honest to goodness script decompiler. It had been twenty years but not only could my investigation now proceed, it <i>had</i> to.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					I don't know exactly when I discovered SCI Companion 3, but I remember feeling lucky. It must have been pretty new, because it crashed so much that I couldn't use it. Before giving up, I tried compiling the latest code — the last refuge of a scoundrel. It wouldn't build, some MFC or SDK thing, the usual strife. <i>"Just when I think I'm out."</i> After some begrudging hacks, it built. SCI Companion was stable as a table and I've built from source ever since. More luck! The miracle I'd been waiting for hinged on latent knowledge of the Windows API. I bore witness and became a decompiler disciple.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					I quickly hit my limits with the scripts. Remember that first example? It's great by decompiler standards, but it's still not good enough for solving complex things like a <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/super-sleuth">Sleuth-O-Meter</a>. It was taking too long to get my bearings in the game code and I didn't even know the language. <i>I didn't know anything!</i> But I did know the messages that appear in the games.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080413035345/http://www.geocities.com/sciviewer/">SCI Viewer</a> had command line tools that could dump resources and export game messages as XML. Script those up, write some regular expressions to parse out message tuples, and baby you got a stew going: one ham-fisted message annotator. No knowledge of SCI internals required. I had my foothold! Now I could get around in these message-heavy games and build from there.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					As my tools grew they set off a cycle. A typical pattern: first my parser trips on something, then I investigate and crash ScummVM, then I investigate with ScummVM's debugger and crash that, and finally it turns out that none of this ever worked and the game has been crashing since 1990. By the time it was over I'd have fixed my bug, the ScummVM bug, the debugger, and written a script patch in bytecode to fix the game. Bonus points if there was a ten year old ticket in the bug tracker. Then my parsers would scan for similar anomalies across other games and it would start all over.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					I didn't mean to build a bug hunting machine, I just wrote some parsers that weren't very bright, and things got out of hand.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/graphs/contributors">
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/scummvm-stats.png" alt="ScummVM contributor statistics">
					</a>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					As I learned more, I wrote proper parsers, and the annotators flourished. I was closing a lot of ScummVM tickets thanks to my decompiled scripts. But as you'll recall, SCI Companion doesn't support everything. If I couldn't decompile, then I couldn't do much. The open tickets were starting to hint at which games and versions were outside of SCI Companion's purview. So I wrote some programs to bring them into the fold. The first one converted <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/quest-for-glory-i-macintosh-easter-egg">Macintosh scripts</a> to DOS with a bunch of byte-swapping. The second program downgraded SCI3 scripts to SCI2, which is so insane that I named it Conversion Therapy. Now I could decompile and annotate everything, and without touching SCI Companion's code. The tickets continued to close and the writing queue <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/archive">grew</a>.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Eventually I had a big problem: the annotated scripts had gotten too good to keep to myself. But they weren't good enough to release. Even if they were, they weren't the products of a program, but a process. Then I realized just how many imperfections I was working around, reverting, or tolerating. <i>Hell's horses!</i> I'd outgrown the SCI Companion decompiler.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Obviously the problem with this pipeline is that it runs through an unmaintained Windows GUI. Obviously the solution is to replace it. Obviously there are problems with that solution:
					</p>
			
					<ol>
					<li>
					It rather involves writing a decompiler
					</li>
					<li>
					Phil's is a tough act to follow!
					</li>
					</ol>
			
					<p>
					There was hope. Phil left a map: a <a href="https://mtnphil.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/decompiling-sci-byte-code-part-1/">four</a> <a href="https://mtnphil.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/decompiling-sci-part-2-control-flow/">part</a> <a href="https://mtnphil.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/decompiling-sci-part-3-instruction-consumption/">blog</a> <a href="https://mtnphil.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/decompiling-sci-part-4-final-steps/">series</a> on decompiling SCI — a masterclass in accessible technical writing. By now I've read a lot of decompiler literature and Phil's articles are still the best. If you want to decompile any kind of bytecode, start there.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					And so last year I used Phil's guide and started writing a decompiler, failed, tried again this year, and succeeded. I later learned that Phil also shelved his first attempt. I'd love to talk about how mine works, but we'll save that for another day. I owe us a full write-up about what it takes to get to one hundred percent.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Yes, that's right: <b>One Hundred Percent</b>. Brian's decompiler produced goto statements. Phil's fell back to assembly. I didn't want to do either, so mine fully decompiles every function in every Sierra script. No need to write fallback code if you never fail!

					You crave caveats. Well, there could be silent failures I don't know about. It seems like there must be some in all that text. Find 'em and I'll fix 'em. But the last bug affected only <i>one</i> function, and it was from a bug in Sierra's compiler, and that was a while ago. So&nbsp;I don't know what to think. As I mentioned, there are also a few versions I don't have. Maybe you do? It's mostly a handful of localized games. I don't expect any exciting scripts, but who knows? Help me find out!
					</p>
			
					<p>
					SCI Companion will always be the best way to view scripts, so I've packaged mine to be compatible; you just need the game. You can try compiling the scripts, but you're on your own there. It might work! Just remember that the version detection in SCI Companion is incomplete, so it can misinterpret accurate symbols like kernel functions. Maybe you'll fix it?
					</p>
			
					<p>
					I wish my work produced fixes for SCI Companion, but the projects didn't overlap. For one thing, I didn't use C++, because #selfcare. Bigger obstacle: I don't really know how the other decompiler works. Phil's articles are <i>so good</i> that I didn't need the code to design my own. The two decompilers must be pretty different though, because I came up with my algorithms by staring at a mess of graphs until blacking out. <i>(Dramatization! ...I Think!)</i>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Speaking of drama! ...There's one more thing.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/codepink.jpg" alt="sierra disk in a pink drive">
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<i>Original Sierra source code.</i> That subject has been off limits, but thanks to recent events I can relax that rule. If there's anything good about performance art, it's the unexpected. I consider this performance art, and I didn't expect to be presented with a Sierra cache on deep background. There's a good story there, but it's not mine to tell. The important thing, I told myself, is that it's found its way into enough hands that it won't get lost — and won't stay underground forever.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					On Christmas Day, Jason Scott discreetly posted the original scripts for nine Sierra games to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/sierrasourcecode">Internet Archive</a>. They're also on <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/">github</a>. I'm happy (and relieved) that we can discuss these publicly, but I have to tell you... as exciting as real source code is, annotated decompiled scripts are <i>so much more useful</i>. But you're hard to convince. So I wrote one more annotator...
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<b>My decompiled scripts include Sierra's symbols — <i>even ones not publicly available!</i></b> The annotator extracts the names of functions and variables from my cache of original scripts and matches them to decompiled scripts. Every game benefits because I also have original system scripts. Of course, if one or two games whose scripts <i>haven't</i> been posted were to have <b><i>all</i></b> of their symbols, that could raise some questions. <i>Not to worry!</i> This blog doesn't have comments.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Speaking of comments! Let's end with one of Jeff's, the gentleman who got us into this mess. I think it will resonate with every ScummVM developer, and anyone else who plays computer games as an adult by making graphs full of assembly.
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						While I did play some of the games just to see how they worked, and actually I probably played Space Quest more just because it was such a gas, but I was pretty unaware of the actual game involved. So my involvement was really at doing the tools that allowed the games to be built, and I encountered the games sort of off and on, but eh they're all just the animated things that are stories, they're not the fun part.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					</p>
			
					<p>
					<b><i>And I gave away the farm!</i></b>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					See, I've still got this writing queue of Sierra discoveries here, and while nothing has ever stopped <i>you</i> from finding them yourself... <i>it&nbsp;just got a heck of a lot easier!</i> So go ahead and scoop me. You can even do your own write-ups! In fact, I'd love to read them. All I ask is that you do a good job and don't skimp on the NewsRadio references. We'll call it outsourcing and they'll call me <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/macho-business-donkey-wrestler">genius</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-agents-self-reflect-perform-better-changing-environments">https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-agents-self-reflect-perform-better-changing-environments</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36622959">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Who </span>would you pick to win in a head-to-head competition — a state-of-the-art AI agent or a mouse? <a href="https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/people/isaac-kauvar">Isaac Kauvar</a>, a Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute <a href="https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/research/training/postdoctoral-scholar-awards">interdisciplinary postdoctoral scholar</a>, and Chris Doyle, a machine learning researcher at Stanford, decided to pit them against each other to find out. Working in the lab of <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber">Nick Haber</a>, an assistant professor in the Stanford Graduate School of Education, Kauvar and Doyle designed a simple task based on their longtime interest in a skill set that animals naturally excel at: exploring and adapting to their surroundings. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Kauvar put a mouse in a small empty box and similarly put a simulated AI agent in an empty 3D virtual arena. Then, he placed a red ball in both environments. Kauvar measured to see which would be the quicker to explore the new object.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The test showed that the mouse quickly approached the ball and repeatedly interacted with it over the next several minutes. But the AI agent didn’t seem to notice it. “That wasn’t expected,” said Kauvar. “Already, we were realizing that even with a state-of-the-art algorithm, there were gaps in performance.” </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The scholars pondered: Could they use such seemingly simple animal behaviors as inspiration to improve AI systems?&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>That question catalyzed Kauvar, Doyle, graduate student Linqi Zhou, and Haber to design a new training method called curious replay, which programs AI agents to self-reflect about the most novel and interesting things they recently encountered. Adding curious replay was all that was needed for the AI agent to approach and engage with the red ball much faster. Plus, it dramatically improved performance on a game based on Minecraft, called Crafter. The results of this project, currently published on </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15934"><span>preprint service arXiv</span></a><span>, will be presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning on July 25. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>Learning Through Curiosity</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It may seem like curiosity offers only intellectual benefits, but it’s crucial to our survival, both in avoiding dangerous situations and finding necessities like food and shelter. That red ball in the experiment could be leaking a deadly poison or covering a nourishing meal, and it would be difficult to find out which if we ignore it. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>That’s why labs like Haber’s have recently been adding a curiosity signal to drive the behavior of AI agents and, in particular, model-based deep reinforcement learning agents. This signal tells them to select the action that will lead to a more interesting outcome, like opening a door rather than disregarding it. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><span><span><span><span><span><span>Read the full study,&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15934">Curious Replay for Model-based Adaptation</a></em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>But this time, the team used curiosity for AI in a new way: to help the agent learn about its world, not just make a decision. “Instead of choosing what to do, we want to choose what to think about, more or less — what experiences from our past do we want to learn from.” said Kauvar. In other words, they wanted to encourage the AI agent to self-reflect, in a sense, about its most interesting or peculiar (and thus, curiosity-related) experiences. That way, the agent may be prompted to interact with the object in different ways to learn more, which would guide its understanding of the environment and perhaps encourage curiosity toward additional items, too.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>To accomplish self-reflection in this way, the researchers amended a common method used to train AI agents, called experience replay. Here, an agent stores memories of all its interactions and then replays some of them at random to learn from them again. It was inspired by research on sleep: Neuroscientists have found that a brain region called the hippocampus will “replay” events of the day (by reactivating certain neurons) to strengthen memories. In AI agents, experience replay has led to high performance in scenarios where the environment rarely changes and clear rewards are given for the right behaviors. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>But to be successful in a changing environment, the researchers reasoned that it would make more sense for AI agents to prioritize replaying primarily the most interesting experiences — like the appearance of a new red ball —&nbsp;rather than replaying the empty virtual room over and over. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>They named their new method curious replay and found that it worked immediately. “Now, all of a sudden, the agent interacts with the ball much more quickly,” said Kauvar. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>But they didn’t stop there. They also added curious replay to AI agents playing a game called Crafter, a standard test of creative problem solving for AI agents, </span><span>where — much like in Minecraft — agents have to figure out how to survive and adapt by learning how to </span><span>collect wood and stone, make a pickaxe, and collect iron to make additional tools</span><span>.</span><span> The curious replay method boosted the current state-of-the-art score from around 14 up to 19 (humans typically score around 50) — with “just this one change,” said Kauvar. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>A Curious Future</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The success of the curious replay method in both simple and complex tasks suggests that it will be important for a vast array of AI research moving forward. </span><span><span>“</span></span><span><span>The overall aim of this work — to make agents that can leverage prior experience and adapt well by efficiently exploring new or changing environments — will lead to much more adaptive, flexible technologies, from household robotics to personalized learning tools,” said Haber. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Kauvar, whose </span></span><a href="https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/research/funded-research/dissecting-curious-exploration-self-supervised-machine-learning"><span>postdoctoral work</span></a><span><span> is jointly mentored by Haber and neuroscientist Karl Deisseroth, the D.H Chen Professor in the departments of Bioengineering and Psychiatry, is excited to continue the theme of taking inspiration from animal behavior to improve AI systems — he plans to continue testing mice and AI agents on more complicated tasks to compare their behavior and abilities. “Lots of people give lip service to saying that they're inspired by animals, but here we are building a direct bridge — not a vague bridge. We are trying to do the exact same [tasks],” he said. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Kauvar hopes that work like this will help “close the loop” between AI research and neuroscience and benefit our understanding of animal behavior and the underlying neural processes, too. “You can imagine that this whole approach might yield hypotheses and new experiments that would never have been thought of before,” he said.</span></span></span></span></p>

        <section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In 2023, the way to use AES is AES-GCM. Anything else is very unlikely to make sense. We might not like that, we might wish OCB hadn’t been patented, but with hardware support in most processors these days GCM is both faster than the alternatives, ubiquitous, and just tolerable to implement.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t want to use AES-GCM, I want to use XAES-256-GCM/11, which has a number of nice properties and only the annoying defect of not existing.</p>
<p>The problem with AES-GCM is that its nonce is a little too small to comfortably select at random. At 96 bit, the probability of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack?ref=words.filippo.io">birthday bound</a> collision becomes uncomfortable (2<sup>-32</sup>) after a few billion messages (2<sup>32</sup>), and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/475?ref=words.filippo.io">the consequences of a collision are catastrophic</a>.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Some applications know they will never encrypt that many messages under a single key, but those numbers are a little too low and the consequences too dire to make that assumption at the API level, so we’re forced to delegate nonce management to the user.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>ChaCha20Poly1305 has the same issue, which is why the <em>extended-nonce</em> construction XChaCha20Poly1305 exists. It resolves the issue by taking a 192-bit nonce<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, and “hashing” it along with the key into a fresh key.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> The key is 256 bits, so there is no need to ever worry about collisions there. (More on that later.) You should <em>always</em> use the X variant unless the nonce is fully implicit, like when it’s always zero (like in age), a record counter (like in TLS), or a chunk number (like in STREAM). You can also make nice APIs for the X variant that generate the nonce at random from the system CSPRNG (and we are thinking about how to best do that in the Go standard library).</p>
<p>XChaCha20Poly1305 uses ChaCha20 itself to do the hashing to avoid introducing a new primitive, but this would work just as well using SHA-256 or HKDF to derive a regular key and nonce for ChaCha20Poly1305 from a key and a larger nonce. This means you could do the same for AES-GCM, and some schemes do in fact do just that. Regrettably, we don’t have a name for it, so you can’t just say to people “you should <em>always</em> use the X variant” or make a nice interoperable API for it.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s the X in my <s>pony</s> XAES-256-GCM/11.</p>
<p>I don’t care if it uses HKDF, or SHA-256, or the AES function<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>: I want a well-defined scheme that takes a key and 192 bits of nonce and hashes them into a derived key and 96 bits of nonce for use with AES-GCM.</p>
<p>Even with AES-128, the combined 224 bits of space for key and nonce are juuuust enough not to worry about collisions in the derived values. Still, this hints to the second part of the <s>pony</s> problem with AES-GCM: while <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/post-quantum-age/#128-bits-are-enough">actually enough for post-quantum cryptography</a>, 128-bit keys are still too tight for <em>multi-user security</em>. If for example an application encrypts 2<sup>48</sup> messages under different 128-bit keys, and all messages start with the same few bytes, an attacker can build a lookup table, try and lookup the ciphertext of 2<sup>64</sup> keys, and <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=log2%281+-+%281+-+2%5E48+%2F+2%5E128%29+%5E+%282%5E64%29%29&amp;ref=words.filippo.io">have a 2<sup>-16</sup> chance</a> to decrypt one message. Not good.</p>
<p>Multi-user attacks can be mitigated by many things—they require fixed nonces and partially known plaintext—but the only way to avoid that complexity escaping the AEAD abstraction and leaking into the rest of the protocol is to use 256-bit keys. For AES-GCM, that means using AES-256. Too bad that AES-256 is slower than AES-128, not because of its bigger key size, but because it was specified with more rounds, presumably under the assumption that users of bigger keys would also want more security margin against cryptanalysis. AES is an iterated cipher, where four core operations are performed multiple times in sequence: AES-128 performs them ten times, while AES-256 performs them fourteen times. AES-256 doesn’t <em>have to be</em> slower than AES-128, it was just defined to be slower. That’s regrettable, because it applies an artificial performance tax on the use of longer keys, which are desirable for reasons that have nothing to do with the risk of AES cryptanalysis.</p>
<p>Picking the “right” number of rounds is hard, and it’s kind of an open secret in the community that there is no rigorous and scientific way to do it. “<em><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1492?ref=words.filippo.io">Too much crypto</a></em>” by Aumasson is all about this, and suggests eleven rounds for AES-256. I started this aiming for ten, which would have been exactly as fast as AES-128, but AES-256 does need more margin than AES-128 in some rare cases for <em>reasons</em><sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> and I guess it’d be silly to introduce a different abstraction-leaking edge case while trying to remove two, so AES-256/11 it is.</p>
<p>Summing up, I would like to provide to my users the extended-nonce 256-bit reduced-rounds XAES-256-GCM/11 (or XAES-256/11-GCM?) AEAD. It has infinitely randomizable nonces, a comfortable margin of multi-user security, and nearly the same performance as AES-128-GCM. It would also be a true drop-in replacement for XChaCha20Poly1305. Only issue is that it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>(I guess it would also not be FIPS 140 compliant. We could make a FIPS version that’s slower but equivalent by using HKDF to derive the key, and the full-rounds AES-256.)</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2023-07-06</strong>: Soatok has <a href="https://soatok.blog/2022/12/21/extending-the-aes-gcm-nonce-without-nightmare-fuel/?ref=words.filippo.io">previously suggested an extended-nonce AES-GCM construction</a>. His AES-XGCM uses CBC-MAC for key derivation, which might be a good pick as both primitive-parsimonious and potentially FIPS 140 compliant. @NohatCoder@mastodon.gamedev.place on Mastodon suggests that since we're KDF'ing, we might as well generate all the subkeys directly, solving the AES-256-specific issues that require the extra rounds (see <sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6:1">[6:1]</a></sup>). I'm a bit wary to diverge too much from the well-established primitives, since at that point might as well use something novel (such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-aegis-aead/?ref=words.filippo.io">AEGIS</a>, like Soatok says). The point here is that I'd like a thin construction that's easy to get confidence for if you already trust AES-GCM.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>You’ll sometimes hear that any single-key AES mode can only produce 2<sup>48</sup> blocks before the advantage of a distinguishing attacker gets uncomfortable. That would seem contradictory with a limit of 2<sup>32</sup> messages for AES-GCM, since each message can be up to 2<sup>32</sup> blocks. The thing is that the only thing that an attacker can do by observing more than 2<sup>48</sup> blocks is confirm that they’re looking at AES rather than at complete randomness. A completely random stream would be expected to show some output block collisions after that many blocks, while AES, being an invertible permutation applied on a counter and unique nonce, will never repeat. The <em>lack</em> of collisions is the distinguisher. NIST doesn’t care, and neither do I. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Technically, GCM accepts longer nonces. However, nonces longer than 96 bits are hashed into a starting 128-bit counter value, leaving no dedicated counter space. (96-bit nonces are instead concatenated with a 32-bit counter.) The birthday bound of 128 bits is better, allowing us to encrypt in theory 2<sup>48</sup> messages (the approximate formula is 2<sup>(N-32)/2</sup>), but that’s only if every message was precisely one block long. If messages are longer, there’s a risk the counter will overlap across messages, which is not as catastrophic and easy to detect as nonce reuse, but leads to loss of confidentiality. In general, it’s very inconvenient for bounds to depend on the message size, because that’s yet another assessment we have to delegate to the application. AES-GCM-SIV has the same issue: it has better bounds for shorter messages, but worse for messages longer than 8 GiB, and the answer to “how many messages can I encrypt” is a double entry table instead of a number. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Technically, 128 bits of nonce are hashed with 256 bits of key into 256 bits of key, and 64 bits of nonce are used as nonce, which leaves 32 bits of nonce space that can be reassigned to counter, if you need to encrypt more than 256 GB. In practice, <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/+/refs/tags/v0.10.0:chacha20poly1305/xchacha20poly1305.go;l=46-53;drc=c084706c2272f3d44b722e988e70d4a58e60e7f4?ref=words.filippo.io">we don’t support that</a>. What counts as key, nonce, and counter in ChaCha20 is really just arbitrary: 384 bits of variable state are mixed with 128 bits of constants for each block, and you need to make sure you never reuse the same state. The original ChaCha20 had 64 bits of nonce and 64 bits of counter, the IETF moved 32 bits from nonce to counter, making random nonces juuust tempting but not quite safe. Anyway. <a href="#fnref3">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn4"><p>In a sense XChaCha20Poly1305 is a SIV construction in the same way AES-GCM-SIV is: they both compute a synthetic (key, nonce) rather than a synthetic nonce alone. 🤔 However, the message is not one of the inputs in the XChaCha20Poly1305 derivation, so it’s not misuse resistant. There are some interesting parallels here with <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/avoid-the-randomness-from-the-sky/">signature nonce generation</a>, where the best design turns out to be hashing message <em>and</em> randomness into it. <a href="#fnref4">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Although if we’re doing this, we might as well do it cleanly and use AES like XChaCha20Poly1305 or GHASH like AES-GCM-SIV. <a href="#fnref5">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn6"><p>Interestingly enough, AES-256 turned out to actually have a legitimate (if maybe unexpected) need for more rounds, because the 256-bit key schedule (the way the key is expanded into subkeys for the various rounds) is simpler and more vulnerable to related-key attacks. In 2009/2010 we got some impractical related-key attacks against AES-256/14, and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/374?ref=words.filippo.io">some “practical” related-key attacks against AES-256/9</a>. The paper does a good job of explaining the background in the first few sections. The related-key attack setting is very contrived: an attacker can recover a key K if it’s able to get an encryption oracle for a K <em>and</em> for K⊕C. There is apparently one protocol that somehow managed that, but these days I’d hope all keys are the output of a CSPRNG or a KDF, not some haphazard XOR operation. (There was also an attack against AES-256/11 which required even more implausible relations between the keys.) I also suspect that the key derivation step of the extended-nonce construction we discussed above would rule out these related-key attacks. Anyway. <a href="#fnref6">↩︎</a> <a href="#fnref6:1">↩︎</a></p>

                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: Hello, I'm Eric Meyer, and I'm a developer advocate at Igalia. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: I am Brian Kardell, and I am, also. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: And today, we have a special guest, Andreas Kling, who is the lead on a brand new browser. So, Andreas, hi. Thanks for being here. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Hi. Yeah, happy to be here. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: So, you're working on a browser called Ladybird. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Uh-huh. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: We want to talk about all of that, but what's the background of where did Ladybird come from to start with? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Right, so it all started in 2018 when I went to a drug rehab program, because I've been struggling with substance abuse for a very long time. And when I came out of that rehab program, I found myself with just so much free time and I had no idea what to do with all of it. And I started programming because that's something I knew how to do lots of, and that's how I ended up working on random things that I'd always wanted to do, but never felt I had the time for. And the big project I started was an operating system, because I always thought that seemed cool, but never really sunk my teeth into it properly, or never really gave it a fair shake. And I had a lot of fun with that, and it just grew and grew and grew. And I put it online and other people found it, and a little community formed around it. And that community just grew and grew and so did the operating system and the scope of it. And at some point, we had built a GUI and we had all the widgets, buttons, check boxes, all that stuff. And I thought, 'Hey, wouldn't it be nice if we could display rich text, and wouldn't it be sweet if we could use HTML as the internal representation of a rich text widget?' And I started just putting together a simple HTML widget that you could view, simple text that had bold, italic, stuff like that. That was what I was trying to achieve. And it just escalated from there because it was really fun to hack on and just add more tags, start to add CSS and so on. And it just incrementally grew to the point where I had to admit that, I guess, this is a browser, not just a rich text widget anymore. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: Okay. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: And, yeah. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: You had a background in browsers, right? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Right, right. Yeah, so it wasn't entirely by accident. I did work on browsers for a long time. This was just how Ladybird started. But yeah, I had a career in browsers for a long time, starting all the way back in 2006, when I first worked on KHTML, in KDE.</blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: Yeah. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: And then I got a job at Nokia a couple years down the line, working on Qt, Qt WebKit, moved to Apple from there. Spent six and a half years I think at Apple, working at Safari. And then I left, got into some troubles, and ended up in the aforementioned rehab clinic. And then, now I'm doing Ladybird, which was just supposed to be an HTML widget, I guess, is the essence of the story. But Ladybird today has come quite far from that original humble beginnings, of course. We've managed to build a fairly capable engine, and it's all from scratch, just like everything else on SerenityOS, we pride ourselves on stubbornly just doing everything from scratch, even though it would be much more convenient not to. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: So, one thing that, it keeps jumping out at me is you have Serenity as the OS. I have some questions about that because I think that's really interesting. But to stay on topic, Ladybird is the name of the browser, but you're inventing... The exciting thing isn't the browser, it's the engine, right? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Sure. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: And you're building a new engine. A whole new, that's a whole new web engine. It's a whole new rendering engine, whole new JavaScript engine, everything all the way down. Does the web engine have a name or is it just LibWeb, or something? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: It is literally LibWeb, yeah. All the libraries in Serenity are just called the obvious name. So, we got LibJS for JavaScript, LibWeb for web engine, and various other lib this and that. So, I gave it the name Ladybird so that we would have some public facing name that people could refer to, because when you're in SerenityOS, it's easy to talk about lib this and that, but LibWeb didn't feel like a PR friendly name, I guess. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Right, right. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: So yeah, I just talk about Ladybird as the whole project, basically. But it is also the name of the UI program that is the shell for the browser engine. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: Where did the name Ladybird come from? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: So the SerenityOS project has been using ladybugs as mascots forever, since the early days. It was just our first icon that we had for the system was a little ladybug, and then we gained various ladybug themed emojis and things like that. But I didn't want to call it Ladybug because then it sounds like it would be buggy. And I thought, 'Remember when Firefox was called Firebird? That was a pretty cool name. What if we call it Ladybird?' Because I hear that in the UK that means ladybug anyway, so yeah. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Yeah, that's actually... People who study insects and stuff don't like ladybug because I guess they're not true bugs. So, the Ladybird is actually the preferred. Yeah, I like it. I like the Ladybird name. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: Yeah. And I'm curious, you mentioned that the Serenity project, in general, stubbornly tries to do everything from first principles, even though that's much harder. Is there... What is the driving foundational principle there? Why did you pick that as a foundational principle? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: So there are many things that factor into it, but the two main ones are, I used to work at Apple for a long time, and I got so used to this culture that they have there of all the experts on the whole system are all in the same building or in the adjacent building, and you can just go talk to them. And I always thought that is so sweet because you have some super gnarly esoteric problem in some system library, and the guy who wrote it is just next door. And I always felt like in the open source world, they don't have that. And I wanted to, after I left Apple, I still craved that kind of environment. So I thought, 'If it doesn't exist, what if I try to create it?' So I wanted to just build a system where we can cultivate all the expertise in one place and we can be super accountable, so that whatever the problem is, you can never blame anybody outside the project. Blame always stays within the repository. And I think it's, as you say, it is very difficult to work that way, but it has also created a very strong community because people enjoy working in that kind of space where they get to become experts and they get to take extreme ownership of system components in a way that I think is much, much harder in the Linux wider open source ecosystem. And the other aspect of why we do this is because it's fun. It's fun to build things from scratch. Everybody knows that. And it was supposed to be a hobby project that I was just doing to fill up my time. So it is rooted in just fun time spending programming activity, and I hope it never shakes that origin. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: I listened to another podcast that you're on, and I think we won't get as much into some of the details of the history and the whys and everything, but you went into a lot of that, and I'm sure people could find it. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Maybe it was CoRecursive, probably. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: It was CoRecursive, right. Yeah, that was it. But it was a good podcast and I really can relate in a way to the time that suddenly is free. I've had other moments in my life that were not specifically that, but where you have some really major life change and the minutes just go forever, and finding yourself a thing that you can throw yourself into is really helpful. For me, it was usually art, painting. But, so we have a series on here called Web Ecosystem Health, when engine disappears, that's the whole story. There's so many pieces that go into is this a healthy ecosystem or not, that maybe focusing on the exact number isn't the important part. What is the ideal number? Is it 3, 5, 7? We don't know. I think Jeremy Keith said, 'It's like political parties. One is definitely too few, and a hundred is probably too many, and somewhere in between there is a series of debatably good numbers.' But in that podcast, we have said a bunch of times that you're more likely to lose engines than to gain them unless it's by evolution, like KHTML becomes WebKit becomes Chromium. And recently, at the Web Engine HackFest, we had two presentations of novel browser engines. It seems to really fly in the face of what I've argued, but I don't think that it does. And I want to ask what you think, Andreas. So you know, you've said on your podcast, 'People say you can't build a browser engine from scratch,' and you say, 'Sure you can.' I don't say that you can't, I just say that it's really, really hard to create a fully featured and competitive mainstream competitor to WebKit and Gecko and Chrome. I would think that for both these engines, that's a ways off, right? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Sure, yeah, it is. It's a very big task. It's a lot of work. It's going to take a long time. But I think at the same time, there's never been a better time in history to build a new browser engine. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: Why is that? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: If you look at the quality of specifications today compared to 10 years ago, for example, the specifications are vastly better today. The effort that the CSS working group, for example, has put into just clarifying so many things makes it actually possible for someone like me who never worked on CSS's layout to go and write a layout engine without a team of experts around me or even having to ask for help much. And I think that's fantastic. And I was pleasantly surprised because I was going into this assuming that it was like the olden days still, that you would end up sitting with CSS 2.1 and trying to guess your way through the various descriptions of blocking and line layout, because that's what I had seen my coworkers do at Apple, just struggling with the old CSS world. But nowadays, the specs have gotten so good, and it's not that they're perfect, but that they're really a lot better than they've ever been. So I think just from that alone, it is a lot easier today than people might think. And I think what you describe, it's absolutely true that it's a ton of work. It's absolutely true that it's hard to build something that will be mainstream competitive, of course. Google throws hundreds of engineers at this and they have full-time people working on it around the clock. It would be silly to say that we're going to out-compete them at their own game, but I think it's still possible to build a browser that can render a significant majority of the web at a satisfying fidelity, let's say. And I also like to think that if you can gain enough momentum that you get to the point where you have a decent rendering of most websites that people care about, you can then gain an enough momentum that you attract people to go and fill in the niche gaps that they might care about, and you might attract funding and so on. So that part is up in the air, but I think if we can go hard and fast enough that we end up there, who knows what can happen. So I'm just very optimistic, I guess. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: I think it's astounding what you all have accomplished so far. Not just a browser that you can view many websites on, but also the operating system that it's built on. It's incredible for this very short amount of time and small number of people, comparatively. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: To be honest, the operating system was the easy part. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: So the operating system was easy, but browsers are hard? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Harder. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: Wow. Talk about that a little. How so? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Because operating systems are fairly simple when you boil it down to what you really want to do. Kernel is a well understood, well-defined problem, and in our case, we're just working on the POS-x specifications. We're building a Unix compatible operating system, and that means we have a set of APIs that we need to support, and that work is really straightforward. And then, we have a UI paradigm that we borrow from late 90s Windows, Microsoft Office, that kind of stuff. So we already know what we need to do there, too. We need to build this UI and these interactions, and so on. And I don't know, I just found that work really straightforward, whereas with the web stuff, I know I was just saying that the specs are better than ever, but it is still hard to get all the specs gluing together, I think. And really when it comes to CSS, I would say CSS is so much harder than any of the other parts of the web platform because it's hard to work on any CSS module in isolation. It really requires the person working on CSS stuff to understand multiple specs at the same time, and then keep them in their head and implement multiple things at the same time, if that makes sense. It is so much easier to work on JavaScript or HTML or Fetch or any of those specs, because they are more self-contained. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: To the point of what you were saying about specs have gotten so much better, one of the things that definitely started those riggers was when Hixie sat down and specified the actual HTML parser, which never had really been written down the way that it needed to work. So, there was a way that it needed to work. There was an interoperable subset, and that was never written down, and there were some rough edges that you couldn't get people to agree on until you had something written down. So, I know that that has been cited as a great accomplishment, and other people have said that they've used that to build a parser. We just did a podcast with Martin Robinson on Servo, and in that, we had this observation, this thought that every browser that comes along fresh and implements something ends up making the specs a little better for the next ones to do it. I noticed that you had several issues open in HTML parser, and I think it's probably because you're the last one to look at it with really fresh eyes, right? </blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Sure, yeah, that's absolutely a thing. And it's also one of the big things that I hope that we can do for the community of web engines is to just give our input as a recent implementer. And we haven't been super great about it yet. Yeah, you can find some bugs that we filed, but for the most part, until recently, whenever we had a problem, it was pretty safe to assume it was because of something we had done wrong. And it's only in the recent couple of months that we've matured to the point where now we start to find spec bugs more often and spec issues. And that has been a really exciting transition, actually, and we're just looking forward to helping out more in that area, at least with regards to HTML and CSS. In JavaScript, we were a bit ahead of that curve, because our engine has been implementing some proposals pretty early. So we implemented the temporal proposal when it was still quite new. And we were able to give a lot of feedback on that, which then helped evolve the spec. Now we're a little bit behind because I think people got a bit burned out on updating it whenever the spec changed. But yeah, that's absolutely something that I agree with Martin on that, that every new engine will make the specs better, and next year and the year after that, you'll be able to say that there has never been a better time to build a new browser engine, I hope. </blockquote></li>

And then that is true for many CSS properties and I expect that to have fallout in a lot of tests, because we might be able to pass the test if we were just doing some random CSS thing more correctly. And we've taken a very vertical slice approach to adding functionality to the browser. And by that, I mean we don't tend to implement a whole spec and then move on to the next spec. What we tend to do is we tend to find a webpage that we want to improve for whatever reason. Maybe it's cool to get the New York Times to render, and then we just spend a bunch of time fixing as many issues as we can for that site and then move on to a new page or some new thing that we want to be able to do. And that might not be the most structured approach to it, but it has been very, very good at keeping people motivated and excited and engaged in the work, which from my perspective is almost more important than having an optimal structure to the work, because it's mostly volunteers working on it. I'm the only person who is full-time employed to do this, so I need to keep it fun for people to work on. </blockquote></li>

When I was a kid, it was, 'This site works best in this or that browser. You need NN4 to browse here, or you got to get IE5,' and these days you've got to use a Chromium based browser. And I think they're just different sides of the same coin. There's always going to be somebody who's pushing for new APIs and new 'standards' to become part of the platform. And I think it's perfectly fine to lag behind on stuff like that. With Ladybird, I'm primarily interested in implementing stuff that is used by the overwhelming majority of the web and make the engine hackable enough and plugable enough that in the future, if there is a demand for more niche features, then it will be reasonably easy to add them to the engine. But it seems at the moment, if I have to choose where to spend my time, I would rather implement more core CSS, JavaScript functionality than any of these new, fancy things that are only used by a fraction of a percent of websites. That's not to say that they're bad ideas, it's just that they're just trying to go where the big ball is instead of chasing the small ball. </blockquote></li>

They also frequently lack many of these. They're not, I don't know, like Tim would say, 'The waft and weft of the web,' that that's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One of the things that struck me, I guess the thing that's most surprising to me, is if you go to Google or Apple or Firefox, the people who work on the JavaScript engine, they're not generally the people who work on layout. And even within layout, you have people who specialize in internationalization, or there's lots of specialization, but you have to solve everything. And that is really interesting to me. Is that intimidating to you at all, or are you just built differently? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: It was intimidating. When I started building the operating system, I was intimidated, and I just kept pushing through that for so long that I forgot. I woke up one day and I forgot to be intimidated, I think, and it just stayed off since then. So I stopped caring. And I think, I also have my YouTube channel where I broadcast myself programming, and that has been very helpful in just taking down my ego, because whenever I make a mistake, I hear about it from people making fun of me. And at first, that was really hard because I wasn't used to that harsh feedback and people making silly jokes about stupid things that I would do. But over time, that accumulated into this hardening of my soul, I guess, where I just became able to push through that intimidation stuff. And it was a lot of work, but I'm happy that I went through that process because now I'm happy to take on anything and suck at it for a while, and do it anyway until I get somewhat better. And then by the time I get somewhat better at something, hopefully I've managed to put something together that other people can help me improve. And that's how most of SerenityOS, most of Ladybird started, was just me pushing through, sucking at something I didn't know how to do, and figuring some of it out, and then other people coming in and helping. And I still do a lot of that, but nowadays, I have gotten a bit more specialized recently because there's just so much specialized work to do on a browser, like you mentioned Grid and Flexbox, for example. I've spent weeks working on our Flexbox implementation, just getting various details right, and it requires some amount of specialization. But I think in a project like ours, we can't afford to all be specialists. It's okay to specialize for short periods, but at the core, if we want to make progress with such a small team and such a shoestring budget, we have to be willing to be generalists. </blockquote></li>

There is not just the specs that have improved so much over the years, but there's countless discussions on what Ouija, GitHub, for example, you can go and read discussions on spec bugs where people explain and argue in depth about, 'Oh, why should it be this way? Why should it be that way?' So there's a tremendous amount of information you can absorb if you know where to look. And as we talked about, I also have a background in browsers, so I do know how to go and find information because it was my job for many years, as well. So I know where the information is. I have friends who work on other browsers still. So, I think, me personally, I benefit so much from having done it for a long time, just like anybody with experience doing something is going to be drawing on that experience, of course. But as a project, we also benefit from other engines having pushed the standards forward, having improved the platform. And also just from the web being an open platform that's developed in the open.

So, which would you prefer the same browser to present the same controls in every operating system? If you open Chrome, it always looks like Chrome. If you look at Safari, well, it is only available in one place, so that's not much. But Firefox, for example, you open it anywhere, they all look the same, or do we match the operating system. And I thought, I was convinced in my head, this is the most ridiculous question. This is going to be such a one-sided, there's clearly one answer to this. And no, it was literally 50/50.

                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: It's something that early on, for example, when I was just working on this by myself, I used a handful of C library routines from OpenBSD, I think, and then I went and replaced them down the line as the project matured, and I just wanted to get rid of all the borrowed code. And I'm sure that there are still some little things here and there with an OpenBSD origin that we need to replace. It just needs to be tracked down. So, I think, for me, the important thing nowadays is that we definitely don't want anybody bringing any proprietary IP into the project, and we don't want people to take something that's GPL because we are a BSD license project, so that wouldn't be entirely cool. And of course, the spirit of the project is that we're supposed to make things ourselves even though it's hard. So even if you could legally take something, we ask people that they don't, that they go through the suffering of doing it themselves, just so that we get the kind of system that is built that way.</blockquote></li>

Well, I think we have over 900 total, but active core contributors on a monthly basis tends to swing up to around 50 maybe, recently. But it goes up and down depending on what people are doing. And there are bursts where people get excited about something, and then a bunch of people join in and they work on that for a while, and then interest fades and some new thing attracts everybody. Ebbs and flows. But one of the unique things about our project is that it's such a huge ecosystem, that even if you come in because you're excited about one thing, it's really easy to stick around and get distracted by a million other things. Maybe you come in because you want to work on a file management thing, and then you end up implementing WebP or something instead, which we recently got, by the way.</blockquote></li>

People still float between these organizations. And if you look at Google today, there's a bunch of Mozilla people, and people have just been moving around that. There are only so many people in the world who want to be browser developers, or at least so I thought until I started doing it on YouTube and broadcasting what it's like to an audience of random onlookers, and it turned out that it could be made interesting to more people by letting them in on this angle of it. And I'm really, really happy to have been able to introduce so many people to it, and gotten hundreds of newcomers just to do a patch or two for a browser engine. Even if most people end up not loving it enough to stick around, we still have a bunch of people who have stuck around and worked on it, and that to me is a really wholesome aspect of what I get to call my job. So I'm happy about that.</blockquote></li>

If I compare my numbers, my audience numbers on every platform that I use to attract people to what we're doing, YouTube is by far doing the best. And the format is surprisingly interesting to people. Just, 'Here's a browser. Here is the website that doesn't look right. I'm going to make it look right. Stick with me for an hour and we'll figure it out.'</blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: I have to say I didn't watch any of the ones where you worked on browser features, but I did watch the one where you worked on doing the Qt browser for Linux. And so, just for background, I did some computer science in college and I had to learn C back then, but professionally, I only did C maybe once or twice. So the C world is intimidating to me, but I can open WebKit source code and find things, and if I read slowly, I can figure it out. So it's intimidating to me, and every once in a while I get WebKit and get it built and then just lose steam. It's so much yak shaving to get it built in the first place that I lose the steam to do it. But the reason I mentioned that is because I turned it on and immediately you were going pretty fast and I was like, 'Oh man, this is really intimidating. Look how much this guy just really knows what he's doing. I am not sure I'm going to be able to follow this at all.' But it didn't take long before you rammed your face into the door a few times with the same kind of stuff that trips me up. And somehow that just made it very engaging and more plausible, somehow, that I could do it. Do you know what I mean? I don't know if that makes sense. So I think that's motivating. You struggled a lot in that, right? I watched it. I don't know if that's common, but there were things that you knew that you didn't have to look up. You were doing it like riding a bike. You were so fluent in it. That stuff was cool, but honestly, the parts where you struggled were just so relatable and watching you work through them, I was like, 'Yeah, that's exactly what I would've done, too.' And one by one, you just have to step through the things. </blockquote></li>

And I think that's one thing that many people who make programming content, video content in particular, they make the wrong choice by editing out mistakes and trying to look perfect and fast and right all the time. Because as you say, then it just ends up looking intimidating or too polished, and you don't get that human side of it. You've got to show the frustration and the stupid mistakes. At least, I really feel like that's how I've been able to build an audience is by just showing the whole thing, with warts and all. And yes, that is representative by the way.

                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: And I think a lot of great things have come out of that. And I hope that they carry that forward and continue to be experimental, or experiment friendly at least, because there's so many things that you could do in a browser engine that is very inconvenient to do in the big engines because there's so much code you would have to rewrite just to try out new architectures and new ways of doing things. One thing that I thought of in this area is that one of the things that we try to do with our browser and with our engine is that we try to write it as close to the spec as possible. This is a bit different from the way other browsers are made, at least the ones I've been familiar with, like WebKit, Chromium, and Gecko, where they are happy to invent their own abstractions and solve things in their own ways. We are very, very hardcore about sticking to spec architecture and spec language and using the spec names for everything wherever we can, in part because it makes it just easier to implement the spec, if you write it exactly as the spec says to the fullest extent possible. But also for maintainability, because we have to recognize that the platform is alive and it keeps changing and keeps mutating. And if we want to have a chance to react and adapt to future changes, I really believe that we'll be in the best position to do that if we keep ourselves as close to the current spec as possible. So, we are... In HTML. For example, we have our class names in C++ are just the same exact words that they use for the same concepts in the HML spec. Our CSS layout engine is organized around formatting contexts, unlike the way it works in the other engines where they invent their own ways to do layout. And it's just a theme throughout. And we also take it a step even further by copying spec text word for word and just copy pasting it as comment into our code, so that you can always cross reference the spec with the code because we have the spec right there. So it's interleaved. So you would have a spec comment that says like, 'Step three, do X, Y, Z.' And then the code, X, Y, Z. 'Step four,' and so on. And it took a while to convince ourselves that this was a good way to work, because it makes the code a lot bigger and it can look bloated. But after we got used to it, I don't think we would ever go back, because it's such a much easier way to stay on top of the spec and what the spec intends, and to be able to react to changes. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Martin made a similar comment actually, because I guess this is a thing in Rust... I'm sorry, in Servo, at least in the newer. So, Servo has two layout engines, and I guess this is something that it seems all of the engines have learned and started changing to do that. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Yeah. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Martin, he seemed to suggest that this is basically a lesson that all of the browser engines have learned. And it's hard to... We can't just rewrite them, but we can migrate them in that direction. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Right, and for us, it's a lot easier to do this because we are in a green field environment. We don't have a huge stack of code that needs to be rewritten. So we've been able to make really good and fast progress towards this, and that's really nice. But of course, the others will catch up, and I think it would be great if more engines look more like the spec because it will be easier to cross reference and catch bugs and so on. And it'll also be easier for people to move between different engines, and people with special interests who want to implement a feature in all engines, the more the code looks like the spec everywhere, the easier it'll be for them, as well. </blockquote></li>

We want to do it because we believe we can do it, and we want the outcome. This thing where it's not disconnected libraries, but do you see that there are potentials for it to be something more than that? Can you imagine use cases for Serenity that it could be a practical choice, or Ladybird, where people could use it for no other purposes? WebKit is used for lots more than Safari. </blockquote></li>

And I'm happy to welcome other people into the project with their own goals, who want to adapt it to something they want to do. But for me personally, I just want to make something that I can use as my daily driver. And I have pretty simple needs. I just need a terminal and a browser and an IDE. So, they're reasonably easy to satisfy. </blockquote></li>

                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Right. I do not, because it is not practical. We don't have the ability to record video and we don't have USB webcam support. And also compile performance is not as good on Serenity as it is on Linux. So I just record on Linux because it's more practical. I tend to be a very pragmatic person in all these things. Honestly, recently I'm focusing way more on just building the browser in a cross-platform environment. And it's still... Everything I work on is still part of the operating system. I've just been swept away with the fun of building a browser that might potentially be useful to more people than just myself. </blockquote></li>

And I think it's important to be realistic, and realistically, SerenityOS will never be something that's used by millions of people, at least not with the goals that we currently have for it. And with Ladybird, that's much more of an open question, I think, because it's much harder to tell the future. We have great momentum. We're making great progress, and who knows how long we can keep that rate of progress. What will be the first major roadblock? What kind of problems will we face? Who knows? But it's exciting to run towards it so we can see what's there. </blockquote></li>

In 2023, now-Sacramento County Sheriff Cooper appears to be doing just that.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) a digital rights group, has sent Cooper a letter requesting that the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office cease sharing ALPR data with out-of-state agencies that could use it to prosecute someone for seeking an abortion. </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p><a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/sacramento-county-397/automated-license-plate-readers-sacramento-county-sheriff-136345/#file-1094668" target="_blank" rel="Follow">According to documents</a> that the Sheriff’s Office provided EFF through a public records request, it has shared license plate reader data with law enforcement agencies in states that have passed laws banning abortion, including Alabama, Oklahoma and Texas.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>Adam Schwartz, EFF senior staff attorney, called automated license plate readers “a growing threat to everyone’s privacy ... that are out there by the thousands in California.” </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>Automated license plate readers are often fixed to stationary locations, or police vehicles, and can collect thousands of license plate images that then are stored in a digital cloud. Once in the cloud, it can easily be shared with out-of-state agencies that use the same software. </p><!--]--><!--[--><p>Schwartz said that a sheriff in Texas, Idaho or any other state with an abortion ban on the books could use that data to track people’s movements around California, knowing where they live, where they work and where they seek reproductive medical care, including abortions. </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office isn’t the only one sharing that data; in May, EFF <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article275795726.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">released a report</a> showing that 71 law enforcement agencies in 22 California counties — including Sacramento County — were sharing such data. The practice is in violation of a 2015 law <a href="https://california.public.law/codes/ca_civ_code_section_1798.90.55#:~:text=(b),as%20otherwise%20permitted%20by%20law." target="_blank" rel="Follow">that states</a> “a (California law enforcement) agency shall not sell, share, or transfer ALPR information, except to another (California law enforcement) agency, and only as otherwise permitted by law.”</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>When The Bee wrote in May about the initial EFF report, the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/sacsheriff/status/1662156652173471746" target="_blank" rel="Follow">responded</a>, even though it was not initially on the list of agencies sharing data. </p><!--]--><!--[--><p>“Law enforcement agencies commonly use information from License Plate Readers (LPRs) to investigate serious crimes, such as homicide, child kidnappings, human trafficking, and drug trafficking across state borders,” the twitter account said. </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>It is unclear who sent the tweets from the official account. </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>It went on to say that organizations like EFF “have lied that law enforcement sharing this information is an attempt to violate people’s legal rights. These false claims are intentional and part of a broader agenda to promote lawlessness and prevent criminals from being held accountable.”</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to The Bee’s request for comment by deadline. On Wednesday, after this story published, Cooper <a href="https://twitter.com/SheriffJCooper/status/1676692758810210304" target="_blank" rel="Follow">took to Twitter</a> to accuse the EFF of “protecting child molesters, fentanyl traffickers, rapists and murderers.”</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>In the tweet, Cooper said that the law allows his office to share license plate data with other law enforcement agencies and that “criminals are not aware of jurisdictional boundaries, much less state lines.” </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>“The bill and this law has absolutely nothing to do with reproductive rights. My record on women’s and reproductive rights has been strong throughout my time in the State Assembly, and nothing has changed since becoming Sheriff,” Cooper wrote. </p><!--]--><!--[--><p>Schwartz said that the May tweets “surprised us, because we had not sent a demand letter to them.” </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>He said that he was not aware of any cases where ALPR data was used to prosecute someone for getting an abortion, but added, “We think we shouldn’t have to wait until the inevitable happens.” </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>The EFF attorney said that this is a “Tale of Two Cities, best of times and worst of times” situation. While the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office appears to be defying the law, another nearby law enforcement agency that was named in the initial report announced that it is no longer doing so. </p><!--]--><!--[--><p>In a letter to the EFF that was shared with The Bee, Woodland Police Chief Derrek Kaff wrote, “We have implemented a revised protocol that does not allow the sharing of ALPR data with any out-of-state agencies. As a department we are committed to upholding the privacy rights of individuals and reinforces our dedication to adhering to the principles of the Fourth Amendment.” </p><!----><!--]--><!--]--><!----><p>This story was originally published <span>July 5, 2023, 6:30 AM.</span></p><!----><!----><div><article>

<p>It’s a small enough function that gcc and/or clang should be able to optimize it
pretty well. Maybe optimally? I initially wrote this to see whether gcc produced
a jump table or a search.</p>

<p>GCC spat out a little more code, that ran a little faster (not much).</p>
<p>This code is pretty straightforward, it has three conditional branch
instructions (je, je, jne), leading to four possible blocks, ‘\0’, ’s’, ‘p’, and
a block for any other character.</p>
<h2 id="rearranging-branches"><a href="#rearranging-branches"><span>#&nbsp;</span>Rearranging branches</a></h2>
<p>However, we know some things about this loop. We know that the only time we
break out of it is when we hit the null terminator (’\0’). The code clang
generates checks for the null terminator first, but this makes no sense. The
maximum number of null terminators we will ever hit in this function is 1, so
for every ‘p’ and ’s’ character, we’re checking for null first. We should
optimize for ‘p’s, ’s’s and other characters over null terminators.</p>
<p>So, let’s rearrange this loop a little.</p>

<p>So both of our common cases (‘p’ and ’s’) jump back to the top of the loop,
so why don’t we remove one of those branches by putting its target block (or
BasicBlock™, for people in compiler land), at the top of the loop?</p>

<p>Great, now our ’s’ block falls through into the loop without a branch. Pretty
sweet.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that we now have to jump into the loop from the function start,
to avoid running the ’s’ block. This is a pretty good tradeoff though, jumping
into the loop from the function start happens once, whereas we encounter many
’s’ characters.</p>
<p>But is it fast?</p>

<p>Conditional jumps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are bad</a>, but
how about your standard garden variety unconditional <code>jmp</code>? What if we tried to

<p>A decrement is the same as two decrements and an increment, right? So let’s use

<p>Well, we got rid of another branch instruction, using basic arithmetic. Good for
us. Is it faster though?</p>

<p><strong>Overall speedup:</strong>: 1.12x 📈</p>
<p><strong>Bitrate</strong>: 332.29MiB/s</p>
<p>Fun fact, we’ve been comparing our performance to clang 16’s output this whole
time, but GCC 12 actually produced faster (but more) code. GCC’s code runs in
2.87s as well, so we only just caught up with it, however our program consists
of 13 instructions, and GCC’s is 19.</p>
<p>GCC’s code seems to have unrolled the loop, and is reusing the case blocks to
some extent.</p>

<p>Okay, but these <strong>conditional</strong> branches are the real problem, right? How do you

<p>Wow that removed a lot of arrows from the control flow graph…</p>
<p>Instead of branching/jumping conditionally, we’re using a different value
for the addition depending on the current character, using <code>cmove</code>, or…
✨✨<strong>conditional move on equality</strong>✨✨.</p>
<p>The rules are: by default use zero, if we’re on an ’s’, use 1, and if we’re on a
‘p’, use -1. Then <strong>always</strong> add.</p>
<p>Right, nice flex, but… Is it fast?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us">https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36617822">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This USGS research marks the first time anyone has tested for and compared PFAS in tap water from both private and government-regulated public water supplies on a broad scale throughout the country. Those data were used to model and estimate PFAS contamination nationwide. This USGS <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412023003069?via%3Dihub">study</a> can help members of the public to understand their risk of exposure and inform policy and management decisions regarding testing and treatment options for drinking water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals used in a wide variety of common applications, from the linings of fast-food boxes and non-stick cookware to fire-fighting foams and other purposes. High concentrations of some PFAS may lead to adverse health risks in people, according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas" target="_blank">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Research is still ongoing to better understand the potential health effects of PFAS exposure over long periods of time. Because they break down very slowly, PFAS are commonly called “forever chemicals.” Their persistence in the environment and prevalence across the country make them a unique water-quality concern.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">

  

<figcaption>A USGS scientist wearing black gloves is collecting a sample of tap water from the kitchen sink using small plastic vials to test for PFAS.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"USGS scientists tested water collected directly from people’s kitchen sinks across the nation, providing the most comprehensive study to date on PFAS in tap water from both private wells and public supplies,” said USGS research hydrologist Kelly Smalling, the study’s lead author. “The study estimates that at least one type of PFAS – of those that were monitored – could be present in nearly half of the tap water in the U.S. Furthermore, PFAS concentrations were similar between public supplies and private wells.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EPA regulates public water supplies, and homeowners are responsible for the maintenance, testing and treatment of private water supplies. Those interested in testing and treating private wells should contact their local and state officials for guidance. Testing is the only way to confirm the presence of these contaminants in wells. For more information about PFAS regulations, visit the EPA’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/key-epa-actions-address-pfas" target="_blank">website on addressing PFAS</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study tested for 32 individual PFAS compounds using a method developed by the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory. The most frequently detected compounds in this study were PFBS, PFHxS and PFOA. The interim health advisories released by the EPA in 2022 for PFOS and PFOA were exceeded in every sample in which they were detected in this study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scientists collected tap water samples from 716 locations representing a range of low, medium and high human-impacted areas. The low category includes protected lands; medium includes residential and rural areas with no known PFAS sources; and high includes urban areas and locations with reported PFAS sources such as industry or waste sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">

  

<figcaption>This USGS map shows the number of PFAS detected in tap water samples from select sites across the nation. The findings are based on a USGS study of samples taken between 2016 and 2021 from private and public supplies at 716 locations. The map does not represent the only locations in the U.S. with PFAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most of the exposure was observed near urban areas and potential PFAS sources. This included the Great Plains, Great Lakes, Eastern Seaboard, and Central/Southern California regions. The study’s results are in line with previous research concluding that people in urban areas have a higher likelihood of PFAS exposure. USGS scientists estimate that the probability of PFAS not being observed in tap water is about 75% in rural areas and around 25% in urban areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The new study builds upon previous research by the USGS and partners regarding human-derived contaminants, including PFAS, in <a href="https://geonarrative.usgs.gov/drinkingwaterinvestigations/" target="_blank">drinking water</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c04795" target="_blank">PFAS in groundwater</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Most prominently: we're replacing our Teams plan with a new ‘Scaler Pro’ offering that combines the best of our current plans and enterprise offerings for companies of all sizes. These plans allow customers to select exactly the resources they need for their workloads. Don't worry; our existing Hobby, Scaler, and Enterprise plans aren't changing or increasing in price.</p>
<p>As we've onboarded thousands of customers, large and small, one of the most common pieces of feedback people have given is that they're unsure how to map our pricing model onto their business. Reads and writes are easy to understand conceptually, but they don't map back to capacity planning that businesses are accustomed to. Many customers want more control than the traditional serverless model provides and clarity on how it compares to products like Amazon RDS and Google Cloud SQL.</p>
<p>The serverless pricing model is an interesting pricing framework for databases, but many real-world workloads need to be delineated in more concrete metrics with as little variability as possible. When predictability, stability, and availability matter most, worrying about unbounded and unknown costs is a distraction nobody can afford.</p>
<p>Scaler Pro gives you the controls needed to understand how to grow and scale. Our new plans come with the ability to scale up and down on demand, all with cutting-edge resiliency and availability features. With Scaler Pro, you get a competitive price compared to established Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) solutions while gaining significantly more features.</p>
<p>This is something we haven't done lightly. We pride ourselves on the innovations we've made in our serverless database pricing model and still aim to be the best database for serverless.</p>

<p>Scaler Pro databases are priced on a combination of resources (CPU and memory) and disk storage. Every database has a ‘cluster size’ encompassing the components that make up a PlanetScale database. Much like our existing plans, we only charge for the storage allocated in your tables, but not binary logs or other metadata.</p>
<p>Below is an updated pricing chart for our plan offerings, nothing has changed in the Hobby, Scaler, and Enterprise plans:</p>
<p><img alt="Pricing chart with the Hobby, Scaler, Scaler Pro, and Enterprise plans, see the full text based chart at planetscale.com/pricing" src="https://planetscale.com/images/blog/content/announcing-scaler-pro/new-pricing-chart-v5.png" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Now let's dive into what goes into a PlanetScale Scaler Pro database, how it stacks up next to common alternatives that you might already be using, and what you're buying when you provision one.</p>

<p>When you think of your PlanetScale database, what do you imagine? For some, a ‘serverless database’ means something mystical; others are probably picturing a complex web of virtual machines, hard drives, network switches, and all of the pieces in between.</p>
<p>Let's look at a Scaler Pro database in the PlanetScale product and break it down a bit:</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram showing a PlanetScale database on a Scaler Pro plan, shows a load balancer top of of the database with one primary and two replicas" src="https://planetscale.com/images/blog/content/announcing-scaler-pro/architecture-diagram.png" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In this diagram, the most important components are the primary and replicas. Each of these is an instance of MySQL and the Vitess components around it to handle orchestrating failovers, backups, etc.</p>
<p>Why is this important? It's where the data is! Underneath it all, PlanetScale uses standard MySQL replication to replicate your data and exists in multiple availability zones. All Scaler Pro production branches by default are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replicated across three availability zones in GCP or AWS</li>
<li>Configured to use MySQL's <code>semi-sync</code> to ensure that writes are persisted across at least two availability zones before being acknowledged to the client</li>
<li>Monitored continuously with Orchestrator, which handles planned and unplanned failovers</li>
</ul>
<p>For Scaler Pro databases, this means that any piece of data you write will exist in at least two redundant block storage volumes that span failure domains, ensuring that the data will be there when you need it. With the Vitess-native <code>Orchestrator</code> looking over your database, the loss of a virtual machine or other problem will be swiftly remediated without a human involved.</p>
<p>Beyond that, PlanetScale runs even more infrastructure behind the scenes: backups are taken by spinning up MySQL instances on-demand that validate existing backups and create new ones, a bespoke pipeline to power PlanetScale Insights, and much more.</p>

<p>In order to create logical and geographic redundancy, cloud providers split up their regions into multiple isolated datacenters that they call availability zones (AZs). In <code>us-east-1</code>, there are six of them: <code>us-east-1a</code> through <code>us-east-1f</code>. Each of these has isolated power and networking, and can be leveraged to create more resilient applications and infrastructure by expecting the failure or one or more of them in your code.</p>
<p>It may come as no surprise, but Amazon is very familiar with the tradeoffs necessary to run MySQL databases. To better understand what Scaler Pro is offering, we can compare it to the different tiers of RDS databases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-AZ</li>
<li>Multi-AZ with one standby</li>
<li>Multi-AZ with two readable standbys</li>
</ul>
<p>We can quickly eliminate single Availability Zone (AZ) from consideration for production workloads: it doesn't offer any failover capabilities, no redundancy for the degradation of an availability zone, and resiliency to losing data is limited to backups. A Single-AZ database might be great for small or staging workloads, but not much more. This would be the equivalent of a development branch on PlanetScale.</p>
<p>Looking at Multi-AZ, things get more interesting. This option includes a “standby” instance to which all writes are synchronously replicated, ensuring that if the primary availability zone were to vanish, all of the acknowledged queries would be contained in the second availability zone, just a failover away. This is great for resiliency but not availability. Failover times are a minute or longer, and no read replicas are available for scaling database traffic.</p>
<p>Finally, we land on Multi-AZ with two readable standbys.This option includes a primary and two replica databases and ensures that any writes to the primary have been acknowledged by at least one replica.</p>
<p>If you've been reading along - this will sound familiar; a PlanetScale Scaler Pro database has the same semantics! The biggest benefits of this option are that you gain two replica instances that you can use to scale your reads and much faster failovers due to the live databases that are running and ready to take traffic.</p>
<p>Because there's such a direct comparison, it's now much easier to understand how much switching to PlanetScale could save you. Let's take a look at an apples-to-apples comparison:</p>
<p><img alt="Image showing comparing PlanetScale Scaler Pro PS-320 ($699/month) to Amazon RDS 4 CPU 32 GB RAM ($1,217/month) in us-east-1" src="https://planetscale.com/images/blog/content/announcing-scaler-pro/planetscale-vs-aws-rds-chart-v1.png" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>As you can see, PlanetScale offers all of the benefits of a Multi-AZ with two readable standby databases, at the price of a Multi-AZ with one standby database. This is before we add PlanetScale's industry-leading <a href="https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/query-insights">Insights</a>, <a href="https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes">non-blocking schema changes</a>, and the ability to use <a href="https://planetscale.com/features/boost">PlanetScale Boost</a>.</p>

<p>Whether you're a current PlanetScale customer or are considering switching from RDS or Cloud SQL, as many have already done, we hope the Scaler Pro pricing scheme works for you. It's as easy as the click of a button to migrate an existing Developer or Scaler database today. For more in-depth coverage of the Scaler Pro plan, check out the <a href="https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/planetscale-plans#resource-based-plan">plans article in our docs</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to give it a try with a new database, plug your <a href="https://planetscale.com/docs/imports/aws-rds-migration-guide">RDS database into our Imports tool</a> today and give it a whirl - we don't think you'll be disappointed!</p>
<p>If your RDS database requires more scale than any of the sizes on our current price sheet, reach out to our sales team today - we can accommodate workloads that require terabytes of memory and petabytes of storage.</p>

      PFAS are found in hundreds of household items. The chemicals are used to make carpets and clothes stain-resistant. They keep food from sticking to pans and food packaging, and they’re good at keeping grease and water from soaking through. PFAS are in mobile phones, commercial airplanes and low-emission vehicles, in the foods you can buy at the farmers market or the grocery store, and in rainwater and dental floss. They’re even in the dust that collects in your home.

With that in mind, the new 45% number may sound low, but DeWitt said there could be a couple factors at play. For one, a number of utilities have been making an effort to remove PFAS from the water. Homeowners could also have filters on their systems that make it so PFAS are not as easily detectable.

And here is a sample text.</code></pre></div>
<p>When we partition a document, the output is a list of document&nbsp;<code>Element</code>&nbsp;objects. These element objects represent different components of the source document. The&nbsp;<code>unstructured</code>&nbsp;library supports various element types including <code>Title</code>, <code>NarrativeText</code>, and <code>ListItem</code>. To access the element type you can use the <code>category</code> method:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>for</span> element <span>in</span> elements<span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span><span>f"</span><span><span>{</span>element<span>.</span>category<span>}</span></span><span>:"</span></span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>element<span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"\n"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Output:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Title
My test title


NarrativeText
And here is a sample text.</code></pre></div>
<p>The list of document elements can be converted to a list of dictionaries using the&nbsp;<code>convert_to_dict</code>&nbsp;function:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> unstructured<span>.</span>staging<span>.</span>base <span>import</span> convert_to_dict

dict_data <span>=</span> convert_to_dict<span>(</span>elements<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Output:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>[{'type': 'Title',
  'coordinates': None,
  'coordinate_system': None,
  'layout_width': None,
  'layout_height': None,
  'element_id': 'a3114599252de55bea36c288aa9aa199',
  'metadata': {'filename': 'sample-doc.md',
   'filetype': 'text/markdown',
   'page_number': 1},
  'text': 'My test title'},
 {'type': 'NarrativeText',
  'coordinates': None,
  'coordinate_system': None,
  'layout_width': None,
  'layout_height': None,
  'element_id': '6e78562ede477550604528df644630e8',
  'metadata': {'filename': 'sample-doc.md',
   'filetype': 'text/markdown',
   'page_number': 1},
  'text': 'And here is a sample text.'}]</code></pre></div>
<p>But since I want to store the chunks of texts in a database and do some exploratory analysis with the data, I used <code>convert_to_dataframe</code> function to convert the text elements into pandas dataframe:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> unstructured<span>.</span>staging<span>.</span>base <span>import</span> convert_to_dataframe

df <span>=</span> convert_to_dataframe<span>(</span>elements<span>)</span></code></pre></div>

    </span></p>
<h2>Gettng the metadata</h2>
<p>One neat feature of the <code>unstructured</code> library is how it keeps track of various metadata about the elements it extracts from documents. For example, you might want to know which elements come from which page number. You can extract the metadata for a given document element like so:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>doc_metadata <span>=</span> elements<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span>metadata<span>.</span>to_dict<span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span>doc_metadata<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Output:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>{'filename': 'note.md', 'filetype': 'text/markdown', 'page_number': 1}</code></pre></div>
<p>All document types return the following metadata fields when the information is available from the source file: <code>filename</code>, <code>file_directory</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>filetype</code>, and<code>page_number</code>.</p>
<h2>Preparing for Transformers</h2>
<p>When you’re ready to feed your text into a transformer model for further processing, you can use the <code>stage_for_transformers</code> function. This function prepares your text elements by splitting them into chunks that fit into the model’s attention window.</p>
<p>In the following example, I’m using a library called <code>SentenceTransformers</code> (I’ve written more about using this library in <a href="https://saeedesmaili.com/how-to-use-sentencetransformers-to-generate-text-embeddings-locally/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">my previous blog post</a>):</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> sentence_transformers <span>import</span> SentenceTransformer
<span>from</span> unstructured<span>.</span>staging<span>.</span>huggingface <span>import</span> stage_for_transformers

model <span>=</span> SentenceTransformer<span>(</span><span>"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"</span><span>)</span>
chunked_elements <span>=</span> stage_for_transformers<span>(</span>elements<span>,</span> model<span>.</span>tokenizer<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And now I can load all the notes in a specific directory, so I can convert them to embedding vectors later:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>all_elements <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
root_dir <span>=</span> <span>'/corpus'</span>

<span>for</span> directory<span>,</span> subdirectories<span>,</span> files <span>in</span> os<span>.</span>walk<span>(</span>root_dir<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>file</span> <span>in</span> files<span>:</span>
        full_path <span>=</span> os<span>.</span>path<span>.</span>join<span>(</span>directory<span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>)</span>
        all_elements <span>+=</span> partition<span>(</span>filename<span>=</span>full_path<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Limitations of <code>unstructured</code></h2>
<p>This library has some issues and limitations as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>When loading and parsing <code>docx</code> files, it can’t properly recognize bullet points as <code>ListItem</code> and most of the times labels them as <code>NarrativeText</code> or <code>Title</code>. This makes the <code>Title</code> recognition unreliable as well, since when you look into the output, you can’t tell for sure if each <code>Title</code> is actually a title or a list item labeled incorrectly as a <code>Title</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/issues/768" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">issue on github</a>)</li>
<li>When working with large documents, there isn’t any way to know what are the parents of each paragraph or title. This could be a very useful feature to have, specially when feeding back the data to an LLM. (<a href="https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/issues/889" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">issue on github</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>After playing with <code>unstructured</code> I tried to see if there are better alternatives for reading documents with python. Although I will need to load documents with various formats, I narrowed down my search to first find alternatives for reading <code>docx</code> files first (as this it the format you get when downloading a large folder of documents from Google Drive). Here are what I found:</p>
<h3><code>python-docx</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>It seems powerful, but it’s complicated to work with.</li>
<li>I tried loading and parsing a few <code>docx</code> files. The biggest issue I experienced was with loading any text that includes hyperlinks. For some unknown reason, the texts of hyperlinks are returned empty in the final output. This makes it unusable for my purpose, since the link texts provide valuable information in the text.</li>
<li>Pro: It is able to provide the heading level info for titles (as <code>Heading 1</code>, <code>Heading 2</code>, etc).</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>docx2txt</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>It uses <code>python-docx</code> under the hood.</li>
<li>Only returns a giant full text string of the loaded document. This would require me to split my documents to meaningful chunks, which is not a trivial task to do.</li>
<li>Pro: It doesn’t have any problems with hyperlinks and the output text is readable and useful.</li>
<li>Pro: It is also very easy to use.</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>simplify_docx</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>It works on top of <code>python-docx</code>.</li>
<li>This library basically converts the complicated output of <code>python-docx</code> to a more easy to use json output.</li>
<li>It also have the same issue with hyperlinks and returns empty texts when there is a link in the paragraph.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I will continue using <code>unstructured</code> for now. It’s worth mentioning that, yes, this could be accomplished more easily using <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LangChain</a> or other similar tools. However, part of my motivation in building this personal AI assistant is the learning journey. By using <code>unstructured</code> to load documents and other similar tools for embeddings and so on, I’m gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying processes, rather than using a one-stop-shop solution like <code>LangChain</code>.</p>
<p>I’ll be sharing more about the progress I’m making in building this personal AI assistant in future posts, so stay tuned.</p></section><hr></article></div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>The planet’s temperature spiked on Tuesday to its hottest day in decades and likely centuries, and Wednesday could become the third straight day Earth unofficially marks a record-breaking high. It’s the latest in a series of <span><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate-change</a></span> extremes that alarm but don’t surprise scientists. </p><p>The globe’s average temperature reached 62.9 degrees Fahrenheit (17.18 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday, according to the University of Maine’s <span><a href="https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/t2_daily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Reanalyzer</a></span>, a common tool based on satellite data, observations, and computer simulations and used by climate scientists for a glimpse of the world’s condition. On Monday, the average temperature was 62.6 degrees Fahrenheit (17.01 degrees Celsius), setting a record that lasted only 24 hours.</p>
    

<p>For scientists, it’s a sweaty case of I-told-you-so.</p><p>“A record like this is another piece of evidence for the now massively supported proposition that <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/un-climate-change-report-ipcc-guterres-science-30d8451c0f3fb7b8a857e3ed4fd01172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global warming</a></span> is pushing us into a hotter future,” said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field, who was not part of the calculations.</p><p>On Wednesday, 38 million Americans were under some kind of heat alert, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist Sarah Kapnick. She said the global heat is from a <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/el-nino-climate-global-warming-world-weather-6eb70f36ce098d931cfcdb82590c4066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural El Nino warming of the Pacific</a></span> that heats up the planet as it changes worldwide weather on top of human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas.</p>





<p>Even normally cooler communities are feeling the heat. In North Grenville, Ontario, the city turned ice-hockey rinks into cooling centers as temperatures Wednesday hit 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), with humidity making it making it feel like 100.4 degrees (38 degrees Celsius).</p><p>“I feel like we live in a tropical country right now,” city spokeswoman Jill Sturdy said. “It just kind of hits you. The air is so thick.”</p>

                </div><p>University of Maine climate scientist Sean Birkle, creator of the Climate Reanalyzer, said the daily figures are unofficial but a useful snapshot of what’s happening in a warming world. Think of it as the temperature of someone who’s ill, he said: It tells you something might be wrong, but you need longer-term records to work like a doctor’s exam for a complete picture. </p><p>While the figures are not an official government record, “this is showing us an indication of where we are right now,” said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist Sarah Kapnick. And NOAA indicated it will take the figures into consideration for its official record calculations.</p><p>Even though the dataset used for the unofficial record goes back only to 1979, Kapnick said that given other data, the world is likely seeing the hottest day in “several hundred years that we’ve experienced.”</p><p>Scientists generally use much longer measurements — months, years, decades — to track the Earth’s warming. But the daily highs are an indication that climate change is reaching uncharted territory.</p>
    

<h2>JUST HOW HOT IS IT?</h2><p>With many places seeing temperatures near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius), the new average temperatures might not seem <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-heat-wave-deaths-9205d9c93882ff84906c5846ef1a6d6d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very hot</a></span>. But Tuesday’s global high was nearly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (a full degree Celsius) higher than the 1979-2000 average, which already tops the 20th- and 19th-century averages.</p><p>High-temperature records were surpassed this week in Quebec and Peru. Beijing reported nine straight days last week when the temperature exceeded 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). Cities across the U.S. from Medford, Oregon, to Tampa, Florida, have been hovering at all-time highs, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</p><p>Alan Harris, director of emergency management for Seminole County, Florida, said that they’ve already exceeded last year in the number of days they’ve had their extreme weather plan activated, a measure initiated when the heat index will be 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.22 degrees Celsius) or greater.</p><p>“It’s just been kind of brutally hot for the last week, and now it looks like potentially for two weeks,” Harris said.</p>
    

<p>In the U.S., heat advisories include portions of western Oregon, inland far northern California, central New Mexico, Texas, Florida and the coastal Carolinas, according to <span><a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center.</a></span> Excessive heat warnings are continuing across southern Arizona and California.</p><h2>SOME POPULATIONS ARE AT RISK, BUT MANY ARE STILL OUTDOORS</h2><p>Higher temperatures translate into brutal conditions for people all over the world. When <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-summer-weather-stay-cool-tips-026c835fe84b7113736dba0265379130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the heat spikes</a></span>, humans suffer health effects — especially young and elderly people, who are vulnerable to heat even under normal conditions.</p>

            </div><p>“People aren’t used to that. Their bodies aren’t used to that,” said Erinanne Saffell, Arizona’s state climatologist and an expert in extreme weather and climate events. “That’s important to understand who might be at risk, making sure people are hydrated, they’re staying cool, and they’re not exerting themselves outside, and taking care of those folks around you who might be at risk.” </p><p>Overall, the heat means something a little different to everyone. </p><p>In West Texas, it’s cool wraps and Gatorade for construction workers, said Joe Staley, a job site superintendent for a company that builds wastewater treatment plants. In Portland, it’s extra water on backyard vegetable gardens, said Martha Alvarado. In Minnesota, it’s a difficult workout on the family vineyard thanks to extra humidity for Joe Roisen. </p><p>In Dallas, the heat also means a sense of camaraderie for musician Sam Cormier, who often plays outdoors. Apartment dwellers with their windows open step out to bring him a drink. People are still walking around outside, even with the weather, and he plays with just his guitar, which is lighter than other equipment. He’d rather be outside sweating, he said, than inside on a computer. </p><h2>HOW WE GOT HERE, AND WHERE WE’RE GOING</h2><p>NOAA’s Kapnick said the global heat is from a <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/el-nino-climate-global-warming-world-weather-6eb70f36ce098d931cfcdb82590c4066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural El Nino warming of the Pacific</a></span> that heats up the globe as it changes worldwide weather on top of human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas.</p><p>“Not all records are meant to be broken. In almost every corner of our planet, people are facing the brunt of unprecedented heat waves,” said United Nations Environment Programme Director Inger Andersen. “We ignore science at our own peril. ... It is the poorest and most vulnerable that continue to suffer from our inaction.”</p><p>The highs come after months of “truly unreal meteorology and climate stats for the year,” such as <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-hot-oceans-el-nino-la-nina-ec00bc89848d18dec9bf4db4444c999e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">off-the-chart record warmth</a></span> in the North Atlantic, <span><a href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record low sea ice in Antarctica</a></span> and a <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/el-nino-climate-global-warming-world-weather-6eb70f36ce098d931cfcdb82590c4066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly strengthening El Nino</a></span>, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. </p><div data-align-center="">

<p>A bill that would allow police in France to spy on suspects by remotely activating cameras, microphone including GPS of their phones has been passed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bill allows the geolocation of crime suspects, covering other devices like laptops, cars and connected devices, just as it could be remotely activated to record sound and images of people suspected of terror offences, as well as delinquency and organised crime.</p>



<p>Although, the spying provision, which is part of a wider “justice reform bill”, has been attacked by the left and rights defenders as an authoritarian snoopers’ charter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The provisions “raise serious concerns over infringements of fundamental liberties,” stated a French advocacy group promoting digital rights and freedoms, La Quadrature du Net.</p>



<p>The group cited the “right to security, right to a private life and to private correspondence” and “the right to come and go freely,” specifically called the proposal a part of a “slide into heavy-handed security.”</p>



<p>But lawmakers agreed to the bill late Wednesday as Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti insisted the bill would affect only “dozens of cases a year.”</p>



<p>During the debate on Wednesday, the members of parliament in the camp of President Emmanuel Macron inserted an amendment limiting the use of remote spying to “when justified by the nature and seriousness of the crime” and “for a strictly proportional duration.” They noted that a judge must approve any use of the provision, while the total duration of the surveillance cannot exceed six months.</p>



<p>They said sensitive professions, including doctors, journalists, lawyers, judges and MPs, would not be legitimate targets.</p>



<p>Last month, the Senate gave the green light to the provision of the justice bill, which would allow law enforcement to secretly activate cameras and microphones on a suspect’s devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2015, when terrorist attacks rocked France, the country has increased its surveillance powers, and the “Keeper of the Seal” bill has been likened to the infamous US Patriot Act.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://www.fastmail.com/blog/partial-outage-on-30-june-2023/</link>
            <guid>36616023</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 14:08:23 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/partial-outage-on-30-june-2023/">https://www.fastmail.com/blog/partial-outage-on-30-june-2023/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36616023">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>A partial network outage occurred at Fastmail on June 30th, 2023. Most did not notice, but it was severe for the directly affected 3-5% of our customers.</p>
<p>Whether or not you noticed, we’re truly sorry that this happened, and have a plan to avoid it happening again.</p>
<p>This article will get very technical about how our network works! We hope you find it useful.</p>
<h2>A short summary</h2>
<p>For about 19 hours, Fastmail and a portion of the internet were completely unable to communicate with each other, including a fraction of our customers, and also some email servers. This led to delayed email, some mail fetches being disabled, and if you were using one of those networks, Fastmail being entirely offline for you!</p>
<p>We had a single path for traffic out to the internet, and hence were unable to fix this ourselves. As a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fastmail/comments/14mrjk1/comment/jq68lb9/">Reddit comment</a> said, this wasn’t within our control, but it is our responsibility.</p>
<p>It is not acceptable to us that a subset of our customers were unable to access their email for so long, and also that we were unable to send email to a section of the internet.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening again, we plan to connect directly into an additional transit provider, so we can select between multiple pathways for outbound data. Having this control will allow us to route around individual provider network issues, and be back online for everybody faster.</p>
<h2>What, when, where, who</h2>
<ul>
<li>What: access to all Fastmail services, including mail delivery, was broken – in particular, the ability for network packets leaving our network to reach their destination.</li>
<li>When: starting approximately 03:00 UTC on June 30th and ending about 22:00 UTC on the same day, for a total outage time of 19 hours. We’re quite certain that the root cause of this outage is now fixed.</li>
<li>Where: a fraction of the internet.</li>
<li>Who: We estimate 3-5% of our customers, based on comparing server metrics to similar days.</li>
</ul>
<p>We first became aware of the issue when our customers informed us via support tickets and social media. While we have monitors from multiple locations around the world, neither those monitors nor any of our staff were on networks that had issues. We could tell it was quite isolated, because some reported being able to access from phone but not home network, or vice versa. Also VPNs allowed some users to find a functioning pathway to our servers.</p>
<p>Since we couldn’t see the failing links ourselves, we relied on helpful customers on those networks who provided us with traceroutes — which then gave us some addresses to trace back to from our end and see where the traffic was dropping. We very much appreciate everybody who assisted us with datapoints!</p>
<h2>Some history</h2>
<p>A few years ago, we moved from New York Internet’s Manhattan datacenter to their Bridgewater, New Jersey location. A bit later, this datacenter was sold to 365 Datacenters. We were using the IP address range <tt>66.111.4.0/24</tt> — a range which still belongs to the original NYI.</p>
<p>Thankfully, NYI were willing to lease us those addresses, because <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/blog/how-to-check-your-ip-reputation">IP range reputation</a> is really important in the email world, and those things are hardcoded all over the place — but it has caused us complications due to more complex routing. Over the past year, we’ve been migrating to a new IP range. We’ve been running the two networks concurrently as we build up the trust reputation for the new addresses.</p>
<p>In past years, we have had <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/fastmail-fights-off-ransom-cyberattack/">DDoS attacks against our service</a>, and our previous DDoS protection services couldn’t keep us up through the worst of those attacks, so we’re now bringing all our incoming traffic via a service called MagicTransit from Cloudflare. It routes everything at the IP layer, so all the traffic is encrypted just like it was going over any other network — but Cloudflare has the capacity to soak up a lot of attack, and they’re really quick and proactive.</p>
<p>As part of the MagicTransit setup, we also added a second way into our network. Cloudflare can either route to us over our “Private Public” network IP on the 365 managed network, or via Megaport, a service which provides private virtual cables. We have a fiber link to Megaport, so we can route traffic from Cloudflare into our network without using the uplink to 365’s network. Traffic normally comes in that way, it’s a little faster, so we give it priority.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.fastmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5aCTGXiL.png" alt="active cloudflare configuration" width="1001" height="288" srcset="https://www.fastmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5aCTGXiL.png 1001w, https://www.fastmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5aCTGXiL-300x86.png 300w, https://www.fastmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5aCTGXiL-768x221.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px"></p>
<p>Megaport was up during the entire incident, so packets were getting in to our network reliably. It was outbound packets that weren’t all getting through.</p>
<h2>Our current network structure</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.fastmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/temp.png" alt="diagram of our network layout" width="754" height="781" srcset="https://www.fastmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/temp.png 754w, https://www.fastmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/temp-290x300.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px"></p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Work is now underway to select a provider for a second transit connection directly into our servers — either via Megaport, or from a service with their own physical presence in 365’s New Jersey datacenter. Once we have this, we will be able to directly control our outbound traffic flow and route around any network with issues.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and as always thank you for using Fastmail (both those who were unaffected, and those of you who have kept using Fastmail after that very bad day!)</p>

Dr Lavé has collected evidence suggesting that, in around 1190, an enormous landslide slashed perhaps 500 metres from the height of Annapurna IV, a mountain in the Himalayas that stands about 7,500 metres high today. If he is right, it would be one of the biggest landslips ever recorded. The falling mountain top would have displaced up to 27 cubic kilometres of rock—roughly enough to bury the entirety of Manhattan to about the height of the Empire State Building.</p><p>As the rubble crashed down, the energy released would have been equivalent to around six times that of the Tsar Bomba, the biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated. “I don’t think I could imagine what it would sound like,” says Ann Rowan, a geologist at the University of Bergen who was not involved in Dr Lavé’s work. </p><p>Dr Lavé’s suspicions were aroused while doing fieldwork in the Ganga plain in Nepal in 2012. He noticed that the ground beneath his feet had an unusual composition. A 50-metre core drilled out of the rock showed an average concentration of limestone of around 10%. But for one 4-metre stretch the concentration rose to nearly 50%, “which is enormous, and completely abnormal”, he says.</p><p>This suggested that the rocks in question had made their way to the Ganga plain from the Annapurna massif, hundreds of kilometres away. That, in turn, hinted at a massive landslide in the (geologically) recent past. After examining satellite images of the massif, and taking a helicopter ride to have a look for himself, Dr Lavé spotted a large rubble field which looked like it could have been caused by the same event. So he visited the site the following year, becoming only the second geologist known to have done so, and took some samples. Examining the surrounding cliffs for signs of a collapse, he noticed that a peak known as Annapurna IV offered a relatively smooth, steep face which seemed to fit.</p><p>Back home, he sent samples from the rubble field, the rock core and others from the path the landslide might have taken for dating. Should their ages roughly correspond, that would suggest they were linked to the same event. By measuring the abundance of chlorine-36 (a radioactive isotope which accumulates in surface rocks and decays once they are buried), and carbon-14 (another which accumulates in living matter and decays after death), his colleagues dated the samples to the late 12th century, and to within a couple of decades of each other. That is within the accuracy limits of the dating techniques themselves.</p><p>Besides shedding light on a previously unknown cataclysm, Dr Lavé’s work could plug a gap in the dominant explanation for why mountains stop growing, which is known as the “glacial buzzsaw” hypothesis. Under this model, it is glaciers, which are extremely effective at carving scoops out of mountains, that are mostly responsible for curbing their growth. </p><p>The problem with that theory, says Dr Rowan, is that there are some peaks that manage to escape the erosive effect of glaciers, and then grow so steeply that glaciers can no longer stick to their sides. “The question is,” she asks, “what stops these mountains getting bigger?”</p><p>Landslides could well be one answer. While the exact trigger for the Annapurna landslide is unknown, Dr Lavé’s idea is that, with nothing to shave rock off their tips, very high mountains simply keep growing until their weight is too much for their lower slopes—which do still experience erosion—to support. </p><p>Working out exactly how and when the tipping point is reached will require examining other such rockslides. Unfortunately, due to the actions of both glaciers and swollen rivers during the monsoon season, the rubble from the Annapurna landslip is vanishing fast. Dr Lavé reckons that only about 10% of the dislodged material now remains in place. Older rockslides, assuming there were any, may already be impossible to reconstruct. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>Curious about the world?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
              <blockquote>
<p>I'm investigating the applicability of the IETF's DDoS Open Threat<br>
Signaling (DOTS) specifications[1] to the needs of privacy-preserving<br>
overlay networks, including VPNs but with particular interest in Tor.</p>
<p>Specifically, now that the July 2022 D/DoS attack has finally come to a<br>
close, I'm wondering about:</p>
<p>1. the history, frequency, and magnitude of D/DoS attacks against the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tor network;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have seen high volumes of onion service activity indicative of internal onion service DDoS roughly once a year for the past several years.</p>
<p>We also have seen periodic attacks against the directory authorities, going back several years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. when these have taken the form of Tor traffic versus lower-level<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attacks on Tor nodes and HSDirs; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most common attack has been either onion service related, or against the directory authorities. However, over the past year, we saw several attack attempts that appeared to target specific relays. This was a new phenomenon, at this scale.</p>
<p>We also saw some evidence of DDoS attack attempts through Tor. Relay operators have developed tools to block connections to external IP addresses that see connection spikes. One such example tool is: <a href="https://github.com/artikel10/surgeprotector">GitHub - artikel10/surgeprotector: Block Tor Exit traffic to flooded IP addresses via ExitPolicy.</a></p>
<p>We have made several attempts to secure funding to develop mechanisms to rate limit scraping, spam, and externally-destined DDoS attack activity happening through Tor, but so far, these funding proposals have all been rejected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3. how the new "proof of work over introduction circuits" scheme fits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into Tor's overall strategy for mitigating D/DoS attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around when the proof of work branch got finalized, the onion service attacks ended. We are not sure if this is related to the ability to deploy the PoW branch ad-hoc, or if it was just a coincidence.</p>
<p>Since the majority of DDoS activity has been onion service related, we expect this defense to act as a deterrent there, for most of the issues we have seen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've found plenty of current and historical GitLab tickets---but I'm<br>
wondering if there are more comprehensive documents or other resources<br>
I'm not aware of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. Many of the non-onion attacks we have noticed have confidential tickets. Many attacks were quite effective at degrading service, and appeared to have this as their goal. They were also appeared to be probing in nature, and often stopped after a few days or a week from starting. These attacks ran parallel to the larger onion service DDoS.</p>
<p>We recently obtained funding to fix these kinds of specific attacks against Guards, dirauths, and Exits, but many issues will remain confidential until we do so. We do not want to advertise which of these probing attacks were actually effective vs not, or why.</p>

However, I don't think <code>/&gt;</code> is a good thing.</p>
<p>First up:</p>
<h2 id="the-facts"><a href="#the-facts">The facts</a></h2>
<h3 id="enter-xhtml"><a href="#enter-xhtml">Enter XHTML</a></h3>
<p>Back in the late 90s and early 2000s, the W3C had a real thing for XML, and thought that it should replace HTML syntax.</p>
<p>There were good reasons for this. At the time there was no HTML parsing spec, so when it came to anything non-trivial, you'd often end up with 4 browser engines interpreting the same HTML document 4 different ways. On the other hand, XML has a fully defined parser.</p>
<p>But, it would have been a huge change to do this all at once, so in 2000, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml1-20000126/">XHTML 1.0 became a recommendation</a>, and proposed writing HTML in a way that was compatible with both existing HTML parsers, and XML parsers.</p>
<p>That meant:</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- Instead of: --&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>HTML</span> <span>LANG</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span>&lt;!-- You'd write: --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span>
<span><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE</span> <span>html</span> <span>PUBLIC</span> <span>"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"</span> <span>"DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>html</span> <span>xmlns</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml<span>"</span></span> <span><span>xml:</span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en<span>"</span></span> <span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Because we've got to scare away newcomers right?</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- Instead of: --&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span>foo</span> <span>selected</span><span>&gt;</span></span>…<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span>&lt;!-- You'd write: --&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>foo<span>"</span></span> <span>selected</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>selected<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>…<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Because, in XML, attributes require values, and they must be quoted with double quotes.</p>
<p>And also:</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- Instead of: --&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span>&lt;!-- You'd write: --&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Because in XML, tags have to explicitly close, and XML has a short-hand for self-closing tags: <code>/&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In XML, it would generally be formatted like <code>&lt;this/&gt;</code>, without the space before the <code>/</code>, but Netscape Navigator 4 couldn't cope with <code>&lt;input type="text"/&gt;</code>, where the <code>/</code> immediately followed an attribute, so the spec recommended a space before the <code>/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="but-browsers-didnt-care"><a href="#but-browsers-didnt-care">But, browsers didn't care</a></h3>
<p>These rules were purely for XML parsers, and because documents were being served as HTML (if you're that one guy who served their site as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, you don't need to tell me), these syntactical 'extras' were ignored.</p>
<p>With <code>&lt;option selected="selected"&gt;</code>, the value was ignored, so <code>&lt;option selected=""&gt;</code> worked too, as would <code>&lt;option selected="false"&gt;</code> (the <code>false</code> would be ignored), but for 'consistency' it was decided that repeating the attribute name was a good idea.</p>
<p>If you forgot to quote an attribute, the browser didn't complain, it just got on with the job of rendering the page.</p>
<p>If you ended a tag with <code>/&gt;</code>, the browser saw it as a parsing error and ignore it. And that's where I start to take issue with it.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>br</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> The br is closed. This text is not inside the br.

But also:

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>br</span><span>&gt;</span></span> The br is closed. This text is not inside the br.

And this is where it gets confusing:

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> The div is open. This text is inside the div.</code></pre></div><p>In XML, <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> would be a self-closing div, but not in HTML. In HTML, it isn't the <code>/&gt;</code> that closes the <code>br</code>, it's the "br". It's part of a special list of elements that can never have children, and therefore they self-close. <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> doesn't self-close, because "div" isn't on that list.</p>
<h3 id="exit-xhtml"><a href="#exit-xhtml">Exit XHTML</a></h3>
<p>The 'transitional' phase of XHTML ended with XHTML 1.1. At this point the spec required the document to be served and parsed as XML. XML parsing rules were well defined, except for when invalid syntax was encountered. The best thing browsers could do there is just show an error page, else we'd be back to browsers just making stuff up, and each behaving differently. And to that, browsers said… no thanks.</p>
<p>Well, they didn't exactly say no, they supported it, and still do today. Here's <a href="https://random-server-stuff.glitch.me/xhtml/">a valid XHTML document served as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code></a>, and <a href="https://random-server-stuff.glitch.me/xhtml-broken-drs/">here's an invalid one</a>. But browsers didn't see it as the future.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: If you visit the website of your local doctor's surgery to find out the opening hours, which browser is best: The one that displays the opening hours of the surgery, or the one that displays an XML parsing error message?</p>
<p>One of the great things about browsers is they're error-tolerant, and browsers weren't interested in giving that up.</p>
<p>XHTML was eventually abandoned, because a new thing came along that browsers were happier with:</p>
<h3 id="enter-html5"><a href="#enter-html5">Enter HTML5</a></h3>
<p>HTML5 entered the scene in 2008, and one of the major things it introduced was a parsing spec. And, unlike the XML parsing spec, it detailed what browsers should do when they encounter weird and invalid markup.</p>
<p>It did away with all of the XML requirements introduced in XHTML, and leaned into the looseness of HTML parsers that existed at the time. It does handle <code>/&gt;</code> specifically, but only to specifically ignored it.</p>
<h3 id="enter-svg-in-html"><a href="#enter-svg-in-html">Enter SVG-in-HTML</a></h3>
<p>In the early 2000s, the ability to include <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> in HTML was spec'd and started appearing in browsers.</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>svg</span> <span>viewBox</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>0 0 100 100<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>circle</span> <span>cx</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>cy</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>r</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>50<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Although SVG is an XML format, when it's embedded in an HTML document it's parsed by the HTML parser. However, to increase compatibility with copy-pasted SVG content, when the HTML parser is within an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag, it switches to a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#parsing-main-inforeign">"foreign content" mode</a>, where <code>/&gt;</code> is actually meaningful.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>/&gt;</span></span> The div is open. This text is inside the div.

Whereas:

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>g</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>text</span><span>&gt;</span></span>This is inside the group<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>text</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>g</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>g</span><span>/&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>text</span><span>&gt;</span></span>This is outside the group<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>text</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Other foreign content such as MathML behaves the same.</p>
<p>And that's where things are today. <code>/&gt;</code> is mostly meaningless in HTML documents, with foreign content being the exception.</p>
<h2 id="opinions"><a href="#opinions">Opinions</a></h2>
<p>Although, as an industry, we generally discarded most of the XHTML requirements, this self-closing-tag decoration seems to have persisted, despite being a remnant from a spec that was abandoned over 10 years ago. Folks even include the space before the <code>/</code>, which was added for compatibility with a browser engine from the previous millennium.</p>
<p>I think it's a confusing relic from a time past, and I don't think tools like Prettier should be pushing it. To make my case, I'll respond to counter-arguments that came up in <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1676843832284004353">a Twitter thread</a>.</p>
<h3 id="self-closing-tags-make-it-easier-to-read-and-are-helpful-for-newcomers-you-dont-need-to-remember-which-tags-are-self-closing"><a href="#self-closing-tags-make-it-easier-to-read-and-are-helpful-for-newcomers-you-dont-need-to-remember-which-tags-are-self-closing">"Self-closing tags make it easier to read, and are helpful for newcomers! You don't need to remember which tags are self-closing."</a></h3>
<p>Outside of foreign content, elements that self-close will always self-close. All other elements, won't.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>This text is outside the input.

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span><span>&gt;</span></span>This text is outside the input.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>input</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>This text is inside the div.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>This text is inside the div.</code></pre></div><p>The examples of <code>/&gt;</code> above simply don't do anything. The only way you know that <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> is acceptable and <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> isn't, is learning and remembering which elements self-close. It sucks, but that's the way it is.</p>
<p>But, does <code>/&gt;</code> have to <em>work</em> to be useful? Code comments don't 'work'. Just like <code>/&gt;</code>, they're an indication, they might be misleading, but that isn't a good argument for removing code comments. The problem with <code>/&gt;</code> is it doesn't look like a comment, and worse, it doesn't always behave like a comment, due to the rules around foreign content.</p>
<p>I think that's particularly bad for newcomers. Imagine you'd never seen <code>&lt;img src="…"&gt;</code> before. You'd see, unlike other elements, it doesn't have a closing tag. Debuggers and validators don't complain about it, suggesting there's something particular about this element you need to learn – it doesn't need to close, it self-closes, and it's particular in this behaviour.</p>
<p>Now imagine you'd never seen <code>&lt;img src="…" /&gt;</code> before. You look up this new syntax you've discovered, and learn that it means a tag is "self-closing". At this point, why wouldn't you assume <code>&lt;iframe /&gt;</code> is self closing too? Or that <code>&lt;img src="…"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</code> is valid? Given this, I'm particularly sad that <a href="https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/242">MDN uses self-closing tags</a> in it's beginner-facing documentation.</p>
<h3 id="its-consistent-with-jsx"><a href="#its-consistent-with-jsx">"It's consistent with JSX"</a></h3>
<p>JSX and HTML are different formats. They aren't consistent with each other. Pretending they're consistent is misleading.</p>

Ok, that's more of a React thing than a JSX thing, but that's a really common way to use JSX.</p>
<p>I don't think there's an argument for consistency here. Despite visual similarities, they're different formats that work differently.</p>
<h3 id="it-means-i-can-parse-html-with-an-xml-parser"><a href="#it-means-i-can-parse-html-with-an-xml-parser">"It means I can parse HTML with an XML parser"</a></h3>
<p>Call me some sort of purist, but if I want to parse an HTML document, I'll use an HTML parser. I wouldn't try and write JSON so it can be parsed by a YAML parser, so I don't see why I'd do the same with HTML and XML.</p>
<p>There are many great HTML parsing libraries out there, for almost every language. And, since the parser is specified, the results are consistent.</p>
<h3 id="it-looks-pretty"><a href="#it-looks-pretty">"It looks pretty"</a></h3>
<p>Sure, that's subjective. I thought <code>/&gt;</code> looked ugly the first time I worked on a codebase that required it, but I got used to it. I also got used to missing it out.</p>
<p>If prettiness is the goal, hey, we could use <code>&lt;input type="text" 🛑&gt;</code>!</p>
<p>But seriously, I think aesthetics should take a back seat, given how misleading the syntax is.</p>
<h2 id="prettier-should-be-more-opinionated"><a href="#prettier-should-be-more-opinionated">Prettier should be more opinionated</a></h2>
<p>I respect Prettier's "our way or the highway" approach, but I don't think it's consistent here.</p>
<p>It will change <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>, but it won't do anything with <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code>. In fact, if you give it <code>&lt;div/&gt;</code> it'll reformat it as <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I think Prettier should either <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5246">drop <code>/&gt;</code> in cases where it's meaningless to the parser</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5864">fix cases where <code>/&gt;</code> is actively misleading</a>. As in:</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<p>…should reformat to:</p>
<p>…similar to how <a href="https://prettier.io/playground/#N4Igxg9gdgLgprEAuEAeAJgSwG4D4A6UqADrqgPSkgA0IExMm0AzsqAIYBOnEA7gApcErFOwA2vdgE9WtAEad2YANZwYAZXYBbOABlMUOMgBm45nHmKVa9cSUGA5shicArhZBwtcuOnS-ddigHV3YHOAAxCE4tdhhGYOQQdlcYCBoQAAsYLTEAdUzMeGY7MDh1YSKcIqkksGZZEANzThh+RQdYkzMPACtmAA91RzE4AEVXCHhusXNaO04WpOzcjOJOAxg8zHQYTOQADgAGeZ5zPMViJPW4FuwjWgBHSfh2+hFk5gBaQ19fDM4cGemEB7TCXSQplmHnMWkwzjcMJGcAAgvENnJUnB+HBOPpDDM5iBmMiJlMjJCerQYOw5NtdvskAAmamKTBiRwAYQgWghnmYAFYMq5zAAVWkiKFE7DuACSUH8sHUYA2DBRCvUMCko0JcAAvnqgA">it already treats unclosed tags</a>.</p>

<p>A major part of the problem is that <code>/&gt;</code> is sometimes ignored, and sometimes not, within the same HTML document. Could we have an option to switch the parsing rules so <code>/&gt;</code> is always meaningful? As in, <code>&lt;div/&gt;</code> is actually self-closing. I <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9491">filed an issue for this</a>, but I suspect it's a no-go due to incompatibility with existing libraries, particularly security-sensitive ones.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>by <a href="https://ploum.net/index.html">Ploum</a> on 2023-07-06</p><p>Lot is happening in the social network landscape with the demises of Twitter and Reddit, the apparition of Bluesky and Threads, the growing popularity of Mastodon. Many pundits are trying to guess which one will be successful and trying to explain why others will fail. Which completely misses the point.</p>
<p>Particular social networks will never "succeed". Nobody even agree on the definition of "success".</p>
<p>The problem is that we all see our little bubble and generalise what we observe as universal. We have a hard time understanding Mastodon ? Mastodon will never succeed, it will be for a niche. A few of our favourite web stars goes to Bluesky ? Bluesky is the future, everybody will be there.</p>
<p>That’s not how it works. That’s not how it ever worked.</p>
<p>Like every human endeavour, every social network is there for a limited duration and will be useful to a limited niche of people. That niche may grow to the point of being huge, like Facebook and WhatsApp. But, to this day, there are more people in the world without an account on Facebook than people with one. Every single social network is only representative of a minority. And the opposite would be terrifying when you think about it (which is exactly what Meta is trying to build).</p>
<p>Social networks are fluid. They come, they go. For commercial social networks, the success is defined by: "do they earn enough money to make investors happy ?" There’s no metric of success for non-commercial ones. They simply exist as long as at least two users are using them to communicate. Which is why criticisms like "Mastodon could never raise enough money" or "the Fediverse will never succeed" totally miss the point. </p>
<p>If you live in the same occidental bubble as me, you might have never heard of WeChat, QQ or VK. Those are immensely popular social networks. In China and Russia. WeChat alone is more or less the size of Instagram in terms of active users. The war in Ukraine also demonstrated that the most popular social network in that part of the world is Telegram. Which is twice as big as Twitter but, for whatever reason, is barely mentioned in my own circles. The lesson here is simple: you are living in a small niche. We all do. Your experience is not representative of anything but your own. And it’s fine.</p>
<p>There will never be one social network to rule them all. There should never be one social network to rule them all. In fact, tech-savvy people should fight to ensure that no social network ever "succeed".</p>
<p>Human lives in communities. We join them, we sometimes leave them. Social networks should only be an underlying infrastructure to support our communities. Social networks are not our communities. Social network dies. Communities migrate and flock to different destinations. Nothing ever replaced Google+, which was really popular in my own tech circle. Nothing will replace Twitter or Reddit. Some communities will find a new home on Mastodon or on Lemmy. Some will go elsewhere. That’s not a problem as long as you can have multiple accounts in different places. Something I’m sure you do. Communities can be split. Communities can be merged. People can be part of several communities and several platforms.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley venture capitalists are trying to convince us that, one day, a social network will succeed, will become universal. That it should grow. That social networks are our communities. That your community should grow to succeed.</p>
<p>This is a lie, a delusion. Our communities are worth a lot more than the underlying tool used at some point in time. By accepting the confusion, we are destroying our communities. We are selling them, we are transforming them into a simple commercial asset for the makers of the tool we are using, the tool which exploits us. </p>
<p>Stop trying to make social networks succeed, stop dreaming of a universal network. Instead, invest in your own communities. Help them make long-term, custom and sustainable solutions. Try to achieve small and local successes instead of pursuing an imaginary universal one. It will make you happier.</p>
<p>It will make all of us happier.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Scaling sequence length has become a critical demand in the era of large
language models. However, existing methods struggle with either computational
complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length
restricted. In this work, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can
scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the
performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention,
which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet
has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a
logarithm dependency between tokens; 2) it can be served as a distributed
trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in
replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the
existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that
LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general
language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long
sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a
sequence.

<p>The Biden administration argued that it communicated with tech companies to counter misinformation related to elections, COVID-19, and vaccines, and that it didn't exert illegal pressure on the companies. The communications to social media companies were not significant enough "to convert private conduct into government conduct," Department of Justice lawyers argued in the case.</p>
<p>But Judge Terry Doughty, a Trump nominee at US District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520.294.0_2.pdf">granted the plaintiffs' request</a> for a preliminary injunction imposing limits on the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the US Census Bureau, the State Department, the Homeland Security Department, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and many specific officials at those agencies. The injunction also affects White House officials.</p>
<p>The agencies and officials are prohibited from communicating "with social-media companies for the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech posted on social-media platforms," Doughty ruled. The injunction prohibits "specifically flagging content or posts on social-media platforms and/or forwarding such to social-media companies urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner for removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Government agencies and officials are further barred from urging, encouraging, or pressuring social media companies "to change their guidelines for removing, deleting, suppressing, or reducing content containing protected free speech." The ruling also said the government may not coordinate with third-party groups, including the Election Integrity Partnership, the Virality Project, and the Stanford Internet Observatory, to pressure social media companies.</p>
<h2>Exceptions include voting misinformation</h2>
<p>Doughty provided several exceptions that allow the government to communicate with social media companies about criminal activity and other speech that the First Amendment doesn't protect. The Biden administration may continue to inform social networks about posts involving criminal activity or criminal conspiracies, national security threats, extortion, criminal efforts to suppress voting, illegal campaign contributions, cyberattacks against election infrastructure, foreign attempts to influence elections, threats to public safety and security, and posts intending to mislead voters about voting requirements and procedures.</p>
<p>The US can also exercise "permissible public government speech promoting government policies or views on matters of public concern," communicate with social networks "in an effort to detect, prevent, or mitigate malicious cyber activity," and "communicat[e] with social-media companies about deleting, removing, suppressing, or reducing posts on social-media platforms that are not protected free speech by the Free Speech Clause in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution."</p>
<p>In addition to the Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general, the plaintiffs include professors Jayanta Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, who co-authored the October 2020 "Great Barrington Declaration" that opposed COVID lockdowns and urged a focus on reaching herd immunity. They and other plaintiffs claim they were censored by social networks.</p>
<p>The ruling was criticized by Jameel Jaffer, an adjunct professor of law and journalism who is executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. "It can't be that the government violates the First Amendment simply by engaging with the platforms about their content-moderation decisions and policies," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/business/federal-judge-biden-social-media.html">Jaffer told The New York Times</a>, calling it "a pretty radical proposition that isn't supported by the case law."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>While the government must be careful to avoid coercion in its efforts to combat false information, Jaffer said that "unfortunately, Judge Doughty's order doesn't reflect a serious effort to reconcile the competing principles."</p>
<p>Stanford Law School Assistant Professor Evelyn Douek <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/04/biden-social-lawsuit-missouri-louisiana/">told The Washington Post</a> that the "injunction is strikingly broad and clearly intended to chill any kind of contact between government actors and social media platforms."</p>
<h2>Judge finds “unrelenting pressure” on social networks</h2>
<p>Doughty previously <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.186715/gov.uscourts.lawd.186715.128.0.pdf">blocked</a> federal vaccine and mask mandates in the Head Start program. In the social media case, Doughty made it clear that he expects plaintiffs to win in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520.293.0_1.pdf">155-page memorandum ruling</a> explaining his decision yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits on their claim that the United States Government, through the White House and numerous federal agencies, pressured and encouraged social-media companies to suppress free speech. Defendants used meetings and communications with social-media companies to pressure those companies to take down, reduce, and suppress the free speech of American citizens.</p>
<p>They flagged posts and provided information on the type of posts they wanted suppressed. They also followed up with directives to the social-media companies to provide them with information as to action the company had taken with regard to the flagged post. This seemingly unrelenting pressure by Defendants had the intended result of suppressing millions of protected free speech postings by American citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>The federal defendants "argue they only made requests to the social-media companies, and that the decision to modify or suppress content was each social-media company's independent decision," Doughty wrote. "However, when a state has so involved itself in the private party's conduct, it cannot claim the conduct occurred as a result of private choice, even if the private party would have acted independently."</p>
<p>He found that defendants "significantly encouraged" and in some cases coerced "the social-media companies to such extent that the decision should be deemed to be the decisions of the Government."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>After <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail">four months of work</a>, we are excited to bring you Godot 4.1! It’s an update that follows our pledge to improve upon Godot 4.0 with frequent incremental releases — with a focus on stability, performance, and polish.</p>

<p>As always, a new release comes with a bunch of welcome new features, like the improved AI navigation avoidance and the ability to detach code editors and put them on other displays.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/detached-code-editor.png" alt="The code editor detached from the main editor window"></p>

<p>Still, we took great care to prioritize the bugs you have encountered in 4.0. This update fixes over 900 issues that users have reported from using Godot 4 or while helping contributors test 4.1 with pre-release builds. The engine should feel more reliable overall. We will continue improving stability, performance, and workflows with every upcoming feature release of Godot 4.</p>

<p>For most games and apps made with 4.0 it should be relatively safe to migrate to 4.1. We are <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/7611">preparing a migration guide</a> that outlines everything you need to pay attention to when migrating your project. Some incompatibilities are expected for C# and GDExtension users specifically, however we are working on making sure to avoid that in future releases. Don’t forget to always make backups when moving versions, even minor. Better yet, prefer using a version control system, such as Git, and commit a version of your project before the migration.</p>

<p><strong>If you wish to get straight into the action, you can <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/">download Godot 4.1 now</a>.</strong> Or stick around and read more about the most notable changes of this release. You can also watch this great highlights video by <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/">GDQuest</a>:</p>

<h2 id="giving-back">Giving back</h2>

<p>As a community effort, Godot relies on individual contributors to improve. In recent years, <a href="https://godotengine.org/donate/">user and company donations</a> allowed us to also hire a number of core contributors to work full-time on the engine and bring you these fast-paced releases.</p>

<p>Our monthly expenses remain higher than monthly donations, and we still depend on large one-time company donations to fund development. Currently, we need a lot more <a href="https://godotengine.org/donate/">monthly donations</a> to keep up the pace with Godot 4 updates, not to mention the need to hire more maintainers to review every contribution.</p>

<p>Besides financial support, you can also give back by: writing detailed bug reports, contributing to the code base, writing documentation, writing guides (for the docs or on your own website), and supporting others on the various <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/channels.html">community platforms</a> by answering questions and providing helpful tips.</p>

<p>Last but not least, making games with Godot and crediting the engine goes a long way to help make it more popular and convince more people to contribute and improve Godot for everyone. Remember, we are all in this together and Godot requires community support in every area to thrive.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>This release was made possible thanks to submissions from over 300 contributors! We warmly thank you all for your work and dedication, including those who helped us test the engine before the release and submit bug reports.</p>

<p>For an exhaustive list of all the bug fixes and improvements, head on over to our <a href="https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#4.1">interactive changelog</a>.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here’s a breakdown of the main changes and new features.</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Godot games are built as a tree of nodes, which are the engine’s base building block for game entities. Adding and removing nodes are operations the engine needs to do extremely often, so they need to be as fast as possible.</p>

<p>In 4.1, we changed the algorithm to use a fast hashmap to make adding and removing child nodes several times faster. Uncommon node operations are slightly slower as a result, and the memory footprint of the base Node class is 10% higher, but this is a small and necessary trade-off for a big benefit to all Godot users, especially to more complex projects with a lot of node manipulation.</p>

<p>This version also introduces experimental multithreading for your scenes, a feature kickstarted by <a href="https://github.com/reduz">Juan Linietsky</a>. New node properties give you full control over how nodes get processed, sequentially or in parallel.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/threaded-node-properties-highlighted.png" alt="Thread group configuration options for Node"></p>

<p>As mentioned, the feature is currently marked experimental as it needs extensive testing to find edge cases. We do not recommend using it in production yet. But it sets the foundation for making the most of modern hardware, with simple controls.</p>

<p>Also on the multithreading front, <a href="https://github.com/RandomShaper">Pedro J. Estébanez</a> worked hard on fixing a large amount of multi-threaded loading issues and limitations.</p>

<p>On the rendering side, the Vulkan renderer got a pipeline cache. While Godot already cached shaders to reduce shader compilation stutter, compiling pipelines still lead to some stuttering and slower load times. While the pipeline compilation stuttering issue is far from solved, this represents a step in the right direction and should also lead to a slight decrease in load times when using one of the RenderingDevice-based rendering backends. This cache can be toggled off in the project settings and is on by default in Godot 4.1.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/shader-cache-setting.png" alt="Shader cache project settings"></p>

<p>This improvement doesn’t address all possible causes of stalls, but it’s a first step in the right direction by <a href="https://github.com/warriormaster12">Alexander Streng</a>. We’ll keep working on it in upcoming releases.</p>

<p>More work will follow on the performance front throughout the year.</p>

<h3 id="core">Core</h3>

<p>When importing models into Godot, there was often the problem that they ended up facing backward.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/model-facing-back.webp" alt="A model facing backwards (before the change)"></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/reduz">Juan Linietsky</a>, <a href="https://github.com/TokageItLab">Tokage</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/aaronfranke">Aaron Franke</a> worked on a number of ways to address this issue. One of the implemented changes swaps the front and back camera directions in the editor. Also, the <code>look_at()</code> function now has an argument to use the model space as the reference for looking forward instead of the camera’s minus Z axis. These changes also help fix a long-standing bug with path following.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/model-facing-front.webp" alt="A model facing forward (after the change)"></p>

<p>This update also brings frame delta smoothing to Godot 4, by <a href="https://github.com/lawnjelly">lawnjelly</a>. This can significantly improve the fluidity of motion and give smoother gameplay. This option is enabled by default, though please note that it only works when VSync is also enabled.</p>

<h3 id="scripting">Scripting</h3>

<h4 id="gdscript">GDScript</h4>

<p>Until now, in GDScript, you needed to use a resource or an autoload to share data between multiple instances of the same script.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vnen">George Marques</a>, you can now create and use static variables instead. Static variables store data on the class instead of each instance, so they’re shared between every instance of the class.</p>

<p>To make a variable static, add the <code>static</code> keyword in front of a variable defined at the top of your script.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/gdscript-static-variables.png" alt="A GDScript code sample showcasing the use of static variables"></p>

<p>A great feature of GDScript added in Godot 4 is the automatic generation of documentation pages for your named classes.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/gdscript-docs-generation.png" alt="An example of a generated documentation based on a custom GDScript class"></p>

<p>This version includes a rework of the system by <a href="https://github.com/anvilfolk">ocean</a> that now treats enumerations as types, making the generated documentation more precise. You can also now use inline docstrings instead of having to always place them above a variable or a function’s definition.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>my_variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span> <span>## This is an inline docstring</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="cnet">C#/.NET</h4>

<p>The focus in this release was on bringing feature parity between C# and GDScript.</p>

<p>When using GDScript, you can define a new node type to use in the editor by adding a global class name to your script.</p>

<p>Starting from Godot 4.1, this is also possible in C# by adding the <code>[GlobalClass]</code> attribute to your file, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/raulsntos">Raul Santos</a> and <a href="https://github.com/willnationsdev">Will Nations</a>. You can also use the <code>[Icon]</code> attribute to give your global class a unique icon.</p>

<p>Note that as of this release projects made with C# still cannot be exported to mobile and web platforms. We are working on providing the support as soon as possible, but the resolution of this limitation will likely depend on the release of .NET 8 at the end of 2023. This means that the work on enabling mobile and web platforms can only truly start later this year.</p>

<h4 id="gdextension">GDExtension</h4>

<p>Godot comes with a unique technology to use low-level languages like C++ as a game scripting language, without having to recompile the engine.</p>

<p>While the technology is still in beta for this release, GDExtension is now even closer to GDScript and C# in terms of scripting capabilities. You can now implement new visual shader nodes and create editor plugins with GDExtension.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/gdextension-visual-shader-node.png" alt="An example of using a custom visual shader node from GDExtension"></p>

<p>The team also implemented a backward compatibility system to help ensure that code written for Godot 4.1 keeps working even if the API changes in future releases. However, a significant compatibility breakage was necessary to do in 4.1 to fix critical issues in GDExtension, so existing Godot 4.0 extensions will need to be ported and recompiled for 4.1.</p>

<p>Finally, a lot of work was done on the architecture once again to make the GDExtension API extensible in the future.</p>

<p>All the above resulted from the teamwork of <a href="https://github.com/dsnopek">David Snopek</a>, <a href="https://github.com/reduz">Juan Linietsky</a>, <a href="https://github.com/RedworkDE">RedworkDE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Chaosus">Yuri Rubinsky</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/YuriSizov">Yuri Sizov</a>.</p>

<h3 id="editor">Editor</h3>

<p>Godot 4 has support for multiple windows which we use for the project and editor settings and various pop-ups. Starting with this version, you can now also detach docs into floating windows and detach script editors, including the shader editor, and place them on a separate monitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/detached-code-editor.png" alt="The code editor detached from the main editor window"></p>

<p>In addition to that, the editor will now keep track of your window layout so that when you close and reopen the editor, you should often find yourself exactly where you left off.</p>

<p>You can thank <a href="https://github.com/trollodel">trollodel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Geometror">Hendrik Brucker</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/KoBeWi">Tomasz Chabora</a> for this.</p>

<p>Godot 4.0 introduced the option to define and export typed arrays, and to export individual nodes to the inspector, but it was not possible to combine the two. From Godot 4.1 onwards, you can export arrays of nodes to the inspector, which is great to link game objects together.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/editor-exported-node-array.png" alt="An array of nodes exported as a custom property"></p>

<p>This work was done by Tomasz and <a href="https://github.com/ajreckof">Timothé Bonhoure</a></p>

<p>The project manager now allows you to assign tags to individual projects and filter projects by tags. It makes it much easier to search through dozens, if not hundreds of Godot projects.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/editor-project-manager-tags.png" alt="A list of projects with custom tags assigned to them"></p>

<h3 id="rendering">Rendering</h3>

<p>Particle turbulence got reworked in this version based on artists’ feedback to offer greater creative control. Turbulence is used extensively to create these rich sprawling effects seen in many modern games. Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/KdotJPG">KdotJPG</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RPicster">Raffaele Picca</a> for this contribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/render-particles-turbulence.png" alt="An effect driven by the updated particle turbulence system"></p>

<p>Using the new 3D noise textures you can control the density of volumetric fog easily, and make it thinner in certain areas. NoiseTexture3D can also be used to create particle attractor vector fields, which is useful to simulate wind that affects particles. <a href="https://github.com/Lasuch69">Lasuch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/clayjohn">Clay John</a> implemented this feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/render-3d-noise.png" alt="A more complex fog volume using the new 3D noise"></p>

<p>While there are still many <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/rendering-priorities-4-1/">planned improvements</a> to Godot’s renderers, most will be present in future releases. The rendering team (and all rendering contributors) prioritized bug fixing and stability over new features. Notably, the 3D GLES3 renderer is not yet complete, but will see substantial work over the coming months.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Godot 4.0 introduced real-time avoidance for AI navigation, but it was limited to a single plane.</p>

<p>This release includes completely rewritten avoidance algorithms by <a href="https://github.com/smix8">smix8</a> to give you much better behaviors and greater control. Avoidance can now happen in 2D or 3D, allowing flying agents to move over those walking on the ground.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/navigation-3d-layers.png" alt="A demo of multiple navigation agents operating on several layers in 3D"></p>

<p>On top of that, you can now use layers to control which agents avoid which and assign priorities to have some agents push others away.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/navigation-priority.png" alt="A demo of multiple navigation agents with varied priorities"></p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/navigation/index.html">updated documentation</a> to learn more about how the improved navigation works.</p>

<h3 id="platform-support">Platform support</h3>

<p>We are as committed as ever to have Godot games on all popular platforms, and 4.1 still offers the same capabilities as did Godot 4.0. You can export to all desktop platforms with both standard and .NET version of the engine, and you can export to mobile and web if you don’t use C# in your projects.</p>

<p>As of 4.1 web exports still have some limitations due to poor vendor support of certain modern features. Browsers with bad WebGL 2 support, such as Chrome on macOS, unfortunately suffer from issues which we cannot address without a fix from Google or a significant amount of effort put into supporting a dedicated WebGL 1 / GLES2 renderer.</p>

<p>We are also aware of the complexity setting up web games on hosting platforms which don’t let you set the required CORS headers for SharedArrayBuffer support. This mostly depends on Safari implementing the <code>coep:credentialless</code> header support, while Chromium-based browsers and Firefox already work fine (especially if you publish on itch.io). There is a <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/6616">possible workaround</a> that we are investigating.</p>

<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>

<p>With every release we acknowledge that there are going to be problems which we couldn’t resolve in time. Some of these problems have been identified and fixes are being worked on as we speak, while others remain unknown until someone runs into the issue. You can follow our <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">bug tracker</a> to learn if the problem that you’re experiencing has been reported. We appreciate new reports and confirmations of existing reports, as that helps us prioritize fixing specific issues.</p>

<p>Here are notable issues that have already been identified that you might experience in Godot 4.1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The newly added API for defining custom configuration properties for export presets does not persist user configurations. Configuration options get reset and lost on editor restarts. The fix is going to be available in 4.1.1 (see <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79025">GH-79025</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="on-to-the-next-release">On to the next release!</h2>

<p>We already started work on Godot 4.2, which will come out in four months. We are dedicated to keeping up the pace and sticking to this reliable release cycle, so you never have to wait long for the next batch of improvements and new features.</p>

<p>Until then, <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/">enjoy Godot 4.1</a>!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
  Declarative enhancement for HTML: simple, composable, lean. TwinSpark
  transfers lots of the common logic from JS into a few declarative HTML
  attributes. This leads to good interactive sites with little JS and more manageable
  code.
</p><p>
  TwinSpark is a battle-tested technology used for years on websites with 100k+
  daily active users.
</p><p>Explanation: click on an <code>a</code> element (which is enhanced with a
<a href="https://twinspark.js.org/api/ts-req/"><code>ts-req</code></a> attribute) issues an XHR request to a server. Then
replaces the element with response from a server, and calls
<a href="https://twinspark.js.org/api/ts-req-after/"><code>ts-req-after</code></a>, which is an <a href="https://twinspark.js.org/api/ts-action">action</a>.</p><p>Some reasons why TwinSpark exists despite <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMx</a> and

				<p id="speakable-summary">Threads, Meta’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/threads-metas-twitter-competitor-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter rival</a>, is drawing users at an astounding pace, amassing 10 million signups in just seven hours, according to co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. But the highly-anticipated new service, which requires an Instagram account for onboarding, features an intriguing stipulation: Deleting a Threads account requires deleting the linked Instagram account.</p>
<p>In a ‘<a href="https://help.instagram.com/515230437301944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supplemental Privacy Policy</a>,’ Meta explains: “You may deactivate your Threads profile at any time, but your Threads profile can only be deleted by deleting your Instagram account.”</p>
<p>The rationale, Meta elaborates on the policy page, is that a Threads profile is part of the user’s Instagram account. The discovery of this stipulation has surprised many users.</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I deactivated my threads account already but it turns out you can’t delete your threads account *without also deleting your Instagram account* so maybe just don’t sign up!</p>
<p>— emily hughes ✨ (@emilyhughes) <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyhughes/status/1676775597735923719?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Threads, a text-based conversation app, is the high-profile alternative to the Elon Musk-owned social media platform Twitter.</p>
<p>Instagram, the popular photo-sharing platform with more than 2 billion users, rolled out Threads on Wednesday to users in more than 100 countries. The app, the latest in a series of fast-growing Twitter rivals, is appearing to be the most desirable so far.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg said on Thursday that the app had attracted 10 million signups in just seven hours, sharing an emoji that suggested that his mind had been blown by the reception. The pace to 10 million makes Threads the <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuWJKP_PPE2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fastest-growing consumer offering</a>.</p>
<p>A number of brands, including Netflix, Amazon, NFL, Pepsi, have also expressed their vote of confidence in Threads by signing up to the app. However, many major names — Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Disney — remain mysteriously absent, at least as of the time of publication.</p>

            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">InternLM</h2>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">InternLM has open-sourced a 7 billion parameter base model and a chat model tailored for practical scenarios. The model has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It leverages trillions of high-quality tokens for training to establish a powerful knowledge base.</li>
<li>It supports an 8k context window length, enabling longer input sequences and stronger reasoning capabilities.</li>
<li>It provides a versatile toolset for users to flexibly build their own workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, a lightweight training framework is offered to support model pre-training without the need for extensive dependencies. With a single codebase, it supports pre-training on large-scale clusters with thousands of GPUs, and fine-tuning on a single GPU while achieving remarkable performance optimizations. InternLM achieves nearly 90% acceleration efficiency during training on 1024 GPUs.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">InternLM-7B</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance Evaluation</h3>
<p dir="auto">We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of InternLM using the open-source evaluation tool <a href="https://github.com/internLM/OpenCompass/">OpenCompass</a>. The evaluation covered five dimensions of capabilities: disciplinary competence, language competence, knowledge competence, inference competence, and comprehension competence. Here are some of the evaluation results, and you can visit the <a href="https://opencompass.org.cn/rank" rel="nofollow">OpenCompass leaderboard</a> for more evaluation results.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Limitations:</strong> Although we have made efforts to ensure the safety of the model during the training process and to encourage the model to generate text that complies with ethical and legal requirements, the model may still produce unexpected outputs due to its size and probabilistic generation paradigm. For example, the generated responses may contain biases, discrimination, or other harmful content. Please do not propagate such content. We are not responsible for any consequences resulting from the dissemination of harmful information.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Import from Transformers</h3>
<p dir="auto">To load the InternLM 7B Chat model using Transformers, use the following code:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;internlm/internlm-chat-7b&quot;, trust_remote_code=True)
>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;internlm/internlm-chat-7b&quot;, trust_remote_code=True).cuda()
>>> model = model.eval()
>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, &quot;hello&quot;, history=[])
>>> print(response)
Hello! How can I help you today？
>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, &quot;please provide three suggestions about time management&quot;, history=history)
>>> print(response)
Sure, here are three tips for effective time management:

1. Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency: Make a list of all your tasks and categorize them into &quot;important and urgent,&quot; &quot;important but not urgent,&quot; and &quot;not important but urgent.&quot; Focus on completing the tasks in the first category before moving on to the others.
2. Use a calendar or planner: Write down deadlines and appointments in a calendar or planner so you don't forget them. This will also help you schedule your time more effectively and avoid overbooking yourself.
3. Minimize distractions: Try to eliminate any potential distractions when working on important tasks. Turn off notifications on your phone, close unnecessary tabs on your computer, and find a quiet place to work if possible.

Remember, good time management skills take practice and patience. Start with small steps and gradually incorporate these habits into your daily routine."><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>AutoTokenizer</span>, <span>AutoModelForCausalLM</span>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Training Performance</h3>
<p dir="auto">InternLM deeply integrates Flash-Attention, Apex and other high-performance model operators to improve training efficiency. By building the Hybrid Zero technique, it achieves efficient overlap of computation and communication, significantly reducing cross-node communication traffic during training. InternLM supports expanding the 7B model from 8 GPUs to 1024 GPUs, with an acceleration efficiency of up to 90% at the thousand-GPU scale, a training throughput of over 180 TFLOPS, and an average of over 3600 tokens per GPU per second. The following table shows InternLM's scalability test data at different configurations:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number of GPUs</th>
<th>8</th>

<p dir="auto"><strong>On Windows</strong>, you may also use the <a href="https://objects.joplinusercontent.com/v2.11.11/JoplinPortable.exe?source=JoplinWebsite&amp;type=New" rel="nofollow">Portable version</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application" rel="nofollow">portable application</a> allows installing the software on a portable device such as a USB key. Simply copy the file JoplinPortable.exe in any directory on that USB key ; the application will then create a directory called "JoplinProfile" next to the executable file.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>On Linux</strong>, the recommended way is to use the following installation script as it will handle the desktop icon too:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unofficial Alternative Distributions</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are a number of unofficial alternative Joplin distributions. If you do not want to or cannot use appimages or any of the other officially supported releases then you may wish to consider these.</p>
<p dir="auto">However these come with a caveat in that they are not officially supported so certain issues may not be supportable by the main project. Rather support requests, bug reports and general advice would need to go to the maintainers of these distributions.</p>
<p dir="auto">A community maintained list of these distributions can be found here: <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/unofficial-alternative-joplin-distributions/23703" rel="nofollow">Unofficial Joplin distributions</a></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Importing</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Importing from Evernote</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin was designed as a replacement for Evernote and so can import complete Evernote notebooks, as well as notes, tags, resources (attached files) and note metadata (such as author, geo-location, etc.) via ENEX files. In terms of data, the only two things that might slightly differ are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Recognition data - Evernote images, in particular scanned (or photographed) documents have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" rel="nofollow">recognition data</a> associated with them. It is the text that Evernote has been able to recognise in the document. This data is not preserved when the note are imported into Joplin. However, should it become supported in the search tool or other parts of Joplin, it should be possible to regenerate this recognition data since the actual image would still be available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Colour, font sizes and faces - Evernote text is stored as HTML and this is converted to Markdown during the import process. For notes that are mostly plain text or with basic formatting (bold, italic, bullet points, links, etc.) this is a lossless conversion, and the note, once rendered back to HTML should be very similar. Tables are also imported and converted to Markdown tables. For very complex notes, some formatting data might be lost - in particular colours, font sizes and font faces will not be imported. The text itself however is always imported in full regardless of formatting. If it is essential that this extra data is preserved then Joplin also allows import of ENEX files as HTML.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To import Evernote data, first export your Evernote notebooks to ENEX files as described <a href="https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005557-How-to-back-up-export-and-restore-import-notes-and-notebooks" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Then follow these steps:</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong>, open File &gt; Import &gt; ENEX and select your file. The notes will be imported into a new separate notebook. If needed they can then be moved to a different notebook, or the notebook can be renamed, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>terminal application</strong>, in <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/terminal.md#command-line-mode">command-line mode</a>, type <code>import /path/to/file.enex</code>. This will import the notes into a new notebook named after the filename.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Importing from Markdown files</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin can import notes from plain Markdown file. You can either import a complete directory of Markdown files or individual files.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>File import</strong>: Go to File &gt; Import &gt; MD - Markdown (file) and select the Markdown file. This file will then be imported to the currently selected Notebook.</li>
<li><strong>Directory import</strong>: Go to File &gt; Import &gt; MD - Markdown (directory) and select the top level of the directory that is being imported. Directory (folder) structure will be preserved in the Notebook &gt; Subnotebook &gt; Note structure within Joplin.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>terminal application</strong>, in <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/terminal.md#command-line-mode">command-line mode</a>, type <code>import --format md /path/to/file.md</code> or <code>import --format md /path/to/directory/</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Importing from other applications</h2>
<p dir="auto">In general the way to import notes from any application into Joplin is to convert the notes to ENEX files (Evernote format) and to import these ENEX files into Joplin using the method above. Most note-taking applications support ENEX files so it should be relatively straightforward. For help about specific applications, see below:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Standard Notes: Please see <a href="https://programadorwebvalencia.com/migrate-notes-from-standard-notes-to-joplin/" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a></li>
<li>Tomboy Notes: Export the notes to ENEX files <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/243691/how-can-i-export-my-tomboy-notes-into-evernote/608551" rel="nofollow">as described here</a> for example, and import these ENEX files into Joplin.</li>
<li>OneNote: First <a href="https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/107736-is-there-a-way-to-import-from-onenote-into-evernote-on-the-mac/" rel="nofollow">import the notes from OneNote into Evernote</a>. Then export the ENEX file from Evernote and import it into Joplin.</li>
<li>NixNote: Synchronise with Evernote, then export the ENEX files and import them into Joplin. More info <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/import-from-nixnote/183/3" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exporting</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin can export to the JEX format (Joplin Export file), which is a tar file that can contain multiple notes, notebooks, etc. This is a lossless format in that all the notes, but also metadata such as geo-location, updated time, tags, etc. are preserved. This format is convenient for backup purposes and can be re-imported into Joplin. A "raw" format is also available. This is the same as the JEX format except that the data is saved to a directory and each item represented by a single file.
Joplin is also capable of exporting to a number of other formats including HTML and PDF which can be done for single notes, notebooks or everything.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">One of the goals of Joplin is to avoid being tied to any particular company or service, whether it is Evernote, Google or Microsoft. As such the synchronisation is designed without any hard dependency to any particular service. Most of the synchronisation process is done at an abstract level and access to external services, such as Nextcloud or Dropbox, is done via lightweight drivers. It is easy to support new services by creating simple drivers that provide a filesystem-like interface, i.e. the ability to read, write, delete and list items. It is also simple to switch from one service to another or to even sync to multiple services at once. Each note, notebook, tags, as well as the relation between items is transmitted as plain text files during synchronisation, which means the data can also be moved to a different application, can be easily backed up, inspected, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, synchronisation is possible with Nextcloud, WebDAV, Dropbox, OneDrive or the local filesystem. To enable synchronisation please follow the instructions below. After that, the application will synchronise in the background whenever it is running, or you can click on "Synchronise" to start a synchronisation manually. Joplin will background sync automatically after any content change is made on the local application.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the <strong>terminal client</strong> has been installed, it is possible to also synchronise outside of the user interface by typing <code>joplin sync</code> from the terminal. This can be used to setup a cron script to synchronise at a regular interval. For example, this would do it every 30 minutes:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code> */30 * * * * /path/to/joplin sync</code></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nextcloud synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/nextcloud-logo-background.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/nextcloud-logo-background.png" width="100"></a> <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" rel="nofollow">Nextcloud</a> is a self-hosted, private cloud solution. It can store documents, images and videos but also calendars, passwords and countless other things and can sync them to your laptop or phone. As you can host your own Nextcloud server, you own both the data on your device and infrastructure used for synchronisation. As such it is a good fit for Joplin. The platform is also well supported and with a strong community, so it is likely to be around for a while - since it's open source anyway, it is not a service that can be closed, it can exist on a server for as long as one chooses.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong> or <strong>mobile application</strong>, go to the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a> and select Nextcloud as the synchronisation target. Then input the WebDAV URL (to get it, click on Settings in the bottom left corner of the page, in Nextcloud), this is normally <code>https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/webdav/Joplin</code> (<strong>make sure to create the "Joplin" directory in Nextcloud</strong>), and set the username and password. If it does not work, please <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/61#issuecomment-373282608" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/laurent22/joplin/issues/61/hovercard">see this explanation</a> for more details.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>terminal application</strong>, you will need to set the <code>sync.target</code> config variable and all the <code>sync.5.path</code>, <code>sync.5.username</code> and <code>sync.5.password</code> config variables to, respectively the Nextcloud WebDAV URL, your username and your password. This can be done from the command line mode using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=":config sync.5.path https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/webdav/Joplin
:config sync.5.username YOUR_USERNAME
:config sync.5.password YOUR_PASSWORD
:config sync.target 5"><pre><code>:config sync.5.path https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/webdav/Joplin
:config sync.5.username YOUR_USERNAME
:config sync.5.password YOUR_PASSWORD
:config sync.target 5
</code></pre></div>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dropbox synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">When syncing with Dropbox, Joplin creates a sub-directory in Dropbox, in <code>/Apps/Joplin</code> and reads/writes the notes and notebooks in it. The application does not have access to anything outside this directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong> or <strong>mobile application</strong>, select "Dropbox" as the synchronisation target in the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a> (it is selected by default). Then, to initiate the synchronisation process, click on the "Synchronise" button in the sidebar and follow the instructions.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>terminal application</strong>, to initiate the synchronisation process, type <code>:sync</code>. You will be asked to follow a link to authorise the application.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OneDrive synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">When syncing with OneDrive, Joplin creates a sub-directory in OneDrive, in /Apps/Joplin and reads/writes the notes and notebooks in it. The application does not have access to anything outside this directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong> or <strong>mobile application</strong>, select "OneDrive" as the synchronisation target in the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a>. Then, to initiate the synchronisation process, click on the "Synchronise" button in the sidebar and follow the instructions.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>terminal application</strong>, to initiate the synchronisation process, type <code>:sync</code>. You will be asked to follow a link to authorise the application (simply input your Microsoft credentials - you do not need to register with OneDrive).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">S3 synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">As of Joplin 2.x.x, Joplin supports multiple S3 providers. We expose some options that will need to be configured depending on your provider of choice. We have tested with UpCloud, AWS, and Linode. others should work as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong> or <strong>mobile application</strong>, select "S3 (Beta)" as the synchronisation target in the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>S3 Bucket:</strong> The name of your Bucket, such as <code>joplin-bucket</code></li>
<li><strong>S3 URL:</strong> Fully qualified URL; For AWS this should be <code>https://s3.&lt;regionName&gt;.amazonaws.com/</code></li>
<li><strong>S3 Access Key &amp; S3 Secret Key:</strong>  The User's programmatic access key.  To create a new key &amp; secret on AWS, visit <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials" rel="nofollow">IAM Security Credentials</a>. For other providers follow their documentation.</li>
<li><strong>S3 Region:</strong> Some providers require you to provide the region of your bucket. This is usually in the form of "eu-west1" or something similar depending on your region. For providers that do not require a region, you can leave it blank.</li>
<li><strong>Force Path Style</strong>: This setting enables Joplin to talk to S3 providers using an older style S3 Path. Depending on your provider you may need to try with this on and off.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">While creating a new Bucket for Joplin, disable <strong>Bucket Versioning</strong>, enable <strong>Block all public access</strong> and enable <strong>Default encryption</strong> with <code>Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3)</code>. Some providers do not expose these options, and it could create a syncing problem. Do attempt and report back so we can update the documentation appropriately.</p>
<p dir="auto">To add a <strong>Bucket Policy</strong> from the AWS S3 Web Console, navigate to the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab. Temporarily disable <strong>Block all public access</strong>  to edit the Bucket policy, something along the lines of:</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration settings for tested providers</h3>
<p dir="auto">All providers will require a bucket, Access Key, and Secret Key.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you provide a configuration and you receive "success!" on the "check config" then your S3 sync should work for your provider. If you do not receive success, you may need to adjust your settings, or save them, restart the app, and attempt a sync. This may reveal more clear error messaging that will help you deduce the problem.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Encryption</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on all the applications. E2EE is a system where only the owner of the notes, notebooks, tags or resources can read them. It prevents potential eavesdroppers - including telecom providers, internet providers, and even the developers of Joplin from being able to access the data. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/e2ee.md">End-To-End Encryption Tutorial</a> for more information about this feature and how to enable it.</p>
<p dir="auto">For a more technical description, mostly relevant for development or to review the method being used, please see the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/spec/e2ee.md">Encryption specification</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Note history</h2>
<p dir="auto">The Joplin applications automatically save previous versions of your notes at regular intervals. These versions are synced across devices and can be viewed from the desktop application. To do so, click on the "Information" button on a note, then click on "Previous version of this note". From this screen you can view the previous versions of the note as well as restore any of them.</p>
<p dir="auto">This feature can be disabled from the "Note history" section in the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a>, and it is also possible to change for how long the history of a note is saved.</p>
<p dir="auto">More information please see the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/note_history.md">Note History page</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">External text editor</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin notes can be opened and edited using an external editor of your choice. It can be a simple text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text or an actual Markdown editor like Typora. In that case, images will also be displayed within the editor. To open the note in an external editor, click on the icon in the toolbar or press Ctrl+E (or Cmd+E). Your default text editor will be used to open the note. If needed, you can also specify the editor directly in the General Options, under "Text editor command".</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Attachments</h2>
<p dir="auto">Any kind of file can be attached to a note. In Markdown, links to these files are represented as a simple ID to the attachment, clicking on this link will open the file in the default application. In the case of audio, video and pdf files, these will be displayed inline with the note and so can be viewed or played within Joplin.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong>, files can be attached either by clicking the "Attach file" icon in the editor or via drag and drop. If you prefer to create a link to a local file instead, hold the ALT key while performing the drag and drop operation. You can also copy and paste images directly in the editor via Ctrl+V.</p>
<p dir="auto">Resources that are not attached to any note will be automatically deleted in accordance to the <a href="#note-history">Note History</a> settings.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Important:</strong> Resources larger than 10 MB are not currently supported on mobile. They will crash the application when synchronising so it is recommended not to attach such resources at the moment. The issue is being looked at.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Downloading attachments</h2>
<p dir="auto">The way the attachments are downloaded during synchronisation can be customised in the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a>, under "Attachment download behaviour". The default option ("Always") is to download all the attachments, all the time, so that the data is available even when the device is offline. There is also the option to download the attachments manually (option "Manual"), by clicking on it, or automatically (Option "Auto"), in which case the attachments are downloaded only when a note is opened. These options should help saving disk space and network bandwidth, especially on mobile.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notifications</h2>
<p dir="auto">In the desktop and mobile apps, an alarm can be associated with any to-do. It will be triggered at the given time by displaying a notification. How the notification will be displayed depends on the operating system since each has a different way to handle this. Please see below for the requirements for the desktop applications:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: &gt;= 8. Make sure the Action Center is enabled on Windows. Task bar balloon for Windows &lt; 8. Growl as fallback. Growl takes precedence over Windows balloons.</li>
<li><strong>macOS</strong>: &gt;= 10.8 or Growl if earlier.</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>: <code>notify-send</code> tool, delivered through packages <code>notify-osd</code>, <code>libnotify-bin</code> or <code>libnotify-tools</code>. GNOME should have this by default, but install <code>libnotify-tools</code> if using KDE Plasma.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier/blob/master/DECISION_FLOW.md">documentation and flow chart for reporter choice</a></p>
<p dir="auto">On mobile, the alarms will be displayed using the built-in notification system.</p>
<p dir="auto">If for any reason the notifications do not work, please <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues">open an issue</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Sub-notebooks</h2>
<p dir="auto">Sub-notebooks allow organising multiple notebooks into a tree of notebooks. For example it can be used to regroup all the notebooks related to work, to family or to a particular project under a parent notebook.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/SubNotebooks.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/SubNotebooks.png" alt=""></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In the <strong>desktop application</strong>, to create a subnotebook, drag and drop it onto another notebook. To move it back to the root, drag and drop it on the "Notebooks" header. Currently only the desktop app can be used to organise the notebooks.</li>
<li>The <strong>mobile application</strong> supports displaying and collapsing/expanding the tree of notebooks, however it does not currently support moving the subnotebooks to different notebooks.</li>
<li>The <strong>terminal app</strong> supports displaying the tree of subnotebooks but it does not support collapsing/expanding them or moving the subnotebooks around.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Markdown</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin uses and renders a Github-flavoured Markdown with a few variations and additions. In particular it adds math formula support, interactive checkboxes and support for note links. Joplin also supports Markdown plugins which allow enabling and disabling various advanced Markdown features. Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/markdown.md">Markdown Guide</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Custom CSS</h2>
<p dir="auto">Rendered markdown can be customized by placing a userstyle file in the profile directory <code>~/.config/joplin-desktop/userstyle.css</code> (This path might be different on your device - check at the top of the <code>General</code> page of the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a> for the exact path). This file supports standard CSS syntax. Joplin <em><strong>must</strong></em> be restarted for the new css to be applied, please ensure that Joplin is not closing to the tray, but is actually exiting. Note that this file is used for both displaying the notes and printing the notes. Be aware how the CSS may look printed (for example, printing white text over a black background is usually not wanted).</p>
<p dir="auto">The whole UI can be customized by placing a custom editor style file in the profile directory <code>~/.config/joplin-desktop/userchrome.css</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Important: userstyle.css and userchrome.css are provided for your convenience, but they are advanced settings, and styles you define may break from one version to the next. If you want to use them, please know that it might require regular development work from you to keep them working. The Joplin team cannot make a commitment to keep the application HTML structure stable.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Plugins</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <strong>desktop app</strong> has the ability to extend beyond its standard functionality by the way of plugins. These plugins adhere to the Joplin <a href="https://joplinapp.org/api/references/plugin_api/classes/joplin.html" rel="nofollow">plugin API</a> and can be installed &amp; configured within the application via the <code>Plugins</code> page of the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">From this menu you can search for plugins uploaded to the <a href="https://github.com/joplin/plugins">Joplin plugins</a> repository as well as manual installation of plugins using a 'Joplin Plugin Archive' (*.jpl) file.<br>
Once the application is reloaded the plugins will appear within the plugins menu where they can be toggled on/off or removed entirely.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information see <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/plugins.md">Plugins</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Searching</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin implements the SQLite Full Text Search (FTS4) extension. It means the content of all the notes is indexed in real time and search queries return results very fast. Both <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#simple_fts_queries" rel="nofollow">Simple FTS Queries</a> and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#full_text_index_queries" rel="nofollow">Full-Text Index Queries</a> are supported. See below for the list of supported queries:</p>
<p dir="auto">One caveat of SQLite FTS is that it does not support languages which do not use Latin word boundaries (spaces, tabs, punctuation). To solve this issue, Joplin has a custom search mode, that does not use FTS, but still has all of its features (multi term search, filters, etc.). One of its drawbacks is that it can get slow on larger note collections. Also, the sorting of the results will be less accurate, as the ranking algorithm (BM25) is, for now, only implemented for FTS. Finally, in this mode there are no restrictions on using the <code>*</code> wildcard (<code>swim*</code>, <code>*swim</code> and <code>ast*rix</code> all work). This search mode is currently enabled if one of the following languages are detected:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Chinese</li>
<li>Japanese</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Thai</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported queries</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Search type</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Single word</td>
<td>Returns all the notes that contain this term.</td>
<td>For example, searching for <code>cat</code> will return all the notes that contain this exact word. Note: it will not return the notes that contain the substring - thus, for "cat", notes that contain "cataclysmic" or "prevaricate" will <strong>not</strong> be returned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Multiple word</td>
<td>Returns all the notes that contain <strong>all</strong> these words, but not necessarily next to each other.</td>
<td><code>dog cat</code> - will return any notes that contain the words "dog" and "cat" anywhere in the note, no necessarily in that order nor next to each other. It will <strong>not</strong> return results that contain "dog" or "cat" only.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Phrase</td>
<td>Add double quotes to return the notes that contain exactly this phrase.</td>
<td><code>"shopping list"</code> - will return the notes that contain these <strong>exact terms</strong> next to each other and in this order. It will <strong>not</strong> return for example a note that contains "going shopping with my list".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prefix</td>
<td>Add a wildcard to return all the notes that contain a term with a specified prefix.</td>
<td><code>swim*</code> - will return all the notes that contain eg. "swim", but also "swimming", "swimsuit", etc. IMPORTANT: The wildcard <strong>can only be at the end</strong> - it will be ignored at the beginning of a word (eg. <code>*swim</code>) and will be treated as a literal asterisk in the middle of a word (eg. <code>ast*rix</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Switch to basic search</td>
<td>One drawback of Full Text Search is that it ignores most non-alphabetical characters. However in some cases you might want to search for this too. To do that, you can use basic search. You switch to this mode by prefixing your search with a slash <code>/</code>. This won't provide the benefits of FTS but it will allow searching exactly for what you need. Note that it can also be much slower, even extremely slow, depending on your query.</td>
<td><code>/"- [ ]"</code> - will return all the notes that contain unchecked checkboxes.</td>

<p dir="auto">Note: In the CLI client you have to escape the query using <code>--</code> when using negated filters.
Eg. <code>:search -- "-tag:tag1"</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The filters are implicitly connected by and/or connectives depending on the following rules:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>By default, all filters are connected by "AND".</li>
<li>To override this default behaviour, use the <code>any</code> filter, in which case the search terms will be connected by "OR" instead.</li>
<li>There's an exception for the <code>notebook</code> filters which are connected by "OR". The reason being that no note can be in multiple notebooks at once.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Incorrect search filters are interpreted as a phrase search, e.g. misspelled <code>nootebook:Example</code> or non-existing <code>https://joplinapp.org</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Search order</h2>
<p dir="auto">Notes are sorted by "relevance". Currently it means the notes that contain the requested terms the most times are on top. For queries with multiple terms, it also matters how close to each other the terms are.

<p dir="auto">In the desktop application, press <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+P</kbd> and type a note title or part of its content to jump to it. Or type <kbd>#</kbd> followed by a tag name, or <kbd>@</kbd> followed by a notebook name.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Multiple profile support</h2>
<p dir="auto">To create a new profile, open File &gt; Switch profile and select Create new profile, enter the profile name and press OK. The app will automatically switch to this new profile, which you can now configure.</p>
<p dir="auto">To switch back to the previous profile, again open File &gt; Switch profile and select Default.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that profiles all share certain settings, such as language, font size, theme, etc. This is done so that you don't have reconfigure every details when switching profiles. Other settings such as sync configuration is per profile.</p>
<p dir="auto">The feature is available on desktop only for now, and should be ported to mobile relatively soon.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Donations</h2>
<p dir="auto">Donations to Joplin support the development of the project. Developing quality applications mostly takes time, but there are also some expenses, such as digital certificates to sign the applications, app store fees, hosting, etc. Most of all, your donation will make it possible to keep up the current development standard.</p>

<div><p>Amazon now feels more like a racket than an open shopping platform; you can't find posts from your friends on Facebook because it's clogged with unsolicited advertising; and Uber no longer seems like a cool, efficient taxi service, it's morphed instead into a global machine for turning gig workers into the new underclass – it's all part of a process Cory Doctorow has dubbed "enshittification".</p><p>In this feature interview, the&nbsp;Canadian sci-fi author, journalist and digital rights activist explains why the digital world seems so exploitative and tawdry.&nbsp;But he has optimism for how things might be improved in the future.</p></div>

<p>Japan has long prided itself on its pacifist constitution. The country's future after WW II was defined by Article 9 which famously denounced aggression. But, in recent years security has become a paramount concern with increasing tensions around the status of nearby Taiwan and challenges from neighbouring countries. The Japanese are now renegotiating how best to defend themselves and their interests, while holding true to constitutional restraint. What that could mean for the future of Japan and its allies is of global interest and concern.</p>

<p>Global permission to mine the ocean floor — the International Seabed Authority will soon meet and decide whether or not to allow seabed exploitation, and in what circumstances. We'll hear the arguments both for and against and get some background on this little known, but hugely consequential, international regulatory body. Also, will advanced technology one day make the oceans transparent? And if so, what will that mean for the future of submarines – a technology that relies on stealth and secrecy? And why studying ancient tsunamis could help protect us from future disasters.</p>

<p>How best to build our homes so they can better withstand natural disasters? It's not just about designing for floods or fire, for example, but creating structures to withstand multiple threats. And to cope with any change of temperature on top of that? Many countries are facing an increase in climate-related threats, and they're struggling to cope and adapt. In Australia, a review of the National Construction Code is underway and there are calls for higher minimum standards. Should such a crisis design be made mandatory?</p>

<p>Toby Walsh is an expert on Artificial Intelligence. He recently declined an offer to sign an open letter calling for a moratorium on the technology's further development, but he's no techno-utopian. In this feature interview, recorded at the Brisbane Writers Festival, he explains his position and warns the world risks repeating the mistakes made through the unregulated release of social media at the beginning of the century.</p>

<p>Citizen scientists across the world have joined forces to map the microplastic crisis in our oceans. It comes as a UN agency moves to create a global treaty to end plastic pollution. Also, the idea that trees can communicate via extensive networks of underground fungi is increasingly popular, but is it correct? New research casts doubt on the extent of the claim. And, replacing cargo planes with drones – the dream of a European drone cargo airline</p>

<p>Beijing likes to trumpet its economic clout. And as the second largest economy in the world there's no denying its power and influence. But the Chinese economy is a "black box" according to noted historian, Frank Dikötter, which even senior Chinese officials don't fully understand. It's an economic cauldron powered by massive debt, political spin and ideological dogma – a unique fusion of ersatz capitalism and rigid central planning. And unless we in the West get a better understanding of its complexity, global future prosperity is far from assured.</p>

<p>Bribery involves using money to try and buy a person's favour, but what do you call it when someone uses their resources not to win someone over, but to destroy their political career? Until now, it's had no name. But James D'Angelo, from the Congressional Research Institute in the US, has just invented one . He calls it "brubery" – and it's threatening the very future of Western politics, he says. Also, high tech largess or digital colonialism ? Seeing global tech's expansion from a very different set of eyes.</p>

<p>ChatGPT is a controversial new language assistant powered by AI. It can write essays, do coding and even structure complex research briefs, all in a matter of seconds. To its detractors ChatGPT and other AI-text generating tools represents the beginning of the end of human creativity and a future of universal plagiarism. To the less exuberant, it's a sophisticated new educational tool that has significant flaws and needs to be used judiciously. It's also likely to force a rethink of how we assess students and what it means to be genuinely creative.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en">
    

    
    

    <div>
  

<p>Two universal facts about user documentation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Documentation is really important.</li>
<li>We are really bad at writing it.</li>
</ol>

<p>We don’t have good theories on what makes for useful documentation. That is except for the <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">four document model</a>, or <a href="https://diataxis.fr/">Diátaxis</a>.<sup id="fnref:diataxis"><a href="#fn:diataxis">1</a></sup> I’m glad that people use it. I’m also a little frustrated that people use it even when its inappropriate. My problem is that it’s not a universal or comprehensive model: there’s a lot of documentation people need to write that doesn’t neatly fit the model.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-4doc-model">What is the 4doc model?</h2>

<p><img src="https://documentation.divio.com/_images/overview.png" alt="four document types on two axes"></p>

<p>The 4doc model says that user-facing documentation should fall into four categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tutorials</strong> describe how to get up and running as fast as possible.</li>
<li><strong>How-tos</strong> describe how to do <em>specific</em> things.</li>
<li><strong>Explanations</strong> teach a topic you already know in-depth.</li>
<li><strong>References</strong> describe exactly what things are and what they do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each category serves a different purpose, targets a different audience, and is written in a special style. Tutorials are friendly and simplified, while references are dry and comprehensive.</p>

<p>4doc was originally started by Daniele Procida at Divio to improve their documentation, and has since become popular in the broader tooling ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="my-problems">My problems</h2>

<p>I think of the 4doc model like the five-paragraph essay. In the US, kids are taught to write essays in three parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>A starting paragraph the context and the main thesis,</li>
<li>Three body paragraphs that each independently support the thesis</li>
<li>A concluding paragraph with summarizing the arguments and thesis.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s a good starting point to learn essay writing. The problem is that students think it’s the <em>only</em> way to write essays, and then they cram everything they write into a format straitjacket.</p>

<p>4doc is <em>much</em> better than 5para: I’ve never read a halfway-decent 5-paragraph essay but I’ve read plenty of good 4doc pages. Even so, it still leads to the same kind of “this is the only way” thinking. People use the model even when it’s not the right choice and they don’t vary up the format even when they should.</p>

<p>My specific issue is that the model is not <strong>universal</strong> and it’s not <strong>comprehensive</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-not-universal">It’s not universal</h3>

<p>From <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/structure/">the structure page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good examples of the scheme in substantial projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the <a href="https://docs.divio.com/">Divio Developer Handbook</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/#how-the-documentation-is-organized">Django’s documentation</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://docs.django-cms.org/">django CMS’s documentation</a></p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Divio and Django CMS are <em>tools</em>. Tools and libraries are different than frameworks and languages. Tools have simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">conceptual models</a>, the set of interrelated ideas you need to internalize to use them properly. You just need to know <em>what</em> they do and <em>how</em> to use them. The 4doc model, developed at Divio, most reflects the documentation needs of tools.</p>

<p>Look at django. Frameworks are one step up from tools and are still mostly about “what and how”, but they also have a lot of interrelated concepts you need to understand. While it still ostensibly follows the 4doc model, the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/">“explanation” section</a> is triple the size of the tutorial and how-to sections combined.<sup id="fnref:django-measurement"><a href="#fn:django-measurement">2</a></sup> The explanation section also <em>teaches</em> the user, which isn’t supposed to happen:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s not the place of an explanation to instruct the user in how to do something. Nor should it provide technical description. These functions of documentation are already taken care of in other sections. — <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/explanation/">divio</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s only possible to separate explanation and instruction for things if you don’t need a good mental model. Things like tools.</p>

<p>If we zoom out to programming languages (PLs), the 4doc model breaks down entirely. If you look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">Python</a> docs, the tutorial section needs to also explain and reference, and the references are both explanation and how-to. Language concept maps are just too dense to separate.</p>

<p>I’ve seen some languages try to strictly follow the 4doc model and it doesn’t work. 4doc is oriented around random-access, languages are taught in a sequence-of-lessons. The two don’t mix well.</p>

<p>In short, the 4doc model is <strong>not universal</strong>. It was designed for documenting <em>tools</em> and doesn’t fully address the needs of frameworks and programming languages.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-not-comprehensive">It’s not comprehensive</h3>

<p>4doc would be comprehensive if all useful forms of documentation fell into one of the four types. This isn’t true for the same reason 4doc is nonuniversal: it only covers documentation forms that are necessary for tools.</p>

<p>If you’re documenting a complex topic like a programming language, there’s at least (at least) two more kinds of docs you’ll want:</p>

<h4 id="1-conceptual-overviews">1. Conceptual Overviews</h4>

<p>If I was presented with 4doc-following documentation and had to add just one thing to it, I’d write a conceptual overview.</p>

<p><dfn>Conceptual overviews</dfn>
 cover the concepts of the tool/framework/language. It presents what the big picture of what this is all <em>for</em> and previews the conceptual model users will learn. The denser the model, the more you need a conceptual overview.</p>

<p>The 4doc model describes documentation types in terms of cooking, so here’s one for conceptual overviews:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All soups work in the same basic way: prepare ingredients like vegetables and meat and boil them in water. This softens the ingredients and flavors the water (“broth”). We can make higher-quality soups by first cooking some ingredients in oil (which develops more flavors), adding some ingredients later in the boil (so they don’t get <em>too</em> soft), using a boiling different liquid (like chicken stock or beer), or using spices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a more in-depth example of an overview, you can see <a href="https://learntla.com/intro/conceptual-overview.html">one I wrote for TLA+</a>. It first explains the problem TLA+ is trying to solve (designing complex concurrent systems), introduces the concepts involved (specs, behaviors, properties, models), and only <em>then</em> shows any code. And even then it doesn’t explain how to <em>run</em> the code, just how various aspects of the code relate to the concepts.</p>

<p>(“Aren’t these just a kind of explanations?” Explanations are intended for people who already know, or are in the process of learning, your subject. It comes after the tutorial. Conceptual overviews come <em>before</em> the tutorial. They are for people who are <em>getting ready</em> to learn the subject, or for outsiders evaluating if they <em>want to learn it</em>.)</p>

<h4 id="2-snippets-and-examples">2. Snippets and Examples</h4>

<p>Examples are complete code intended to be studied. Snippets are samples of code intended to be used. As much as we make fun of Stackoverflow-based development, we copy and paste from websites because that works and makes us productive. If you provide them from the start, developers don’t have to find them from sketchy third parties.</p>

<p>Examples also show <em>how something is done</em>, which is subtly-but-fundamentally different from <em>how-to do something</em>. Imagine I present you an example of a code, and then an example of the same code, optimized. I’m not giving you a rote how-to on optimizing code, I’m demonstrating a way of <em>thinking</em> about optimizing code. It all comes back to the mental model.</p>

<p>Or take Julia Evans’ <a href="https://mysteries.wizardzines.com/">debugging mysteries</a>, a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">Choose Your Own Adventures</a> where the reader debugs a problem. It looks like a how-to, but it’s a branching path, not a linear set of steps.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/problems-with-the-4doc-model/img/wizardzines.png" alt="An example of a debugging mystery, where the user can try a few different things and see why they do (or don't) work"></p>

<p>The cooking analogy would be a video of a chef making a dish and explaining what she’s thinking while she makes it. Or maybe doing a taste-test of undersalted dishes. It’s not a perfect analogy. Written examples don’t make a whole lot of sense in tradecraft.</p>

<h2 id="good-is-the-enemy-of-better">Good is the enemy of better</h2>

<p>I want to be clear: I don’t think 4doc is <em>bad</em>. I think it’s quite good! But I think you have to think about <em>how</em> you’re using it. Like any other tool, you have to evaluate what it does for you. The model says at much:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diátaxis is based on sound theoretical principles and has been proven in practice, but it’s not the final word in documentation. … the structure it proposes is not intended to be a plan, something you must complete in your documentation. It’s a guide, a map to help you check that you’re in the right place and going in the right directions. — <a href="https://diataxis.fr/how-to-use-diataxis/">How to use Diátaxis</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m unhappy that the original Divio page doesn’t have this disclaimer and instead has big quote calling it the “The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation”. Procida doesn’t seem to be believe this and I wish divio would stop pitching 4doc as the one-and-only documentation system. It might be good for getting people on board but it’s bad for broader documentation innovation.</p>

<h2 id="overview">1. Overview </h2>

<p>The "Cloud Backed SQLite" (CBS) system allows databases to be stored within
cloud storage accounts such that they can be read and written by storage
clients without first downloading the entire database to the client. This
document should be read in concert with the detailed API documentation present
in the two main public header files:

</p><ul>
  <li> <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/blockcachevfs.h">blockcachevfs.h</a>
  </li><li> <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/bcvutil.h">bcvutil.h</a>
</li></ul>

<p>Databases may be accessed concurrently by multiple clients, although ensuring
that only a single client is writing to a database at any time is (mostly) left
to the application. A "client" is a single operating system process system -
within a single client process there may be multiple SQLite handles reading and
writing a database using the usual SQLite WAL-mode read/write locking to 
manage concurrent access between themselves. Existing clients do not see
changes made by writers automatically, they are obliged to explicitly poll
cloud storage to do so.

</p><p>The system currently supports 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/">Azure Blob Storage</a>
and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Google Cloud Storage</a>. It also features
<a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/module.wiki">an API that may be used to implement</a> support to other 
cloud storage systems.

</p><p>The software is currently developed on Linux with stock gcc, and on Windows-10
using the MSVC-compatible mingw64 gcc compiler. Other platforms are quite
likely to work too, but have not been tested.

</p><h2 id="storage_format">1.1. Storage Format</h2>

<p>SQLite databases are not stored within the blob storage system in the usual
format. Instead, each database is divided into one or more fixed-size blocks.
The default block-size is 4MB, although this is configurable. Each block is
assigned an id between 16 and 32 bytes (128 and 256 bits) in size (all blocks
in a single container have the same sized ids). The name of each block file
is created by encoding its id in hexadecimal format and adding the extension
".bcv". For example:

</p><pre>  787A5B026DBF882F89748C37AED04CCD.bcv
</pre>

<p>For containers that use ids smaller than 24 bytes in size, each block id is
randomly generated. For manifests that use ids 24 bytes or larger, the first
16 bytes of each id may contain the md5 hash of the block contents, with
the remainder of the id made up by pseudo-random values. See the
section on <a href="#sharing">block sharing</a> below for further details.

</p><p>Along with the block files is a "manifest" file, which contains, amongst other
things, a machine-readable description of how the various block files may be
assembled into into one or more SQLite databases. The name of the manifest
file is always:

</p><pre>  manifest.bcv
</pre>

<p>There is also an SQLite database used to store the contents of the "bcv_kv"
virtual table <span color="red">MAKE THIS LINK SOMEWHERE!</span> named:

</p><pre>  bcv_kv.bcv
</pre>

<p>At present, manifest and block files may only be stored in the root directory
of a blob storage container, not in any sub-directory. This means that each
container contains at most a single manifest file. It may be that this
limitation can be removed if desirable. Other files may be stored in a
container along with the CBS files, but they must not use the ".bcv" extension.
Files that end with ".bcv" may be mistaken for surplus block or other files and
deleted or overwritten by CBS clients. 

</p><p><b>Note:</b> CBS documentation uses the Azure terminology "container" to refer
to the cloud storage virtual receptacle in which block files and manifests are
stored. In Google Storage documentation the analagous concept is a "bucket".
Other cloud storage systems may use their own vernacular.

</p><h2 id="system_components">1.2. System Components</h2>

<p>There are three components to the system:

</p><ol>
  <li> <b>Primitives</b> to:
    <ul><li> Create blob storage containers and populate them
             with empty manifest files (manifest files indicating that the
             container contains no databases).
        </li><li> Destroy entire blob storage containers and their contents.
        </li><li> Upload databases to cloud storage.
        </li><li> Download databases from cloud storage.
        </li><li> Create copies of existing databases within cloud storage.
        </li><li> Delete databases from cloud storage.
        </li><li> List the databases within a cloud storage container.
        </li><li> Clean up (remove) unused blocks from cloud storage.
    </li></ul>
    <p>
      Each primitive is available both as an 
      <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/bcvutil.h">C API</a> that can be called by
      applications, and as a <a href="#commandline">command-line tool</a>.
  </p></li><li> <b>A daemon process</b> that, while running, provides local SQLite
       database clients in the same or different OS process with read-only
       access to databases stored in remote blob storage containers.

<blockquote></blockquote></li><li> <b>A VFS module</b> that may be used in two modes, as follows:
  <ul>
    <li> For read-only access of cloud databases via a running daemon process,
         or
    </li><li> For read/write access of cloud databases in "daemonless" mode.
  </li></ul>
  <p>
  The advantage of using a daemon over daemonless mode is that a single 
  local cache of downloaded database blocks may be shared by multiple
  processes. In daemonless mode, each process is obliged to maintain its 
  own separate cache.
</p></li></ol>

<p>Both the daemon and command line tools are packaged as a single binary
executable - "blockcachevfsd".

</p><h2 id="build">2. Building, Deployment and Testing</h2>

<p>command from the root directory of the source tree.


</p><h3>Adding Application Support </h3>

<div><p>
To add support for the VFS and various primitives, the following C files from
the source code distribution must be built into the application:

</p><pre>    bcvutil.c
    bcvmodule.c
    blockcachevfs.c
    simplexml.c
    bcvencrypt.c
</pre>

<p>The following header files from the source code distribution are required:
</p><pre>    bcvutil.h
    bcvmodule.h
    blockcachevfs.h
    simplexml.h
    bcv_int.h
    bcvencrypt.h
</pre>

<p>As well as SQLite, the application must be linked against libcurl and openssl.

</p><p>The application should not include either "bcv_int.h" or "simplexml.h"
directly. They are required by the build, but are not intended to be used
directly. The other three header files are intended to be used by applications,
they container declarations for APIs that provide the following functionality:

</p><ul>
  <li> Header file <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/blockcachevfs.h">blockcachevfs.h</a> 
       contains APIs required to use the VFS module to access cloud databases
       via usual SQLite interfaces.
  </li><li> Header file <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/bcvutil.h">bcvutil.h</a> 
       contains APIs required to use the various cloud storage primitives.
  </li><li> Header file <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/blockcachevfs.h">bcvmodule.h</a> 
       contains APIs required to extend blockcachevfs to access new
       cloud storage systems (other than Azure Blob Storage and Google Cloud
       Storage, for which there is built-in support).  
</li></ul>
</div>

<h3>Building blockcachevfsd:</h3>
<div><p>
The easiest way to build the "blockcachevfsd" executable that contains both
the daemon and the command line tools is using the standard:

</p><pre>  ./configure &amp;&amp; make
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, it may be built from all sources listed above as required
for adding blockcachevfs support for an application, along with file
"blockcachevfsd.c", which contains the main routine.  
</p></div>

<h3>Testing the system:</h3>
<p>
The blockcachevfs system has an automated test suite. Notes describing its
use may be <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/testing.wiki">found here</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="usage">3. Usage </h2>

<h2 id="usage1">3.1. Uploading Databases</h2>

<p>This section illustrates how to upload databases to a blob storage account 
and begin using them. It assumes that cloud storage module name and
authentication details, for example an account name and access key are stored
in a file named "account.txt" in the current directory. Example account.txt
contents for Azure Blob Storage:

</p><pre>  -module azure
  -user devstoreaccount1
  -auth Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==
</pre>

<p>The command-line options above can just as easily be specified directly on the
command-line. But storing them in a file, and then using the 
"-f &lt;file&gt;" option supported by all commands to treat the contents 
of the named file as if they were specified directly on the command-line can
be less cumbersome.

</p><p>To begin, create a container and an empty manifest to which databases may be
uploaded, where $CONTAINER is the container name:

</p><pre>  $ blockcachevfsd create -f account.txt $CONTAINER
</pre>

<p>If the named blob storage container already exists, CBS will clobber any
manifest file within it with a new, empty, manifest file, effectively
deleting any databases in the container.

</p><p>Next, upload one or more databases from the local file system to the blob
storage account. In the following, $LOCALDB is an absolute or relative path
to an SQLite database file and $DBNAME is the name used to access the 
database after it has been uploaded. It is an error if there is already
a database named $DBNAME in the manifest:

</p><pre>  $ blockcachevfsd upload -f account.txt -container $CONTAINER $LOCALDB $DBNAME
</pre>

<h2 id="usage2">3.2. Accessing Databases</h2>

<p>This section explains, by way of example code, how to access a blockcachevfs
datbase stored in cloud storage using an SQL client. The full program is
<a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/cloudsql.c">available here</a>. It should be read together with
the API documentation in file <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/blockcachevfs.h">blockcachevfs.h</a>

</p><p>The example code implement a program that accepts four arguments on the command
line:

</p><ul>
  <li> A path to an existing directory to use for a blockcachevfs cache
       directory, 
  </li><li> The name of a container to attach to the new blockcachevfs VFS
       the program creates,
  </li><li> A path to a database to open using the blockcachevfs VFS, and
  </li><li> An SQL script to evaluate against that database.
</li></ul>

<p>The program creates a VFS, attaches the container, opens a database handle
and then executes the supplied SQL script. The code as presented below omits 
several uninteresting features for brevity - there is no main() routine for
example. But the full version, linked above, contains everything required
for a working application.

</p><p>The following block contains the required #include directives and the
authentication callback for the example application. All applications
require an authentication callback, as there is no other way to provide
authentication tokens to system. And there are currently no implementations
of cloud storage modules that do not require authentication tokens.

</p><div>
<pre>/*
** The code in this file creates and uses a VFS, but it doesn't use any 
** cloud storage primitives or implement a new cloud storage module, so

*/
#include "blockcachevfs.h"
#include "sqlite3.h"

/*

** authentication token based on the storage system, account name and 
** container name parameters, but since the credentials used by this
** application are hard coded, it just returns a copy of constant string

**
** Because the API is defined such that this function must return a buffer

  const char *zContainer,
  char **pzAuthToken
){
  *pzAuthToken = sqlite3_mprintf("%s", CS_KEY);
  return (*pzAuthToken) ? SQLITE_OK : SQLITE_NOMEM;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>The next block contains the start of the cloudsql() function, which does the
bulk of the work for this application. It begins by creating the VFS object.
Note that, like almost all other blockcachevfs APIs, if an error occurs the
sqlite3_bcvfs_create() function returns an error message in a buffer that
must be freed by the caller using sqlite3_free().

</p><p>Once the VFS has been created successfully, the application can use the
sqlite3_bcvfs_isdaemon() API to see if the VFS has connected to a daemon or
is running in daemonless mode.

</p><p>If, when sqlite3_bcvfs_create() is called, there is a daemon process using the
specified directory as its cache directory, then the VFS created by the
sqlite3_bcvfs_create() call automatically connects to the daemon and 
provides read-only access. The daemon can be started using the following
command line:

</p><pre>    blockcachevfsd daemon $DIRECTORY
</pre>

<p>where $DIRECTORY above must be the same string as passed to cloudsql()
function below via the zDir parameter. If a daemon process was using the
directory for its cache directory, but has since exited, the
sqlite3_bcvfs_create() call will fail. 

</p><p>If there has never been a daemon running in the directory, then the call to
sqlite3_bcvfs_create() creates a VFS running in daemonless mode. In this mode
it requires exclusive access to the directory. If there is some other
daemonless VFS already running in the specified directory, the call to
sqlite3_bcvfs_create() fails with SQLITE_BUSY.

</p><div>
<pre>/*
** Open a VFS that uses directory zDir as its cache directory. Then attach
** container zCont. Next, open an SQLite handle on path zPath using the new 
** VFS and execute SQL script zSql.
*/
static int cloudsql(
  const char *zDir,               /* Directory to use for blockcachevfs cache */
  const char *zCont,              /* Container to attach */
  const char *zPath,              /* Path to open */
  const char *zSql                /* SQL to execute */
){

  /* Create a VFS object. Directory zDir must already exist. If it exists
  ** and there is a daemon running in that directory, the new VFS connects
  ** to the daemon for read-only access. Or, if there is no such daemon,
  ** the new VFS will provide read-write daemonless access.  */
  rc = sqlite3_bcvfs_create(zDir, "myvfs", &amp;pVfs, &amp;zErr);

  /* Check if this is a daemon VFS or not */
  if( rc==SQLITE_OK ){
    if( sqlite3_bcvfs_isdaemon(pVfs) ){
      printf("VFS is using a daemon\n");
    }else{
      printf("VFS is in daemonless mode\n");
    }
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>Following this, assuming it was create successfully, the code connects the
authorization callback to the new VFS. And then "attaches" the cloud 
storage container specified by the user to the VFS. 

</p><p>Before the databases in a cloud storage container can be accessed, it must 
be attached to the VFS. Once it has been attached, SQL clients may access
the databases within the container by opening paths of the form
"/$CONTAINER/$DATABASE" using the blockcachevfs VFS.

</p><div>
<pre>  /* Configure the authorization callback. */
  if( rc==SQLITE_OK ){
    sqlite3_bcvfs_auth_callback(pVfs, 0, csAuthCb);
  }

  /* Attach the container. Specify the SQLITE_BCV_ATTACH_IFNOT flag so that
  ** it is not an error if the container is already attached. 
  **
  ** There are two reasons the container might already be attached, even
  ** though the VFS was only just created. Firstly, if this VFS is connected
  ** to a running daemon process, then some other client may have already
  ** attached the container to the daemon. Secondly, VFS objects store their
  ** state in the cache directory so that if they are restarted, all
  ** containers are automatically reattached. So if this (or some other
  ** blockcachevfs application) has run before specifying the same 
  ** cache directory, the container may already be attached.  */
  if( rc==SQLITE_OK ){
    rc = sqlite3_bcvfs_attach(pVfs, CS_STORAGE, CS_ACCOUNT, zCont, 0,
        SQLITE_BCV_ATTACH_IFNOT, &amp;zErr
    );
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>Once the container is attached to the VFS, the database handle is opened
and the SQL script executed. Before the script is executed though,
sqlite3_bcvfs_register_vtab() is called to make the virtual tables available
to the database handle.

</p><p>For the sake of brevity, the code below omits the sqlite3_exec() callback
that is part of the <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/cloudsql.c">full version</a>.

</p><div>
<pre>  /* Open a database handle on a cloud database. */
  if( rc==SQLITE_OK ){
    rc = sqlite3_open_v2(zPath, &amp;db, SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE, "myvfs");
    if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){
      zErr = sqlite3_mprintf("%s", sqlite3_errmsg(db));
    }
  }

  /* Enable the virtual table interface. */
  if( rc==SQLITE_OK ){
    rc = sqlite3_bcvfs_register_vtab(db);
  }

  /* Execute the provided SQL script. */
  if( rc==SQLITE_OK ){
    sqlite3_exec(db, zSql, 0, 0, &amp;zErr);
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>Finally, the cloudsql() function cleans up the two handles it allocated,
outputs any error message and returns.

</p><div>
<pre>  sqlite3_close(db);
  sqlite3_bcvfs_destroy(pVfs);

  /* Output any error, free any error message and return. */
  if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: (%d) %s\n", rc, zErr);
  }
  sqlite3_free(zErr);
  return rc;
}
</pre>
</div>

<h2 id="secure">3.3. Secure Containers </h2>

<p>When running in daemon mode, containers may be attached either securely or
insecurly. By default, containers are attached to a daemon insecurely. This
means that:

</p><ul>
  <li><p>Any local process that can connect to the daemon's listening socket 
       may read and write the database, and that
  </p></li><li><p>Even after the daemon process has stopped, any cached parts of 
       databases in attached containers may be read directly from the 
       cache file.
</p></li></ul>

<p>When containers are attached securely, all data stored in the cache file
is encrypted using 128-bit AES OFB encryption. Local clients obtain the
encryption key from the daemon process by supplying valid cloud storage
credentials - a client is granted the encryption key only if it can prove 
that it already has permission to access the database within cloud storage.
Cloud storage credentials are verified only once, when the client first
connects, so it is quite possible for a client to remain connected to a
daemon process and accessing a database long after its supplied credentials 
have expired.

</p><p>A container is nominated as secure when it is first attached to a daemon,
by specifying the SQLITE_BCV_ATTACH_SECURE flag along with the
sqlite3_bcvfs_attach() call.

</p><p>There are two known disadvantages to attaching containers securely:

</p><ul>
  <li><p>Blocks are stored unencrypted in cloud storage. This means that as
       well as local clients encrypting and decrypting individual database 
       pages as they are read, each time a block is downloaded the entire block
       must be encrypted before it can be stored in the cache file.  Under some
       cirumstances this overhead may be significant.

</p><blockquote></blockquote></li><li><p> If the daemon process crashes or is killed after data is written 
       to a secure container database but before said data has been uploaded
       to cloud storage, the data is lost.
</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="modules">4. Cloud Storage Modules and Authentication</h2>

<p>All CBS APIs and command-line tools accept a "module" specification, which
determines the cloud storage system that the system operates on and how
it operates. There are two built-in modules, "azure", which works with
Azure Storage, and "google", which works with Google Cloud Storage. There
is also <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/module.wiki">an API</a> that may be used to add new cloud
storage modules.

</p><p>A module specification consists of the module name optionally followed by
one or more URI style key/value parameters. For example:

</p><pre>  azure
  azure?sas=1
  azure?emulator=127.0.0.1:10000&amp;sas=1
</pre>

<p>There is no default module. It must always be specified explicitly.

</p><p>As well as a module specification, CBS APIs and command-line tools require
a user-name and an authentication value - a string containing cloud storage
authentication information. Exactly how these are interpreted depends on the
module specification. The values expected by the two built-in modules, and how
they are used, are described in the following two sections.

</p><h2 id="azure">4.1 The Built-In "azure" Module</h2>

<p>The "azure" module is used to interface with Azure Storage. The value provided
as a user-name is used as the Azure user name when connecting. The
authentication value may either be the corresponding 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage">
account access-key</a> (shared-key access), or an 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview">
Azure Shared Access Signature token</a>, depending on the URI style parameters
provided along with the module name.

</p><p>One way to generate an SAS token for Azure is to use the "az" command line
tool. For example, given account $ACCOUNT with access-key $ACCESSKEY, to
generate an SAS token that allows read/write access to container $CONTAINER and
expires on the 15th of April, 2020:

</p><pre>  az storage container generate-sas -o tsv 
      --account-name $ACCOUNT 
      --account-key $ACCESSKEY 
      --expiry 2020-04-15 
      --name $CONTAINER 
      --permissions dlrw
</pre>

<p>The daemon process and some command-line commands may also use read-only SAS
tokens. To generate a read-only token, the --permissions option in the command
above should be passed "lr" instead of "dlrw".

</p><p>The following URI style parameters may be used to modify the behaviour of the
azure module:
</p><table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Option</th><td></td><th> Interpretation
  </th></tr><tr><td>emulator</td><td></td><td>
          If this option is present, it indicates that CBS should connect to an
          Azure emulator instead of to a real Azure cloud storage account. Both
          the open source <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite">azurite</a>
          and the 
          <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator">legacy emulator</a> 
          are supported. The value of this option should be set to the
          "host:portnumber" address of the port on which the emulated Azure
          blob service is running. If using either supported emulator on the
          local machine with default options, this address is
          "127.0.0.1:10000".
</td></tr><tr><td>sas</td><td></td><td>This option must be set to either "0" (the
          default) or "1". If it is set to 1, then the module expects the
          provided authentication value to be an SAS token. Otherwise, it
          assumes it to be an access-key.
</td></tr><tr><td>customuri</td><td></td><td>This option may only be present if "sas=1"
          is also specified. Similarly, it may only be set to "0" (the
          default), or "1". If it is set to 1, then a base URI for the
          container must be specified in place of the account name parameter.
          If the specified container name is NULL or a zero-length string,
          then the base URI is used as is as the URI for the remote container.
          Otherwise, the specified container name is appended as a directory
          component to the base URI. For example, if the string value passed as
          the account name for an "customuri=1" module is:

<blockquote><pre>https://photos.contoso.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>and the container name "myforms", then the URI used to access the container manifest is:

</p><blockquote><pre>https://photos.contoso.com/myforms/manifest.bcv</pre></blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, the same container can be accessed by specifying a NULL container name and:

</p><blockquote><pre>https://photos.contoso.com/myforms</pre></blockquote>

<p>as the custom URI value.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>For example, to connect to a real Azure account using an SAS token for 
authentication purposes:
</p><pre>  azure?sas=1
</pre><p>
To connect to an Azure blob emulator running on localhost port 10000 (the
default) using an access-key for authentication, either of the following
may be used:
</p><pre>  azure?emulator=127.0.0.1:10000
  azure?emulator=127.0.0.1:10000&amp;sas=0
</pre><p>
Or, to connect to a real Azure account using an access-key for authentication:
</p><pre>  azure
</pre><p>
may be used.

</p><h2 id="google">4.2 The Built-In "google" Module</h2>

<p>The "google" module is used to connect CBS to Google Cloud Storage. The
user-name parameter should be passed the 
<a href="https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113?hl=en">project-id
</a> for the project that owns the storage bucket or buckets to be operated on.
In practice, this is only required for CBS's "create" primitive, and only
then if it needs to 
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/xml-api/reference-headers#xgoogprojectid"> create a new cloud storage container (bucket)</a>. In all other 
cases, an empty string may be specified for the CBS user-name parameter.

</p><p>The authorization value parameter must be passed the text of a 
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#oauth">
Google Cloud access token</a>.

</p><p>The google module does not accept any URI style parameters.

</p><h2 id="details">5. Details and Caveats </h2>
<h2 id="concurrent">5.1. Concurrent Access From Multiple Clients </h2>

<p>The system supports any number of concurrent readers using either daemonless
or daemon mode. Even though no locks are taken, read transactions are not
usually interfered with, even if a new version of the database is pushed by
another host while they are ongoing. This is because block files are never
modified after they are created; new block files are uploaded for each change.
And old block files are not deleted immediately (<a href="#cleanup">see
below</a>), so ongoing read transactions can usually continue to access them
for as long as required.

</p><p>If a database is modified within the cloud storage system, the modifications
do not become automatically visible to existing clients. Until the container
is "polled", clients continue to see the old versions of all databases. A
container may be polled either by calling the sqlite3_bcvfs_poll() API:

</p><pre>    int sqlite3_bcvfs_poll(sqlite3_bcvfs *pFs, const char *zCont, char **pzErr);
</pre>

<p>or the equivalent <a href="#pragma">PRAGMA interface</a>. To be clear, any 
changes made are immediately visible to other SQL clients using the same
read-write daemonless VFS object, but are not visible to SQL clients using
other VFS objects until the container has been polled.

</p><p>Similarly, after changes are made to a cloud storage database via a read-write
daemonless VFS object, the new version of the database is not automatically
uploaded to cloud storage. In order to upload changes to cloud storage so
that they are available to new clients or existing clients after they have
polled the container, use the sqlite3_bcvfs_upload() API:

</p><pre>    int sqlite3_bcvfs_upload(
      sqlite3_bcvfs *pFs,             /* VFS handle */
      const char *zCont,              /* Container (alias) to upload databases of */
      int (*xBusy)(void*,int),        /* Busy-handler callback */
      void *pBusyArg,                 /* First argument passed to xBusy */
      char **pzErr                    /* OUT: Error message */
    );
</pre>

<p>or the equivalent <a href="#pragma">PRAGMA interface</a>.

</p><p>At present, it is not possible to upload changes to a database if there have
been changes made to *any* database in the container since the most recent
poll operation. This is not usually a problem, the container can be polled
and then the upload reattempted.

</p><p>However, the poll operation will fail if there have been changes to one or
more databases in cloud storage for which there are also local changes yet
to be uploaded, or if there are local changes to a database that has been
deleted from cloud storage. It is the responsibility of the user to avoid
this situation - concurrent modifications being made to the same database
at multiple sites - perhaps by using the <a href="#vtab">bcv_kv virtual table</a>.

</p><h2 id="cleanup">5.2. Deleting Old Blocks</h2>

<p>Once they have been uploaded, blocks are never modified within cloud storage.
Instead, when a database is modified, new block files are uploaded for the
modified regions and the manifest updated to refer to the new list of blocks.
This makes managing reader/writer concurrency easier, and facilitates 
<a href="#sharing">block sharing</a>, but also means that as time passes a 
large number of unused block files may accumuate within cloud storage.

</p><p>Unused block files may be removed by invoking the sqlite3_bcv_cleanup()
interface from <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/bcvutil.h">bcvutil.h</a>:

</p><pre>    int sqlite3_bcv_cleanup(sqlite3_bcv *p, int nSecond);
</pre>

<p>In order to avoid disturbing existing read clients, the second parameter
may be used to specify the minimum number of seconds the block must have
been unused for to be considered eligible for cleanup.

</p><h2 id="sharing">5.3. Block Sharing</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a single block may be used by multiple databases within a 
manifest, saving cloud storage space and bandwidth. This is known as
"block sharing". Block sharing occurs in two scenarios:

</p><ul>
  <li> If a copy of a database is made using the 
       <a href="#copy_command">command line copy primitive</a>, then the copy
       shares all of its blocks with the original. This takes place regardless
       of the configured size of block ids for the manifest file.

<blockquote></blockquote></li><li> If the configured block-id size for a manifest file is greater than
       or equal to 24 bytes, then the first 16 bytes of each block id is
       an md5 hash of the block contents. In this case, before each new 
       block is uploaded, the system checks to see if there already exists a
       block with the same md5 hash (and hence, we assume, the same content)
       that can be used in its place.
       <p>
       This usually only occurs when a database being uploaded is a copy or
       slightly modified copy of an existing database, or when an existing
       database is overwritten with a copy of another database using the
       SQLite backup API.
       </p>
</li></ul>

<p>The block id size used by a manifest file must be configured when the 
manifest is first created using the 
<a href="#create_command">command line create command</a> or equivalent
API. If block sharing using md5 hash values is required, then the block id size
should be set to 24 bytes. Otherwise, it is best left set to the default value
of 16 bytes to save space.

</p><h2 id="pragma">5.4. Pragma Interface</h2>

<p>Blockcachevfs currently supports three PRAGMA statements - "PRAGMA bcv_upload"
, "PRAGMA bcv_poll" and "PRAGMA bcv_client". If further PRAGMA commands are
added in the future, the names of the new commands will begin with "bcv_".

</p><p><b> PRAGMA bcv_upload </b>

</p><p>Blockcachevfs database clients may execute the following PRAGMA statement
to force any changes made locally to be uploaded to the cloud storage
account:

</p><pre>  PRAGMA [database].bcv_upload
</pre>

<p>The PRAGMA statements does not return until the upload is complete. If
successful, an empty string is returned. If an error occurs and the upload
cannot be completed, an SQLite error code is returned and the error message
set to an English language explanation of the error.

</p><p>Invoking this PRAGMA is different to using the sqlite3_bcvfs_upload() 
interface in that this command only uploads changes for the current database,
whereas sqlite3_bcvfs_upload() uploads all locally modified databases in
the container.

</p><p><b> PRAGMA bcv_poll </b>

</p><p>Invoking "PRAGMA bcv_poll":

</p><pre>  PRAGMA [database].bcv_poll
</pre>

<p>is the equivalent to calling sqlite3_bcvfs_poll() on the container that the
database is a part of. If successful, an empty string is returned. Otherwise,
an SQLite error code is returned and the error message set to an English
language explanation of the error.

</p><p><b id="pragma_bcv_client"> PRAGMA bcv_client </b>

</p><p>Invoking "PRAGMA bcv_client":

</p><pre>  PRAGMA [database].bcv_client
  PRAGMA [database].bcv_client = NAME
</pre>

<p>This PRAGMA is used to set or query a cloudsqlite database connection's client
name. The configured client name appears in the "client" column of the
<a href="#bcv_http_log">bcv_http_log</a> virtual table for requests associated
with the current database connection. It may also appear in log messages. It is
not used for any other purpose. The default client name is an empty string.

</p><h2 id="vtab">5.5. Virtual Table Interface</h2>

<p>The virtual table interface consists of three eponymous virtual tables
(or two in daemon mode). It is not available automatically, but must be
made available to each SQLite connection explicitly by calling the
sqlite3_bcvfs_register_vtab() API from 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/blockcachevfs.h">blockcachevfs.h</a>:

</p><pre>    int sqlite3_bcvfs_register_vtab(sqlite3*);
</pre>

<p><b>The bcv_container table:</b>

</p><p>The read-only "bcv_container" table contains one row for each container
attached to the VFS. It has the equivalent of the following schema:

</p><pre>    CREATE TABLE bcv_container(
      name      TEXT,          -- local name (alias) of container 
      storage   TEXT,          -- cloud storage system (e.g. "azure")
      user      TEXT,          -- cloud storage username
      container TEXT,          -- container name in cloud storage
      ncleanup  INTEGER        -- number of blocks eligible for cleanup
    )
</pre>

<p>Column "name" contains the local alias of the attached container (this
may be the same as the remove container name). Columns "storage", "user"
and "container" contain the storage module, account and cloud storage
container names as specified to sqlite3_bcvfs_attach() when the container
was attached.

</p><p>The "ncleanup" column usually contains the number of blocks that will 
be deleted from cloud storage if a cleanup operation (see the 
sqlite3_bcv_cleanup() API)is run on the container. However, if
errors or client crashes have occurred while uploading changes to
cloud storage, then there may be extra unused blocks left in the
cloud storage container. In this case those blocks will be deleted
by the next cleanup operation, but are not included in the value
stored in the "ncleanup" column of the "bcv_container" table.

</p><p>The bcv_container table is available in both daemon and daemonless
mode.

</p><p><b>The bcv_database table:</b>

</p><p>The read-only "bcv_database" table contains one row for each database in each
attached container. It has the equivalent of the following schema:

</p><pre>    CREATE TABLE bcv_database(
      container TEXT,          -- local name (alias) of container
      database  TEXT,          -- name of database
      nblock INTEGER,          -- total number of blocks in database
      ncache INTEGER,          -- number of blocks in cache
      ndirty INTEGER,          -- number of dirty blocks in cache
      walfile BOOLEAN,         -- true if transactions in local wal file
      state TEXT               -- state of database (see below)
    )
</pre>

<p>The "container" column contains the local alias of the container (the
same value that is stored in the "name" column of the bcv_container
table). Column "database" contains the database name.

</p><p>Columns "nblock", "ncache" and "ndirty" contain the total number of
blocks in the database, the number of those blocks that are currently
cached locally, and the number of those cached blocks that are dirty
and require uploding. It is always true that:

</p><pre>    nblock &gt;= ncache &gt;= ndirty
</pre>

<p>Boolean column "walfile" is set to true if there are currently write
transactions in a local wal file (blockcachevfs databases are always
in wal mode). To determine whether or not there have been local 
changes to a database, an application might use a query similar to:

</p><pre>    SELECT (walfile OR ndirty&gt;0) AS has_local_changes FROM bcv_database WHERE...
</pre>

<p>The "state" column usually contains an empty string. There are two
exceptions:

</p><ul><li>If the database has been created using sqlite3_bcvfs_copy() but
       not yet uploaded, then this column contains the text 'copied'.</li></ul>

<ul><li>If the database has been deleted using sqlite3_bcvfs_delete() but
       the delete operation has not yet uploaded, then this column contains the
       text 'deleted'.</li></ul>

<p>The bcv_database table is available in both daemon and daemonless
mode.

</p><p><b id="bcv_http_log">The bcv_http_log table:</b>

</p><p>The "bcv_http_log" table contains one row for each HTTP request made
by the VFS or connected daemon. It has the equivalent of the following
for a schema:

</p><pre>     CREATE TABLE bcv_http_log(
       id INTEGER,              -- Unique, monotonically increasing id value
       start_time TEXT,         -- Time request was made, as iso-8601
       end_time TEXT,           -- Time reply received, as iso-8601 (or NULL)
       method TEXT,             -- "PUT", "GET" etc.
       client TEXT,             -- Name of client that caused request
       logmsg TEXT,             -- Log message associated with request
       uri TEXT,                -- URI of request
       httpcode INTEGER         -- HTTP response code (e.g. 200)
     ) 
</pre>

<p>For those requests that can be associated with a single SQLite database
handle, the contents of the "client" column is the client name as
configured using the <a href="#pragma_bcv_client">PRAGMA bcv_client</a> command.
For requests associated with a prefetch operation, it contains the string
'prefetch'.

</p><p>To prevent it from consuming an ever-increasing amount of memory, entries 
are automatically removed from the bcv_http_log on a first-in/first-out
according to the values configured for the SQLITE_BCV_HTTPLOG_TIMEOUT 
and SQLITE_BCV_HTTPLOG_NENTRY parameters. Or, in daemon mode, according
to the values passed via the --httplogtimeout and --httplognentry 
command-line options.

</p><p>Including various overheads, each entry may be assumed to consume 
256 bytes of memory or less. So allowing 4096 entries to accumulate in
the bcv_http_log table may require up to 1MiB of memory.

</p><p><b>The bcv_kv table:</b>

</p><p>The schema of the "bcv_kv" table is:

</p><pre>    CREATE TABLE bcv_kv(
      name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- Key value 
      value                    -- Associated payload value
    )
</pre>

<p>Unlike the other two eponymous virtual tables described in this section, the
bcv_kv table is read-write. Applications may write arbitrary data to the table
to be stored in the cloud storage container. The table is empty when the
container is first created.

</p><p>The contents of the bcv_kv table is stored as a separate file (an
SQLite database) in the cloud container - "bcv_kv.bcv". 

</p><p>The bcv_kv table implements transaction-like properties. As follows:

</p><ul>
  <li> The first time in a database transaction that the bcv_kv table 
       is read or written, the file is downloaded from cloud storage and cached
       for the duration of the transaction. All user queries - read and write -
       are executed against this cached version of the bcv_kv table. This
       ensures that each transaction sees a consistent version of the table
       contents.
  </li><li> When a read/write transaction is committed, a new version of the bcv_kv
       table data is uploaded to cloud storage. At this point, if it is found
       that the file has been modified within cloud storage since it was
       downloaded at the beginning of the transaction (because some other
       client wrote to it), the commit fails and the transaction is rolled
       back. The extended error code in this case is SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT.
</li></ul>

<p>Because the entire bcv_kv table is downloaded (and, for write transactions,
uploaded) for each transaction, applications should avoid storing large
amounts of data within it.

</p><p><b id="bcv_kv_meta">The bcv_kv_meta table:</b>

</p><p>The schema of the "bcv_kv_meta" table is:

</p><pre>    CREATE TABLE bcv_kv_meta(
      name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- Header field name
      value                    -- Header field value
    )
</pre>

<p>The bcv_kv_meta table is similar to the bcv_kv table, in that querying it
causes cloudsqlite to download the bcv_kv.bcv database file and cache it
for the remainder of the transaction. Instead of providing read/write access
to the contents of the bcv_kv.bcv database, it provides read-only access
to two of the http headers recieved from the cloud storage server when the
file was downloaded - "Date" and "Last-Modified".

</p><p>The bcv_kv_meta table always contains exactly two rows. The first contains
the string 'date' in the "name" column, and the value of the timestamp from the
HTTP "Date:" header, in ISO-8601 format, in the "value" column. The second row
contains 'last-modified' in the "name" column, and the ISO-8601 equivalent
of the timestamp from the HTTP "Last-Modified:" header in "value".

</p><p>If, for some reason, the cloud storage server does not provide a "Date:" or
"Last-Modified:" header, or if the contents of that header cannot be parsed,
the corresponding "value" field in the bcv_kv_meta table is set to NULL.

</p><h2 id="commandline">6. Command Line Reference </h2>

</p>
<pre id="create_command"> blockcachevfsd <b>create</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> <i>CONTAINER</i></pre>
<div>
  <p> Create a new container and add an empty manifest file containing zero

  effectively deleting any databases currently stored in the container.
  </p><p> The following extra options are supported:
  </p><pre>      -blocksize BlOCK-SIZE
      -namebytes BLOCKID-SIZE
</pre>
  <p> The "-blocksize" option is used to set the size of each block file
  stored within cloud storage. The default size is 4MiB. If the argument
  is an integer value it is interpreted as a size in bytes. If an integer value
  followed by a 'k' or 'K' character, a size in KiB. Or, if the argument
  is an integer value followed by an 'm' or 'M' character, a size in MiB.
  The specified size must be a power of two in bytes. The following switches
  all serve to set the block-size to 2MiB: 
  </p><pre>      -blocksize 2M
      -blocksize 2048k
      -blocksize 2097152
</pre>
  <p> The "-namebytes" option may be passed an integer value between
  16 and 32, inclusive, to set the size in bytes of the block ids that

Oh, to one day reach and explore them, finally find out what is behind that blanket of darkness and light that keeps us sleeping and, sometimes, awake, for hours every day. It is that same belief and dream about the stars that brought many developers to create a universe that could be freely and fully explored. That same belief animated <a href="https://80.style/#/hsp">Alessandro Ghignola</a>, an Italian developer who, in 1996, began working on the first version of the space exploration simulator, <strong>Noctis</strong>. But, in reality, the work began <em>much</em> earlier.</p>
<p>Set in the Feltyrion galaxy – which is around 90 thousand light-years in radius – Noctis presents players with 78 billion stars to chart and explore, along with their accompanying planets, moons and other objects of interest. Each procedurally-generated world offers up its own climate, life forms and – most chillingly of all – ruined civilisations. The aim in Noctis isn't to 'win' as such; instead, players are expected to catalogue their findings as they explore the boundaries of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Speaking with Time Extension today, Ghignola reveals that he started toying on the Amiga with programs that would generate artificial landscapes. “<strong>Mercenary 2</strong> was the big title which changed my perspective since that title had a huge solar system, I thought, I’ll go bigger and build a whole galaxy," he remembers.</p>
<p>Work on the first version of Noctis started on MS-DOS, with Ghignola building a galaxy bigger than the milky way, while keeping the experience a little over 2 MB. "There were many limitations and difficulties, especially since each segment of code could not go beyond 640k of memory," the programmer recalls. For each version, he tried to experiment with features to see if it would maintain a stable framerate, like the reflection of the pilot in the spaceship window.</p>

<p>Only three years later, in 2000, Ghignola finally released Noctis to the public. "No one noticed the game though; I had very few visits to my Geocities homepage." This was the case until Noctis was discovered by the classic "abandonware" website <a href="https://www.homeoftheunderdogs.net/">Home of the Underdogs</a>. "That’s when I started having feedback from fans and speaking to them regularly; Noctis really came to life and started being its own thing." The community loved the sense of being alone in space, the desolation which came while staring into darkness and unknown worlds, but still being able to connect through early 2000s forums and chats.</p>
<p>This is also how one of the most unique features of Noctis, in its fourth version, came to be: the guide. "This is a little bit like an encyclopedia where players can note down the things they find exploring around on the planets: flora, fauna, sea, lakes," Ghignola says. "Despite being a community effort, it was not an online thing; instead, players emailed me their findings, and I would update the guide in each subsequent game’s version."</p>
<p>The guide would stop being updated only years later, in 2014, but by then, Ghignola had long stopped looking after Noctis. The game was instead being kept up to speed by its loving community, which had also released a version with bugfixes called <strong><a href="https://80.style/#/hsp">Noctis IV CE</a></strong> (or <strong>NICE</strong>). A fifth version of Noctis had been in the works for many years, designed for 32-bit systems and with weather effects and new features.</p>

<p>For <strong>Noctis V</strong>, Alessandro had also developed his very own programming language, called L.in.oleum. "It was a low-level programming language, perfectly fine for me, but honestly not that great anyway. In the end, after four versions, I stopped updating it since there were so many better alternatives out there, such as Python. I thought, why bother? I could release the source code if anyone is interested, but lacking instructions, I believe no one would think the struggle was worth it."</p>
<p>But that’s not the only interactive experience he worked on, there are many that have yet to see the light. Among these, he mentions <strong>Crystal Pixels.</strong> "It was all about telling my dreams to a computer; you had a little spaceship called The Fly that you could use to land on little pixel planets. you would find objects on those planets, such as lamps or boards to write on. You could even record your own soundtrack on CD in-game, and then play it back during exploration." He also developed <strong>Avatar</strong>, an update of the original <strong>Rogue</strong>, but mostly featuring animals waving guns around. "Utter chaos," is how he describes it.</p>
<p>Reaching Ghignola was no easy feat, nor was phoning him up to talk. Still, he was pretty happy to talk about Noctis, despite describing himself as totally isolated. "I’m one step away from being a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori">hikikomori</a>', I barely interact with human beings these days," The programmer mentions that he lost interest and still does not have the willpower to go back to Noctis V. "I was hit by a huge depression in the '90s – in some way, I’m still recovering. These days I just draw comics; I only do things when I’m drawn by passion and, unfortunately, I feel nothing towards going back to programming."</p>

<p>Regarding his depression, things were so bad that in 2001 he refused a possible job at Insomniac. "This happened after I started doing bug reports for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/ps1/spyro_2_riptos_rage">Spyro 2</a> and got in contact with Craig Stitt at Insomniac. I showed him an engine I was working on, and he invited me, mentioning the company could have a $6k job for me. I refused. I was having panic attacks even going to the next city; how could I ever transfer to California?" We contacted Craig Stitt, and he does remember something to that effect, even though he’s not sure about the job offer. "One thing is for sure: Spyro 2 definitely had a whole slew of bugs, so Alessandro had his hands full," comments Stitt.</p>
<p>While he doesn’t have regrets over the job, there is one thing Ghignola does regret: letting fans down. "I do remember promising several times that I would finish Noctis V and, still after all these years, I’ve never gone back. I’m sorry; I wish I had the strength to go back and finish what I started more than ten years ago."</p>
<p>Ghignola developed Noctis as a reflection of his dreams and exploring a desolate space, while being alone in the universe. Ironically, while now in the middle of his own (very real) isolation, Ghignola wonders how Noctis ended up bringing together people. "The community in Noctis found a way to connect even through isolation. In some way, out of my hands, Noctis became all about connecting with people, rather than escaping them, like I’ve been doing all my life."</p>
