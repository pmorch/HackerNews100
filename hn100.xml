And so one can only conclude that HawkEye’s surveillance support for Gulf dictatorships is not an anomaly, but rather a corporate extension of official U.S. foreign policy.</span></p><p><span>The full text of Hawkeye 360’s pitch to the Pentagon through the </span><a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/exclusive-inside-trident-spectre" rel="">Vulcan</a><span> contracting marketplace follows:</span></p><blockquote><p>(U//PROPIN) HawkEye 360 (HE360) operates the first-of-its-kind constellation of commercial satellites that can independently detect, identify, and geolocate radio-frequency (RF) signals to within 500 meters of their point of origin. Launched in December 2018, the first cluster of three spacecraft (known as the Pathfinder Cluster) has been fully operational since February of 2019. The software-defined radio (SDR) payload on all three spacecraft can be tuned to a wide range of different frequencies (144MHz-15GHz) and switched between several different RF front end and antenna paths. The HE360 Signal of Interest (SOI) library is the list of signals that can be geolocated by the company’s spacecraft. Common SOIs include UHF GMRS/FRS Push-to-talk Radios, VHF Radios, Automatic Identification System (AIS) EPIRB Emergency Radio Beacons, Cellular Towers, Satellite Phone, X-band Maritime Navigation Radars, Ku-band VSAT Terminals. Tools developed in-house by HE360 efficiently process this data in an integrated signal-processing and geo-engine to calculate and deliver information about myriad emitter types from around the planet.</p><p>(U//PROPIN) Additionally, HawkEye 360 satellites can detect RF signals in the GPS bands, as well as other GNSS systems, e.g. GLONASS. If detected by all three spacecraft, the RF energy from a GNSS interference can be geolocated to its point of origin using an adaptation of the company’s existing geolocation techniques. Due to the global coverage of the constellation, geolocation of GNSS jamming or spoofing can be conducted over denied areas without exposing airborne or terrestrial sensors or personnel to hostile conditions. Unlike electro optical sensors, RF geolocation provides data day and night in all weather conditions.</p><p>(U//PROPIN) HE360 Spectrum Awareness products can support multiple applications and mission areas; including theater indications and warning, pattern of life analysis; maritime domain awareness; illegal fishing identification; border monitoring, mapping communications nodes; and disaster response.</p><p>(U) HE360 data and products are entirely unclassified, providing theater intelligence officers with an unprecedented ability to share RF geolocations with tactical echelons and partner nations. HE360 data is easily accessible via a web interface, and is interoperable “out of the box” with all GIS, C4ISR, and mobile device systems.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></description>

  <div id="post_body_1136625"><p>A lot of people ask me what the ideal cofounder looks
like.&nbsp; I now have an answer: Greg Brockman.</p>

<p>Every successful startup I know has at least one person&nbsp;who
provides the force of will to make the startup happen. &nbsp;I’d thought a lot
about this in the abstract while advising YC startups, but until OpenAI I
hadn’t observed up close someone else drive the formation of a startup.</p>

<p>OpenAI wouldn’t have happened without Greg. &nbsp;He commits
quickly and fully to things. &nbsp;I organized a group dinner early on to talk about
what such an organization might look like, and drove him home afterwards.&nbsp;
Greg asked me questions for the first half of the drive back to San Francisco,
then declared he was in, and started planning logistics for the rest of the
drive.</p>

<p>From then on he was fully in, with an average email response
time of about 5 minutes to anything.&nbsp; Elon and I were both busy with day
jobs, but Greg kept everything moving forward with imperfect information and a
very high-latency connection.</p>

<p>He recruited the founding team. &nbsp;Greg is a world-class recruiter
(he plans every detail of interviews, heavily researches candidate’s
backgrounds, sends thoughtful and persistent followups, and so on), and&nbsp;I
now believe even more strongly that someone on the founding team has to be an
amazing recruiter.</p>

<p>He’s incredibly open to feedback.&nbsp; Large or small, he’s
always willing to hear it, never gets offended, and processes it very
quickly.&nbsp; I once suggested to him that he wasn't communicating a bold
enough vision for the organization, and&nbsp;the next time I heard him talk
about it (and every time since) it was&nbsp;a perfectly calibrated explanation
of how we were going to succeed at something that really mattered.&nbsp; Even
on non-traditional ideas, like when I suggested he co-lead the organization with
Ilya, he was always open-minded and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Greg also played the role of ‘non-technical cofounder’, which is
a misnomer because most people who know him will say something like “Greg is
the most productive engineer I know”.&nbsp; But he took on all the
non-technical roles at the beginning, defining the culture, making offers,
organizing offsites, letting everyone work out of his apartment, ordering
supplies, cleaning up after meals, etc.&nbsp; It's important to have someone
great in this role at a small startup—many people gloss over it.</p>

<p>Without someone dedicated to finding a solution to all problems,
no matter how difficult, eventually a large problem will come along and kill you while you’re
still weak.&nbsp; Founding teams need a Chief
Optimist to rally everyone to press on despite the difficulties, and it’s always hard on that
person because they can’t really lean on anyone else in the hardest times.</p>

<p>You for sure need great technical talent on a founding team, but
make sure you also have someone like Greg.&nbsp; If they’re the same person,
then you’ve hit the jackpot.</p></div>

<p>On Friday, OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/11/openai-fires-ceo-sam-altman-citing-less-than-candid-communications/">fired CEO Sam Altman</a> in a surprise move that led to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-president-greg-brockman-quits-as-nervous-employees-hold-all-hands-meeting/">resignation</a> of President Greg Brockman and <a href="https://x.com/hellokillian/status/1725797467315486902?s=20">three senior scientists</a>. The move also blindsided key investor and minority owner Microsoft, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-18/openai-altman-ouster-followed-debates-between-altman-board#xj4y7vzkg">reportedly</a> making CEO Satya Nadella furious. As Friday night wore on, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/before-openai-ousted-altman-employees-disagreed-over-ai-safety">reports emerged</a> that the ousting was likely orchestrated by Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever over concerns about the safety and speed of OpenAI's tech deployment.</p>

<p>"This was the board doing its duty to the mission of the nonprofit, which is to make sure that OpenAI builds AGI that benefits all of humanity," Sutskever told employees at an emergency all-hands meeting on Friday afternoon, as reported by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/before-openai-ousted-altman-employees-disagreed-over-ai-safety">The Information</a>.</p>
<p>Since its founding, OpenAI has pursued the development of artificial general intelligence (or AGI), which is a hypothetical technology that would be able to perform any intellectual task a human can do, potentially replacing a large number of humans at their jobs.</p>
<p>Internally at OpenAI, insiders say that disagreements had emerged over the speed at which Altman was pushing for commercialization and company growth, with Sutskever arguing to slow things down. Sources <a href="https://x.com/karaswisher/status/1725702612379378120?s=20">told</a> reporter Kara Swisher that OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">Dev Day event</a> on November 6, with Altman front and center in a keynote pushing consumer-like products, was an "inflection moment of Altman pushing too far, too fast."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/gdb/status/1725736242137182594?s=20">joint statement</a> released Friday night, Altman and Brockman said they were "shocked and saddened" by the board's actions. And they weren't the only ones shocked by the news, as tech insiders took to social media on Friday to share their reactions. Angel investor Ron Conway <a href="https://x.com/RonConway/status/1725759359748309381?s=20">wrote</a>, "What happened at OpenAI today is a Board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs. It is shocking; it is irresponsible; and it does not do right by Sam &amp; Greg or all the builders in OpenAI."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>OpenAI has an <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure">unusual structure</a> where its for-profit arm is owned and controlled by a non-profit 501(c)(3) public charity. Prior to yesterday, that non-profit was controlled by a board of directors that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/11/17/these-are-the-people-that-fired-openai-ceo-sam-altman/">included</a> Altman, Brockman, Ilya Sutskever and three others who were not OpenAI employees: Adam D’Angelo, the CEO of Quora; Tasha McCauley, an adjunct senior management scientist at RAND corporation; and Helen Toner, director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Now, only Sutskever, D'Angelo, McCauley, and Toner remain.</p>

<h2>Surprise moves and turmoil</h2>
<p>According to the joint statement from Brockman and Altman, Altman's firing came as a complete surprise to the pair, and they laid out a rough timeline of what happened. On Thursday night, Altman was asked to attend a remote board meeting on Friday at noon. The next day, Brockman, who was Chairman of the OpenAI board, was not invited to this board meeting, where Altman was fired.</p>

<p>Around 30 minutes later, Brockman was informed by Sutskever that he was being removed from his board role but could remain at the company, and that Altman had been fired (Brockman declined, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-president-greg-brockman-quits-as-nervous-employees-hold-all-hands-meeting/">resigned</a> his role later on Friday). According to Brockman, the OpenAI management team was only made aware of these moves shortly after the fact, but former CTO (now interim CEO) Mira Murati had been informed on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Key questions remain about accusations made against Altman in the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition">OpenAI blog post</a> that announced his departure, where the board said that Altman "was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities." That has yet to be clarified by the company, but insiders say the move was mostly a power play that resulted from a cultural schism between Altman and Sutskever over Altman's <a href="https://x.com/karaswisher/status/1725733594310512775?s=20">management style</a> and drive for high-profile publicity. On September 29, Sutskever <a href="https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1707752576077176907?s=20">tweeted</a>, "Ego is the enemy of growth."</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1258459514-scaled.jpg" data-height="1707" data-width="2560" alt="Sam Altman and Ilya Sutskever speak together at Tel Aviv University on June 5, 2023."><img alt="Sam Altman and Ilya Sutskever speak together at Tel Aviv University on June 5, 2023." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1258459514-640x427.jpg" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1258459514-1280x853.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1258459514-scaled.jpg" data-height="1707" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Sam Altman and Ilya Sutskever speak together at Tel Aviv University on June 5, 2023.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The schism is causing further turmoil on the inside. Three AI researchers loyal to Altman departed the company as well on Friday, resigning in reaction to the news: Jakub Pachocki, GPT-4 lead and OpenAI's director of research; Aleksander Madry, head of a team evaluating AI risk, and Szymon Sidor, an open source baselines researcher.</p>
<h2>Pushing back the "veil of ignorance"</h2>
<p>Rumors have already begun swirling about potential internal breakthroughs at OpenAI that may have intensified the slow/fast rift within the company, owing to Sutskever's role as co-lead of a "<a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment">Superalignment</a>" team that is tasked with figuring out how to control hypothetical superintelligent AI. At the APEC CEO Summit on Thursday, Altman <a href="https://x.com/thecaptain_nemo/status/1725743009629983215?s=20">said</a>, "Four times now in the history of OpenAI—the most recent time was just in the last couple of weeks—I’ve gotten to be in the room when we push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward. And getting to do that is like the professional honor of a lifetime."</p>

<p>The concern here not necessarily being that OpenAI has developed superintelligence, which experts say is unlikely, but that the new breakthrough Altman mentioned may have added pressure to a company that is fighting within itself to proceed safely (from its non-profit branch) but also make money (from its for-profit subsidiary). Altman also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/11/openai-ceo-sam-altman-wants-to-build-ai-superintelligence/">recently said</a> that GPT-5, presumed to be a powerful successor to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-checked-to-see-whether-gpt-4-could-take-over-the-world/">alarm-causing GPT-4</a>, is now in development.</p>
<p>As news spread, some predictably shared quips on social media. X user shaurya <a href="https://x.com/shauseth/status/1725757968619278587?s=20">wrote</a>, "this is like the roman empire for people who do matrix multiplication." And AI futurist Daniel Jeffries <a href="https://x.com/Dan_Jeffries1/status/1725807257772872062?s=20">said</a>, "<span>The entire AI industry would like to thank the OpenAI board for giving us all a chance to catch up.</span>"</p>
<p>But not all reactions were doom and gloom. As Friday night wore on, some at OpenAI made forward-looking statements. Evan Morikawa, Engineering Manager at OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/E0M/status/1725721507161395415?s=20">wrote on X</a>, "For those wondering what’ll happen next, the answer is we’ll keep shipping. @sama &amp; @gdb weren’t micro-managers.

<p>Expect to hear more on the OpenAI board's side of the story as further details emerge.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Computer scientist and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/geoffrey-hinton-profile-ai">“godfather of AI”</a> Geoff Hinton says this about chatbots:</p>
<blockquote><p>“People say, It’s just glorified autocomplete . . . Now, let’s analyze that. Suppose you want to be really good at predicting the next word. If you want to be really good, you have to understand what’s being said. That’s the only way. So by training something to be really good at predicting the next word, you’re actually forcing it to understand. Yes, it’s ‘autocomplete’—but you didn’t think through what it means to have a really good autocomplete.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This got me thinking about what I do at work, for example in a research meeting.  I spend a lot of time doing “glorified autocomplete” in the style of a well-trained chatbot:  Someone describes some problem, I listen and it reminds me of a related issue I’ve thought about before, and I’m acting as a sort of FAQ, but more like a chatbot than a FAQ in that the people who are talking with me do not need to navigate through the FAQ to find the answer that is most relevant to them; I’m doing that myself and giving a response.</p>
<p>I do that sort of thing a lot in meetings, and it can work well, indeed often I think this sort of shallow, associative response can be more effective than whatever I’d get from a direct attack on the problem in question.  After all, the people I’m talking with have already thought for awhile about whatever it is they’re working on, and my initial thoughts may well be in the wrong direction, or else my thoughts are in the right direction but are just retracing my collaborators’ past ideas.  From the other direction, my shallow thoughts can be useful in representing insights from problems that these collaborators had not ever thought about much before.  Nonspecific suggestions on multilevel modeling or statistical graphics or simulation or whatever can really help!</p>
<p>At some point, though, I’ll typically have to bite the bullet and think hard, not necessarily reaching full understanding in the sense of mentally embedding the problem at hand into a coherent schema or logical framework, but still going through whatever steps of logical reasoning that I can.  This feels different than autocomplete; it requires an additional level of focus.  Often I need to consciously “flip the switch,” as it were, to turn on that focus and think rigorously.  Other times, I’m doing autocomplete and either come to a sticking point or encounter an interesting idea, and this causes me to stop and think.</p>
<p>It’s almost like the difference between jogging and running.  I can jog and jog and jog, thinking about all sorts of things and not feeling like I’m expending much effort, my legs pretty much move up and down of their own accort . . . but then if I need to <em>run</em>, that takes concentration.</p>
<p>Here’s another example.  Yesterday I participated in the methods colloquium in our political science department.  It was Don Green and me and a bunch of students, and the structure was that Don asked me questions, I responded with various statistics-related and social-science-related musings and stories, students followed up with questions, I responded with more stories, etc.  Kinda like the way things go here on the blog, but spoken rather than typed.  Anyway, the point is that most of my responses were a sort of autocomplete—not in a word-by-word chatbot style, more at a larger level of chunkiness, for example something would remind me of a story, and then I’d just insert the story into my conversation—but still at this shallow, pleasant level.  Mellow conversation with no intellectual or social strain.  But then, every once in awhile, I’d pull up short and have some new thought, some juxtaposition that had never occurred to me before, and I’d need to think things through.</p>
<p>This also happens when I give prepared talks.  My prepared talks are not super-well prepared—this is on purpose, as I find that too much preparation can inhibit flow.  In any case, I’ll often finding myself stopping and pausing to reconsider something or another.  Even when describing something I’ve done before, there are times when I feel the need to think it all through logically, as if for the first time.  I noticed something similar when I saw my sister give a talk once:  she had the same habit of pausing to work things out from first principles.  I don’t see this behavior in every academic talk, though; different people have different styles of presentation.</p>
<p>This seems related to models of associative and logical reasoning in psychology.  As a complete non-expert in that area, I’ll turn <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory">to wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The foundations of dual process theory likely come from William James. He believed that there were two different kinds of thinking: associative and true reasoning. . . . images and thoughts would come to mind of past experiences, providing ideas of comparison or abstractions. He claimed that associative knowledge was only from past experiences describing it as “only reproductive”. James believed that true reasoning could enable overcoming “unprecedented situations” . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds about right!</p>
<p>After describing various other theories from the past hundred years or so, Wikipedia continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Daniel Kahneman provided further interpretation by differentiating the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning in 2003. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds a bit different from what I was talking about above.  When I’m doing “glorified autocomplete” thinking, I’m still <em>thinking</em>—this isn’t automatic and barely conscious behavior along the lines of driving to work along a route I’ve taken a hundred times before—; I’m just thinking in a shallow way, trying to “autocomplete” the answer.  It’s pattern-matching more than it is logical reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong>  Just to be clear, I have a lot of respect for Hinton’s work; indeed, Aki and I included Hinton’s work in our brief review of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://news.columbia.edu/news/top-10-ideas-statistics-ai">10 pathbreaking research articles during the past 50 years of statistics and machine learning</a>.  Also, I’m not trying to make a hardcore, AI-can’t-think argument.  Although not myself a user of large language models, I respect <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/08/20/report-on-the-large-language-model-meeting-at-berkeley/">Bob Carpenter’s respect</a> for them.</p>
<p>I think that where Hinton got things wrong in the quote that led off this post was not in his characterization of chatbots, but rather in his assumptions about human thinking, in not distinguishing autocomplete-like associative reasoning with logical thinking.  Maybe Hinton’s problem in understanding this is that he’s just too logical!  At work, I do a lot of what seems like autocomplete—and, as I wrote above, I think it’s useful—but if I had more discipline, maybe I’d think more logically and carefully all the time.  It could well be that Hinton has that habit or inclination to always be in focus.  If Hinton does not have consistent personal experience of shallow, autocomplete-like thinking, he might not recognize it as something different, in which case he could be giving the chatbot credit for something it’s not doing.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, one thing that impresses me about Bob is that, when he’s working, he seems to always be on focus.  I’ll be in a meeting, just coasting along, and Bob will interrupt someone to ask for clarification, and I suddenly realize that Bob absolutely <em>demands</em> understanding.  He seems to have no interest in participating in a research meeting in a shallow way.  I guess we just have different styles.  It’s my impression that the vast majority of researchers are like me, just coasting on the surface most of the time (for some people, all of the time!), while Bob, and maybe Geoff Hinton, is one of the exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong>  Sometimes we really want to be doing shallow, auto-complete-style thinking.  For example, if we’re <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/06/13/world-premiere-performance-of-recursion-is-tonight/">writing a play</a> and want to simulate how some characters might interact.  Or just as a way of casting the intellectual net more widely.  When I’m in a research meeting and I free-associate, it might not help immediately solve the problem at hand, but it can bring in connections that will be helpful later.  So I’m not knocking auto-complete; I’m just disagreeing with Hinton’s statement that “by training something to be really good at predicting the next word, you’re actually forcing it to understand.”  As a person who does a lot of useful associative reasoning and also a bit of logical understanding, I think they’re different, both in how they feel and also in what they do.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        
            <p><span>W</span>e all know to be careful about the details we share online, but the information we seek can also be revealing. Search for driving directions, and our location becomes far easier to guess. Check for a password in a trove of compromised data, and we risk leaking it ourselves.</p><p>These situations fuel a key question in cryptography: How can you pull information from a public database without revealing anything about what you’ve accessed? It’s the equivalent of checking out a book from the library without the librarian knowing which one.</p>
      
    <p>Concocting a strategy that solves this problem—known as private information retrieval—is “a very useful building block in a number of privacy-preserving applications,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dwu4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Wu</a>, a cryptographer at the University of Texas, Austin. Since the 1990s, researchers have chipped away at the question, improving strategies for privately accessing databases. One major goal, still impossible with large databases, is the equivalent of a private Google search, where you can sift through a heap of data anonymously without doing any heavy computational lifting.</p><blockquote>
<p>It would be like having a librarian scour every shelf before returning with your book.</p>
</blockquote>
          <p>Now, three researchers have&nbsp;<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crafted</a>&nbsp;a long-sought version of private information retrieval and extended it to build a more general privacy strategy. The work, which received a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Paper Award</a>&nbsp;in June at the annual&nbsp;<a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Symposium on Theory of Computing</a>, topples a major theoretical barrier on the way to a truly private search.</p><p>“[This is] something in cryptography that I guess we all wanted but didn’t quite believe that it exists,” said&nbsp;<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vinod Vaikuntanathan</a>, a cryptographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the paper. “It is a landmark result.”</p><p>The problem of private database access took shape in the 1990s. At first, researchers assumed that the only solution was to scan the entire database during every search, which would be like having a librarian scour every shelf before returning with your book. After all, if the search skipped any section, the librarian would know that your book is not in that part of the library.</p><p>That approach works well enough at smaller scales, but as the database grows, the time required to scan it grows at least proportionally. As you read from bigger databases—and the internet is a pretty big one—the process becomes prohibitively inefficient.</p>
          <p>In the early 2000s, researchers started to suspect they could dodge the full-scan barrier by “preprocessing” the database. Roughly, this would mean encoding the whole database as a special structure, so the server could answer a query by reading just a small portion of that structure. Careful enough preprocessing could, in theory, mean that a single server hosting information only goes through the process once, by itself, allowing all future users to grab information privately without any more effort.</p><p>For&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/wichs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Wichs</a>, a cryptographer at Northeastern University and a co-author of the new paper, that seemed too good to be true. Around 2011, he started trying to prove that this kind of scheme was impossible. “I was convinced that there’s no way that this could be done,” he said.</p><p>But in 2017, two groups of researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">results</a>&nbsp;that changed his mind. They built the first programs that could do this kind of private information retrieval, but they weren’t able to show that the programs were secure. (Cryptographers demonstrate a system’s security by showing that breaking it is as difficult as solving some hard problem. The researchers weren’t able to compare it to a canonical hard problem.)</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="286" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Goldberg_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=png&amp;h=366&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Goldberg_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Goldberg_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Goldberg_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>SEARCHING IN THE DARK:</strong> From left: Wei-Kai Lin, Ethan Mook, and Daniel Wichs devised a new method for privately searching large databases. <em>Courtesy of Ian MacLellan and Khoury College of Computer Sciences/Northeastern University.</em></figcaption></figure>
          <p>So even with his hope renewed, Wichs assumed that any version of these programs that was secure was still a long way off. Instead, he and his co-authors—<a href="https://weikailin.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wei-Kai Lin</a>, now at the University of Virginia, and&nbsp;<a href="https://ethanmook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethan Mook</a>, also at Northeastern—worked on problems they thought would be easier, which involved cases where multiple servers host the database.</p><p>In the methods they studied, the information in the database can be transformed into a mathematical expression, which the servers can evaluate to extract the information. The authors figured it might be possible to make that evaluation process more efficient. They toyed with an idea from 2011, when other researchers had found a way to quickly evaluate such an expression by preprocessing it, creating special, compact tables of values that allow you to skip the normal evaluation steps.</p><p>That method didn’t produce any improvements, and the group came close to giving up—until they wondered whether this tool might actually work in the coveted single-server case. Choose a polynomial carefully enough, they saw, and a single server could preprocess it based on the 2011 result—yielding the secure, efficient lookup scheme Wichs had pondered for years. Suddenly, they’d solved the harder problem after all.</p><p>At first, the authors didn’t believe it. “Let’s figure out what’s wrong with this,” Wichs remembered thinking. “We kept trying to figure out where it breaks down.”</p>
          <p>But the solution held: They had really discovered a secure way to preprocess a single-server database so anyone could pull information in secret. “It’s really beyond everything we had hoped for,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://yuvali.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuval Ishai</a>, a cryptographer at the Technion in Israel who was not involved in this work. It’s a result “we were not even brave enough to ask for,” he said.</p><blockquote>
<p>Cryptographers have a long history of results that were initially impractical.</p>
</blockquote><p>After building their secret lookup scheme, the authors turned to the real-world goal of a private internet search, which is more complicated than pulling bits of information from a database, Wichs said. The private lookup scheme on its own does allow for a version of private Google-like searching, but it’s extremely labor-intensive: You run Google’s algorithm yourself and secretly pull data from the internet when necessary. Wichs said a true search, where you send a request and sit back while the server collects the results, is really a target for a broader approach known as homomorphic encryption, which disguises data so that someone else can manipulate it without ever knowing anything about it.</p><p>Typical homomorphic encryption strategies would hit the same snag as private information retrieval, plodding through all the internet’s contents for every search. But using their private lookup method as scaffolding, the authors constructed a new scheme which runs computations that are more like the programs we use every day, pulling information covertly without sweeping the whole internet. That would provide an efficiency boost for internet searches and any programs that need quick access to data.</p>
          <p>While homomorphic encryption is a useful extension of the private lookup scheme, Ishai said, he sees private information retrieval as the more fundamental problem. The authors’ solution is the “magical building block,” and their homomorphic encryption strategy is a natural follow-up.</p><p>For now, neither scheme is practically useful: Preprocessing currently helps at the extremes, when the database size balloons toward infinity. But actually deploying it means those savings can’t materialize, and the process would eat up too much time and storage space.</p><p>Luckily, Vaikuntanathan said, cryptographers have a long history of optimizing results that were initially impractical. If future work can streamline the approach, he believes private lookups from giant databases may be within reach. “We all thought we were kind of stuck there,” he said. “What Daniel’s result gives is hope.”</p><p><em>This article was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cryptographers-devise-an-approach-for-total-search-privacy-20231106/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally published</a>&nbsp;on the</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/abstractions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quanta Abstractions</a><em>&nbsp;blog.&nbsp;</em></p>

The uncertainty is a bit alarming.<p>What is still very unclear is what removing Altman protects or preserves about the integrity of OpenAI and its work.

	<div>
		<p>Some of us in the GTK team have spent the last month or so exploring the world of linux kernel graphics apis, in particular, dmabufs. We are coming back from this adventure with some frustrations and some successes.</p>
<h3>What is a dmabuf?</h3>
<p>A dmabuf is a memory buffer in kernel space that is identified by a file descriptor. The idea is that you don’t have to copy lots of pixel data around, and instead just pass a file descriptor between kernel subsystems.</p>
<p>Reality is of course more complicated that this rosy picture: the memory may be device memory that is not accessible in the same way as ‘plain’ memory, and there may be more than one buffer (and more than one file descriptor), since graphics data is often split into planes (e.g. RGB and A may be separate, or Y and UV).</p>
<h3>Why are dmabufs useful?</h3>
<p>I’ve already mentioned that we hope to avoid copying the pixel data and feeding it through the GTK compositing pipeline (and with 4k video, that can be quite a bit of data for each frame).</p>
<p>The use cases where this kind of optimization matters are those where frequently changing content is displayed for a long time, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Video players</li>
<li>Virtual machines</li>
<li>Streaming</li>
<li>Screencasting</li>
<li>Games</li>
</ul>
<p>In the best case, we may be able to avoid feeding the data through the compositing pipeline of the compositor as well, if the compositor supports <em>direct scanout</em> and the dmabuf is suitable for it.&nbsp; In particular on mobile systems, this may avoid using the GPU altogether, thereby reducing power consumption.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>GTK has already been using dmabufs since 4.0: When composing a frame, GTK translates all the render nodes (typically several for each widget) into GL commands, sends those to the GPU, and mesa then exports the resulting texture as a dmabuf and attaches it to our Wayland surface.</p>
<p>But if the only thing that is changing in your UI is the video content that is already in a dmabuf, it would be nice to avoid the detour through GL and just hand the data directly to the compositor, by giving it the file descriptor for the the dmabuf.</p>
<p>Wayland has the concept of subsurfaces that let applications defer some of their compositing needs to the compositor: The application attaches a buffer to each (sub)surface, and it is the job of the compositor to combine them all together.</p>
<p>With what is now in git main, GTK will create subsurfaces as-needed in order to pass dmabufs directly to the compositor. We can do this in two different ways: If nothing is drawn on top of the dmabuf (no rounded corners, or overlaid controls), then we can stack the subsurface above the main surface without changing any of the visuals.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above.png" alt="" width="525" height="675" srcset="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above.png 525w, https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above-233x300.png 233w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 85vw, 525px"></a>This is the ideal case, since it enables the compositor to set up <em>direct</em> <em>scanout, </em>which gives us a zero-copy path from the video decoder to the display.</p>
<p>If there is content that gets drawn on top of the video, we may not be able to get that, but we can still get the benefit of letting the compositor do the compositing, by placing the subsurface with the video <em>below</em> the main surface and poking a translucent hole in the main surface to let it peek through.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below.png" alt="" width="625" height="675" srcset="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below.png 625w, https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below-278x300.png 278w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></a>The round play button is what forces the subsurface to be placed below the main surface here.</p>
<p>GTK picks these modes automatically and transparently for each frame, without the application developer having to do anything. Once that play button appears in a frame, we place the subsurface below, and once the video is clipped by rounded corners, we stop offloading altogether. Of course, the advantages of offloading also disappear.</p>
<p>The graphics offload visualization in the GTK inspector shows these changes as they happen:</p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-9664-1" width="840" height="660" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/webm" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/offload-visualization.webm?_=1"><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/offload-visualization.webm">https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/offload-visualization.webm</a></video></p>
<p>Initially, the camera stream is not offloaded because the rounded corners clip it. The magenta outline indicates that the stream is offloaded to a subsurface below the main surface (because the video controls are on top of it). The golden outline indicates that the subsurface is above the main surface.</p>
<h3>How do you use this?</h3>
<p>GTK 4.14 will introduce a <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.GraphicsOffload.html">GtkGraphicsOffload</a> widget, whose only job it is to give a hint that GTK should try to <em>offload</em> the content of its child widget by attaching it to a subsurface instead of letting GSK process it like it usually does.</p>
<p>To create suitable content for offloading, the new <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gdk4/class.DmabufTextureBuilder.html">GdkDmabufTextureBuilder</a> wraps dmabufs in GdkTexture objects. Typical sources for dmabufs are pipewire, video4linux or gstreamer. The dmabuf support in gstreamer will be much more solid in the upcoming 1.24 release.</p>
<p>When testing this code, we used the GtkMediaStream implementation for pipewire by Georges Basile Stavracas Neto that can be found in <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pipewire-media-stream">pipewire-media-stream</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libmks/">libmks</a> by Christian Hergert and Bilal Elmoussaoui.</p>
<h3>What are the limitations?</h3>
<p>At the moment, graphics offload will only work with Wayland on Linux. There is some hope that we may be able to implement similar things on MacOS, but for now, this is Wayland-only. It also depends on the content being in dmabufs.</p>
<p>Applications that want to take advantage of this need to play along and avoid doing things that interfere with the use of subsurfaces, such as rounding the corners of the video content. The <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.GraphicsOffload.html">GtkGraphicsOffload</a> docs have more details for developers on constraints and how to debug problems with graphics offload.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The GTK 4.14 release will have some interesting new capabilities for media playback. You can try it now, with the just-released 4.13.3 snapshot.</p>
<p>Please try it and let us know what does and doesn’t work for you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>When people think of <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/28/ftc-must-free-american-workers-consumers-entrepreneurs-non-compete-agreements-politics-labor-john-arensmeyer/" target="_self" rel="">noncompete agreements</a>, they usually think of corporate executives with knowledge of prized trade secrets, whose lavish pay packages often come with a condition that if they quit or get fired, they <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/23/doctors-hospitals-noncompete-ftc-proposed-rule/" target="_self" rel="">can’t go work for an industry rival</a>.</p><div>



<p>More and more, though, employers are requiring regular workers to sign those deals. About 1 in 5 American workers, nearly 30 million people, are bound by noncompete agreements,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/non-compete-clause-rulemaking#:~:text=Overview,from%20pursuing%20better%20employment%20opportunities." target="_self" rel="">according</a>&nbsp;to the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>Horror stories about companies using noncompete agreements to trap workers in middling jobs or punish them for taking their skills elsewhere for better pay prompted New York legislators to pass a bill last June that would ban noncompete agreements.</p>



<p>Five months later, though, Gov. Kathy Hochul hasn’t said whether she intends to sign the legislation, which has come under a fierce attack by business groups.</p>



<p>The Public Policy Institute of the State of New York, an affiliate of the Business Council of New York, launched a $1 million ad campaign last month in an attempt to thwart the legislation. Some of the loudest opposition has come from Wall Street, where firms see noncompete agreements as important to protecting investment strategies and keeping highly-paid workers from walking out with valuable inside information.</p>



<p>Supporters of the ban say <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/15/heres-what-chros-actually-think-about-the-potential-ban-on-noncompetes/" target="_self" rel="">it would help people</a> like lighting designer Richard Tatum, a New York City resident who had signed a noncompete agreement and spent a year fighting a former employer in court after they sued him for getting another job shortly after they laid him off in 2009. He had a family to support and wasn’t moving or leaving his industry, he said.</p>



<p>“I felt I had no choice but to fight,” said Tatum, who now works for an event production company. He said he understands being fired during the financial meltdown. “But the fact that I had to spend a year fighting off my former employer was just wrong.”</p>



<p>A handful of states, including California, already ban noncompete agreements. Other states, including Minnesota and Oklahoma, have laws that void noncompete agreements if a person is laid off.</p>



<p>The Federal Trade Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-technology-politics-business-9fb699837e8bf8ecd9c70dcf27699dcf" target="_self" rel="">proposed a regulation</a>&nbsp;in January banning noncompete agreements, arguing that they hurt workers. President Joe Biden said at the time that the agreements “block millions of retail workers, construction workers and other working folks from taking better jobs and getting better pay and benefits in the same field.”</p>



<p>If signed by Hochul, a Democrat, the New York bill would only affect noncompete agreements signed after the law goes into effect. The legislation would not restrict nondisclosure agreements.</p>



<p>Hochul’s office said she’s still reviewing the legislation. She has until the end of the year to make a decision.</p>



<p>Business groups say the ban shouldn’t apply to certain industries and job levels, like top executives or partners in tech companies or law firms. They also said it could push employers to ship jobs to states like Florida and Texas that do not have similar laws.</p>



<p>“This bill poses a serious risk to innovation and job growth and, if enacted, could unravel the delicate balance between protecting business investment and fostering a competitive job market,” said Paul Zuber, the executive vice president for the Business Council of New York.</p>



<p>Advocates for the bill argue that striking noncompete agreements will actually be good for innovation.</p>



<p>State Senator Sean Ryan, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, pointed to Silicon Valley in California, a hub for tech companies.</p>



<p>“All the flexibility you see in that economy would have been dashed had they made it so you couldn’t go work for an emerging tech company,” Ryan said.</p>



<p>The bill, he added, would give employees more flexibility and agency when considering other employment opportunities.</p>



<p>Tatum, the lighting designer who reached a legal settlement with his former employer to keep working in his profession, said, “I just don’t think anyone like me should have to go through that again.”</p></div><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get the CEO perspective on the biggest headlines in business. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=ceo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-wrapper" tabindex="-1">
            


<p>Welcome back, calibre users. It has been a year since calibre
6.0. The headline new feature is <b>notes for authors, series, tags, etc.</b>
calibre can now store notes with links, images and rich text formatting associated
with every author, series, publisher, tag, etc. The notes are searchable, browseable,
linkable and can be exported as standalone HTML files.
</p>

<p>To use the new <i>Notes</i> feature, right click (or <code>Ctrl+click</code> on macOS) on 
an author or tag in the <i>Tag browser</i> or <i>Book details</i> panel and <i>Edit notes</i>.
</p>

<ul id="feature-list">
    <li>
        <span>Category notes</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            You can store notes associated with an author, publisher, series, et cetera,
            in your calibre library. To do so right click (or <code>Ctrl+click</code> on macOS) on
            an author or tag name in the <i>Tag browser</i> or <i>Book details</i> panel and
            choose <i>Edit notes</i>. Once you have created the note, a little pencil icon
            will show next to the name in the book details panel. You can click the
            pencil to view the note.
            </p>

            <p>
            You can browse and search through all notes in your library by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+N</code>
            or adding the <i>Browse notes</i> tool to the toolbar via <i>Preferences-&gt;Toolbars &amp; menus</i>.
            </p>

            <p><a title="The notes display window" href="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/notes-show.webp"><img src="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/notes-show-thumb.webp" alt="First"></a>

    <li>
        <span>Audio EPUB books in the E-book viewer</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            calibre has gained support for so called "Audio EPUB" books. Typically,
            these are books that have a pre-recorded voice reading the text. Freely downloadable
            examples of such books are available at: <a title="Read Beyond books" href="https://www.readbeyond.it/ebooks.html">Read Beyond books</a>.
            When reading such a book, clicking the <i>Read Aloud</i> button in the
            viewer will automatically use the embedded audio in the book to read the text
            aloud, marking the currently read sentence and showing progress. Note that
            this may not work on Linux because of issues with patented codecs, but works on
            Windows and macOS.
            </p>

            <p><a title="Read aloud playing embedded audio" href="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/audio-epub.webp"><img src="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/audio-epub-thumb.webp" alt="First"></a>

        </div>

    </li>

    <li>
        <span>Store extra data files associated with any book</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            A long requested feature in calibre, was the ability to store "data" files associated with a book
            and have calibre manage them automatically. This is finally available. Extra data files can be
            added to a book by selecting the book, right clicking the <i>Add books</i> button and choosing
            <i>Add data files to selected book records</i>. You can also manage the data files by right clicking
            the <i>Edit metadata</i> button and choosing <i>Manage data files</i>. The data files are simple
            files stored in the <code>data</code> sub-folder inside the book's folder. A common use for such
            files is storing alternate covers or supplementary material associated with the book.
            </p>

            <p><a title="Managing data files" href="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/data-files.webp"><img src="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/data-files-thumb.webp" alt="First"></a>

        </div>
    </li>


    <li>
        <span>calibre's own private Recycle Bin</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            calibre now has its own private Recycle Bin instead of using the
            operating system one. This means that it is now possible undo the
            deletion of a book with a single click, restoring all its files and
            metadata automatically. Indeed when you delete a book calibre will
            show an unobtrusive popup offering to undo the deletion for a few
            seconds. You can also browse recently deleted books by right
            clicking the <i>Remove books</i> button and choosing <i>Restore
            recently deleted</i>.
            </p>

            <p><a title="Restoring recently deleted books" href="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/undo-delete.webp"><img src="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/undo-delete-thumb.webp" alt="First"></a>
            </p>

        </div>
    </li>

</ul>

<hr>

<p>This is an appropriate time to throw out a big thank you to the calibre
community who have contributed selflessly of their energy and enthusiasm —
without which many of the features above would never have seen the light of
day.</p>

<p>Note that some of these features were actually introduced during the
lifetime of the 6.x series. This document describes new features as compared
to 6.0</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content--body"><div> <p>Ilya Sutskever, head bowed, is deep in thought. His arms are spread wide and his fingers are splayed on the tabletop like a concert pianist about to play his first notes. We sit in silence.</p>  <p>I’ve come to meet Sutskever, OpenAI’s cofounder and chief scientist, in his company’s&nbsp;unmarked office building on an unremarkable street in the Mission District of San Francisco to hear what’s next for the world-tilting technology he has had a big hand in bringing about. I also want to know what’s next for him—in particular, why building the next generation of his company’s flagship generative models is no longer the focus of his work.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>Instead of building the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/14/1069823/gpt-4-is-bigger-and-better-chatgpt-openai/">next GPT</a> or <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1049061/dalle-openai-gpt3-ai-agi-multimodal-image-generation/">image maker DALL-E</a>, Sutskever tells me his new priority is to figure out how to stop an artificial superintelligence (a hypothetical future technology he sees coming with the foresight of a true believer) from going rogue.</p>  <p>Sutskever tells me a lot of other things too. He thinks <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/03/1069311/inside-story-oral-history-how-chatgpt-built-openai/">ChatGPT</a> just might be conscious (if you squint). He thinks the world needs to wake up to the true power of the technology his company and others are racing to create. And he thinks some humans will one day choose to merge with machines.</p> 
 <p>A lot of what Sutskever says is wild. But not nearly as wild as it would have sounded just one or two years ago. As he tells me himself, ChatGPT has already rewritten a lot of people’s expectations about what’s coming, turning “will never happen” into “will happen faster than you think.”</p>  <p>“It’s important to talk about where it’s all headed,” he says, before predicting the development of artificial general intelligence (by which he means machines as smart as humans) as if it were as sure a bet as another iPhone: “At some point we really will have AGI. Maybe OpenAI will build it. Maybe some other company will build it.”</p> 
 <p>Since the release of its sudden <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/08/1068068/chatgpt-is-everywhere-heres-where-it-came-from">surprise hit, ChatGPT</a>, last November, the buzz around OpenAI has been astonishing, even in an industry known for hype. No one can get enough of this nerdy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/technology/openai-artifical-intelligence-value.html">$80 billion startup</a>. World leaders seek (and get) private audiences. Its clunky product names pop up in casual conversation.&nbsp;</p>  <p>OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, spent a good part of the summer on a weeks-long outreach tour, glad-handing politicians and speaking to packed auditoriums around the world. But Sutskever is much less of a public figure, and he doesn’t give a lot of interviews.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He is deliberate and methodical when he talks. There are long pauses when he thinks about what he wants to say and how to say it, turning questions over like puzzles he needs to solve. He does not seem interested in talking about himself. “I lead a very simple life,” he says. “I go to work; then I go home. I don’t do much else. There are a lot of social activities one could engage in, lots of events one could go to. Which I don’t.”</p>  <p>But when we talk about AI, and the epochal risks and rewards he sees down the line, vistas open up: “It’s going to be monumental, earth-shattering. There will be a before and an after.”</p> </div><div> <h3>Better and better and better</h3>  <p>In a world without OpenAI, Sutskever would still get an entry in the annals of AI history. An Israeli-Canadian, he was born in Soviet Russia but brought up in Jerusalem from the age of five (he still speaks Russian and Hebrew as well as English). He then moved to Canada to study at the University of Toronto with Geoffrey Hinton, the AI pioneer who went public with his <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/02/1072528/geoffrey-hinton-google-why-scared-ai/">fears about the technology he helped invent</a> earlier this year. (Sutskever didn’t want to comment on Hinton’s pronouncements, but his new focus on rogue superintelligence suggests they’re on the same page.)</p>  <p>Hinton would later share the Turing Award with Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio for their work on neural networks. But when Sutskever joined him in the early 2000s, most AI researchers believed neural networks were a dead end. Hinton was an exception. He was already training tiny models that could produce short strings of text one character at a time, says Sutskever: “It was the beginning of generative AI right there. It was really cool—it just wasn’t very good.”</p>  <p>Sutskever was fascinated with brains: how they learned and how that process might be re-created, or at least mimicked, in machines. Like Hinton, he saw the potential of neural networks and the trial-and-error technique Hinton used to train them, called deep learning. “It kept getting better and better and better,” says Sutskever.</p>  <p>In 2012 Sutskever, Hinton, and another of Hinton’s graduate students, Alex Krizhevsky, built a neural network called AlexNet that they trained to identify objects in photos far better than any other software around at the time. It was deep learning’s Big Bang moment.</p> 

 <p>After many years of false starts, they had showed that neural networks were amazingly effective at pattern recognition after all. You just needed more data than most researchers had seen before (in this case, a million images from the ImageNet data set that Princeton University researcher <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/10/09/3988/put-humans-at-the-center-of-ai/">Fei-Fei Li</a> had been building since 2006) and an eye-watering amount of computer power.</p>  <p>The step change in compute came from a new kind of chip called a graphics processing unit (GPU), made by Nvidia. GPUs were designed to be lightning quick at throwing fast-moving video-game visuals onto screens. But the calculations that GPUs are good at—multiplying massive grids of numbers—happened to look a lot like the calculations needed to train neural networks.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Nvidia is now a trillion-dollar company. At the time it was desperate to find applications for its niche new hardware. “When you invent a new technology, you have to be receptive to crazy ideas,” says Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “My state of mind was always to be looking for something quirky, and the idea that neural networks would transform computer science—that was an outrageously quirky idea.”</p>  <p>Huang says that Nvidia sent the Toronto team a couple of GPUs to try when they were working on AlexNet. But they wanted the newest version, a chip called the GTX 580 that was fast selling out in stores. According to Huang, Sutskever drove across the border from Toronto to New York to buy some. “People were lined up around the corner,” says Huang. “I don’t know how he did it—I’m pretty sure you were only allowed to buy one each; we had a very strict policy of one GPU per gamer—but he apparently filled a trunk with them. That trunk full of GTX 580s changed the world.”&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>It’s a great story—it just might not be true. Sutskever insists he bought those first GPUs online. But such myth-making is commonplace in this buzzy business. Sutskever himself is more humble: “I thought, like, if I could make even an ounce of real progress, I would consider that a success,” he says. “The real-world impact felt so far away because computers were so puny back then.”</p>  <p>After the success of AlexNet, Google came knocking. It acquired Hinton’s spin-off company DNNresearch and hired Sutskever. At Google Sutskever showed that deep learning’s powers of pattern recognition could be <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3215.pdf">applied to sequences of data</a>, such as words and sentences, as well as images. “Ilya has always been interested in language,” says Sutskever’s former colleague Jeff Dean, who is now Google’s chief scientist: “We’ve had great discussions over the years. Ilya has a strong intuitive sense about where things might go.”</p>  <p>But Sutskever didn’t remain at Google for long. In 2014, he was recruited to become a cofounder of OpenAI. Backed by $1 billion (from Altman, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Microsoft, Y Combinator, and others) plus a massive dose of Silicon Valley swagger, the new company set its sights from the start on developing AGI, a prospect that few took seriously at the time.</p>  <p>With Sutskever on board, the brains behind the bucks, the swagger was understandable. Up until then, he had been on a roll, getting more and more out of neural networks. His reputation preceded him, making him a major catch, says Dalton Caldwell, managing director of investments at Y Combinator.</p> 
 <p>“I remember Sam [Altman] referring to Ilya as one of the most respected researchers in the world,” says Caldwell. “He thought that Ilya would be able to attract a lot of top AI talent. He even mentioned that Yoshua Bengio, one of the world's top AI experts, believed that it would be unlikely to find a better candidate than Ilya to be OpenAI's lead scientist."</p>  <p>And yet at first OpenAI floundered. “There was a period of time when we were starting OpenAI when I wasn’t exactly sure how the progress would continue,” says Sutskever. “But I had one very explicit belief, which is: one doesn’t bet against deep learning. Somehow, every time you run into an obstacle, within six months or a year researchers find a way around it.”</p> 
 <p>His faith paid off. The first of OpenAI’s GPT large language models (the name stands for “generative pretrained transformer”) appeared in 2016. Then came GPT-2 and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/">GPT-3</a>. Then <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/05/1015754/avocado-armchair-future-ai-openai-deep-learning-nlp-gpt3-computer-vision-common-sense/">DALL-E</a>, the striking text-to-image model. Nobody was building anything as good. With each release, OpenAI raised the bar for what was thought possible.&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Managing expectations</h3>  <p>Last November, OpenAI released a free-to-use chatbot that repackaged some of its existing tech. It reset the agenda of the entire industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>At the time, OpenAI had no idea what it was putting out. Expectations inside the company couldn’t have been lower, says Sutskever: “I will admit, to my slight embarrassment—I don’t know if I should, but what the hell, it is true—when we made ChatGPT, I didn’t know if it was any good. When you asked it a factual question, it gave you a wrong answer. I thought it was going to be so unimpressive that people would say, ‘Why are you doing this? This is so boring!’”</p>  <p>The draw was the convenience, says Sutskever. The large language model under ChatGPT’s hood had been around for months. But wrapping that in an accessible interface and giving it away for free made billions of people aware for the first time of what OpenAI and others were building.</p>  <p>“That first-time experience is what hooked people,” says Sutskever. “The first time you use it, I think it’s almost a spiritual experience. You go, ‘Oh my God, this computer seems to understand.’”</p>  <p>OpenAI amassed 100 million users in less than two months, many of them dazzled by this stunning new toy. Aaron Levie, CEO of the storage firm Box, summed up the vibe in the week after launch when he tweeted: “ChatGPT is one of those rare moments in technology where you see a glimmer of how everything is going to be different going forward.”&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>That wonder collapses as soon as ChatGPT says something stupid. But by then it doesn’t matter. That glimpse of what was possible is enough, says Sutskever. ChatGPT changed people’s horizons.</p>  <p>“AGI stopped being a dirty word in the field of machine learning,” he says. “That was a big change. The attitude that people have taken historically has been: AI doesn’t work, every step is very difficult, you have to fight for every ounce of progress. And when people came with big proclamations about AGI, researchers would say, ‘What are you talking about? This doesn’t work, that doesn’t work. There are so many problems.’ But with ChatGPT it started to feel different.”</p>  <p>And that shift only started to happen a year ago? “It happened because of ChatGPT,” he says. “ChatGPT has allowed machine-learning researchers to dream.”</p>  <p>Evangelists from the start, OpenAI’s scientists have been stoking those dreams with blog posts and speaking tours. And it is working: “We have people now talking about how far AI will go—people who talk about AGI, or superintelligence.” And it’s not just researchers. “Governments are talking about it,” says Sutskever. “It’s crazy.”</p> 
</div><div> <h3>Incredible things</h3>  <p>Sutskever insists all this talk about a technology that does not yet (and may never) exist is a good thing, because it makes more people aware of a future that he already takes for granted.</p>  <p>“You can do so many amazing things with AGI, incredible things: automate health care, make it a thousand times cheaper and a thousand times better, cure so many diseases, actually solve global warming,” he says. “But there are many who are concerned: ‘My God, will AI companies succeed in managing this tremendous technology?’”</p>  <p>Presented this way, AGI sounds more like a wish-granting genie than real-world prospect. Few would say no to saving lives and solving climate change. But the problem with a technology that doesn’t exist is that you can say whatever you want about it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>What is Sutskever really talking about when he talks about AGI? “AGI is not meant to be a scientific term,” he says. “It’s meant to be a useful threshold, a point of reference.”</p>  <p>“It is the idea—” he starts, then stops. “It’s the point at which AI is so smart that if a person can do some task, then AI can do it too. At that point you can say you have AGI.”</p>  <p>People may be talking about it, but AGI remains one of the field’s most <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/15/1010461/artificial-general-intelligence-robots-ai-agi-deepmind-google-openai/">controversial ideas</a>. Few take its development as a given. Many researchers believe that major conceptual breakthroughs are needed before we see anything like what Sutskever has in mind—and some believe we never will.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And yet it’s a vision that has driven him from the start. “I’ve always been inspired and motivated by the idea,” says Sutskever. “It wasn’t called AGI back then, but you know, like, having a neural network do everything. I didn’t always believe that they could. But it was the mountain to climb.”</p>  <p>He draws a parallel between the way that neural networks and brains operate. Both take in data, aggregate signals from that data, and then—based on some simple process (math in neural networks, chemicals and bioelectricity in brains)—propagate them or not. It’s a massive simplification, but the principle stands.</p> </div><div> <p>“If you believe that—if you allow yourself to believe that—then there are a lot of interesting implications,” says Sutskever. “The main implication is that if you have a very big artificial neural network, it should do a lot of things. In particular, if the human brain can do something, then a big artificial neural network could do something similar too.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Everything follows if you take this realization seriously enough,” he says. “And a big fraction of my work can be explained by that.”</p>  <p>While we’re talking about brains, I want to ask about one of Sutskever’s posts on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Sutskever’s feed reads like a scroll of aphorisms: “If you value intelligence above all other human qualities, you’re gonna have a bad time”; “Empathy in life and business is underrated”; “The perfect has destroyed much perfectly good good.”</p>  <p>In February 2022 he <a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1491554478243258368?lang=en">posted</a>, “it may be that today’s large neural networks are slightly conscious” (to which Murray Shanahan, principal scientist at Google DeepMind and a professor at Imperial College London, as well as the scientific advisor on the movie <em>Ex Machina</em>, replied: “... in the same sense that it may be that a large field of wheat is slightly pasta”).</p>  <p>Sutskever laughs when I bring it up. Was he trolling? He wasn’t. “Are you familiar with the concept of a Boltzmann brain?” he asks.</p>  <p>He's referring to a (tongue-in-cheek) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain">thought experiment</a> in quantum mechanics named after the 19th-century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, in which random thermodynamic fluctuations in the universe are imagined to cause brains to pop in and out of existence.</p>  <p>“I feel like right now these language models are kind of like a Boltzmann brain,” says Sutskever. “You start talking to it, you talk for a bit; then you finish talking, and the brain kind of—” He makes a disappearing motion with his hands. Poof—bye-bye, brain.</p>  <p>You’re saying that while the neural network is active—while it’s firing, so to speak—there’s something there? I ask.</p> </div><div> <p>“I think it might be,” he says. “I don’t know for sure, but it’s a possibility that’s very hard to argue against. But who knows what’s going on, right?”</p>  <h3>AI but not as we know it</h3>  <p>While others wrestle with the idea of machines that can match human smarts, Sutskever is preparing for machines that can <em>outmatch</em> us. He calls this artificial superintelligence: “They’ll see things more deeply. They’ll see things we don’t see.”</p>  <p>Again, I have a hard time grasping what this really means. Human intelligence is our benchmark for what intelligence is. What does Sutskever mean by smarter-than-human intelligence?</p>  <p>“We’ve seen an example of a very narrow superintelligence in AlphaGo,” he says. In 2016, DeepMind’s board-game-playing AI beat Lee Sedol, one of the best Go players in the world, 4–1 in a five-game match. “It figured out how to play Go in ways that are different from what humanity collectively had developed over thousands of years,” says Sutskever. “It came up with new ideas.”</p>  <p>Sutskever points to AlphaGo’s infamous Move 37. In its second game against Sedol, the AI made a move that flummoxed commentators. They thought AlphaGo had screwed up. In fact, it had played a winning move that nobody had ever seen before in the history of the game. “Imagine that level of insight, but across everything,” says Sutskever.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It’s this train of thought that has led Sutskever to make the biggest shift of his career. Together with Jan Leike, a fellow scientist at OpenAI, he has set up a team that will focus on what they call <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment">superalignment</a>. Alignment is jargon that means making AI models do what you want and nothing more. Superalignment is OpenAI’s term for alignment applied to superintelligence.</p>  <p>The goal is to come up with a set of fail-safe procedures for building and controlling this future technology. OpenAI says it will allocate a fifth of its vast computing resources to the problem and solve it in four years.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Existing alignment methods won’t work for models smarter than humans because they fundamentally assume that humans can reliably evaluate what AI systems are doing,” says Leike. “As AI systems become more capable, they will take on harder tasks.” And that—the idea goes—will make it harder for humans to assess them. “In forming the superalignment team with Ilya, we’ve set out to solve these future alignment challenges,” he says.</p> </div><div><p>“It’s super important to not only focus on the potential opportunities of large language models, but also the risks and downsides,” says Dean, Google’s chief scientist.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The company announced the project in July with typical fanfare. But for some it was yet more fantasy. OpenAI’s post on Twitter attracted scorn from prominent critics of Big Tech, including Abeba Birhane, who works on AI accountability at Mozilla (“so many grandiose sounding yet vacuous words in one blog post”); Timnit Gebru, cofounder of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (“Imagine ChatGPT even more ‘super aligned’ with OpenAI techbros. *shudder*”); and Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at the AI firm Hugging Face (“My alignment is bigger than yours”). It’s true that these are familiar voices of dissent. But it’s a strong reminder that where some see OpenAI leading from the front, others see it leaning in from the fringes.</p>  <p>But, for Sutskever, superalignment is the inevitable next step. “It’s an unsolved problem,” he says. It’s also a problem that he thinks not enough core machine-learning researchers, like himself, are working on. “I’m doing it for my own self-interest,” he says. “It’s obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>The work on superalignment has only just started. It will require broad changes across research institutions, says Sutskever.&nbsp;But he has an exemplar in mind for the safeguards he wants to design: a machine that looks upon people the way parents look on their children. “In my opinion, this is the gold standard,” he says. “It is a generally true statement that people really care about children.” (Does he have children? “No, but I want to,” he says.)</p>  <p>My time with Sutskever is almost up, and I figure we’re done. But he’s on a roll and has one more thought to share—one I don't see coming.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Once you overcome the challenge of rogue AI, then what? Is there even room for human beings in a world with smarter AIs?” he says.</p>  <p>“One possibility—something that may be crazy by today’s standards but will not be so crazy by future standards—is that many people will choose to become part AI.” Sutskever is saying this could be how&nbsp;humans try to keep up. “At first, only the most daring, adventurous people will try to do it. Maybe others will follow. Or not.”</p>  <p>Wait, what? He’s getting up to leave. Would he do it? I ask. Would he be one of the first? “The first? I don’t know,” he says. “But it’s something I think about. The true answer is: maybe.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>And with that galaxy-brained mic drop, he stands and walks out of the room. “Really good to see you again,” he says as he goes.&nbsp; </p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><!--[--><!--[--><div><p>We <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> our “capped profit” structure in 2019, about three years after <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">founding</a> the original OpenAI Nonprofit.</p><p>Since the beginning, we have believed that powerful AI, culminating in AGI—meaning a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work—has the potential to reshape society and bring tremendous benefits, along with risks that must be safely addressed. The increasing capabilities of present day systems mean it’s more important than ever for OpenAI and other AI companies to share the principles, economic mechanisms, and governance models that are core to our respective missions and operations.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="overview" data-heading=""><p><h2>Overview</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>We founded the OpenAI Nonprofit in late 2015 with the goal of building safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity. A project like this might previously have been the provenance of one or multiple governments—a humanity-scale endeavor pursuing broad benefit for humankind.</p><p>Seeing no clear path in the public sector, and given the success of other ambitious projects in private industry (e.g., SpaceX, Cruise, and others), we decided to pursue this project through private means bound by strong commitments to the public good. We initially believed a 501(c)(3) would be the most effective vehicle to direct the development of safe and broadly beneficial AGI while remaining unencumbered by profit incentives. We committed to publishing our research and data in cases where we felt it was safe to do so and would benefit the public.</p><p>We always suspected that our project would be capital intensive, which is why we launched with the goal of $1 billion in donation commitments. Yet over the years, OpenAI’s Nonprofit received approximately $130.5 million in total donations, which funded the Nonprofit’s operations and its initial exploratory work in deep learning, safety, and alignment.</p><p>It became increasingly clear that donations alone would not scale with the cost of computational power and talent required to push core research forward, jeopardizing our mission. So we devised a structure to preserve our Nonprofit’s core mission, governance, and oversight while enabling us to raise the capital for our mission:</p><ul><li>The OpenAI Nonprofit would remain intact, with its board continuing as the overall governing body for all OpenAI activities.<br></li><li>A new for-profit subsidiary would be formed, capable of issuing equity to raise capital and hire world class talent, but still at the direction of the Nonprofit. Employees working on for-profit initiatives were transitioned over to the new subsidiary. <br></li><li>The for-profit would be legally bound to pursue the Nonprofit’s mission, and carry out that mission by engaging in research, development, commercialization and other core operations. Throughout, OpenAI’s guiding principles of safety and broad benefit would be central to its approach.<br></li><li>The for-profit’s equity structure would have caps that limit the maximum financial returns to investors and employees to incentivize them to research, develop, and deploy AGI in a way that balances commerciality with safety and sustainability, rather than focusing on pure profit-maximization. <br></li><li>The Nonprofit would govern and oversee all such activities through its board in addition to its own operations.

We achieved this innovation with a few key economic and governance provisions:</p><ul><li>First, the for-profit subsidiary is fully controlled by the OpenAI Nonprofit. We enacted this by having the Nonprofit wholly own and control a manager entity (OpenAI GP LLC) that has the power to control and govern the for-profit subsidiary.</li><li>Second, because the board is still the board of a Nonprofit, each director must perform their fiduciary duties in furtherance of its mission—safe AGI that is broadly beneficial. While the for-profit subsidiary is permitted to make and distribute profit, it is subject to this mission. The Nonprofit’s principal beneficiary is humanity, not OpenAI investors.</li><li>Third, the board remains majority independent. Independent directors do not hold equity in OpenAI. Even OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, does not hold equity directly. His only interest is indirectly through a Y Combinator investment fund that made a small investment in OpenAI before he was full-time.</li><li>Fourth, profit allocated to investors and employees, including Microsoft, is capped. All residual value created above and beyond the cap will be returned to the Nonprofit for the benefit of humanity.</li><li>Fifth, the board determines when we've attained AGI. Again, by AGI we mean a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work. Such a system is excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft, which only apply to pre-AGI technology.<br></li></ul></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><figure><p><img src="https://images.openai.com/blob/f3e12a69-e4a7-4fe2-a4a5-c63b61f26ab7/org-structure.svg?width=10&amp;height=10&amp;quality=50" width="796" height="551" alt="OpenAI Org Structure" loading="lazy" data-nuxt-img="" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, (max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 100vw" aria-hidden="false"></p><figcaption><!--[--><!--]--></figcaption></figure></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>We strive to preserve these core governance and economic components of our structure when exploring opportunities to accelerate our work.

We subsequently <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extended</a> our partnership, expanding both Microsoft’s total investment as well as the scale and breadth of our commercial and supercomputing collaborations.</p><p>While our partnership with Microsoft includes a multibillion dollar investment, OpenAI remains an entirely independent company governed by the OpenAI Nonprofit. Microsoft has no board seat and no control. And, as explained above, AGI is explicitly carved out of all commercial and IP licensing agreements.</p><p>These arrangements exemplify why we chose Microsoft as our compute and commercial partner. From the beginning, they accepted our capped equity offer and our request to leave AGI technologies and governance for the Nonprofit and the rest of humanity. They have also worked with us to create and refine our joint safety board that reviews our systems before they are deployed. Harkening back to our origins, they understand that this is a unique and ambitious project that requires resources at the scale of the public sector, as well as the very same conscientiousness to share the ultimate results with everyone.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="our-board" data-heading=""><p><h2>Our board</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>OpenAI is governed by the board of the OpenAI Nonprofit, comprised of OpenAI Global, LLC employees Greg Brockman (Chairman &amp; President), Ilya Sutskever (Chief Scientist), and Sam Altman (CEO), and non-employees Adam D’Angelo, Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--]--></div></div>]]></description>

  <div id="post_body_768297"><p>Over the
last five years, there has been an incredible shift in leverage from investors
to founders.&nbsp; It’s good in most ways, but bad in an important few.&nbsp; Founders’ desire for control is good in
moderation but hurts companies when it gets taken to extremes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many founders
(or at least, many of the founders I talk to) generally want few to no
outsiders on their boards.&nbsp;&nbsp;A popular way to win an A round in the
current environment is to not ask for a board seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some investors
are happy to do this—it’s certainly easier to write a check and go hang out on
the beach than it is to take a board seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this trend is likely
to continue, because these new investors are generally willing to pay much
higher prices than investors that want to be involved with the company.</p>

<p>But great
board members, with a lot of experience seeing companies get built, are the
sort of people founders should want thinking about their companies every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;There
are a lot of roles where experience doesn’t matter in a startup, but board
members usually aren’t one of them.&nbsp; Board
members are very useful in helping founders think big and hire executives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Board
members are also a good forcing function to keep the company focused on
execution.&nbsp; In my experience, companies
without any outsiders on their boards often have less discipline around operational
cadence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally,
board members stick with the company when things really go wrong, in a way that
advisors usually don’t.</p>

<p>Board members certainly don't have to be investors. &nbsp;If founders
do choose to take money without an involved board member, I think it’s very
important to get an advisor with a significant equity position that will play
the role of a board member (or better, actually put them on the board).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personally,
I think the ideal board structure for most early-stage companies is a 5-member
board with 2 founders, 2 investors, and one outsider.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a 4-member
board with 2 founders, 1 investor and 1 outsider is also good (in practice, the
even number is almost never a problem).</p>

<p>As a side
note, bad board members are disastrous.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should check references
thoroughly on someone before you let them join your board.</p>

<p>The
companies that have had the biggest impact and created the most value have had
excellent board members (and executives).&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t believe this is a
coincidence.</p>

<p>It’s a good
idea to keep enough control so that investors can’t fire you (there are a lot
of different ways to do this), but beyond that, it’s important to bring in
other people and trust them to help you build the company.</p>



<p>Thanks to
Mike Moritz for reviewing a draft of this.</p></div>

<p>Congress has recently proposed multiple bills to regulate the internet (such as the recent “Kids Online Safety Act”), in the name of protecting children. This has caused a simple response: “Just have parents be parents and set up parental controls if they care.”</p>



<p>That’s simpler said than done. Parental controls right now <em>completely suck</em> by being incomplete, full of loopholes, extremely buggy, overly complicated, poorly designed, privacy invading, or a combination of the above. As someone who has used almost every ecosystem, here’s an eye opener. </p>



<p>Also here’s my rallying cry: If you don’t want Congress regulating the internet to “protect the Kids,” demand companies fix their parental controls. </p>



<p><strong>Windows 11</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft has <em>Family Safety</em> as their tool for parental controls on Windows. Here’s my hate list.</p>



<ol>
<li>Every child must have a Microsoft Account to use it. Even the 8-year-olds. Local accounts are still supported by Windows 11 after setting up the main account, but you can’t use parental controls with them. </li>



<li>You can’t disable Windows Copilot, or Edge Copilot. Don’t want your kid using AI from Bing or ChatGPT when they are just learning to write? Too bad. Don’t want them using AI for any host of ethical or personal issues? Too bad. </li>



<li>You can’t disable the Microsoft News feed of tabloid content on new Microsoft Edge tabs, without disabling Bing (rendering you unable to offer restricted “SafeSearch” browsing of any kind, to your child, at all). </li>



<li>You can’t disable the Microsoft Search button, which shows… surprise, more tabloid content. Even if you have your child’s account set to “allowed websites only.” They’ll still see headlines of the day about how the world is on fire.</li>



<li>You can’t disable the Widgets button. The entire purpose of widgets is to serve tabloid content. And once again, “allowed websites only” doesn’t disable that or do basically anything to it. </li>



<li>Windows 11 comes preloaded with Movies+TV, Xbox, Microsoft News, and other apps. Unless you as a parent <em>know</em> about these apps, open these apps individually so they appear in the dashboard, and <em>then</em> block these apps, they’re allowed. <em>What?</em></li>



<li>You can’t disable the Microsoft Store. You can set age restrictions; so setting everything to block all apps rated above the Age of 3 is the best you’ll be able to do. </li>



<li>Microsoft Office lets you embed content from Bing, and does not respect system parental controls… at all. Even if you block Bing, your 8-year-old can still watch videos to their heart’s content by embedding them in a Word document, because the internet filters <em>only work in Microsoft Edge</em>.</li>
</ol>



<p>So let’s say you want to allow your 8-year-old to work on school, on a Windows PC. What’s the point of parental controls when you can’t disable Widgets, can’t disable the tabloid content in the Search box even if you block Bing, the Bing filter can still be bypassed using Office, and your student can use AI all they want? These are “parental controls”?</p>



<p><strong>MacOS / iOS</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Quite powerful, stupidly buggy. So much so that Apple even admitted as such to a reporter a few months ago. There is, in my experience, no part of macOS more buggy than Screen Time. How so? </li>



<li> It appears that Screen Time runs using a daemon (background process) on the child’s account. That daemon has a propensity to randomly crash after running for a few hours. When it does, <em>all locks are disabled. </em>Safari will just let you open Private windows without filtering of any kind, regardless of your internet filtering settings, when that happens. This state then remains until the child logs out and logs back in. Naturally, <em>what’s the point of parental controls that randomly fail open?</em></li>



<li>The “allowed websites only” option shows Apple has never used this feature, ever. You will be swarmed on your first login with prompts to approve random IP addresses and Apple domains because of system services that can no longer communicate with the mother ship. And they will nag you <em>constantly</em> with no option to disable them, so your first experience of enabling this is entering your PIN code a dozen or more time to approve all sorts of random junk just to get to a usable state. </li>



<li>The “allow this website” button on the “website blocked” page randomly doesn’t work; and this might be because the codebase is so old (and likely untested for so long), <em>it’s not even HTML5</em>. Meaning it’s probably been, what, a decade and a half since anyone really looked at it last?</li>



<li>You can’t disable any in-box system apps. You don’t want your kid reading through the Apple Books store? You don’t want your kid seeing suggestive imagery and nudity in the Apple Music app? You don’t want your kid listening to random Podcasts from anyone in the Apple Podcasts app? You can’t do anything about it but set a time limit for 1 minute. Of course, that time limit randomly doesn’t work either.</li>



<li>The “allowed websites” list in macOS has a comical, elementary bug showing how badly tested the code is. If you open the preference pane, it shows a list of allowed websites (say, A, B, and C). Let’s say I add a website called D, and close it. I open the preference pane again – only A, B, and C are in the list, D nowhere to be seen! However, D <em>was</em> added to the system, but it’s not in the list. If I go add E (so the list is now A, B, C, and E); D will then be <em>removed</em> and opening the preference pane will one again just show A, B, and C.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch</strong></p>



<p>I generally like Nintendo, but the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls are inexcusable.</p>



<ol>
<li>Every parental control is per-device. What about families that have, say, multiple children and can’t afford (or don’t want the risk) of having multiple Switches? Seems reasonable, but no, every Switch is personal to the owner if you use Parental Controls.</li>



<li>Let’s say you then go, fine, and buy multiple Switches. There’s no ability to set a PIN lock; so theoretically the kids could just… swipe the other’s Switch?</li>



<li>You can’t hide titles on the menu. Let’s say you have two kids on the same Switch. One plays M-rated titles, the other plays E-rated titles. The kid who plays E-rated titles will see all the M-rated titles on the Home Screen, and nothing can be done about it. They can even <em>launch them and play them</em>. </li>



<li>You can’t disable the eShop from within the Parental Controls app. You can dig through the eShop settings to find the option to require a password before signing in, but that requires the kid to not know their own Nintendo password. If your kid uses, say, their actual email address on their Nintendo account, locking down the eShop is impossible – and they’ll see every game for sale regardless of how appropriate or inappropriate it is (<em>Hentai Girls</em>, <em>Waifu Uncovered</em>, anyone? Games you can “play with one hand”? Actual titles on the eShop). </li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Router based filtering</strong></p>



<p>One of the best solutions. Unfortunately, </p>



<ol>
<li>Every child must have their own device (again, poor families need not apply, making this very financially uninclusive solution).</li>



<li>Often, technically overwhelming for parents. What IP address is that kid’s laptop again? </li>



<li>Premium routers like Eero, which have very easy to use router-based parental controls, often demand subscriptions to use them. In the case of Eero, $9.99/mo. after you already paid ~$200 for the devices. That’s not a viable solution – I can’t tell a poor family to pay $200+ for routers <em>and </em>a $9.99/mo. subscription as their solution.</li>



<li>Some routers have parental controls that make me wonder what idiot thought this would work. Case in point – a Netgear router from a few years ago that let me “block websites” and had “parental controls” right on the box. Cool – but they worked by letting a parent individually enter, domain by domain, websites to block. Considering the internet’s scale, that’s criminally useless and if I had a lawyer, I would’ve sued for false advertising.</li>



<li>Remember the Nintendo eShop? Try using router-based parental controls to block eShop access without blocking software updates or online play. Good luck with that. Router-based blocking has the least nuance of any of the above solutions. </li>
</ol>



<p>But sure. It’s the parent’s job to set up parental controls. My response is, once again, if you don’t want Congress regulating the internet, parents need better tools than these. </p>

<p>To understand the problem the Disruptor is trying to solve, and to get a feel for why this concurrency framework is so fast, read the <a href="https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/disruptor.html">Technical Paper</a>.
It also contains detailed performance results.</p>
<p>And now for some words from our sponsors…​</p>
<p>LMAX are recruiting once again.

<h2 id="_what_is_the_disruptor">What is the Disruptor?</h2>
<div>
<p><a href="https://www.lmax.com/">LMAX</a> aims to be the fastest trading platform in the world.
Clearly, in order to achieve this we needed to do something special to achieve very low-latency and high-throughput with our Java platform.
Performance testing showed that using queues to pass data between stages of the system was introducing latency, so we focused on optimising this area.</p>
<p>The Disruptor is the result of our research and testing.
We found that cache misses at the CPU-level, and locks requiring kernel arbitration are both extremely costly, so we created a framework which has "mechanical sympathy" for the hardware it’s running on, and that’s lock-free.</p>
<p>This is not a specialist solution, it’s not designed to work only for a financial application.
The Disruptor is a general-purpose mechanism for solving a difficult problem in concurrent programming.</p>
<p>It works in a different way to more conventional approaches, so you use it a little differently than you might be used to.
For example, applying the pattern to your system is not as simple as replacing all your queues with the <a href="https://trishagee.com/2011/06/22/dissecting_the_disruptor_whats_so_special_about_a_ring_buffer/">magic ring buffer</a>.

<p>the <a href="https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/disruptor.html">technical paper</a> goes into some detail as you’d expect,</p>

Martin Thompson will also witter on occasionally about performance in his <a href="https://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/">Mechanical Sympathy blog</a>.

<p>However, this wasn’t enough to get the game in a playable state.
Depending on where you are in the game, <code>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</code> internally switches between double and triple buffered VSync presentation modes.
This causes the number of images it has available for presentation to frequently change.</p>
<p>yuzu wasn’t ready for this due to a misunderstanding of how nvnflinger works.
On Android, SurfaceFlinger (the OG Flinger) can free buffers that are beyond the maximum count a program has allocated, but nvnflinger (the Switch’s fork) is never supposed to free any buffers unless the program requests it.
Maide made a <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11827" data-gh-pr="11827">few presentation code changes</a>
 to support this behaviour, and players are now set to grab those fun Wonder Flowers!</p>

<p>Classic Mario (Super Mario Bros. Wonder)</p>


<p>I bet you didn’t expect to see the sole input change of the month here ― yet here we are.
<code>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</code> <em>loves</em> vibration, to a point of saturating the old implementation when using HD Rumble on Nintendo controllers (Joy-Cons, Pro Controllers).
This is because waiting for the controller to reply takes time, more than the game would have the patience for, leading to noticeable and bothersome vibration stuttering. That’s right, ASTC, you’re not the only one in town causing stutters.
By <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11852" data-gh-pr="11852">making vibration calls asynchronous,</a>
 vibration is, while not entirely solved, now <em>much</em> more pleasant.</p>
<h2 id="the-gpu-changes">The GPU changes</h2>
<p>Undefined behaviour: the formal way to say “here be dragons”.
It’s a good practice to avoid dragons ― I mean, undefined behaviour ― in your code, especially when dealing with a complex graphics API like Vulkan.</p>
<p>Remember our explanation of <code>depth stencils</code> <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-aug-2023/#more-gpu-changes">back in August</a>? You may wish to reread that, as it provides useful context to what we will talk about next.</p>
<p>When a game is using a depth buffer, it is usually drawing into a busy 3D scene while taking advantage of a hardware-accelerated process called depth testing.</p>
<p>During depth testing, the GPU hardware determines if a pixel is visible or hidden (occluded) by another pixel. This is decided by their depth values.
The depth buffer tracks how far away each stored pixel is from the camera.
If a rendered pixel is further away than what has already been drawn on the scene, then the pixel is discarded; if it is closer, then it is kept and the colour buffers are updated.
Typically, the depth buffer is also updated and written to, in this case, to store the depth of the new, closer object.</p>
<p>It is possible for a game to use depth testing alone, and turn the actual writes to the depth buffer off for specific elements, and many games do this when rendering partially transparent objects.
However, the opposite is not allowed by graphics APIs like Vulkan ― hardware designs require depth testing to be enabled in order update the depth buffer.
yuzu’s masked clear path for depth/stencil buffers has a shader which updates the depth buffer, and so enables depth writes, but forgot to also enable depth tests.
Most of the time, this worked by coincidence, as the game was enabling depth tests and yuzu was not clearing this state.
However, not all games enabled them, and without depth tests, games like <code>Super Mario 64</code>, part of <code>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</code>, can’t properly render the face of a certain character (I <em>think</em> his name is in the title of the game.)</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11630" data-gh-pr="11630">the work done</a>
 by <a href="https://github.com/Kelebek1">Maide</a>, Mr. Mario Mario renders correctly now.</p>
<p>Not stopping there, Maide’s dragon-hunting continued for another pull request.
One advantage of using the standard Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA for short) is how it can help sanitise code.</p>
<p>VMA will raise asserts if things are wrong somewhere.
In this case, we were accidentally marking a device-local buffer we intend to use exclusively in VRAM as CPU mapped.
VMA is very clear here: device local buffers should not be allocated as mapped because they are outright <em>not</em> intended for CPU access.

</p>
<p>Thanks to users’ reports, <a href="https://github.com/FernandoS27">Blinkhawk</a> managed to figure out why the new query cache was leaking memory in many games, including <code>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</code>.
After <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11646" data-gh-pr="11646">some slight tweaking,</a>
 RAM consumption is put in its place.</p>
<p>Starting a campaign to combat holes in yuzu’s format support, <a href="https://github.com/Squall-Leonhart">Squall-Leonhart</a> has been working on implementing some of the more obscure format conversions, like  <code>D32_SFLOAT</code>.
For this particular depth format on Vulkan, it can <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11677" data-gh-pr="11677">now be converted</a>
 to <code>ABGR8_UNORM</code> when the game needs this behaviour.
Combined with <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11716" data-gh-pr="11716">adding support for</a>
 the <code>Z32</code>, <code>FLOAT</code>, <code>UINT</code>, <code>UINT</code>, <code>UINT</code>, <code>LINEAR</code> variants in the internal format table, this work solves rendering issues in games like <code>Disney Speedstorm</code> and <code>Titan Glory</code>.</p>

<p>Some games also make aliases of images in the D32 depth format.
Since a similar limitation with format conversion was present here too, <code>ARGB8_SRGB</code> and <code>BGRA8_UNORM</code>/<code>BGRA8_SRGB</code> <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11795" data-gh-pr="11795">can now be converted to</a>

<p>Continuing with this streak, Maide <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11688" data-gh-pr="11688">implemented</a>
 the <code>X8_D24</code> depth format, allowing <code>A Sound Plan</code> to start rendering.
However, more work is needed to make this game properly playable.</p>
<p>Robustness is a feature Vulkan provides that lets developers handle invalid memory accesses in a cleanly defined way.
This can help prevent the application from crashing or <del>summoning dragons</del> invoking undefined behaviour when some part of the code tries to access memory out of bounds.</p>
<p>For some reason, either Maxwell and Pascal NVIDIA GPUs have broken robustness support on uniform buffers, or yuzu’s codebase makes a wrong assumption somewhere (most likely the latter). As a result, those two NVIDIA GPU generations (GTX 750/GTX 900/GTX 1000 series) suffer from oversized graphics on <code>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</code>, due to the game accessing memory out of bounds in the shader.
<a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11789" data-gh-pr="11789">Manually clamping out-of-bounds buffer reads to 0</a>
 on the affected GPU architectures solves the issues. We are also now investigating what causes this problem in the first place.
Maide gets to play detective yet again, dear Watson.</p>

<p>Maide also fixed a hidden issue with the resolution scaler.
Images were being <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11744" data-gh-pr="11744">marked as rescaled,</a>
 even if the resolution scaler was not in use (running at 1x).
This led to a slight additional overhead, and rarely, some assertion failures.
While no game bug was known to be caused by this, it’s good to have preemptive fixes for once instead of just reactionary ones.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Maide has also been removing image alias bits for all image attachments in an effort to allow the drivers to use more memory optimizations.

<p>And now, one for the Linux gang.
<a href="https://github.com/v1993">v1993</a> tested and <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11786" data-gh-pr="11786">re-enabled CUDA video decoding</a>
 on Linux, allowing better video decoding performance for NVIDIA users (running the proprietary driver, of course).
We previously disabled CUDA by default because it can fail on systems running both a dedicated NVIDIA GPU and a dedicated AMD GPU (iGPUs are fine), a decently rare configuration that only a few people, like your writer, actually ever use.</p>
<p>For those few users running mixed hardware vendors on your systems, please manually  select “CPU Video Decoding” if you’re affected by video decoding issues now.
This was the previous default behaviour.</p>
<p>We received user reports of crashes occurring when grabbing a Grand Star in <code>Super Mario Galaxy</code>, as part of <code>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</code>.
byte[] found that the problem is in how the Vulkan scheduler incorrectly flushes data.
The solution? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNgNBsCI4EA">Use a lock</a>.
And if that doesn’t work, <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11806" data-gh-pr="11806">use more locks.</a>

Happy star hunting!</p>
<p>To improve OpenGL support even further, <a href="https://github.com/ameerj">Epicboy</a> returns.
First, he found that the <code>shfl_in_bounds</code> variable, which is used to track data used in compute shaders, could result in undefined behaviour when threads were inactive and return invalid results.
<a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11847" data-gh-pr="11847">The solution</a>
 was to move the <code>shfl_in_bounds</code> check after the <code>readInvocationARB</code> function, which requires all threads to be active, to avoid <del>dragons</del> undefined behaviour.
This fixed some graphical corruption issues in unit tests, which should lead to fixes in real games too.</p>
<p>Next, a simple gift from epicboy: <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11904" data-gh-pr="11904">force enabling</a>
 <code>Threaded optimization</code>, an NVIDIA-specific OpenGL optimization that enables the use of a new separate CPU thread for graphics rendering.
This is a solid performance boost for those running OpenGL with NVIDIA hardware.
And for those asking, yes, Vulkan allows the use of a separate thread for rendering too ― but we do it on an API level, instead of a driver setting, so all GPUs can benefit.</p>
<p>Maide found a problem occurring with compute shaders when they were triggering invalidations in the buffer cache.
yuzu has a lot of code to track the sizes of buffers used by the games.
Consider a game using two buffers: the first, with an address range from 1 to 2, and another with a range of 3 to 5. They don’t overlap, so there is no issue.
Then, after the game runs for a while, a buffer requiring a range of 1 to 5 is used.
The previous two buffers would be considered to overlap it and will be deleted.
Then, the old buffer data from the two overlaps gets moved to the new third buffer.
While this was already working for graphics-related buffers, it didn’t correctly consider compute buffers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11859" data-gh-pr="11859">Adding the missing loop</a>
 to fix this behaviour, problems ranging from minimal graphical issues to completely broken game logic are potentially solved.
You know what they say: with compute, the sky’s the limit. Just ask AI developers.</p>
<p>Another optimization Maide implemented affects how buffers are handled after they are successfully deleted.
The previous method would unnecessarily create several copies, wasting resources.
By <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11683" data-gh-pr="11683">removing one synchronisation step,</a>
 only the exact amount of needed copies are used.</p>
<p>Now let’s discuss a long-standing issue: some 2D games were flipped on AMD, Intel, and Android GPUs.
Games can use different APIs to run on the Switch.
Nintendo allows the use of Vulkan, OpenGL, and their proprietary API, NVN.
This poses a problem for emulation on Vulkan, since <a href="https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/listdevicescoverage.php?extension=VK_NV_viewport_swizzle&amp;platform=all">only NVIDIA GPUs</a> support the viewport swizzle extension (which allows for transforming viewports).</p>
<p>To allow other GPU vendors to render properly in most cases, a fallback implementation was made to handle the case of vertical flips, for use by OpenGL games.
A tiny error in its implementation made it unable to correctly track invalidations of the viewport flip state, resulting in garbled graphics in several games.
byte[] <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11893" data-gh-pr="11893">solved</a>
 that issue with a one-line change, making games like <code>Stardew Valley</code>, and <code>Streets of Rage 4</code>, finally render properly on non-NVIDIA hardware.
No more mirrors needed!</p>

<p>While investigating this, a similar but different issue came to light.
Many OpenGL games (that is, games using OpenGL to render, not yuzu rendering on OpenGL) ask for a 1920x1080 framebuffer, regardless of whether the game is running in handheld or docked mode.
The game then simply moves and resizes the region it’s rendering to inside that 1920x1080 buffer, like moving a small box inside a bigger box, if you will.
In the final step, the image is flipped and sent to the bottom of that 1080p render target.
yuzu was incorrectly rendering only the top of the render target due to how it used to calculate that flip in the final pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11894" data-gh-pr="11894">Adjusting</a>
 this behaviour made <code>Tiny Thor</code> render correctly in handheld mode.</p>

<li>byte[] <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11910" data-gh-pr="11910">fixed another case</a>
 where yuzu would fail to recreate the surface on screen rotations.</li>
<li>t895 moved the <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11915" data-gh-pr="11915">game list loading process to a separate thread</a>
 to reduce stuttering when opening yuzu. The process still takes a similar amount of time, but the perceived smoothness is very welcome.</li>
<li>t895 solved an issue that caused the <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11916" data-gh-pr="11916">touch buttons overlay to get stuck</a>
 while drawing the in-game menu from the left side.</li>

<h2 id="ui-and-applet-changes">UI and Applet changes</h2>
<p>After a rocky start, thanks to the early work of <a href="https://github.com/roenyroeny">roenyroeny</a>, <a href="https://github.com/boludoz">boludoz</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/FearlessTobi">FearlessTobi</a>, we now have proper <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11705" data-gh-pr="11705">shortcut creation</a>
 support for Windows too!</p>
<p>To access this feature, simply right click a game in yuzu’s game list, select Create Shortcut, and pick if you want it on your desktop or the applications section of the start menu. This allows you to start games with a quick start menu search or even from a pin in the menu/taskbar if you so choose.</p>

<p>Helping improve this, <a href="https://github.com/german77">german77</a> made the required changes to <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11740" data-gh-pr="11740">save multiple resolutions per icon,</a>

<p><a href="https://github.com/DanielSvoboda">DanielSvoboda</a> made several changes in file system handling to <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11749" data-gh-pr="11749">improve directory path detection</a>
 for the shortcuts, making them far more usable and stable.
Thank you!</p>
<p>Work on improving user experience (UX) is always welcome, it is your writer’s belief that UX is as important as proper functionality, and should never be ignored.
To improve the quality of life of people playing with multiple controllers, <a href="https://github.com/flodavid">flodavid</a> changed the behaviour of how users interact with the <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11779" data-gh-pr="11779">number of connected controllers</a>
 in the Controls settings.
Users can now more intuitively click the green lights at the bottom to select how many players/controllers they would like to be active.
Thank you!</p>

<p>Another welcome UX addition is by <a href="https://github.com/Macj0rdan">Macj0rdan</a>, who implemented <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11903" data-gh-pr="11903">a quick control for game volume</a>
 with the mouse wheel when the pointer is placed over the volume button in the UI, removing the need to click it and drag a small slider.
Thank you!</p>
<p>Continuing his work on applet support, german77 implemented the <code>SaveScreenShotEx0</code> <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11812" data-gh-pr="11812">service method and its variants,</a>
 allowing users to take captures from within games themselves instead of globally with the screenshot hotkey.
This works for games like <code>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</code> ― however, note that screenshot editing is not available yet.
Homework for later!</p>

<p>One of the changes german77 introduced broke the <code>Find Mii</code> stage in <code>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</code>.
Since it’s not a popular stage, even among the Smash community, we didn’t notice this issue, and no one reported in our <a href="https://discord.gg/u77vRWY">Discord server</a>, <a href="https://community.citra-emu.org/c/yuzu-support/14">forums</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/issues/new/choose">GitHub bug report page</a> ― we only found out thanks to complaints on Reddit. This is a reminder to you, the users, please try to report issues in the proper channels! Doing so ensures we see the problems you are having and can work to fix them.</p>
<p>yuzu is a large project with many “black box” areas. There will be bugs, many thousands of bugs, that our team may never encounter. Your voice is so important, we hate to see any bug reports slip through the cracks outside of our channels.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, by <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11822" data-gh-pr="11822">creating random Miis</a>
 with names, german77 solved the issue.</p>
<p>german77 also <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11846" data-gh-pr="11846">expanded the character limit of cheats</a>
 to more than 64 characters.
Now you can cheat to your heart’s content.</p>
<p>You know our developers spend a lot of time opening and closing yuzu when byte[] can accurately measure that 10% of shutdown crashes are caused by the game list.
He found that the issue was in how Qt deals with messages from objects that were destroyed or disconnected (like stopping the emulator while the game list is loading).
By <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11846" data-gh-pr="11846">changing the behaviour</a>
 of how the game list is reported to those events, another source of shutdown crashes has been defeated.</p>
<h2 id="kernel-cpu-and-file-system-changes">Kernel, CPU, and file system changes</h2>
<p>byte[] has been having a lot of “fun” lately fixing and implementing kernel changes.
First off, he <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11686" data-gh-pr="11686">fully implemented transfer memory,</a>
 fixed <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11766" data-gh-pr="11766">incorrect page group tracking,</a>
 <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11914" data-gh-pr="11914">updated the implementation</a>
 of KPageTableBase, and has now <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11843" data-gh-pr="11843">nearly completed</a>
 the entire KProcess implementation!</p>
<p>As preliminary work for NCE support coming in the near future, byte[] implemented <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11718" data-gh-pr="11718">native clock support</a>
 for arm64 devices running on Linux or Android.
There is no support for ARM Windows devices for now, as none have bothered to include a Vulkan driver yet.</p>
<p>The kernel was updated to reflect changes made in <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11748" data-gh-pr="11748">firmware version 17.0.0,</a>
 ensuring support for future games.</p>
<p>v1993 <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11772" data-gh-pr="11772">solved some warnings</a>
 that were spamming our build logs ― namely, using <code>std::forward</code> where appropriate, and qualifying <code>std::move</code> calls.
This should solve build issues for those experimenting with Darwin build targets.</p>
<p>By user request, byte[] <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11774" data-gh-pr="11774">further improved the build performance of RomFS mods</a>
 by getting rid of some unnecessary object copies.
This also fixed a file handle leak, which now allows modders to edit mod files after stopping emulation, helping them work faster on those <em>juicy and delicious</em> game mods.</p>
<h2 id="audio-changes">Audio changes</h2>
<p>Thanks to user reports, our audio connoisseur, Maide, found that <code>Ancient Rush 2</code> would crash at the end of the first developers screen.
<a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11735" data-gh-pr="11735">Clearing the DSP buffer</a>
 after each execution fixes the issue.</p>

<p>Speaking of audio, byte[] delivered another resounding victory in the shutdown department by <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/11778" data-gh-pr="11778">fixing a deadlock</a>
 in the audio renderer.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-section">Hardware section</h2>
<p>We have some sad news for the old Red Team guard, a warning for the Green Team, and very good news for Adreno droids.</p>
<h3 id="nvidia-our-fault-this-time">NVIDIA, our fault this time</h3>
<p>The 545 and 546 series of drivers have solved the high VRAM usage crashes we reported this last month, but users are reporting new crashes in games with these drivers.
Reverting to the 53X series of drivers solves the problem, but this time, it’s not NVIDIA’s fault!
Mesa also has many new crashes with the 24.0.0 release, and having the top two drivers crashing under the same conditions is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>We found that the problem is in how we are recompiling shaders ― the types of some variables are mismatched.
The fix will take some time to implement, so for NVIDIA and Mesa users experiencing crashes in games like <code>Bayonetta 3</code>, we suggest not updating your drivers for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="amd-giving-a-last-hurrah-to-polaris-and-vega">AMD, giving a last hurrah to Polaris and Vega</h3>
<p>The time has come. The last 2 remnants of the GCN architecture are on their way to be discontinued.
AMD started releasing <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21126/amd-reduces-ongoing-driver-support-for-polaris-and-vega-gpus">split drivers</a> for those products, which run outdated Vulkan driver branches compared to RDNA and newer hardware.
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-24.0-Faster-RADV-Vega">The news</a> of AMDVLK, the official Linux AMD driver, killing support for these products means no new Vulkan drivers will be available.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean the show is over for their owners.
For the time being, no new change breaks compatibility with the cards, and Linux Mesa drivers like RADV will continue to provide support, most likely extending it past what the Windows drivers report as supported (as is usually the case with Mesa).</p>
<p>But for those stuck on Windows, this is the last ride.</p>
<p>GCN4.0, GCN5.0, you weren’t the most efficient cards, but you gave us good value in the worst moments, <em>years</em> of amazing gameplay, and great FineWine moments.
We salute you and thank you for your impeccable service, few GPU architectures leave the stage with such a round of applause.</p>
<p>o7</p>
<h3 id="turnip-a-very-quickly-improving-work-in-progress">Turnip, a very quickly improving work-in-progress</h3>
<p>yuzu uses a single codebase for all its releases, upstream/master/main, however you prefer to call it, Mainline, Early Access, and Android all start from there.
When improvements to the codebase are added, they eventually reach all releases, Android included.</p>
<p>We recently added improved support for <code>occlusion queries</code> (part of project Y.F.C.) to Android to increase performance and accuracy on all devices. But occlusion query support on Turnip drivers with Adreno 725 and 730 GPUs was not working correctly, and this took us a very long time to find.
Users experienced crashes that forced them to remain on outdated <a href="https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu-android/releases/">GitHub</a> versions, and we needed to stall a new Play Store release until the problem was investigated and properly solved.</p>
<p>The issue was found, reported, and resolved by Mesa in record time in their current Adreno 700 branches, which then driver packagers like <a href="https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers/releases">K11MCH1</a> use to build packages Qualcomm users can load on emulators.</p>
<p>For this reason we <em>strongly</em> recommend Adreno 730 and Adreno 725 users to update to the latest <a href="https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers/releases/tag/24.0.0-R-X">Release X</a> driver, which not only fixes the crashes caused by occlusion queries, but also the lack of support for the Adreno 725 and some variants (yes, there are several) of the Adreno 730.
It isn’t only desktop GPU vendors who love to rename things.</p>
<p>By using this driver, we were able to launch newer Android builds with the latest upstream changes, and all Qualcomm users can safely use the latest GitHub builds if they prefer.</p>
<p>By the way, the GitHub builds are now properly signed. Rejoice, as you can now update from one to the next without needing to uninstall first.
If you want to test experimental and potentially unsafe (but maybe faster) changes before Play Store updates, it’s now much easier.</p>
<h2 id="future-projects">Future projects</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with what most people want to hear about: Project Nice for Android devices.
NCE (Native Code Execution) is progressing very well, but there are still some bugs to iron out.
Games are becoming not only playable, but also <em>faster</em> on devices with thermal restrictions. Additionally, the time spent loading and closing games has been significantly reduced now!
NCE has helped us understand issues in our CPU emulation in x86_64 too, so expect gains on both fronts.</p>

<p>Blinkhawk is <em>suggesting</em> that your writer informs you he is working on a new project seeking to make the GPU process-agnostic, allowing multiprocess emulation within the GPU.
No fancy names this time, we’ve simply been calling this “Multiprocess” internally.
Multiprocess is a mandatory step towards UMA support, which will provide huge gains for iGPUs and SoC users, as well as reducing RAM consumption.</p>
<p>That’s all folks! Apologies for the delay, university homework and finals are killing your writer.
Thank you for reading until the end. See you next time!</p>

<p>Thank you all so much! The original post got such a great response it would be rude not to tell you more about the project.</p>

<h2 id="0-how-i-came-up-with-the-idea">How I came up with the idea.</h2>







<p><br>Yes, I know that the mouse is quite questionable in terms of convenience, but the main driver of my idea was these two clips.</p>



<p>Some time ago, I saw this video and immediately thought of what I needed to do to solve the author’s problem:</p>







<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>A year later, I saw this video and decided my time had come:</p>







<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="1-the-idea">The idea</h2>



<p>It became obvious to me that I should just charge the battery and do not to connect mouse schematics, well as it turns out it worked. Not without some interesting findings, though.</p>



<p>To make it ergonomic and prevent problems with the sensor (which is not working perfectly as it is) I will have to divide the mouse into 2 halves. I was prepared to have to lengthen the cable from the top part (touch sensor), but luckily, the standard length turned out to be enough.</p>







<h2 id="2-implementation">Implementation</h2>



<p>The found models did not fit at all. I had to do it myself, and the first attempts were quite …. ugly, what can I say?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="850" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=1024%2C850&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=1024%2C850&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=300%2C249&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=768%2C637&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?w=1465&amp;ssl=1 1465w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>







<p>Moreover, all the Magic Mouse 3d models I’ve found aren’t perfect either. So, I adjusted the shape of the enclosure step by step, just by eye. It’s a concept, after all 🙂<br>Create-&gt; print -&gt; Adjust -&gt; print -&gt; Adjust -&gt; print -&gt; etc…</p>

<p>A last, but probably not the final option. After all, there is no limit to perfection. But if I were to perfect it, I’m afraid the project would never see the light of day</p>

<p>In the photo, you can notice a frame-adapter for the upper part of the mouse. It was made in only four iterations</p>

<p>Its task is essentially to repeat and extend the original mount (which, by the way, is quite difficult to disassemble without breaking anything off).<br>There is also a place for a spring (a long metal part near the button) and an offset lever that presses the button.</p>

<p>I was so confident of success that I didn’t even bother to see if the charging idea would work.<br>Better late than never. The labeling on the battery is not standard (3.61V), but according to the tests, it is a normal one cell that can be charged to 4.2V, which is defined as 100% in the OS.</p>

<p>When I charge the battery using my BMC (TP4056) the mouse is not aware that it is in the process of charging.<br>The TP4056 raises the voltage to ~4.258V when the charge is complete. And then shuts down, and the battery stays at ~4.2V.</p>



<p>So here’s the finding:<br>If we monitor the percentage of charge in the OS, we see <strong>100%</strong> at 4.15, and then the wonders begin.<br>At ~4.17V, the percentage drops to <strong>99%</strong>.<br>~4.19V – <strong>98%</strong><br>~4.21V – <strong>97%</strong><br>~4.24V – <strong>96%</strong><br>After charging is finished and I restarted the mouse, the percentage is back to <strong>100%</strong>.<br>Maybe I’ve found why the mouse is magical? 🙂</p>

</div></div>


<p>Next, I soldered a regular TP4056 directly to the battery outputs. Don’t have to make it complicated. With this battery capacity, it will do the job just fine, there is no need for additional current limiters. Just in case, I monitored the temperature while charging, and everything seemed to be working great.</p>

<h2>Assembling</h2>



<p>As in most advanced devices, I used double-sided tape to glue the battery on.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=768%2C578&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>







<p>However, double-sided tape was mostly used for assembly as well. By the way, for the first time, I tried printing on an FDM printer at 60 microns (0.06mm) resolution.</p>

<p>I installed this adapter into the top of the mouse and taped it to the battery so it could be disassembled for fine-tuning. Once the exact position has been selected, it makes sense to glue it firmly in place and snap the top part into place.</p>

<p>And then there’s the final view. I added high-tech hot glue (sarcasm) to secure the wires and USB-C port. If it works, why think of anything else?</p>

<p>Carefully connected the FFC cable and secured it with the native fasteners.<br>I added double-sided tape to the plastic extension adapter and simply taped it to the battery at the very end.</p>

<p>Final demo</p>

<p>That’s it.</p>



<h2>Sources</h2>



<p>repository in progress</p>



<h2>One more thing</h2>



<p>When I started working on the project, I immediately had very global plans.</p>



<p><br>Namely:</p>



<ol>
<li>Add RGB backlighting.</li>



<li>Add a Raspberry Pi RP2040 with an accelerometer to activate the backlighting.</li>



<li>Consider installing additional buttons connecting RP2040 to the Macbook with a separate BT channel or cable.</li>



<li>Install an additional battery to ensure the operation of the backlighting.</li>
</ol>



<p>Fortunately, I came to my senses in time. </p>

(I have since recorded podcasts with four other teachers at the studio and am completely unsure how to express my gratitude to Joe — honestly perhaps less words about it?) While I would be the one asking Joe questions on the podcast, he had an important question for me. With all the casual profundity of a yoga teacher, Joe asked, “<u>what is your earliest memory?</u>”<p>Without pause for an inhale I responded, “</p><u>probably a panic attack.</u>” I feel like Joe did his best asana poker face, based on projecting my own insecurities and/or the hyper-vigilant observance that comes with anxiety.<u>I began having panic attacks at a young age. I felt the impending doom of death before I had any concept of death.</u> (Do I really have any concept of death now, though? Does anyone??) I define panic attacks as feeling “too alive,” like diving off the deep end into awareness of existence without any proper scuba gear or knowledge of free diving. Panic attacks, I’ve learned, come like an ambulance flashing lights and blaring a siren indicating that my mind and my body are… experiencing a missed connection in terms of communication — they’re refusing to listen to each other. More accurately: my mind is disregarding the messages from my body, convinced she can think her way through feelings, and so my body goes into panic mode like she’s on strike."</li><li id="block97">Annie then basically proceeds to mention that "panic attack" doesn't quite feel like her first memory, but doesn't decisively settle on a "first memory." She concludes the article: "TBD on the first memory of that history. Here’s to exploring."<ol><li id="block98">This becomes relevant later on, as Annie ends up remembering an earlier memory than her panic attacks - Sam sexually assaulting her.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li id="block99"><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">Period lost, period found</a> - published Feb 21, 2019<ol><li id="block100">Annie started taking Zoloft at age 13 to help with symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety, and Depression.</li><li id="block101">Annie tapered herself off of Zoloft at age 22.</li><li id="block102">Annie graduated from college with a major in Biopsychology, a minor and dance, and also completed all of the prerequisite courses for medical school.</li><li id="block103">After graduation, Annie chose not to pursue a pre-med route, opting instead to focus on movement, writing, comedy, music, and food. She got certified as a yoga teacher, worked for an online CSA (community-supported agriculture) company, began writing more frequently, started slowly going to open mic nights and putting videos on YouTube, and began a podcast and this blog.</li></ol></li><li id="block104"><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/18-reasons-i-spent-18-years-criticizing-my-appearance-988b94f1b7df">18 reasons I spent 18 years criticizing my appearance</a> - published Mar 6, 2019<ol><li id="block105">Annie lists various reasons, including many related to mental illness and body image issues.</li></ol></li><li id="block106"><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/an-open-letter-to-relatives-b88d917b6f57">An open letter to relatives</a> - published Sep 22, 2020<ol><li id="block107">As I'll get to later on, I'm pretty sure that Annie published this shortly after (as she claims):<ol><li id="block108">Her millionaire relatives (esp. Sam and her mother) exploited a loophole to screw her out of the money that her Dad left for her in his will</li><li id="block109">Sam (through lawyers) told Annie she'd have to get back on Zoloft if she wanted the money</li><li id="block110">Annie had (and still was having?) extremely intense, nearly all-day PTSD flashbacks of the sexual assault she experienced in her childhood from Sam Altman, plus other forms of assault from all members of her nuclear family (except her Dad, I think.)</li><li id="block111">Annie had started publicly speaking out against Sam on social media, though this received surpisingly little attention/audience, which Annie thinks is due to Sam shadowbanning her posts.</li></ol></li><li id="block112">In light of this, to me, this letter seems to be somewhat sarcastic. Annie is "thanking" her relatives in a way that carries subliminal criticisms.&nbsp;</li><li id="block113">Example: "Thank you for strengthening my sense of self. I am where I am and doing what I’m doing in part because of each of you. My tenacity and gentleness to take care of myself has increased because of you. The lessons I’ve received from my relationships with you have shifted my perspectives beyond their limitations.

She was never going to be an <i>Übermensch. </i>She’s always been someone who felt the pain of the world. <u>At age 5, she began waking up in the middle of the night, needing to take a bath to calm her anxiety. By 6, she thought about suicide, though she didn’t know the word.</u>"</li><li id="block127">&nbsp;"When I visited Annie on Maui this summer, she told me stories that will resonate with anyone who has been the emo-artsy person in a businessy family, or who has felt profoundly hurt by experiences family members seem not to understand. Annie — her long dark hair braided, her voice low, measured, and intense — <u>told me about visiting Sam in San Francisco in 2018. He had some friends over. One of them asked Annie to sing a song she’d written. She found her ukulele. She began. “Midway through, Sam gets up wordlessly and walks upstairs to his room,”</u> she told me over a smoothie in Paia, a hippie town on Maui’s North Shore. “I’m like, <i>Do I keep playing? Is he okay? What just happened?</i>” The next day, she told him she was upset and asked him why he left. “And he was kind of like, ‘My stomach hurt,’ or ‘I was too drunk,’ or ‘too stoned, I needed to take a moment.’ And I was like, ‘Really? That moment? You couldn’t wait another 90 seconds?’” That same year, Jerry Altman died. He’d had his heart issues, along with a lot of stress, partly, Annie told me, from driving to Kansas City to nurse along his real-estate business. The Altmans’ parents had separated. Jerry kept working because he needed the money. After his death, Annie cracked. Her body fell apart. Her mental health fell apart. She’d always been the family’s pain sponge. She absorbed more than she could take now. <u>Sam offered to help her with money for a while, then he stopped. In their email and text exchanges, his love — and leverage — is clear. He wants to encourage Annie to get on her feet. He wants to encourage her to get back on Zoloft, which she’d quit under the care of a psychiatrist because she hated how it made her feel.</u> Among her various art projects, Annie makes a podcast called <i>All Humans Are Human.</i> The first Thanksgiving after their father’s death, all the brothers agreed to record an episode with her. <u>Annie wanted to talk on air about the psychological phenomenon of projection: what we put on other people. The brothers steered the conversation into the idea of feedback</u> — specifically, how to give feedback at work. After she posted the show online, Annie hoped her siblings, particularly Sam, would share it. He’d contributed to their brothers’ careers. Jack’s company, Lattice, had been through YC. <u>“I was like, ‘You could just tweet the link. That would help. You don’t want to share your sister’s podcast that you came on?’” He did not. “Jack and Sam said it didn’t align with their businesses.”</u></li><li id="block128">"In May 2020, she relocated to the Big Island of Hawaii. One day, shortly after she’d moved to a farm to do a live-work trade, she got an email from Sam <u>asking for her address.</u> He wanted to send her a memorial diamond he’d made out of some of their father’s ashes. “Picturing him sending a diamond of my dad’s ashes to the mailbox where it’s one of those rural places where there are all these open boxes for all these farms … It was so heavy and sad and angering, but it was also so hilarious and so ridiculous. So disconnected-feeling. Just the lack of fucks given.” Their father never asked to be a diamond. <u>Annie’s mental health was fragile. She worried about money for groceries.</u> It was hard to interact with somebody for whom money meant everything but also so little. “Like, either you aren’t realizing or you are not caring about this whole situation here,” she said. By “whole situation,” she meant her life.<u> “You’re willing to spend $5,000 — for each one — to make this thing that was your idea, not Dad’s, and you’re wanting to send that to me instead of sending me $300 so I can have food security. What?”</u>"</li><li id="block129">"The two are now estranged. <u>Sam offered to buy Annie a house. She doesn’t want to be controlled.</u> For the past three years, she has supported herself doing sex work, “both in person and virtual,” she told me. She posts porn on OnlyFans. She posts on Instagram Stories about mutual aid, trying to connect people who have money to share with those who need financial help."</li><li id="block130">"<span>Annie has moved more than 20 times in the past year.</span> When she called me in mid-September, her housing was unstable yet again. She had $1,000 in her bank account. <u>Since 2020, she has been having flashbacks.</u> She knows everybody takes the bits of their life and arranges them into narratives to make sense of their world. <u>As Annie tells her life story, Sam, their brothers, and her mother kept money her father left her from her.</u> As Annie tells her life story, she felt special and loved when, as a child, Sam read her bedtime stories. <u>Now those memories feel like abuse.</u> The Altman family would like the world to know: “We love Annie and will continue our best efforts to support and protect her, as any family would.” Annie is working on a one-woman show called the <i>HumAnnie</i> about how nobody really knows how to be a human. We’re all winging it."</li></ol><p id="block131"><i>Note</i>: Elizabeth Weil has stated the following on X in regards to her nymag article:</p><ol><li id="block132"><a href="https://twitter.com/lizweil/status/1709975840598130982">lizweil on X: "@RemmeltE This is also a story about the tech media &amp;amp; its entanglement with industry.

I believe this because:<i>&nbsp;</i><ol><li id="block139">Sam Altman posted a link on Twitter in 2018 to Annie's YouTube channel ("Go check out my sister on Youtube!")&nbsp;</li><li id="block140">Annie did an episode for her podcast featuring her brothers Sam Altman, Jack Altman, and Max Altman in 2018.&nbsp;</li><li id="block141">There are old newspaper reports in various places around the Internet listing Annie as a sibling of Sam, Jack, and Max Altman in, for example, obituary-type webpages related to the death and funeral of their father, Jerry Altman.&nbsp;</li><li id="block142">Both Sam Altman and Annie Altman spoke personally to Elizabeth Weil of nymag for her "Sam Altman Is the Oppenheimer of Our Age" article she published in Sept. 2023.&nbsp;<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/hgtgosg2nmisod5bzwft" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/jn9vaml8znaw7n3ydggr 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/hwxtvddzrx0gkdtkguun 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/xflg8zxlzglj4v09z79h 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/tmxgucyjfzgcpkjahxdk 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/jlbdngbvbc3l0ftvrwgu 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/ntjgldwhpmhq8anbzien 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/mgvucqbi9sh7cqhuifqq 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/w8wbqu57pvd30lf6glwd 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/ctxv8ureykhdgkqpoomk 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/kzjjjmj73n8sf8bmgfif 1446w"><i>Picture is taken from </i><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html"><i>this article</i></a><i>.

I believe this because:<ol><li id="block144">Sam shared a link to Annie's Youtube channel in 2018. From this, I infer he is aware of her other social media profiles, where she has made her claims about Sam.</li><li id="block145">Sam and Annie both personally interviewed Elizabeth Weil for her September 2023 nymag article. The article was published, and I infer that Sam, having consented to be interviewed for the article, knows that the article exists and has read it.</li></ol></li><li id="block146">Annie Altman has been posting consistently about being abused by Sam Altman (and Jack Altman, to a lesser extent) for about 4 years (~2019-present) across multiple social media platforms. Annie is largely self-consistent with the claims she makes over time.</li><li id="block147">In my view, Annie's claims have been paid little attention, considering the power and notoriety of the person about whom she is making them - Sam Altman - and the seriousness of the claims she has been making. Besides Elizabeth Weil's nymag article (<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">here</a>), there has been virtually <i>zero</i> (mainstream) media coverage of the extremely serious claims that Annie has consistently made many, many times against Sam Altman over the past 4 years.&nbsp;</li></ol><p id="block148"><i><span>So -- </span></i><span>since it seems like no writer or journalist on the planet, besides me, for some reason, has ever properly answered this question</span>, I'll take a swing at it:<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p id="block149"><i>What exactly has Annie Altman claimed about Sam Altman</i>?</p><h2 id="My_Personal_Understanding_Interpretation_of_Annie_s_story_and_the_chronology_of_her_life"><u>My Personal Understanding/Interpretation of Annie's story and the chronology of her life</u></h2><p id="block150">The following provides a chronology of Annie's life that I have constructed from her claims. This is <i>my understanding of her claims. </i>This is <i>not</i> me asserting that the following <i>has been proven to be true</i>, as it has not.</p><ol><li id="block151">In ~1998, when Annie is 4 years old, a 13-years-old Sam Altman non-consensually climbs into her bed (<i>implied</i>: sexually assaults Annie.) The specifics are unclear. All that Annie has stated is that Sam was something like her "first {sex work} client", that he used her to "help him figure out his sexuality", and that her brothers "touched her." (<i>implied</i>: in an inappropriate / nonconsensual way that would be classified as sexual abuse.)<ol><li id="block152">Annie, being 4 years old, does not form a concrete memory of this event that she fully understands / comprehends / accepts. That is, as she grows up and develops higher consciousness, sentience, intelligence, and self-awareness, <i>she does not remember what Sam did to her</i>, due to the fact that, when Sam sexually assaulted her (when she was 4 years old), <i>her brain was extremely young, and the event was extremely traumatic for her younger self in a way that was hard for her to even conceptualize, much less understand and remember</i>. Instead, Annie's "remembrances" of Sam's sexual assault of her manifest as extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts around the age of 5-6, and emotional and mental problems (e.g. issues with relationship with her own body, needing to take antidepressants, depression, etc.)</li></ol></li><li id="block153">Around age 5-6, Annie starts dealing with extreme anxiety and suicidal ideation. As Annie puts it, she "{tells} her birth mother about wanting to end this life thing and being touched by older siblings, and said 'mother' decided to instead protect her sons and demand to receive therapy and chores only from her female child."</li><li id="block154">As she grows up, though Annie does not have a complete memory of the sexual abuse she experienced in her early childhood, she practically embodies the dictionary definition of "symptoms common in those who have experienced sexual abuse in early childhood." Panic attacks, depression, body image problems, eating disorders, anxiety, suicidal thoughts - the list goes on.</li><li id="block155">Annie <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">starts using Zoloft at age 13</a> to help with symptoms of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), anxiety, and depression. She eventually tapers herself off of Zoloft at age 22.<ol><li id="block156">Zoloft becomes relevant again later on in Annie's chronology.</li></ol></li><li id="block157">Annie enters college. She ends up finishing college early (even though she was <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/my-denied-appeal-letter-for-early-college-graduation-dcd0ca74bca2">trying to graduate even earlier</a>, I think?). However, upon graduating, she is extremely depressed, and ends up forsaking the medical school route. Instead, she seeks out a place to live that, as <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">Elizabeth Weil writes</a>, "felt better to her. She wanted to make art." <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">In Annie's own words</a>, she "majored in Biopsychology in college, with a minor in dance, and took all the prerequisite courses for medical school. Then I noped out of the pre-med route to focus on movement, writing, comedy, music, and food. I got certified as a yoga teacher, worked for an online CSA (community-supported agriculture) company, began writing more frequently, started slowly going to open mic nights and putting videos on YouTube, and began a podcast and this blog."</li><li id="block158">At some point in 2018, Annie visits Sam in San Francisco and plays ukulele to an audience including Sam and his friends. While she is playing the ukulele, Sam abruptly, wordlessly gets up and walks upstairs to his room (as reported in the nymag article; see above.)&nbsp;<ol><li id="block159">The next day, Sam says something along the lines of "his stomach hurt" or "he was too drunk/stoned" or "he needed to take a moment." Annie finds this explanation to be odd.</li></ol></li><li id="block160"><a href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/jerold-altman-7862632">In May 2018, Annie's Dad dies.</a>&nbsp;</li><li id="block161">In Aug 2018, Annie starts a podcast, the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0SKQ3vKzn2pSYXWRWwWb7J?si=d7fb748fff654cb5"><i>All Humans Are Human</i> podcast</a>.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block162">Annie experiences "6 months of hacking into all her accounts" after <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/1-we-are-all-self-conscious-with-avram-ellner/id1428943256?i=1000417931953">starting her podcast (in 2018)</a>.</li></ol></li><li id="block163">On <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/all-humans-are-human/21-podcastukkah-5-feedback-GV1w9h8mJld/">Dec 7, 2018</a>, Annie records and publishes an episode of her podcast featuring Sam Altman, Max Altman, and Jack Altman: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/09LDNc5PMBfpJUr3M02Tcp?si=VUxVTmnRTnGGqfu5Mld04w">21. Podcastukkah #5: Feedback is feedback with Sam Altman, Max Altman, and Jack Altman</a>.<ol><li id="block164">At this point in time, Annie still has not yet remembered / processed what Sam did to her at age 4. This is why she is ok with doing this podcast episode with Sam and her other brothers.</li><li id="block165">Following the recording of Annie's podcast episode with her brothers Sam, Jack, and Max in 2018, Sam (and Jack) refuse to share a link to the podcast, citing the argument that it "didn't align with their businesses" (as reported in nymag; see above.)</li></ol></li><li id="block166">In 2019, Annie gets sick with PCOS, an IBS flare-up, a long-term problem with her Achilles (not sure on the specifics), and posterior tibial tendinopathy, as well as with a bout of tonsilitis.</li><li id="block167">Also, in 2019, about a year after her Dad's death, Annie is notified about being (as stated in her Dad's will) the primary beneficiary of her Dad's 401K.</li><li id="block168">In light of these situational factors, Annie makes a plan to quit her job for 6 months to focus on her health. <i>She notifies her relatives </i>(from what I understand, primarily: Sam Altman, Jack Altman, Max Altman, and her mother) <i>of this plan.</i>&nbsp;</li><li id="block169"><span>Annie carries out her plan as intended. However,</span><i><span> </span></i><span>Sam, as well as Annie's mother and some of her other relatives, exploit a loophole that allows them to withhold the money that Annie's Dad left to her in his will.&nbsp;</span><br><span>At some point, Annie is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709977862252658703"><span>connected with one of Sam Altman's lawyers.</span></a><span> Annie is told that she will only receive money if she starts taking Zoloft again (c.f. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1708193951319306299"><span>this source</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html"><span>this source</span></a><span>), which she had stopped taking at age 22 (c.f. </span><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830"><span>this source</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html"><span>this source</span></a><span>.)&nbsp;</span></li><span></span><li id="block170">As a result, Annie basically ends up sick <i>and </i>low on money. She sells some items, returns to an older job, and, for the first time, asks her millionaire brothers/relatives for money, who proceed to haggle her about it and give her a hard time. She does "two family therapy sessions", which terminate when she is professionally advised to stop doing such sessions.</li><li id="block171">She moves back to Big Island (Hawai'i.) For some reason, Sam offers to send her a diamond of her Dad's ashes, even though 1) Annie is low on cash, and could use cash much more than an expensive Dad-ashes-diamond, and 2) Annie's Dad wanted just cremation, not diamond-ification. Annie finds this to be a very odd / insensitive gesture.</li><li id="block172">At this point, Annie has begun speaking out against Sam on social media. She has also begun "survival sex work." That is, because she was sick and broke, her options for (more conventional forms of) employment were very limited, and thus she was forced to resort to sex work to financially support herself.</li><li id="block173">In 2020, Sam offers to buy Annie a house...but there's strings attached. She has to meet with a Sam Altman lawyer. Annie sees this as an attempt by Sam to increase his control over her / suppress her (and her speaking out against him on social media.) She <i>refuses</i> his offer (which she frequently references as a "no contact" or "no family" decision.)</li><li id="block174">In 2020, Annie begins having <i>intense</i>, nearly day-long flashbacks, which last for 18 months. That is -<i> she begins to remember, and realize, that Sam Altman sexually assaulted her at age 4</i>.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block175">From what I understand, these flashbacks are a part of PTSD (relating to Sam's sexual assault of her 4-year-old self) that Annie begins to experience (she mentions PTSD specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1710039374224933175">here</a> and <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/an-open-letter-to-the-emdr-trauma-therapist-who-fired-me-for-doing-sex-work-f5f537218b45">here</a>.)</li></ol></li><li id="block176">Annie seems to think (<a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709629089366348100">here</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709629659242242058">here</a>) that Sam was hoping that Annie would die or commit suicide before she could do too much damage to Sam' s reputation, carrying her knowledge to the grave.</li><li id="block177">Annie continues to speak out against Sam on social media, including through various posts on Twitter/X (c.f. the <i>Relevant excerpts from Annie's social media accounts</i> section of this post.)</li><li id="block178">In 2023, some of Annie's X posts receive newfound attention / rediscovery on X.<ol><li id="block179">One of the people who sees them first the first time is me.

This seems to potentially be part of a pattern of behavior wherein Annie tries to exploit the status of her brothers for her own gain."<ul><li id="block207"><i>My response</i>: I do think that this objection holds merit. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">In her nymag article</a>, Elizabeth Weil writes, "Among her various art projects, Annie makes a podcast called <i>All Humans Are Human.</i> The first Thanksgiving after their father’s death, all the brothers agreed to record an episode with her. Annie wanted to talk on air about the psychological phenomenon of projection: what we put on other people. The brothers steered the conversation into the idea of feedback — specifically, how to give feedback at work. After she posted the show online, Annie hoped her siblings, particularly Sam, would share it. He’d contributed to their brothers’ careers. Jack’s company, Lattice, had been through YC. “I was like, ‘You could just tweet the link. That would help. You don’t want to share your sister’s podcast that you came on?’” He did not. “Jack and Sam said it didn’t align with their businesses.”" I find this account to be <i>plausible</i>, yet do not think it entirely dispels the objection.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li id="block208"><i>Objection 3:</i> "It seems Annie has been dealing with a variety of severe mental and psychological ailments throughout her life.

It may well be that these claims are borne purely out these sorts of ailments of hers (or are of some other untrustworthy origin)."<ul><li id="block209"><i>My response</i>: I think this is a valid concern to raise. As with much of the information presented here, I would be interested in hearing more from Annie.</li></ul></li><li id="block210"><i>Objection 4</i>: "While Annie's claims are concerning, and her online activity and presence across a variety of media platforms does potentially support her claims, Annie has provided no direct evidence to corroborate her claims.

The idea of recovered memories was already discredited decades ago after the peak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_panic">satanic ritual abuse hysteria/panic</a> of the 80's.  At its peak some parents were jailed based on testimonies of children, children that had been coerced (both deliberately and indirectly) into recanting fantastical, increasingly outlandish tales of satanic baby eating rituals.  The FBI even eventually investigated and found 0 evidence, but the turning point was when some lawyers and psychiatrists started winning lawsuits against the psychologists and social workers at the center of the recovered memory movement.</p>
<p>Memories change every time they are rehearsed/reimagined; the magnitude of such change varies and can be significant, and the thin separation between imaginings (imagined memories, memories/stories of others, etc) and 'factual' memories doesn't really erode so much as not really exist in the first place.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some people's detailed memories from childhood are probably largely accurate, but some detailed childhood memories are complete confabulations based on internalization of external evidence, and some are later confabulations based on attempts to remember or recall and extensive dwelling on the past, and some are complete fiction.  No way with current tech to distinguish between, even for the rememberer.</p>
</div><div id="ejFAkp9msr2bpTFBc"><p>Bessel van der Kolk claimed the following in <i>The Body Keeps the Score:</i></p><blockquote><p>There have in fact been hundreds of scientific publications spanning well over a century documenting how the memory of trauma can be repressed, only to resurface years or decades later. Memory loss has been reported in people who have experienced natural disasters, accidents, war trauma, kidnapping, torture, concentration camps, and physical and sexual abuse. Total memory loss is most common in childhood sexual abuse, with incidence ranging from 19 percent to 38 percent. This issue is not particularly controversial: As early as 1980 the DSM-III recognized the existence of memory loss for traumatic events in the diagnostic criteria for dissociative amnesia: “an inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness.” Memory loss has been part of the criteria for PTSD since that diagnosis was first introduced.</p><p>One of the most interesting studies of repressed memory was conducted by Dr. Linda Meyer Williams, which began when she was a graduate student in sociology at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1970s</p></blockquote><p>... <span>(read more)</span></p></div><div id="PDyHgqK5aWGnWpt5W"><p>I know someone who recovered memories of repeated abuse including from the age of four later in their teenage years. The parents could corroborate a lot of circumstances around those memories, which suggests that they're likely broadly accurate. For instance, things like "they told their mother about the abuse when they were four, and the mother remembered that this conversation happened." Or "the parents spoke to the abuser and he basically admitted it." There was also suicidal ideation at around age six (similarity to Annie's story). In addition, the person remembers things like, when playing with children's toy figures (human-like animals), they would not play with these toy figures like ordinary children and instead think about plots that involve bleeding between legs and sexual assault. (This is much more detailed than Annie’s story, but remembering panic attacks as the first memory and having them as a child at least seems like evidence that she was strongly affected by something that had happened.)</p><p>Note that the person in question recovered these memories alone years before having any therapy.</p><p>It's probably easier to remember abuse (or for this to manifest itself in child beha... <span>(read more)</span></p></div><div id="bqXvsxhF9vDtxX9Ht"><p><span><div><p><span>8</span><span>Elizabeth</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>The chances she remembers it accurately? very small.

Is it true that someone with psychosis (assuming your judgement is correct) making an allegation of sexual abuse is more likely to be lying/mistaken than not?&nbsp;

I.e someone with psychosis making a claim like the above is less likely than someone without psychosis to be accurately interpreting reality, but is their claim more likely to be false than not? Your argument leans heavily on her having psychosis. Do people with psychosis make more false allegations of sexual assault that true allegations?&nbsp;

Breiding et al., 2014 estimates that around 19.3% of women in the US have been sexually assaulted. Assuming the rate is similar for people with psychosis, more than 1 in 5 women with psychosis would need to make false allegations for the base assumption to be "person has psychosis therefore their sexual assault claim is more likely false than true".</p></div></span></p></div></div></div><div id="nMNwxrMJdQTGzDyBf"><p>Bayes can judge you now: your analysis is half-arsed, which is not a good look when discussing a matter as serious as this. &nbsp;</p><p>All you’ve done is provide one misleading statistic.

<p>Why not?</p>
<p>A priori when a person makes a bunch of unlikely accusations in public, it would have been reasonable to first consider this as evidence of them not being truthful and sane. Since people are often not sane and/or liars, this is an important epistemic subroutine to have otherwise you are vulnerable to manipulation.</p>
<p>I don't really want to make this into a huge battle; you almost certainly don't have anything to change my mind (because I'm right) and I almost certainly won't change your mind (because your position is good for signaling/popular). I've mostly given up on these kind of battles because the supply of mindkilled virtue signaling is essentially limitless - but if you are going to disagree and take the epistemic high ground on LW I think you should have to justify yourself or retract the point.</p>

It's probably partly that, but it's also partly that it's considered impolite to point out when someone is mentally ill. In part this is because unfortunately doing so can strengthen a paranoid person's feeling of persecution.

When a friend of mine suffered a psychotic break, she had many technology related delusions, and she reached out to me for advice because I work in technology. I wasn't sure how to handle it so I consulted a professional. Under their advice, I gave her general advice on how to protect herself from breaches (strong passwords, HTTPS everywhere extension, etc.) and didn't otherwise try to disillusion her. My role as a friend was to stay her friend, not try to break her delusions. Paranoid people already have enough enemies, imaginary though they may be.&nbsp;

Of course, once delusions have been put into print, it's now a public forum. (One might question the ethics of publishing such an article). But politeness norms often extend into public forums.&nbsp;

This doesn't mean that these dissmissed women were indeed psychotic and/or wrong in their allegitions. Pre-me-too perception of the world is at least not necessarily more accurate.

If anything, happening of Me-Too movement is an evidence in favor of base rates of sexual assault being highter. You can't use it existence to lower the probability estimate of this particular allegation being true, without contradicting conservation of expected evidence.

Similarly, with mental health issues. They can be downstream of sexual abuse or they can lead to falsly believing that you were abused. Priviledging one hypothesis over the other requires some kind of evidence. What are the rates of abused person developping mental health issues, similar to what can be observed of Annie Altman? What are the rates of people with similar to Annie Altman issues having delusions about sexual assault?

You are comparing wrong numbers. As I've already said what we need to compare is the rate of this kind of mental health symptoms among people who were not sexually abused in their childhood and then developped delusions about sexual assualt with the probability of people being sexually abused in their childhood and then developping this kind of simptoms. This will give us a prior to distinguish between two hypothesis.&nbsp;

All the other complications like shadowbanning, family members conspiring, being written out of the will, etc. are not relevant to the main issue. A scenario where a girl was sexually abused as by her brothers, which resulted in her devolopping mental health issues, which lead her to inaccurately believe that she is shadowbanned in the internet isn't absolving for the brothers. Of course if the other allegations are also true/partially true it makes the situation even more severe. But they have to be examined on their own and not dissmissed all together.</p></div></span></p></div></div></div><div id="htzd7BtAA9upCLkPL"><div><p>I'm confused about and skeptical of the justifiability of all the downvotes this post received.</p><ol><li>If the allegations are true, well, I'm <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/sam-altman-s-sister-annie-altman-claims-sam-has-severely?commentId=hcqiBJCAKuXqC9tKP">not sure</a> how important exactly it is, but it seems at least like it passes the bar of "worth knowing about" pretty easily.</li><li>If something passes that bar pretty easily, I guess the next question is how plausible it is.

I think, though I did a pretty good job with being rational in this post, and trying to make rational, unbiased claims from/using the information that exists, I could have been a bit more refined and clear-cut.

I honestly feel a bit bad, because this is an important issue, and I hope I didn't screw things up by (unintentionally) presenting things in a irrational or biased way. I'll try to be very rational and unbiased in this comment.

I think my statement that I was "trying to figure out the truth" in an earlier comment was misguided and imprecise. You were keen to notice this. In a situation like this, there are large amounts of uncertainty, and there is currently no proof of misconduct (that I've seen.)

I think what this post does is {provide a (relatively) accurate description of the state of affairs regarding Annie's claims.} I do feel pretty good about the way in which I presented the information relevant to this matter in this post. Though I don't want to necessarily "take shots" at Elizabeth Weil, whose nymag article provided basically the only significant written third-party acknowledgment of Annie's claims, I will say that I prefer the (hopefully, more) objective, straight-from-the-source, uncertainty-acknowledging approach I've taken here.

The key thing here is that, currently, the primary information we have is:

 1. Claims that Annie has made on social media, as well as a few pictures of her from when she was sick that she took, and a few screenshots of her social media that potentially indicate, but do not provably or definitively, indicate that she experienced shadowbanning, let alone that the low engagement/shadowbanning occured because of Sam. It is important to avoid the conjunction fallacy:
    
    Let A = the event that Annie Altman, or (digital) media relating to her did indeed experience shadowbanning, low engagement, etc.
    Let B = the event that </p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="ewihvex9FczJayebj"><div><p>Also a practical question about how to interpret this is how reliable flashbacks that occur many years later the event without memory of the event in the time inbetween are.

<p>Like as far as I understand, dissociation is A Thing, but the people who talk about it still don't have a solid understanding of how it can or cannot work, and are often mistaken about the science of it and of trauma? (In particular overestimating the validity of some of the science.)</p>
<p>And conversely, some recovered memories are fake, but the people who talk about this tend to deny the possibility of dissociation and don't really have any scalable way of determining the validity or invalidity of such memories, so they just round it off to always being fake without having solid support for that?</p>

As I note in my response to "Objection 4", Annie has provided no direct evidence to corroborate her claims, to the best of my knowledge.&nbsp;

I also acknowledge that the links I provided (e.g. from saprea.org) do not meet rigorous standards that would enable me to label them as "scientific" or "empiric" evidence to corroborate Annie's account. I provide them merely as a way of noting that the symptoms that Annie's reported seem plausible.

As I mentioned, the intent of this post is to promote discussion about the claims that Annie has made, and to spread awareness of the fact that Sam has not yet responded to Annie's (very serious claims.) This post does not claim that Annie's claims are provably or indisputably valid. In fact, I think the opposite is true: her claims are not yet corroborated by direct evidence, and they certainly are disputable. I currently hold Sam Altman to be innocent, until proven guilty.&nbsp;

In spite of this, I still thought that this post was worth making, as a means of bringing attention to Annie's claims, which I think have a nonzero probability of being true in whole or in part.</p></div></span></p><div id="b39yT8g7p8f9yHpui"><p><span><div><p><span>3</span><span>tailcalled</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>This seems like a thing that, even if true, would not lead to any direct evidence?

Deviating a bit from your reply to the more general question of "What direct evidence could be provided (e.g. by Annie) to corroborate the claims Annie is making?" -- I do think that a potentially useful piece of evidence that could be provided to corroborate (some of) Annie's claims would be proof that:

I suppose the latter story would have less complexity penalty since it also explains the incest attraction and assault and not just the gynephilia.</p></div><div><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><img src="https://www.lesswrong.com/reactionImages/nounproject/inaccurate.svg"></span></span><span>1</span></span><span></span></span></span></span><span><span><svg fill="none" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="currentColor"><path d="m13 7c0-3.31371-2.6863-6-6-6-3.31371 0-6 2.68629-6 6 0 3.3137 2.68629 6 6 6 .08516 0 .1699-.0018.25419-.0053-.11154-.3168-.18862-.6499-.22673-.9948l-.02746.0001c-2.76142 0-5-2.23858-5-5s2.23858-5 5-5 5 2.23858 5 5l-.0001.02746c.3449.03811.678.11519.9948.22673.0035-.08429.0053-.16903.0053-.25419z"></path><path d="m7.11191 10.4982c.08367-.368.21246-.71893.38025-1.04657-.15911.03174-.32368.04837-.49216.04837-.74037 0-1.40506-.3212-1.86354-.83346-.18417-.20576-.50026-.22327-.70603-.03911-.20576.18417-.22327.50026-.03911.70603.64016.71524 1.57205 1.16654 2.60868 1.16654.03744 0 .07475-.0006.11191-.0018z"></path><path d="m6 6c0 .41421-.33579.75-.75.75s-.75-.33579-.75-.75.33579-.75.75-.75.75.33579.75.75z"></path><path d="m8.75 6.75c.41421 0 .75-.33579.75-.75s-.33579-.75-.75-.75-.75.33579-.75.75.33579.75.75.75z"></path><path d="m15 11.5c0 1.933-1.567 3.5-3.5 3.5s-3.5-1.567-3.5-3.5 1.567-3.5 3.5-3.5 3.5 1.567 3.5 3.5zm-3-2c0-.27614-.2239-.5-.5-.5s-.5.22386-.5.5v1.5h-1.5c-.27614 0-.5.2239-.5.5s.22386.5.5.5h1.5v1.5c0 .2761.2239.5.5.5s.5-.2239.5-.5v-1.5h1.5c.2761 0 .5-.2239.5-.5s-.2239-.5-.5-.5h-1.5z"></path></g></svg></span></span></span></p></div></div><div><div id="6BTBLpQ7ZmDGDqyKg"><div><div><p>My understanding is that perpetrator sexuality has little to do with the gender of chosen victims in child sexual abuse.

Obviously pedophiles are much more likely to sexually assault children than teliophiles are, and from what I've heard pedophiles are more likely to have no particular preference (or only weak preferences) for whether their victims are male or female. But pedophilic child molesters tend to have strong preferences for children, which is in tension with Sam Altman being attracted to adult men.

Alternatively I've heard that some teliophiles molest children out of opportunism, but that seems somewhat counterintuitive to me (in order to see children as a sexual opportunity, wouldn't they need to be attracted to them?). It's less counterintuitive if we're talking about teens (sexual attractiveness to teliophiles tends to gradually increase due to age, rather than suddenly spiking up at the age of consent), but that doesn't square with Annie being four years old. I'm pretty sure this type of child molester tends to have a correspondence between their preference for adults's sex and their preference for children's sex, but I also think their preference for children's sex is weaker than their preference for adult's sex.

These explanations are all making reference to the perpetrator's sexuality, though of course in much more complex and nuanced ways than gay/straight/bi.</p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="GcGdpqhgrMiySch6J"><p><span><div><p><span>8</span><span>DanielFilan</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>[epistemic status: i know nothing]

I do acknowledge that this may not provide an entirely satisfactory explanation of why a 13-year-old Sam (purportedly) chose to sexually abuse a 4-year-old Annie Altman.

While I agree that:

-- 13-year-old Sam Altman choosing to explore his sexuality by sexuality assaulting his 4-year-old sister is a psychologically infeasible (I do acknowledge that this is not exactly the claim you are making.)

I have seen Anne (Twitter) claim that her brother once touched her pussy and anus. The so-called sexual harassment (if the allegations are true) may not necessarily be driven by sexual desire. The gay boy who touched his sister's genitals may only be confirming (in reality rather than in pornographic magazines) whether he would be sexually aroused by a woman. We don't know if he had sexual contact with girls of his age during adolescence.

 1. I thought its users would probably understand the significance of a claim that Sam Altman has been quietly hiding the fact that he sexually assaulted his 4-year-old sister.
 2. I thought that its users would be good at calling me out on any logical/irrational bullshit that I (unintentionally) propagated. I want to be right, not to feel right. Say what you will about LessWrong, but its users do love to be quite exacting in their arguments about whether or not they think a person is making rational arguments. Indeed, I've modified this post, and my replies, many times in response to comments I've received in a way that I think has been to the benefit of the clarity of this post and its conveyance of my position. I'm glad that my karma score has jumped all over the place as I've updated my post - it means that LessWrong users are actually thinking critically about the degree to which I am being rational.&nbsp;

It seems to me, at this point, one of two things is true:

 1. Annie Altman is lying left, right,. and center, or is deluded, disconnected from reality, or just misinformed/misunderstanding things to the point that she believes she is telling the truth when she is not.
 2. She is not lying (at least, to some degree.)

We can debate whether Sam Altman's alleged offenses are relevant to this forum, but I don't think there's any case to be made that his sister's mental health or honesty is relevant to anyone here.

What could cause me to change my mind? Here are my cruxes.

If character assessment posts about particular people can be shown to cause a useful actions or ways of thinking for readers more often than they distract readers by unverifiable gossip.

If character assessment posts about particular people is used as a case study for reasoning about particular people to teach a broader lesson.

If character assessment posts about particular people allows community members to protect themselves from a real danger.

However, my beliefs are that these types of posts are juicy gossip that fuel idle speculation and status hierarchy games and serve no purpose except to make those who engage with content worse people who think more simplistically about human behavior and motivation. Even though this particular post is done fairly well for what it is, I think it is "bad form" and, perhaps, on the wrong site.</p></div></span></p><div id="AzseGSZ6pzwEJ5zqm"><p><span><div><p><span>4</span><span>Adam Zerner</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>It makes me happy to see such a cruxy comment like this. Thanks.

The cruxes seem reasonable. However, I feel like it's appropriate to upvote/downvote based on how confident you are on your position for each of them. Like, if it's really clear that a particular post will have the consequence of pushing people really far towards distracting gossip and away from useful actions, then downvote. If the opposite, maybe upvote. If it's unclear, probably do nothing.

Because this post is about the person who might be the most powerful person in the domain of AI, and thus is perhaps the most important person in the entire world, or even perhaps throughout history, I think it's actually a decently important topic. Because of magnitude, not probability. Like, even if there is a low probability that we figure out the truth, and of P(useful action | figure out truth), the magnitude of the positive impact could very well be large, and so it seems to me like a topic that is plausibly worth exploring. Enough that I upvoted it.

I think I personally have a tendency to see people like Sam Altman and Elon Musk and get caught up in thinking they're so awesome, and then am a victim of the halo effect. I find concrete examples of "wait, they frequently do things that aren't very awesome" helpful. I suspect the same is true for many others.</p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="F4Qoo7qQupEuaZNBW"><p><span><div><p><span>0</span><span>Adam Zerner</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>It makes things more difficult, but by wielding Bayescraft appropriately, discussion and updating can certainly still occur.
