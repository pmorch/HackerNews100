                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Car dealerships in North America continue to wrestle with major disruptions that started last week with cyberattacks on a software company used widely in the auto retail sales sector. </p><p>CDK Global, a company that provides software for thousands of auto dealers in the U.S. and Canada, was hit by back-to-back cyberattacks Wednesday. That led to an outage that has continued to impact operations.</p><p>For prospective car buyers, that’s meant delays at dealerships or vehicle orders written up by hand. There’s no immediate end in sight, with CDK saying it expects the restoration process to take “several days” to complete.</p><p>On Monday, Group 1 Automotive Inc., a $4 billion automotive retailer, said that it continued to use “alternative processes” to sell cars to its customers. </p><p>Here is what you need to know. </p><h2>What is CDK Global?</h2><p>CDK Global is a major player in the auto sales industry. The company, based just outside of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, provides software technology to dealers that helps with day-to-day operations — like facilitating vehicle sales, financing, insurance and repairs.</p>
    

<p>CDK serves more than 15,000 retail locations across North America, according to the company.</p>



<h2>What happened last week?</h2><p>CDK experienced back-to-back cyberattacks on Wednesday. The company shut down all of its systems out of an abundance of caution, spokesperson Lisa Finney said last week.</p><p>“We have begun the restoration process,” Finney said in an update over the weekend — noting that the company had launched an investigation into the “cyber incident” with third-party experts and notified law enforcement.</p>
    
<p>“Based on the information we have at this time, we anticipate that the process will take several days to complete, and in the interim we are continuing to actively engage with our customers and provide them with alternate ways to conduct business,” she added.</p><p>In messages to its customers, the company has also warned of “bad actors” posing as members or affiliates of CDK to try to obtain system access by contacting customers. It urged them to be cautious of any attempted phishing.</p>
    

<p>The incident bore all the hallmarks of a ransomware attack, in which targets are asked to pay a ransom to access encrypted files. But CDK declined to comment directly — neither confirming or denying if it had received a ransom demand.</p><h2>Are impacted dealerships still selling cars?</h2><p>Several major auto companies — including Stellantis, Ford and BMW — confirmed to The Associated Press last week that the CDK outage had impacted some of their dealers, but that sales operations continue.</p><p>In light of the ongoing situation, a spokesperson for Stellantis said Friday that many dealerships had switched to manual processes to serve customers. That includes writing up orders by hand. </p><p>A Ford spokesperson added that the outage may cause “some delays and inconveniences at some dealers and for some customers.” However, many Ford and Lincoln customers are still getting sales and service support through alternative routes being used at dealerships. </p><p>Group 1 Automotive Inc., which owns 202 automotive dealerships, 264 franchises, and 42 collision centers in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, said Monday that the incident has disrupted its business applications and processes in its U.S. operations that rely on CDK’s dealers’ systems. The company said that it took measures to protect and isolate its systems from CDK’s platform.</p>
    

<p>All Group 1 U.S. dealerships will continue to conduct business using alternative processes until CDK’s dealers’ systems are available, the company said Monday. Group 1’s dealerships in the U.K. don’t use CDK’s dealers’ systems and are not impacted by the incident.</p><p>With many details of the cyberattacks still unclear, customer privacy is also at top of mind — especially with little known about what information may have been compromised this week.</p><p>Cybersecurity experts have stressed that consumers connected to CDK (or a CDK-affilated dealership) should assume that their data may have been breached. Those impacted should monitor their credit — or even consider <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/buyline-personal-finance/article/how-to-freeze-your-credit">freezing their credit</a></span> as an added layer of defense — and be wary of any suspicious phishing messages.</p>
    

<p>In a statement last week, Mike Stanton, president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said “dealers are very committed to protecting their customer information” and were seeking updates from CDK to determine the scope of impact “so they can respond appropriately.”</p>

<p>Some time ago, Hillel Wayne published an article titled
<a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/microfeatures-id-like-to-see-in-more-languages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Microfeatures I’d like to see in more languages</em><svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
In this article, he described three kinds of features in <em>programming languages</em>:
fundamental features, deeply engrained features, and nice-to-have convenience features.
Hillel’s premise was that language designers tend to focus on the first two;
however, because the convenience features are relatively low-overhead, it’s
easier for them to jump between projects, and they provide a quality-of-life
increase.</p>
<p>I’ve been running a blog for a while — some of the oldest posts I’ve found
(which are no longer reflected on this site due to their low quality) were from
2015. In this time, I’ve been on the lookout for ways to improve the site,
and I’ve seen quite a few little things that are nice to use, but relatively
easy to implement. They don’t really make or break a website; the absence of
such features might be noticed, but will not cause any disruption for the reader.
On the other hand, their presence serves as a QoL enhancement. I find these to be
analogous to Hillel’s notion of “microfeatures”. If you’re interested in adding
something to your site, consider browsing this menu to see if anything resonates!</p>
<p>One last thing is that this post is not necessarily about microfeatures
I’d like <em>every</em> blog or personal website to have. Some ideas I present
here are only well-suited to certain types of content and certain written
voices. They need not be applied indiscriminately.</p>
<p>With that, let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes</h3>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwern<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> is, in my view, the king of sidenotes.
Gwern’s writing makes very heavy use of them (at least based on the articles
that I’ve read). This is where I originally got inspiration for
<a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/sidenotes/">my own implementation in Hugo</a>. Check out the page
on <a href="https://gwern.net/hydrocephalus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydrocephalus<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> for an example; Here’s what
a piece of that page looks like on my end at the time of writing:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/gwern-sidenotes.png" alt="A screenshot of Gwern's page on hydrocephalus. The main article text is accompanied by notes in both the left and right margin."><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of Gwern’s page on hydrocephalus</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sidenotes are nice because they allow for diversions without interrupting
the main article’s flow. You can provide additional details for the curious
reader, or — <a href="https://gwern.net/hydrocephalus#sn4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Gwern does<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> —
use the sidenotes for citing studies or sources. In either case, the reading
experience is significantly more pleasant that footnotes, for which you typically
have to go to the bottom of the page, and then return to the top.</p>
<p>Another reason I called Gwern the “king of sidenotes” is
<a href="https://gwern.net/sidenote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page on sidenotes<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>. There, Gwern documents
numerous approaches to this feature, mostly inspired by <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tufte CSS<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
The page is very thorough — it even includes a link to my own work, as unknown
as it may be! I would recommend checking it out if you are interested in
enhancing your site with sidenotes.</p>
<h3 id="tables-of-contents">Tables of Contents</h3>
<p>Not all personal sites include tables of contents (TOCs), but they are nice.
They serve two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seeing at a glance what the post will be about, in the form of headings.</li>
<li>Being able to navigate to an interesting part of the page without
having to scroll.</li>
</ol>
<p>Static site generators (I myself use <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>) are
typically able to generate TOCs automatically, since they are already generating
the HTML and know what headings they are inserting into the page. For instance,
Hugo has <a href="https://gohugo.io/methods/page/tableofcontents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>TableOfContents</code><svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
I suspect the same is true for other existing website technologies.</p>
<p>Despite this, I actually had to look relatively long to find sites I frequent that have
TOCs to show off as examples here. The first one I came across — after Gwern’s,
whose site will be mentioned plenty in this post anyway — is <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faster than Lime<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
Take this post on <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust’s Futures<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>;
this is what the top of it looks like at the time of writing:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/fasterthanlime-toc.png" alt="A screenshot of the table of contents on Faster than Lime. A box with the word &quot;Contents&quot; contains links to several sections on the page bellow (off screen)"><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of the table of contents on Faster than Lime</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The quality and value of TOCs certainly depends on the
sections within the page itself — and whether or not the page has sections
at all! — but in my opinion, the benefits to navigation become apparent even
for relatively simple pages.</p>
<p>As an honorable mention, I’d like to show <a href="https://lars.hupel.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lars Hupel’s site<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
The pages on the site don’t — as far as I can tell — have <em>internal</em> tables
of contents. However, pages that are part of a series — such as
the <a href="https://lars.hupel.info/topics/crdt/01-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduction to CRDTs<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> —
have tables of contents that span the entire series.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/lars-toc.png" alt="A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel's site. A box with the words &quot;Series Navigation&quot; contains links to several other pages in the series."><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel’s site</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I also find this very nice, though it does miss out on headings within a page.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-showing-page-progress">Bonus: Showing Page Progress</h4>
<p>I’ve mentioned that tables of contents can communicate the structure of the
page. However, they do so from the outset, before you’ve started reading.
In their “base form”, the reader stops benefiting from tables of contents
<span>
<label for="jump-top-note">once they've started reading.</label>
<span><span>[note:</span>
That is, of course, unless they jump back to the top of the post and
find the table of contents again.
<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>If you want to show progress while the reader is somewhere in the middle
of a page, you could use a page progress bar. I’ve noticed one while
reading <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quanta Magazine<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>; it looks like
this (recording my scrolling through
the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-square-root-of-2-became-a-number-20240621/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recent article at the time of writing<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>).</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/quanta-scroll.gif" alt="The progress bar on a Quanta Magazine article. As the page scrolls, an orange bar at the top gradually fills up from left to right."><figcaption>
      <p>The progress bar on a Quanta Magazine article</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One immediate thought is that this is completely superseded by the regular
browser scroll bar that’s ever-present at the side of the page. However,
the scroll bar could be deceiving. If your page has a comments section,
the comments could make the page look dauntingly long. Similarly, references
to other pages and general “footer material” count towards the scroll bar,
but would not count towards the progress bar.</p>
<p>Combining the two, you could imagine an always-visible table of contents
that highlights the current section you’re in. With such a feature, you
can always see where you are (including a rough estimate of how far into
the page you’ve scrolled), and at the same time see how the current section
integrates into the broader structure. I’ve seen this done before, but could
not find a site off the top of my head that implements the feature; as a
fallback, here’s the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/sticky-table-of-contents-with-scrolling-active-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS tricks tutorial<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
that shows how to implement a dynamic table of contents, and a recording

<h3 id="easily-linkable-headings">Easily Linkable Headings</h3>
<p>How can you link a particular section of a page to your friend? There’s a
well-defined mechanism to do this in HTML: you can use the ID of a particular
HTML element, and add it as <code>#some-id</code> to the end of a link to the page. The
link then takes the user to that particular HTML element. I can do this,
for instance, to link to the <a href="#sidenotes">sidenotes section above<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>.</p>
<p>How does one discover the ID of the part of the page that they want to
link to? The ID is not a “visual” property; it’s not displayed to the user,
and is rather a detail of HTML itself. Thus, on any given page, even
if every element has a unique, linkable ID, I can’t make use of it without
going into <strong>Inspect Element</strong> and trying to find the ID in the HTML tree.</p>
<p id="linked-paragraph">The simple solution is to make the elements that you want to be easily “linkable”
into links to themselves! Then, the user can right-click
the element in question (probably the heading) and click <strong>Copy Link</strong>.
Much easier! To demonstrate a similar idea, <a href="#linked-paragraph">here is a link to this paragraph itself</a>.
You can now use the context menu to <strong>Copy Link</strong>, put it in your browser,
and voilà — you’re right back here!</p>
<p>As with <a href="#tables-of-contents">tables of contents<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>, many website technologies
provide most of the tooling to add support for this feature. Relatively
often I come across pages that have unique IDs for each header, but no clickable
links! I end up having to use inspect element to find the anchor points.</p>
<p>A variation on this idea — if you don’t want to make the entire heading or title
a link — is to include alongside it (before or after) a clickable element
that is a link to that title. You can click that element to retrieve link
information, instead (and the icon additionally tells you that this is possible).
Hugo’s documentation does this: here’s a screenshot of
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/markdown-attributes/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an arbitrary page<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/hugo-titlelink.png" alt="A title and paragraph from the Hugo documentation. Next to the title there is a blue link symbol."><figcaption>

<h3 id="grouping-series-of-posts">Grouping Series of Posts</h3>
<p>Some authors like to write at length on a particular topic; to get the
content out to readers faster (and to make the resulting pages less daunting),
it makes sense to break a single topic up into a series. The easiest way
to do this is to just… publish several articles, possibly with related
names, and link them to each other. Done!</p>
<p>With a little more effort, though, the series-reading and series-writing
experience could be nicer. Instead of manually inserting links, you
could configure your website to automatically add a “next” and “previous”
button to pages in a given series. You could also give an overview of a particular
series and create a “navigation hub” for it.</p>
<p>As an example, the <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapel language blog<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> has navigation
buttons. Here’s a screenshot from <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/posts/aoc2022-day09-elvish-string-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post in the Advent of Code series<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/chapel-seriesnav.png" alt="Series navigation buttons on a Chapel blog post. There are two buttons; one links to a previous page in the series, another links to the next."><figcaption>
      <p>Series navigation buttons on a Chapel blog post</p>

</figure>

<p>I’ve mentioned this in the section on <a href="#tables-of-contents">tables of contents<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>,
but <a href="https://lars.hupel.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lars Hupel’s site<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> has tables of contents
that link between series. I’m not sure if it’s automatically generated
or hand-written, but it’s definitely nice.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/lars-toc.png" alt="A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel's site. A box with the words &quot;Series Navigation&quot; contains links to several other pages in the series."><figcaption>

<h3 id="dialogues">Dialogues</h3>
<p>I first came across dialogues on <a href="https://xeiaso.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xe Iaso’s site<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>,
but I think I see them used most often in posts on <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faster than Lime<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
As an example, here’s a little dialogue on <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep#it-s-waiting-for-the-first-one-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post about Rust’s futures<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
At the time of writing, it looks like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/fasterthanlime-dialogue.png" alt="A dialogue with &quot;cool bear&quot; on Faster than Lime. The page contains chat bubbles that alternate between a bear character and the author."><figcaption>
      <p>A dialogue with “cool bear” on Faster than Lime</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Using dialogues — even for technical writing — is not a particularly novel
idea. I know I’ve seen it in a textbook before; probably
this part of <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/dialogue-virtualization.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
It can help ask questions from a less-experienced point of view, and therefore
possibly voice concerns that a reader might themselves be having. And of course
— as with “cool bear” and Xe Iaso’s <a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many characters<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
— it can change the tone and make the page a bit more fun.</p>
<h3 id="code-blocks-with-origin">Code Blocks with Origin</h3>
<p>This one was recommended to me by a reader, and so I’ll be talking about
my page specifically!</p>
<p>When I was <a href="https://danilafe.com/series/compiling-a-functional-language-using-c++/">writing about making a compiler</a>,
a reader emailed me and pointed out that they were getting lost in the various
code blocks. My page displayed the code that I was writing about, but the
project had grown beyond a single file. As a result, I’d be making changes
midway through one file at one moment, and another file the next. This
prompted me to add decorators to my code blocks that look
something like this:</p>





<div data-base-path="" data-file-path="patterns/patterns.rb" data-first-line="3" data-last-line="8">
<table><tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span><span>7
</span><span>8
</span></code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="Ruby"><span><span><span>def</span> <span>sum_digits</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>while</span> <span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>9</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span><span>.</span><span>chars</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:to_i</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>n</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>end</span></span></span></code></pre>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</div>


<p>The decorator says what file the code is from, as well as what lines
are being presented. If you click the file name, the decorator links
to my Gitea instance, allowing you to read the code in context.</p>
<p>Though it’s not quite the same (in particular, it’s unfortunately missing
links), the Crafting Interpreters online book does something similar. It
describes changes to the code in words next to the changed code itself,
like “added after <code>MyStruct</code>”. Here’s a screenshot of the page on
<a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/local-variables.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local variables<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
at the time of writing.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/craftinginterpreters-codenotes.png" alt="Location notes on code in Crafting Interpreters. On the right of code blocks, a margin note describes the file and nature of the change."><figcaption>
      <p>Location notes on code in Crafting Interpreters</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think it looks quite elegant, and in some ways — specifically in
the verbal descriptions of what each change does — might be superior to my
approach.</p>
<p>It’s not quite the same thing, but <a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Gists<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>
can help approximate this feature. A Gist could contain multiple files,
and each file can be individually embedded into your page. Hugo in particular has
<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#gist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in support<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> for
Gists (and I’ve snagged that link using the docs’ <a href="#easily-linkable-headings">easily linkable headings<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>);
I suspect that other website engines have some form of support
as well. At the time of writing, an embedded Gist looks something like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/hugo-gist.png" alt="Code embedded in Hugo documentation using a GitHub Gist."><figcaption>
      <p>Code embedded in Hugo documentation using a GitHub Gist</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Clicking <code>list.html</code> takes you to the source code of the file.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-code-blocks-with-clickable-links">Bonus: Code Blocks with Clickable Links</h4>
<p>If we’re going for fancy code blocks, another fancy feature is provided
by the <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/what-is-agda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agda programming language<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
Agda can generate HTML code blocks in which every symbol (like a variable,
record name, function name) are linked to where they are defined. So if
you’re reading the code, and wonder “what the heck is <code>x</code>?”, you can just
click it to see how it’s defined.</p>
<p>It’s not simple to integrate Agda’s plain HTML output into an existing
webpage, but some projects do that. I took a stab at it in
my <a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/agda_hugo/">post about integrating it with Hugo</a>.
I wager this would be even harder for other languages. However, it leads
to nice results; my go-to is <a href="https://plfa.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming Languages Foundations in Agda<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
The online book introduces various concepts from Programming Language Theory,
and each code block that it shows is fully linked. This makes it possible
to jump around the page like so:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/plfa-goto.gif" alt="Navigating code blocks on a page from PLFA. I hover over then click a plus sign to see how addition is defined. I then do the same to see how natural numbers are defined."><figcaption>
      <p>Navigating code blocks on a page from PLFA</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="markers-for-external-links">Markers for External Links</h3>
<p>Some sites I’ve seen mark links that go to a different domain with
a little icon. If you’ve read this far, you’ve likely noticed that my
site does the same. Another good example of this — even though the CSS
is little rough at the time of writing — is <a href="https://jamesg.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James’ Coffee Blog ☕<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
I’ve taken the (small) liberty to adjust the color of the icon, which
I suspect is buggy in my browser.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/jamesg-external.png" alt="An external link on James' blog. The link is displayed as normal, and an additional diagonal arrow aiming up and to the right and surrounded by a square is displayed to the right of the link text."><figcaption>
      <p>An external link on James’ blog</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some websites (this one included) also make such links open in a new tab
automatically. That way, you tend to not lose the original article by clicking
through one of its references.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-different-markers-for-different-destinations">Bonus: Different Markers for Different Destinations</h4>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwern’s website<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> takes this idea further, by changing
the icon for external links depending on the destination. For instance,
links to Wikipedia articles are stylized with a little “W”, links to
Haskell.org are stylized using a lambda (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), and links to
<code>.zip</code> files have a little archive icon. There are more; I’ve found
the <a href="https://github.com/gwern/gwern.net/blob/959ba9c50d327a960e07241b2c7f13630bf8b80c/js/old/links.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link processing code on GitHub<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>,
and even the <a href="https://github.com/gwern/gwern.net/blob/959ba9c50d327a960e07241b2c7f13630bf8b80c/js/old/links.js#L380-L387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of websites that get their own icons<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>.
I could not find a verbal description, though.</p>
<p>Now for some pictures. Here are a ton of links from
the <a href="https://gwern.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“About”<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> page!</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/gwern-linkicons-wiki.png" alt="Links to Wikipedia on Gwern's blog. Each link is followed by a superscript &quot;W&quot;."><figcaption>

<h4 id="bonus-link-preview">Bonus: Link Preview</h4>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwern’s website<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a> has no shortage of cool ideas. Among
them showing link previews on hover. When hovering over a link, the site
displays a popup window that contains a view into that page. I suspect that
this view is also archived somehow, so that it retains a view into the
page that matches it at the time of writing.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I found this feature a little jarring at first.
As I would try to click links, I would get surprised by an additional overlay.
However, as I spent more time browsing the site, I grew quite accustomed to
the previews. I would hover over a link to see the first paragraph and
thus get a short synopsis. This worked really well in tandem with
<a href="#bonus-different-markers-for-different-destinations">per-destination marker icons<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>;
I could tell at a glance whether a link was worth hovering over.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/gwern-hover.gif" alt="Hovering over a link on Gwern's site. After the link is hovered over, a rectangular popup displays a section of the Wikipedia page the link goes to. I scroll through the section to the table of contents."><figcaption>

</figure>


<p>RSS is a feed standard that allows sites to publish updates. Blogs in
particular can make use of RSS to notify readers of updates.
RSS feeds are processed by a feed reader, which is a program that polls
a website’s <code>index.xml</code> file (or other similar files) and reads it to
detect new content. If you opt in to full-text RSS feeds, users can read
the entire post entirely from their reader.</p>
<p>RSS makes it easier to keep up with your site. Rather than having
to check in on every author whose content I enjoy on the internet, I can
add their feed URL to my list, and have my feed reader automatically aggregate
all updates for me to read. It’s kind of like a social media or news feed,
except that I control what’s shown to me, and authors of the blogs I follow
don’t need to create accounts and explicitly share their work on social media!</p>
<p>I don’t have any particular website to show off in this section; instead
I’ll show you a list of websites that I’m following in my feed reader of choice.
You might notice that a lot of these websites are listed here as inspiration
for other microfeatures.</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/feedbin.png" alt="A screenshot of my Feedbin list. Some sites include Hillel Wayne's, Faster than Lime, Drew DeVault, and the Chapel Language Blog"><figcaption>
      <p>A screenshot of my Feedbin list</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="links-to-other-sites">Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>This feature I first noticed on Drew DeVault’s blog. Every page on Drew’s
blog, at the bottom, has a section titled “Articles from blogs I read”.
For instance, on <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2024/05/24/2024-05-24-Bunnix.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a sample post<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>,
at the time of writing, I’m seeing the following footer:</p>
<figure><img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/drew-openring.png" alt="Links to other blogs from Drew DeVault's blog. The links consist of three side-by-side boxes, each with a title and brief excerpt."><figcaption>
      <p>Links to other blogs from Drew DeVault’s blog</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As indicated in the image, Drew’s site in particular uses a program
called <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>openring</code><svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#external-link"></use>
</svg></a>, which is based on
RSS feeds (another <a href="#rss-feeds">microfeature I love<svg>
    <use xlink:href="/feather-sprite.svg#arrow-up"></use>
</svg></a>). However,
<em>how</em> the site finds such articles (statically like <code>openring</code>, or
on page load using some JavaScript) isn’t hugely important to me. What’s
important is that you’re promoting other content creators whose work
you enjoy, which is the ethos of my favorite slice of the internet.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion--anything-else">Conclusion + Anything Else?</h3>
<p>Those are all the microfeatures that I could think of in a single sitting.
I hope that you have been inspired to integrate features like these into
your own site, or at the very least that you think doing so would be a good idea.</p>
<p>This list isn’t exhaustive. I’ve probably missed some good microfeatures!
If you can think of such a feature, let me know; my email address is linked
in the footer of this article.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and cheers!</p>

Prevent the doorbell chime going continuously, the circuit is interrupted by the doorbell button, which acts as a switch. The circuit is only active/complete when the doorbell button is pushed. Hence, your chime turns on when someone pushes the doorbell button.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-1024x512.png" alt="Shows an circuit/wiring schema for the DIY Smart doorbell" srcset="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema.png 1024w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-300x150.png 300w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-768x384.png 768w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-720x360.png 720w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-580x290.png 580w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-320x160.png 320w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-800x400.png 800w, https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/diy-doorbell-wiring-schema-600x300.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>DIY Smart doorbell circuit schema</figcaption></figure><p>The image above should give you an idea of the result of this article. Basically, you are going to split your doorbell circuit into two separate circuits. One circuit detects the doorbell button push; the other circuit controls the chime. This split allows for controlling those separately, e.g., detecting a doorbell push from Home Assistant, without activating the chime.</p><p>The device we are using is going to act as a sensor for the doorbell button push, and acts as a switch for the chime. Effectively, we are moving the activation of the chime from the doorbell button, to the new device. Our new device needs power, and since the one used consumes 5 volts. Any old USB phone charger you have, does the job just fine.</p><h2 id="1-smart-doorbell-stuff-youll-need">Smart doorbell stuff you’ll need</h2><p>To achieve this, you need some “stuff”. The $2 price tag is based on the actual device we are going to create, however, if you don’t have some of the needed tools, that would raise the total price. Nevertheless, the additional stuff is really cheap and are things that, in my humble opinion, every DIY home automator should have in their toolbox (for future projects).</p><p>Based on the country you are in, additional shipping costs may apply. I live in the Netherlands, and I’ve paid 1,80EUR in total, including shipping. Checking out the different sites for the right price helps. I’ve noticed the prices for these little boards vary, but getting it for around $2 is doable.</p><h3 id="2-the-main-components">The main components</h3><p>This project consists of just 2 parts. An ESP8266-based chip called the ESP-01S and a small board with a relay on it.</p><div id="ub_feature_box_0c870d0b-ced3-49fc-bf45-3ca5c48b54a4"><div> <p><img decoding="async" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/esp-01s.png" alt="Product image of the ESP-01S chip"></p><p><a href="https://frenck.link/esp-01s-relay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ESP-01S (opens in a new tab)">ESP-01S</a></p><p><em>The ESP-01S is one of the smallest WiFi boards available, that works ESPHome and Home Assistant.</em><br></p></div><div> <p><img decoding="async" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/esp-01s-relay-module.png" alt="Product image of the ESP-01(s) relay module board"></p><p><a href="https://frenck.link/esp-01s-relay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Relay module (opens in a new tab)">Relay module</a></p><p><em>This relay module board for the ESP-01(S), It comes pre-soldered, and the ESP will just slide on top of it.</em></p></div></div><p>The nice thing about these two is that they fit together, are pre-soldered and often sold together. There is also another version of the ESP chip, without the <strong>S</strong>, the ESP-01. That chip is viable for use as well, however, the ESP-01S is an improved version and has double the amount of memory. Since the price difference is just a couple of cents, I would highly recommend getting the <strong>S</strong> version.</p><p>The board needs to be powered and requires 5 Volts. Lucky, most phone chargers provide those and I’m sure most of you have an old one around you could use.</p><p>That brings me to the shopping list of the main components needed:</p><ul><li><a href="https://frenck.link/esp-01s-relay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="An ESP-01S (opens in a new tab)">An ESP-01S</a></li><li><a href="https://frenck.link/esp-01s-relay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The relay module board for the ESP-01(S) (opens in a new tab)">The relay module board for the ESP-01(S)</a></li><li>An old phone charger, delivering 5 Volts</li></ul><h3 id="3-other-tools-and-hardware">Other tools and hardware</h3><p>Besides the main components, you’ll need some other things for building it as well. Without a doubt, you need some screwdrivers and a wire stripper. A pair of tweezers can also help put wires to place, and for modifying to the board later on.</p><p>The ESP01-S chip needs to be programmed. To do that, you’ll need an FTDI adapter. If you have ever flashed ESP chips before (e.g., SonOff switches), you probably already have one. If not, you should get one! It is an essential tool to have when you are into home automation.</p><p>Additionally, some wire is needed. I always have a bunch of Dupont cables in stock. They are really helpful in many many projects I’ve done. It allows you to wire up prototypes really quickly as well.</p><div id="ub_feature_box_81af68ae-6eb7-4909-952a-e05f03dc75f8"><div> <p><img decoding="async" src="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dupont.png" alt="Product image showing a bunch of Dupont wires"></p><p><a href="https://frenck.link/dupont" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dupont wires (opens in a new tab)">Dupont wires</a></p><p><em>Having a collection of Dupont wires with different male/female connector combinations, is useful to have around.

I’ve added a section at the end of the article for more information about this.</p><h2 id="5-modifying-to-the-esp-01s-chip">Modifying to the ESP-01S chip</h2><p>To make this setup work, you would have to make a small modification to the ESP-01S chip. Reason for this modification is that you have to free up an additional pin for connecting your doorbell button. These input/output pins, are called GPIO pins.</p><p>The ESP-01S has two GPIO pins available. Using the relay board, one of the GPIO pins is wired to the relay, the other is wired to a reset mechanism. Without this modification, a doorbell button push would result in a reset/restart of the chip, which of course, isn’t what we want.</p><p>Don’t worry, this modification is easy. We need to bend the GPIO2 pin from the ESP-01S. This allows you to access the pin for connecting the doorbell button, while disconnecting it from the relay board.</p><figure><p> <iframe data-placeholder-image="https://frenck.dev/wp-content/uploads/complianz/placeholders/youtubemS42qXhejKs-maxresdefault.webp" data-category="marketing" data-service="youtube" data-cmplz-target="src" data-src-cmplz="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mS42qXhejKs?feature=oembed" data-deferlazy="1" title="Freeing up GPIO-2 on a ESP-01S by bending the pin" width="720" height="405" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>The lost reset functionality is later be restored via a software switch in ESPHome.

I’m not going to make a full tutorial on how to set up ESPHome since that is really well covered on their website.

While to voltage is too high for the board, I could have used a little regulator to “step-down” from the 8 Volts to the 5 Volts required by the board.</p><p>These “step-down” are available for around a dollar on AliExpress. However, since I have enough older chargers I could use, and do have a power outlet available in my utility closet (where the doorbell wires are at); I saved myself the extra buck 😉.</p><h3 id="18-using-multiple-doorbell-buttons-eg-front--amp-backdoor">Using multiple doorbell buttons (e.g., front- &amp; backdoor)</h3><p>In some homes, there are multiple doorbells. E.g., one for the front door, the other for the back door. Mostly they are connected to the same chime. There are three ways to use this guide in those cases:</p><ol><li>Connect the doorbell push buttons in parallel to a single chip. This is fast and cheap, however, you cannot distinguish which button was pushed.</li><li>Connect two of those boards in parallel to the chime. You would need two boards and one chime, however, you can still distinguish the doorbell pushed.</li><li>Replace the ESP-01S and relay board with one of the bigger brothers. Those provide more GPIO pins. However, it would be more expensive compared to using just two of this project.</li></ol><h3 id="19-using-mqtt-eg-for-use-with-openhab">Using MQTT (e.g., for use with OpenHAB)</h3><p>Are you not using Home Assistant?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Apple has been found to be in breach of sweeping new EU laws designed to allow smaller companies to compete and allow consumers to find cheaper and alternative apps in the tech business’s app store. </p><p>
  The European Commission, which also acts as the EU antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple after an investigation launched in March.</p><p>
  “For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying consumers new opportunities and choices,” said Thierry Breton, the European commissioner responsible for digital markets, <a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1805138863091859564" data-link-name="in body link">on X</a>.</p></div><figure id="64fc8fbb-3ed2-4789-ae8a-1ad8879ce267" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:1,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Brussels accuses Apple of breaking EU rules; UK facing rise in economic Misery Index – business live&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;64fc8fbb-3ed2-4789-ae8a-1ad8879ce267&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/jun/24/uk-economic-misery-index-election-advertised-salaries-fall-ftse-stock-markets-business-live&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&quot;:true,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>In preliminary findings, against which Apple can appeal, the European Commission said it believed its rules of engagement did not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) “as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternatives channels for offers and content”.</p><p>The company has 12 months to comply before it face fines of up to 10% of its global revenues but the EU hopes ongoing dialogue will lead to compliance rather than sanctions.</p><p>In addition, the commission has opened a new non-compliance procedure against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Apple</a> over concerns its new contract terms for third-party app developers also fall short of the DMA’s requirements.</p><p>It is the third non-compliance investigation opened by the commission into Apple since the DMA came into force last year and the sixth launched in total, with two other inquiries outstanding into Google and one into Meta, the owner of Facebook.</p><p>At the heart of Monday’s findings are three elements of Apple’s practices, including fees charged to app developers for every purchase made within seven days of linking out to the commercial app.</p><p>The commission says a fee for such matchmaking is justifiable but what Apple charges goes “beyond what is strictly necessary”.</p><p>In its preliminary findings on its earlier investigation, the EU has reiterated that the new digital laws require Apple to ensure that developers should be able “free of charge to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases”.</p><div><p>As part of the new investigation, the commission is examining 0.50c charge, or “core technology fee”, Apple demands every time a developer’s app is installed on a phone.</p><p>
 The allegations that Apple is breaking EU law are the first against a tech company under the DMA, landmark legislation introduced last August to ensure six designated “very large online platforms” including Google, Amazon, Meta and ByteDance (TikTok) compete fairly.</p></div><p>The commission also found that Apple made it difficult for customers to find the pricing information, requiring them to “link out” to a webpage where a customer could then find the contract details.</p><p>“If the commission’s preliminary views were to be ultimately confirmed, none of Apple’s three sets of business terms would comply with article 5(4) of the DMA, which requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to steer consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers’ app stores, free of charge,” the Commission said.</p><p>The EU likened Monday’s preliminary findings to the halfway stage in a formal anti-trust investigation during which a company is shown a statement of objection and given time to rectify its anti-competitive practices.</p><p>Apple said it had made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in the past few months in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission investigators.</p><p>“We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created,” it said.</p><p>“All developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilise the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate. As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div>
<p>U.S. prosecutors are recommending to senior Justice Department officials that criminal charges be brought against Boeing after finding the planemaker violated a settlement related to two fatal crashes, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Justice Department (DOJ) must decide by July 7 whether to prosecute Boeing. The recommendation of prosecutors handling the case has not been previously reported.</p>
<p>In May, officials determined the company breached a 2021 agreement that had shielded Boeing from a criminal charge of conspiracy to commit fraud arising from two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving the 737 MAX jet.</p>
<p>Under the 2021 deal, the Justice Department agreed not to prosecute Boeing over allegations it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration so long as the company overhauled its compliance practices and submitted regular reports. Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle the investigation.</p>
<p>Boeing declined to comment. It has previously said it has "honored the terms" of the 2021 settlement, which had a three-year term and is known as a deferred prosecution agreement. Boeing has told the Justice Department it disagrees with its determination that the company violated the settlement, Reuters reported this month.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment.</p>
<p>The two sides are in discussions over a potential resolution to the Justice Department's investigation and there is no guarantee officials will move forward with charges, the two sources said. The internal Justice Department deliberations remain ongoing, and no final decisions have been reached, they added.</p>
<p>Criminal charges would deepen an unfolding crisis at Boeing, which has faced intense scrutiny from U.S. prosecutors, regulators and lawmakers after a panel blew off one of its jets operated by Alaska Airlines mid-flight Jan. 5, just two days before the 2021 settlement expired.</p>
<p>The sources did not specify what criminal charges Justice Department officials are considering, but one of the people said they could extend beyond the original 2021 fraud conspiracy charge.</p>
<p>Alternatively, instead of prosecuting Boeing, the DOJ could extend the 2021 settlement by a year or propose new, stricter terms, the sources said.</p>
<p>In addition to financial penalties, the strictest settlements typically involve installing a third party to monitor a company's compliance. The DOJ can also require the company to admit its wrongdoing by pleading guilty.</p>
<p>Boeing may be willing to pay a penalty and agree to a monitor, but believes a guilty plea, which typically incurs additional business restrictions, could be too damaging, said one of the sources. Boeing derives significant revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, including the Defense Department, which could be jeopardized by a felony conviction, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>Relatives of the victims of the two fatal 737 MAX crashes have long criticized the 2021 agreement, arguing that Justice Department officials should have prosecuted the company and its executives.</p>
<p>At a Senate hearing in June, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun acknowledged the company's shortcomings on safety and apologized to the families who lost loved ones.</p>
<p>Last week, the families pressed prosecutors to seek a fine against the planemaker of nearly $25 billion and move forward with a criminal prosecution.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In early 2015, Apple started stealth semiconductor fabrication activities in a facility located at 3250 Scott Boulevard in Santa Clara, California.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> &nbsp;Like some sort of Skunkworks, Apple codenamed the facility “ARIA” and even tried to use the codename on regulatory paperwork.</p><p>The ARIA semiconductor fabrication facility operated less than three hundred feet from thousands of homes where Gjovik lived in 2020. Also within 300 from the building were two public parks (Creekside Park and Meadow Park), picnic tables, outdoor fitness stations, and a children’s playground. Within 1,000 feet of ARIA there was also a church, a school, an elder care facility,&nbsp; and the San Tomas Aquino Creek and public trail. (San Tomas Aquino Creek flows to the Bay and then into the Pacific Ocean).</p><p>Apple intentionally vented its fabrication exhaust – unabated – and consisting of toxic solvent vapors, gases, and fumes – into the ambient outdoor air. The factory was one story, while the apartments were four stories tall, creating a high likelihood that Apple’s factory exhaust entered the interior air of the apartments through open windows and the 'fresh air intake' vents.</p><p>Apple was fully aware of this facility and its operations, including the vast amount of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, as every year, Apple submitted a financial assurance document to the Santa Clara Fire Department and HazMat agency, which detailed hazardous waste treatment and disposal operations, and is personally signed by Apple’s Chief Financial Officer, Luca Maestri – including affixing a company seal. Each financial assurance filing also attached a detailed confirmation letter from Apple’s third-party auditor, E&amp;Y, on behalf of Apple. Maestri was also on the email distribution list for notification of hazardous waste violations at the facility.</p><p>Upon initiating operations at ARIA, Apple was quickly cited for building, environmental, health, safety, and fire code violations in at least 2015 (stop work order due to construction without permits), 2016 (spill of cooling water into storm drains, fire code and CalASPA violations, health and safety code violations, failure to properly monitor wastewater discharge), 2019 (wastewater testing violations), 2020 (fire code violations, using two EPA identification numbers, inaccurate hazmat inventory data, no spill plans or training, no business permit, no signature from supervisor on records, and failure to properly monitor wastewater discharge again).</p><p>In February 2020, Gjovik moved into a large, new apartment complex at 3255 Scott Blvd (adjacent to ARIA) and quickly became severely ill. Gjovik suffered severe fainting spells, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, stomach aches, exhaustion, fatigue, and strange sensations in her muscles and skin. Gjovik also suffered bradycardia (slow heart rate), volatile blood pressure with both hypertension and hypotension and a high frequency of premature ventricular contractions (an arrhythmia). From February 2020 through September 2020, Gjovik was screened for multiple severe and fatal diseases and disorders, including Multiple Sclerosis, brain tumors, deadly arrhythmias, and Neuromyelitis Optica – instead, all of Gjovik’s symptoms were consistent with chemical exposure. Due to the solvent exposure, Gjovik also suffered skin rashes, burns, and hives, and her hair fell out and she had a shaved head for nearly a year as the bald patches slowly grew back.</p><p>Due to the sudden illness, Gjovik visited the Emergency Room on February 13 2020, and Urgent Care (at AC Wellness, Apple’s for-profit in-house clinic) on February 20 2020. Gjovik subsequently consulted with dozens of doctors, who screened her for all sorts of diseases, subjecting Gjovik to extensive blood draws, urine samples, injections, and scans – including potentially dangerous procedures like MRI and CT scans with contrast, of which Gjovik had multiple. Gjovik was too sick to work and went on disability.</p><p>Gjovik transitioned her medical care to a different clinic and provider after her Apple primary care provider at AC Wellness refused to help her triage her 2020 medical issues (due to exposure to Apple’s factory exhaust). Instead she suggested Gjovik could be suffering from anxiety, and enrolled Gjovik in an Apple internal user study related to blood pressure, requiring Gjovik share her iPhone medical and fitness data with Apple, and participate in weekly life coaching sessions (while being exposed to Apple’s solvent vapor and gas exhaust).</p><p>While sick in 2020, Gjovik would wake up occasionally at 3 AM feeling like she was dying and with symptoms of heart failure and asphyxia. Heart monitoring showed arrhythmias, bradycardia, and low blood pressure. On September 2 2020, Gjovik discovered elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) in her indoor air. What immediately captured Gjovik’s attention was the arge spike in VOCs had occurred the night prior, around 3 AM, while she had been suffering from one of these “dying” spells.</p><p>Gjovik sought out multiple occupational and environmental exposure doctors, who told Gjovik that all of her symptoms were consistent with solvent and other chemical exposures. After Gjovik discovered her medical issues at the apartment were due to a chemical emergency, Gjovik quickly filed complaints with Santa Clara City HazMat/Fire Department, California EPA DTSC and Air Resources Board, and US EPA. She also called Poison Control, who said what she described also sounded like Benzene exposure. (Apple reported it was exhausting Benzene into the air).</p><p>City Fire Department records for ARIA contain at least sixteen chemical spill/leak incident reports at ARIA within only three years. These incident reports included eight confirmed leaks/spills: leaks of phosphine and silane on June 1 2019 at 9:17 AM; a phosphine leak on October 21 2019 at 11:06 PM; a 17.5 PPM Tetraethyl Orthosilicate (“TEOS”) leak on July 17 2020 at 8:58 AM; a major phosphine leak on April 30 2021 at 8:29 AM (peaking at 32 PPB and 0.0001145 pounds of the gas vented into the exterior ambient air); a 5% fluorine gas leak on April 18 2022 at 10:42 AM, a Hexafluorobutadiene leak on May 29 2022 at 2:19 PM, and leaks of two unnamed toxic gases on September 20 2022 at 7:44 AM and December 21 2022 at 1:40 AM.</p><p>Notably, almost all of the reported toxic gas leaks during the time frames Gjovik had complained n 2020 that her symptoms seemed to always be the worst around 8-9 AM, 10-11 PM, and sometimes around 2-3 AM. One of the chemical spills that did not occur during those times of concern was root caused to an Apple engineer “accidently” turning on lethal fluorine gas. Similarly, another incident, the TEOS leak, was root caused to an Apple engineer accidently installing the gas for a tool “backwards.” Further, less than two weeks following the April 30 2021 phosphine leak, Apple’s manifests included sixty pounds of “v<em>acuum filters contaminated with glass dust</em>,” implying there may have also been a phosphine explosion.</p><p>Further, later in 2021-2022, Apple reported to the government. that in the year 2020, Apple released at least 7.8 tons (15,608 pounds) of VOCs and 260 pounds of the combustible solvent N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) into the exterior air around ARIA. Per a review of Apple’s manifests, Apple did not replace the carbon/charcoal in its exhaust system for over five years, with the first replacement occurring December 14, 2020 – only after Gjovik had notified Apple EH&amp;S and environmental legal about what occurred to her near ARIA.</p><p>In 2022, the US EPA severely restricted the legal use of NMP as <em>“it presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health</em>” under TSCA. Apple also reported that in at least 2019-2021, that ARIA exhausted reportable amounts of mercury, arsenic, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde into the ambient air around the factory. &nbsp;Further, Apple reported to the Bay Area Air Quality Management Board that ARIA exhausted an average of 16 pounds a day of isopropyl alcohol vapors.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik hired an industrial hygienist to test the indoor air at her apartment. She purchased an inspection, soil testing, and a two-hour sorbent tube-based TO-17 air panel. Only half the total contaminants were accounted for in the test and the California EPA informed her that testing with Summa canisters for 24 hours is superior and would have yielded better results. Still, Gjovik’s limited testing returned results showing a number of the chemicals in use by Apple at ARIA including Acetone, Acetonitrile, Acetaldehyde, Benzene, 1,2-Dichloroethane, Ethanol, Ethylbenzene, Hexane, Isopropanol, Isopropyl toluene, Methylene Chloride, Toluene, and Xylene.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik set up additional air monitors to observe the levels of VOCs in her apartment next to the ARIA factory (though she was not aware of the factory exhaust at that time). The results of the data validated what Gjovik had noticed with her symptoms and ad hoc testing – that the VOCs mostly spiked early in the morning and late at night as if they were being exhausted from an automated mechanical system (which it was). Gjovik notified several Apple executives of her findings and activities, including her managers Powers.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik’s blood and urine medical tests returned results with industrial chemicals, including arsenic, mercury, Toluene (Hippuric Acid), and Xylenes (2-3-4 Methyl hippuric Acid. Also noteworthy are the symptoms of Gjovik’s 3 AM attacks, (including both subjective reporting and physical real-time heart monitoring) match Phosphine and Arsine gas exposure. Both Phosphine and Arsine are very dangerous, exposure can be fatal, and there are no antidotes. Apple has a significant quantity of Arsine gas on site, and Gjovik’s medical tests from September 2020, on the morning after one of the 3 AM attacks, revealed significant arsenic in her blood with no other explanation than Arsine gas exposure within the prior eight hours.</p><p>Apple’s leaks, spills, and releases were not limited to the air. Apple’s wastewater discharge monitoring repeatedly showed the presence of heavy metals and organic solvents. In 2017, the government mandated testing revealed the presence of 29 μg/L of 1,1-Dichloropropane, 24 μg/L of &nbsp;Trichloroethylene (“TCE”), and 6.7 μg/L of Ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE). Among other issues, it’s unclear why Apple had TCE on site but not in any of its chemical inventories, and then, in addition, why exactly Apple was pouring that TCE down the drain.</p><p>&nbsp;ARIA reported an average daily water usage of around 44,000 gallons per day and the sewer pipes carrying ARIA’s discharges flowed downhill and directly around the apartment where Gjovik lived in 2020. In 2020, the government had already started investigating the plumbing at her apartment as a possible vector for some unknown solvent vapor pollution.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik noticed an Apple facility at 3250 Scott Boulevard across the street, which was also on the Superfund groundwater plume. Gjovik mentioned the facility to Apple on at least September 8, 9, 10, and 13, 2020 – inquiring if anyone was familiar with the area because Apple had an office there. Apple EH&amp;S and Gjovik had at least two phone calls. The woman who responded who was also actually in charge of Real Estate/EH&amp;S teams involved in Gjovik’s Superfund office at 825 Stewart Drive (“Stewart 1”) and the activities at ARIA.<br>​<br>In September 2021, the Apple EH&amp;S manager, Elizabeth, suggested that Gjovik use a special paid leave to move out of the apartment called ‘<em>extreme condition leave’</em> designated for disasters. Later, in September 2021, Apple Employee Relations conferred with Elizabeth about Gjovik’s environmental concerns only hours before Gjovik was abruptly terminated.</p></div><div><p>On February 21 2023, Gjovik discovered the semiconductor fabrication activities at ARIA. Gjovik posted on Twitter in real-time as she learned about it, expressing severe distress.[1] Until that day, Gjovik did not know it was Apple who was responsible for making her so ill in 2020. Further, until that day, Gjovik did not know the chemicals she was exposed to in 2020 were potentially lethal to human life.</p><p>Gjovik began researching the site and Apple's activities, with the findings making Gjovik feel compelled to file a formal complaint about Apple’s illegal conduct at ARIA. On June 23 2023, Gjovik filed complaints about ARIA to the US EPA, CalEPA, the city of Santa Clara, and Santa Clara County. Gjovik drafted a 28-page memo with dozens of exhibits. Gjovik also posted on Twitter that she did so and provided a public link.</p><p>The US EPA responded and took the lead on an investigation. Gjovik met with the US EPA’s RCRA Enforcement &amp; Compliance team several times before they then inspected Apple’s factory in August 2023 and January 2024. The August 17, 2023 inspection was coded as an RCRA “<em>Compliance Evaluation Inspection,</em>” defined as “<em>primarily an on-site evaluation of the compliance status of the site about all applicable RCRA Regulations and Permits</em>.”[2] The January 16, 2024 inspection was coded as a “<em>Focused Compliance Inspection</em>.”[3]&nbsp; Gjovik is still awaiting a report on the results. The US EPA notified her they finalized the report but are currently unable to share it with her as Apple apparently declared the report of their (assumed) numerous environmental violations is <em>Apple Confidential. </em>Gjovik has a pending FOIA request as well.</p></div><div><p><strong>Creation &amp; Maintenance of a Private Nuisance at 3250 Scott Blvd</strong></p><p>Apple created and maintained a condition in violation of Cal.Civ.C. § 3479. This nuisance was demonstrably injurious to health, which was indecent and offensive to the senses and obstructed the free use of property. By acting and failing to act, Apple created a condition or permitted a condition to exist that was harmful to health, offensive to the senses, an obstruction to the free use of property, and a fire, explosion, and poisoning hazard. Apple’s conduct in acting or failing to act was intentional, unreasonable, negligent, and reckless.</p><p>Apple is continuously casting pollution upon the property of the owner and tenants of adjacent properties, as it knew it would do when it constructed its exhaust and HVAC systems and hazardous waste handling systems. It knew then, as it knows now, that so long as it would continue its operation, the pollution would continue to fall, not by accident or mishap, but in conformity with the knowledge it had before the construction of the systems. Apple should be presumed to have intended its act's natural, known, and reasonable consequences.</p><p>Apple’s interference would and did substantially annoy or disturb persons of normal health and sensibilities in the same community. Apple’s operations at the factory and Superfund site are both continuing nuisances, and every continuation of the nuisance or trespass gives rise to separate damages claims. Apple has the agency and ability to stop the nuisance (it is not permanent), so until it does, the nuisance Apple created is continuous. &nbsp;Apple’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing Gjovik’s harm. Gjovik did not consent to a defendant’s conduct, and the seriousness of the harm outweighs the social utility of Apple’s conduct. Apple damaged Gjovik’s property and injured Gjovik’s person. Due to Apple’s actions, Gjovik’s property was destroyed, the leasehold degraded, she became very ill, and she suffered severe emotional distress.</p><p>In or about 2015, Apple constructed, or caused to be constructed, exhaust vents and open tanks at ARIA in Santa Clara, near the common border line of the defendant's and Gjovik’s property. The exhaust vents were installed and maintained negligently, recklessly, and unskillfully. Apple exhausted through the vents and emptied various materials or substances into the open tanks that caused a foul, obnoxious, and disagreeable odor and polluted the atmosphere / ambient air of Gjovik’s leasehold property.</p><p>Apple’s facility emits large quantities of vapors, dust, chemicals, and other contaminants into the air, which are carried by the natural winds and air currents onto Gjovik’s property and collect Gjovik’s chattel property and are generally injurious to Gjovik’s health, are offensive to the senses, and interfered with Gjovik’s comfortable enjoyment of life and property. Apple created the nuisance due to unnecessary, unreasonable, and injurious methods of operation of their business. The emissions were a business decision to be able to report reduced waste sent to landfills.</p><p><strong>Strict Liability for Ultrahazardous Activities at 3250 Scott Blvd</strong></p><p>Apple’s fabrication activities at ARIA provided a high degree of risk of significant harm to people and property, and the exercise of reasonable care could not eliminate the risk; the activity's benefits do not outweigh the risks, and these activities are inappropriate for the location, Apple’s activities at ARIA, directly adjacent to High-Density Residential and numerous sensitive receptors (including parks, schools, and playgrounds) is in violation of city and county zoning rules.</p><p>&nbsp;Apple’s facility was originally registered simply as an “R&amp;D Facility” (it appears Apple went to much effort to ensure no one knew they were doing semiconductor fabrication at the location). The ARIA building is located on “Light Industrial” zoned land (18.48), however semiconductor fabrication is expressly not allowed on any land other than “Heavy Industrial” zoned land (18.50). &nbsp;The state Fire Code also includes numerous other regulations targeted at the semiconductor fabrication processes (see, <em>e.g.</em>, Cal. Fire Code Ch. 17 – “Semiconductor Fabrication Faculties”).</p><p>Santa Clara City Code, Santa Clara County Code, and California Fire Code all explain that facilities which process raw materials (10.60.090) and require hazardous material and hazardous waste management, must be located in Heavy Industrial zoned land, must go through an application/review process, and may still be denied if their activities (and emissions) would create a nuisance for other industrial facilities in that area. Further, Santa Clara City Code requires that any industrial zoned properties be located at least 500 feet away from any Residential zoned properties.</p><p>Apple stored, used, treated, and released a large quantity of lethal gases at ARIA. Apple possessed and used substantial amounts of arsine, phosphine, silane, fluorine, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and phosphorus trichloride. In addition, many of Apple's chemicals at the plant were characterized as “<em>extremely hazardous substances</em>,”[1] “<em>highly toxic gases</em>,”[2] and/or “<em>acute and extremely hazardous wastes</em>.”[3] Regardless of other considerations, California Fire Code requires that any storage or processing of highly toxic gases occur no less than twenty feet away from the property lot line and public sidewalks.</p><p>Further, California Fire Code strictly prohibits the storage, use, or treatments of toxic gases within 75 feet of air intakes in adjacent buildings. This rule applies in Heavy Industrial zoning, where these activities should have been conducted. Apple intentionally venting unabated toxic gases and lethal chemicals into the ambient air only 250 feet from an open-air children’s playground – is exactly the policy justification for Ultrahazardous Activities tort enforcement as a common law zoning mechanism.<br>Apple conducted semiconductor fabrication activities, with extremely dangerous substances, openly dumping its unabated chemical exhaust into the ambient air, only 150 feet from High-Density Residential with thousands of apartments, and 250 feet away from two public parks and a children’s playground. The storage, use, treatment, and release of large quantities of highly toxic, extremely poisonous, acutely lethal gases – directly adjacent to an unsuspecting, High Density Residential area – and directly adjacent to public parks and children’s playgrounds –&nbsp; is an activity which, even when conducted with the greatest of care and prudence, can still cause severe injuries, fatalities, and mass human suffering (<em>e.g.</em> Bhopal). Thus, these activities – in this location, scenario, and context – are Ultrahazardous Activities.</p><p>Apple’s use, storage, and release (intentional and unintentional” of highly toxic gases can produce a dense cloud of lethal gas that would be large enough to engulf the apartments. Such an emissions could easily cause mass fatalities and severe suffering. The condition Apple created and permitted to exist resulted from Ultrahazardous Activities and for which strict liability should also exist.<br>Apple violated the spirit of the Clean Air Act, if not the law, which “<em>criminalizes knowing or negligent “releases into the ambient air [of] any hazardous air pollutant . . . or extremely hazardous substance” that give rise to imminent danger,</em>” [42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(4)– (5)]. Similarly, Apple’s activities likely violated RCRA when Apple “<em>knowingly transports, treats, stores, disposes of, or exports any hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter . . . in violation of … of this section [and] knows at that time that he thereby places another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury</em>.” [42 U.S.C. § 6928(e)].</p><p>Apple also released chemicals categorized by Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 17, § 93000 as “<em>Substances Identified as Toxic Air Contaminants</em>,” of which there is no safe level of exposure without “<em>significant adverse health effects</em>. “Apple released into the air chemicals categorized under 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(b) as “<em>Hazardous Air Pollutants</em>” and Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 17, § 93001 as “<em>Hazardous Air Pollutants Identified as Toxic Air Contaminants</em>.”</p><p>Apple was engaged in Ultrahazardous Activities that caused Gjovik to be harmed. Apple’s activities were the proximate cause of that harm, and Apple is responsible for that harm. People who engage in ultrahazardous activities are responsible for the harm these activities cause others, regardless of how carefully they carry out these activities. Apple damaged Gjovik’s chattel property (discoloring, weakening, dissolving glues, causing reactions), degraded her extremely expensive leasehold conditions, and harmed Gjovik’s mind and body.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                With LINQPad, you can interactively query databases directly in LINQ (as well as SQL). The big win with LINQ is having <b>association properties automatically generated for all relationships</b>
                (inferred from foreign key constraints), so you can access related rows without joining! LINQPad uses a custom high-performance scaffolding engine behind the scenes, and includes drivers for SQL Server, SQL Azure,
                Oracle, SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL.
            </p>

            <p>
                When dumped, association properties appear as lazy hyperlinks that can be expanded <b>just by clicking on them</b>. You can walk your entire database interactively!

                        LINQPad’s Dump method is famous for its capacity to eat almost anything! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tuned with numerous heuristics, it intelligently walks object graphs for the best possible output. It even turns lazy objects into hyperlinks 
					    and asynchronous values into placeholders whose content materializes in the future!

                        With its support for advanced C# features such as <b>async</b> / <b>await</b> and <b>unsafe</b>, 
                        LINQPad is capable of serious rapid coding work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8DY5DndmxI" target="_blank">writing a neural network from scratch</a>!

                    <p>
                        Reference project assemblies from your Visual Studio solution, and use LINQPad as an interactive test harness.
                        Or use LINQPad to provide <b>instant entry points into any part of your solution</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use LINQPad for build scripts and to automate cloud management tasks. LINQPad includes
                        an integrated password manager for securely storing API keys, and a MSAL/OAuth frontend 
                        for multifactor authentication that preserves tokens across executions.

                        Step through your code with a lightweight debugger, and move around quickly with symbol navigation, outlining and bookmarking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        LINQPad is also a <b>great way to learn C#</b>: it comes with all 1300 examples from the book, <a href="https://www.albahari.com/nutshell/">C# 12 in a Nutshell</a>,

            <span>Abstract:</span>The expression problem describes how most types can easily be extended with new ways to produce the type or new ways to consume the type, but not both. When abstract syntax trees are defined as an algebraic data type, for example, they can easily be extended with new consumers, such as print or eval, but adding a new constructor requires the modification of all existing pattern matches. The expression problem is one way to elucidate the difference between functional or data-oriented programs (easily extendable by new consumers) and object-oriented programs (easily extendable by new producers). This difference between programs which are extensible by new producers or new consumers also exists for dependently typed programming, but with one core difference: Dependently-typed programming almost exclusively follows the functional programming model and not the object-oriented model, which leaves an interesting space in the programming language landscape unexplored. In this paper, we explore the field of dependently-typed object-oriented programming by deriving it from first principles using the principle of duality. That is, we do not extend an existing object-oriented formalism with dependent types in an ad-hoc fashion, but instead start from a familiar data-oriented language and derive its dual fragment by the systematic use of defunctionalization and refunctionalization. Our central contribution is a dependently typed calculus which contains two dual language fragments. We provide type- and semantics-preserving transformations between these two language fragments: defunctionalization and refunctionalization. We have implemented this language and these transformations and use this implementation to explain the various ways in which constructions in dependently typed programming can be explained as special instances of the phenomenon of duality.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission joined regulators in four states to sue four men behind a notorious telemarketing company called Outreach Calling. The FTC alleged that the company, which it described as a “sprawling fundraising operation,” had raised millions on the promise of helping the needy — cancer patients, veterans, firefighters — but instead used the money to line its pockets.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">The case was meant to put fundraisers on notice. The FTC would not only go after charities that improperly spent donor dollars, but it would “aggressively pursue their fundraisers who participate in the deception,” a news release said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">The executives and corporate entities behind the operation were fined more than $58 million. They were also banned from all charitable fundraising for life. But regulators kept one door open in most of the settlements: the ability to continue fundraising for political purposes.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">For Thomas Berkenbush, who was a co-manager at Outreach, that provision would prove to be a windfall.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Before the deal with the FTC was even finalized, Berkenbush filed paperwork to establish a new company, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Office+Edge&amp;toggle=expenditures">Office Edge LLC</a>. Since then, Office Edge has been paid about $866,000 for fundraising from organizations that similarly claim to be working on behalf of cancer patients, veterans and firefighters. The difference? These groups are not charities, they’re political nonprofits that claim to use donations to influence elections and support broad political causes.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">The groups that are hiring Berkenbush are <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/">known as 527s</a>, after a section of the tax code. They include federal political action committees — organizations that raise money to elect or defeat candidates and are regulated by the Federal Election Commission — but also a lesser-known group of nonprofits. These 527 groups limit their direct support to political candidates, removing them from the jurisdiction of the FEC or similar state agencies and leaving their regulation to the IRS. They do not have restrictions on how much donors can contribute, but the donations are not tax deductible.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">A ProPublica investigation has connected Berkenbush to a network of at least 10 of these 527 groups that have raised more than $33 million on the promise of supporting admirable causes, but that have spent little on activities that could be construed as having a political purpose. Most of the money goes to fundraisers who have only been paid by 527s in the group ProPublica identified.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Experts say that it’s hard for the public to follow the business practices of 527 groups because of how difficult it is to access the records that the IRS publishes about their activity. Data about 527 organizations is published on an <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/political-organizations/political-organization-filing-and-disclosure">IRS website</a> in a hard-to-use data file with a limited search interface. On top of that, experts said that there is lax oversight by the federal agencies in charge of regulating the groups.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">“There is no enforcement whatsoever,” said William Josephson, the former head of the charities bureau within New York’s attorney general’s office. “It’s just not a big enough issue for the IRS.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">None of the organizations responded to ProPublica’s requests for comment. But during the process of our reporting, the eight groups that have websites added prominent “Transparency Statements” with essentially identical language.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">“We advocate for the needs of veterans, by informing voters of these needs and asking them to take action. This is our only purpose,” the <a href="https://www.disabledvetspac.org/transparency-statement.html">statement</a> for the National Coalition for Disabled Veterans reads. It also says, “When you make a contribution, we want you to know that a minimum of 90 cents of every dollar will be dedicated to covering our fundraising costs and outreach efforts.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">The IRS did not respond to questions from ProPublica about our findings in any detail. The FTC declined to comment on why some of the settlement agreements in its case against Outreach Calling permitted political fundraising. The New York attorney general’s office, whose lawyers played a significant role in the case, told ProPublica that it can’t prohibit political fundraising because of First Amendment protections. But it maintained that the settlement agreements forbid the defendants from engaging in any fraudulent conduct while fundraising, regardless of the organization’s tax status or stated purpose.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Under the terms of the settlements, the defendants — who did not admit or deny any of the allegations in the FTC complaint — were required to submit yearly compliance reports to New York, disclosing all fundraising activity for five years after the agreement was reached. The office confirmed that some of the defendants have reported business activity with 527 groups but did not say whether this prompted any investigations. Berkenbush did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">“They really do need it,” he said in an interview. “They’ve worked hard enough to deserve it.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">Eggers has given at least $1,500 to the nonprofit in the past three years. He said his phone rings two to three times a day with different causes asking him for money. However, there is scant evidence the organizations calling Eggers do what they claim.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">The American Breast Cancer Coalition, for example, has taken in nearly $9 million from donors since 2019 and has spent less than half of 1% of that on “voter advocacy and outreach.” The rest of the money — millions of dollars — goes to companies with names like <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Action+Committee+Marketing+LLC&amp;toggle=expenditures">Action Committee Marketing</a>, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Capital+Vendor+Management+Inc&amp;toggle=expenditures">Capital Vendor Management</a> and Berkenbush’s Office Edge. Berkenbush’s company pulled in $222,000 just from this one organization.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">The network has paid millions to a handful of other vendors, including one of Berkenbush’s former colleagues at Outreach Calling, whose company brought in more than $3.4 million in expenditures. He and his firm did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">Another man, Alan Bohms, was paid more than $575,000 by the American Breast Cancer Coalition through a company he controlled named <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=%22Campaign+Marketing+Inc.%22&amp;toggle=expenditures">Campaign Marketing Inc.</a>, which also did business under the names <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=%22Insight+Data+Management%22&amp;toggle=expenditures">Insight Data Management</a> and <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Prestige+Tax+%26+Payroll&amp;toggle=expenditures">Prestige Tax &amp; Payroll</a>. The company has taken in close to $1.5 million from the network of nonprofits ProPublica identified. Bohms was not a member of Outreach Calling or subject to the FTC order, but he has previously paid the company millions to fundraise for one of his nonprofits.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">In an email, Bohms defended the money that the groups spend on fundraising, writing that the phone calls are central to “educating and engaging the community about the PAC’s mission and objectives.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">Even on their surface, the connections between these groups are obvious: Six of the organizations in this network have websites that were built using the same platform and share similar designs. All but one process donations using an obscure payment system also used by several political nonprofits that federal prosecutors began investigating after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/14/us/politics/scam-robocalls-donations-policing-veterans.html">New York Times story</a> last year.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">At least half of the organizations ProPublica identified worked with the same Morristown, Tennessee-based accounting firm on their IRS filings, Purkey, Carter, Compton, Swann &amp; Carter. Bohms also uses the firm for his own nonprofit, the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/465432355">Volunteer Firefighter Alliance</a>, telling ProPublica that the firm maintained high standards of integrity. The firm did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">Fire departments across the country warned people against donating to Bohms’ charity, and both he and the charity were written about in a 2020 <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/12/09/meet-the-man-at-the-center-of-a-shadowy-multimillion-dollar-scam-pac-network/">Salon story</a> that connected Bohms to a network of “scam PACs.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">“VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER ALLIANCE is a FRAUD!” exclaimed one 2021 post on Facebook from the Alpha Fire Company in Centre County, Pennsylvania. “Do not give money to this organization! They are not your local fire company.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Records show that one of the charity’s main fundraisers was Outreach Calling, the company shut down by the FTC. The Volunteer Firefighters Alliance paid $4.8 million to the company for fundraising in total. Bohms defended Outreach’s work, telling ProPublica that he “found Outreach Calling to be very professional and had never experienced any problems with them.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Bohms’ family members also appear to help run the nonprofits that pay his companies. His sister, Julie Forsythe, is listed as the treasurer of the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/orgs/843763242/">National Cancer Alliance</a>, which “works to establish the end of childhood cancer by making it a state and national priority.” Another organization, the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/orgs/853307234">National Coalition for Disabled Veterans PAC</a>, reports its treasurer as Bohms’ aunt, Judith Gragert. In the last five years, these two organizations have raised over $7 million from more than 700 donors around the country.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">Like all of these groups, neither used much of the money they raised in support of their stated efforts. Effectively all of the expenditures that both groups reported were for either fundraising or other administrative costs. Together, the organizations paid more than $300,000 to Campaign Marketing Inc., the company owned by Bohms.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Gragert and Forsythe did not respond to requests for comment. Bohms told ProPublica that he works with 527 groups “strictly in the capacity of a vendor,” and that the payments made to his companies were for legitimate services. He denied any involvement in decision-making at the groups that listed his aunt and sister as treasurer.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">“It is important to understand that the payments made to fundraisers encompass more than just fundraising activities,” Bohms wrote in an emailed <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24762422-alan-bohms-response">response</a>. “These funds support a broad range of outreach efforts, including phone calls and direct mail campaigns that are designed to inform the public about the PAC’s goals and initiatives.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">At least one of the groups ProPublica identified has been sued over its fundraising practices. A pair of call recipients filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status in 2022 against the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/orgs/854325630">National Police &amp; Sheriffs Coalition PAC</a>. Lawyers for the plaintiffs alleged that the group used prerecorded voice calls to contact potential donors without their consent, in violation of FCC rules that are meant to protect consumers from telemarketers.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">“Many of these PACs are illegitimate,” said Eric Weitz, whose law firm is on the team representing plaintiffs. “They prey on people’s political leanings.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">One of the defendants named in the lawsuit was Frank Pulciani, the organization’s treasurer. Pulciani maintained that prerecorded messages were not improperly used in calls to donors, and that the fundraising company the group hired was responsible for ensuring that calls complied with the law. Pulciani settled with the plaintiffs for undisclosed terms, and the organization was dissolved in February of last year.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">Pulciani is also closely connected to Bohms. The two men, who both produce and act in low-budget films, recently worked on a project called “Murder by Association.” In its trailer, posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uhl2kxE_BU">YouTube</a>, Bohms and Pulciani can be seen decked out in suits and dark sunglasses.</p>

<h3>Used and Abused</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">For Eggers, the donor who gave to the American Breast Cancer Coalition, the revelation that some of the organizations he’s been supporting are using almost none of what they raise for their stated purpose was discouraging.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">“I feel like I’m being used and they’re being abused,” he said, referring to those he aimed to help with his donations.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">On the mantle above Eggers’ fireplace rests a selection of plaques, framed photographs and certificates that showcase his commitment to giving. One award from 2012, titled “Lending a Helping Hand,” recognizes his 31 years of volunteering for a local organization providing services to the homeless. Another, from a regional branch of the American Red Cross, celebrates his donations to a blood platelet program.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">“Through your much-needed support, we hope to educate the public about our nation’s important Breast Cancer health bills,” reads the letter, thanking him for his donation. It noted that the group was not a charity —&nbsp;key to the FTC order against former Outreach Calling employees. And further down, it stated, “A large portion of proceeds from this campaign are used to defray the costs of fundraising.”</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="Quest-for-the-Ideal-Portable-Linux-Device">Quest for the Ideal Portable Linux Device</h2>
<p>After my 2016 MacBook Pro experienced multiple hardware issues and was sent for recycling, I no longer have a personal laptop. Until recently, if I wish to do some programming in a coffee shop or during a family trip, my only options are the corporate-provisioned MacBook or my iPad Pro 2020, neither of which is ideal. I had hoped the iPad Pro could be more productive and tried various setups involving <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/coder/code-server">code-server</a> and remote development, but I encountered many limitations. Furthermore, the fact that Apple has restricted iPadOS, preventing me from installing any software I want, has become increasingly uncomfortable for me in light of the recent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">Digital Markets Act</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24105363/apple-doj-monopoly-lawsuit">antitrust</a> discussions.</p>
<p>I adore the form factor of the iPad Pro as a travel computer, and the concept of a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macpad-how-i-created-the-hybrid-mac-ipad-laptop-and-tablet-that-apple-wont-make/">MacPad</a> is indeed extraordinary. However, I’m hesitant to invest significant time and money into a custom product that might not have the bless of its manufacturer. Additionally, memories of the Microsoft Surface have resurfaced. I owned a Surface 3 many years ago but sold it due to its performance not meeting my needs, eventually replacing it with a Hades Canyon mini PC.</p>
<p>As I’ve become more immersed in Linux, both through my <a href="https://mudkip.me/2024/01/31/My-2023-Homelab-Setup/">Homelab VMs</a> and my <a href="https://mudkip.me/2024/03/28/Notes-on-EndeavourOS/">desktop PC</a>, the idea of owning a portable Linux device appeals to me. However, I must confess that I’m not fond of the design of most mainstream non-Apple laptops, and Linux-friendly laptop brands like Framework, System76, and Starlabs are not yet available in my region. I’ve experimented with Asahi Linux on my iMac, and while it offers a generally great experience, the ARM Linux ecosystem, especially with 16K pages, doesn’t quite meet my daily needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m in search of a Surface-like device that offers good performance, runs Linux well, and is ultraportable. Although the Surface Pro 10 was released just as I began my search, Microsoft’s pricing strategy—essentially doubling the price of the whole device for adequate RAM and SSD—is unacceptable to me. It seems Microsoft has taken the wrong lessons from Apple in this regard, and I believe such pricing strategies should be considered unethical.</p>
<h2 id="Discovering-the-V3-Tablet">Discovering the V3 Tablet</h2>
<p>During my search, I discovered an intriguing product from Minisforum, a manufacturer renowned for creating NUC-like mini PCs, which has gained popularity within the Homelab community. The tablet, named “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minisforum.com/page/v3/index.html">V3</a>,” has been in development for over a year. Initially, it was developed by another manufacturer with an AMD Ryzen 7 6800U processor. Later, Minisforum took over the project, replacing the processor first with the 7840U, and ultimately with the 8840U in the final product.</p>
<p>The tablet features a 14" 2.5K 165Hz P3 color touch screen, a 50.82Wh battery, four speakers, front and rear cameras, and face and fingerprint unlocking, along with two USB4 ports. Surprisingly, it also features a USB-C port labeled “VLink” or “DP-in,” enabling the tablet to function as an external display for other devices. This is a feature I’ve long believed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://indieweb.social/@mudkip/112041394562007832">should be standard on all screens</a> and regret its absence in recent iMacs. My curiosity was piqued about how Linux would perform on this device.</p>
<p>The tablet was released on March 29 locally, and its price was set at 6999 CNY (~968 USD) for the configuration with 32GB DDR5 RAM and a 1TB SSD—a price point I consider quite reasonable. Early buyers were offered a keyboard case at no extra cost and had the opportunity to purchase the MPP 2.0 stylus for just 200 CNY (~28 USD). Moreover, it was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bf421o7Qa/?t=1417">mentioned</a> that Linux runs on this tablet, with support for Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.10, albeit with “only a few minor issues” that are currently being addressed. I placed my order on day one and have been playing with it over the past few weeks.</p>
<h2 id="Initial-Experience">Initial Experience</h2>
<p>My first impressions of the V3 tablet were less than ideal, primarily due to Minisforum’s approach to selling and shipping the initial units. Although the kickstand and keyboard case were offered for free to early buyers, there was a catch: they were shipped <em>after</em> leaving a review on the online retailer JD. The absence of both the kickstand and the keyboard significantly detracted from the user experience. Additionally, a bug in Windows 11 prevented me from creating a PIN code to complete the setup, a problem that could only be resolved by connecting a USB keyboard. Placing the tablet on a table without the kickstand led to the air opening on the back being covered, which is far from ideal for airflow.</p>
<p>I believe that shipping the free kickstand and keyboard with the tablet would lead to more positive reviews by significantly improving initial customer satisfaction. I hope global customers won’t have to wait for the kickstand, keyboard, and stylus to be shipped separately, as international shipping could add to the frustration.</p>
<p>The V3 tablet comes with Windows 11 Pro, a detail I find quite welcoming, even I primarily intend to use Linux desktop on this device, as most laptops in this price range only come with the Home edition of Windows. The Pro edition grants users more control over BitLocker encryption, which is crucial for a portable device. Additionally, Hyper-V is important for those who need to install VMs on Windows.</p>
<p>The screen’s color and brightness are exceptional. Initially, I didn’t anticipate the 165Hz refresh rate to be a significant feature for this tablet, assuming that most games would struggle to run at 2K on the integrated GPU and that I didn’t have any videos exceeding 60Hz to watch. However, the difference in UI smoothness between 60Hz and 165Hz is stark, making it hard for me to revert to the lower refresh rate.</p>
<p>It’s somewhat disappointing that the tablet’s resolution is only 2.5K; at this screen size, I believe 2.8K or 3K would be optimal for 200% integer scaling. Nonetheless, given that KDE and Wayland now adequately support fractional scaling at 175% and the AMD GPU has good Wayland compatibility, this resolution is acceptable. Consequently, content on the V3 tablet appears as sharp as on MacBooks other than 14 and 16 inch MacBook Pro, which has 254 pixels per inch.</p>
<h2 id="Linux-on-the-Device">Linux on the Device</h2>
<p>Unlike my desktop PC, which runs EndeavourOS, I chose Fedora KDE for this tablet. My preference for Fedora stems from its relatively newer kernel and desktop environment, as well as its out-of-the-box support for secure boot. The latter is particularly crucial for a portable computer, allowing me to enable full disk encryption and set up automatic decryption via TPM with <code>systemd-cryptsetup</code>. My choice to stick with KDE was primarily due to its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pointieststick.com/2022/06/17/this-week-in-kde-non-blurry-xwayland-apps/">excellent support</a> for scaling Xwayland applications. Although many GTK4 apps appeal to me—and I can still use them within KDE—GNOME has continued to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/xwayland-fractional-scaling-like-in-kde/17617">refuse</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/any-news-on-fixing-xwaylands-blurry-fractional-scaling/18163">to address</a> the issue of Xwayland apps appearing blurry on HiDPI displays.</p>
<p>I was concerned about hardware support on Linux, but my experience turned out to be reassuring. The touchscreen, keyboard, touchpad, Wi-Fi, USB, Bluetooth and suspend/sleep all work without any issues. It’s surprising that the fingerprint reader on the power button works right out of the box. After adding my fingerprint in KDE settings, not only can I use it on the lock screen, but I can also use my fingerprint to unlock <code>sudo</code> commands in Konsole with no extra setup. Both the front-facing and back cameras work well. I didn’t try face unlocking because I actually prefer using touch over face recognition.</p>
<p>Most apps I installed on V3 are similar to those on my desktop PC, only I use <code>dnf</code> instead of <code>pacman</code>. I don’t need to configure Wayland for Chromium and Electron apps, as Xwayland performs well with an AMD GPU. I couldn’t get Timeshift working with a btrfs filesystem inside a LUKS partition, so I switched to <code>btrfs-assistant</code> and <code>snapper</code> for automatically creating snapshots.</p>
<p>Enabling hardware acceleration for video playback in Fedora is somewhat weird. I need to add the RPMFusion repository and switch from <code>mesa-va-drivers</code> to <code>mesa-va-drivers-freeworld</code> to enable H.264 and HEVC hardware decoding, due to some absurd patent law issues.</p>
<h2 id="Using-the-V3-as-a-Linux-Tablet">Using the V3 as a Linux Tablet</h2>
<p><img src="https://mudkip.me/images/2024/04/v3-2.jpg" alt="KDE Tablet Mode and Handwritten Notes in Xournal++"></p>
<p>Using Linux with a touchscreen is as good as using Windows. I’ve used the desktop mode on the Steam Deck, and all the gestures are familiar. KDE has a “tablet mode” that enlarges the taskbar icons and many UI elements when I detach the keyboard, making it easier to tap.</p>
<p>The stylus is well-supported on Linux. Hover and pen pressure functionalities work great in apps like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://krita.org/">Krita</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://xournalpp.github.io/">Xournal++</a>. It’s a pleasure to take handwritten notes and annotate PDFs on this tablet, especially with the 165Hz refresh rate. Using the stylus makes selecting text and navigating the UI easier than using my finger.</p>
<p>The on-screen keyboard is a bit tricky here. Both <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fcitx-im.org/">Fcitx5</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maliit.github.io/">Maliit</a> use the virtual keyboard protocol on KDE Wayland. When the keyboard is attached, I use Fcitx5 for inputting Chinese or Japanese texts, and when detached, I switch to Maliit for the on-screen keyboard. I haven’t found a way to automatically switch between these two, but I believe it’s possible. Maliit supports multiple languages and can be configured with <code>gsettings set org.maliit.keyboard.maliit enabled-languages "['en', 'zh-hans', 'ja', 'emoji']"</code>.</p>
<p>I use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://waydro.id/">Waydroid</a> to run Android apps on the V3 tablet, with support for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.waydro.id/faq/google-play-certification">Google Play</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/casualsnek/waydroid_script">arm translation</a>. Some apps, like Google Play Books and Pocket Casts, work great. However, the performance and experience don’t compare to <a href="https://mudkip.me/2024/02/28/Spiritual-Successor-to-the-Google-Nexus-7/">a native Android tablet</a>. I considered using Microsoft OneNote as a cross-platform tool for my handwritten notes, but there’s a major issue with OneNote for Android on Waydroid—the handwriting doesn’t appear on the screen until I lift the stylus, touchpad, or finger. Another issue is video playback; while I have hardware acceleration in Linux apps like Firefox, mpv, and VLC, Android apps can only decode videos with the CPU, leading to worse battery life. Cameras do not work on Waydroid either.</p>
<p>One functionality missing in Linux on the V3 is automatic rotation. I have <code>iio-sensor-proxy</code> installed, and KDE Wayland should support automatic rotation out of the box. However, <code>monitor-sensors</code> reports there is no accelerometer. I hope Minisforum can address this issue with a driver or firmware update, or at least provide a DKMS module.</p>
<p>Another minor issue is that the volume keys on the side of the tablet only work when the keyboard is attached in Linux. I suspect this is a userland problem.</p>
<h2 id="Performance-and-Battery-Life">Performance and Battery Life</h2>
<p><img src="https://mudkip.me/images/2024/04/v3-3.jpg" alt="Watching Sound! Euphonium"></p>
<p>The performance of the AMD Ryzen 7 8840U is outstanding. It outperforms my M1 iMac in tasks such as building Android apps and the <code>7z b</code> benchmark. Its single-core performance surpasses that of my Core i7 12700 homelab PC, though the 12700 only performs better in multi-core tasks because it has four more E-cores. I haven’t conducted extensive benchmarks, and I haven’t yet managed to get Handbrake working with AMD VCN on Linux to test its hardware-accelerated video encoding speed. However, the KDE UI and most applications feel as fast as my Dragon Canyon desktop PC equipped with an RTX 3080. In some cases, it feels even snappier, due to the ongoing issues between NVIDIA and Wayland, which are expected to be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2024/04/05/explicit-sync.html">resolved</a> very soon.</p>
<p>During my normal usage in Linux, which includes web browsing with Firefox, video playback with Haruna Media Player (with <code>hwdec</code> set to <code>auto</code>), writing in Obsidian, and lightweight coding in Visual Studio Code and Android Studio, the tablet lasts for 6 hours. The battery life is not as long as that of Apple Silicon MacBooks but it is satisfactory to me and better than what I remember from using Intel MacBooks. The battery life might vary with Windows, potentially achieving longer duration.</p>
<p>Gaming on this tablet delivers performance in line with what you would expect from the Radeon 780M integrated GPU. I’ve tested it with two recent games I’m playing. I can play <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> at high settings (though with Ray-Traced Reflections disabled) at 1200p and 60fps. For <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, I achieve 55 to 60 fps at high settings (with FSR set to optimize for frame rate) in 1200p. Both games perform much better than on the Steam Deck. The frame rate only drops slightly when reducing the TDP from 28W to 15W, showcasing the efficiency of the GPU under varied power conditions.</p>
<p>The tablet is marketed as an “AI PC,” due to the AMD Ryzen 7 8840U processor, which features an XDNA NPU, and a keyboard equipped with a Copilot key. While local Large Language Models like Llama 2 perform rapidly and effectively using platforms like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ollama.com/">ollama</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a>, I believe these currently run on the CPU. As of now, I am not aware of any AI products specifically utilizing the NPU, but AMD does provide <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/ryzen-ai-software.html">some tutorials</a> which might hint at future developments that could leverage the NPU for enhanced AI performance.</p>
<h2 id="Working-as-an-Portable-Display">Working as an Portable Display</h2>
<p>The external display feature of the V3 tablet, which makes it a “3 in 1” device, is unique. Although this feature is still in its early stages based on my testing, I believe it represents a promising start.</p>
<p>The VLink USB-C port only operates when the computer part of the tablet is shut down. Unfortunately, there appear to be compatibility issues, as it doesn’t work with my M1 Macs using a USB-C cable. I tried two cables that function with my Mac and the LG UL850 display, but neither could activate the V3’s display. However, it worked fine when connected to my desktop PC. I suspect that the issue might be resolved by using a USB-C to DisplayPort dongle and a DisplayPort to USB-C cable, but this solution is too cumbersome. I hope a firmware update can resolve this issue.</p>
<p>When used as an external display, the keyboard case can also function as an external USB keyboard. This is particularly useful in setups where I want to configure a NAS or mini PC for eventual headless operation. However, it seems the V3 only supports a 60Hz refresh rate when used as an external display, and I’m not sure if this is due to compatibility or cable issues.</p>
<p>Another feature I hope to see improved in the future is the ability to turn on the Nintendo Switch’s TV mode with just one USB-C cable. I understand that Nintendo doesn’t use standard display protocols, making this a challenging feature to implement. However, I’m aware of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cforce.com.cn/html/Product/portable/">portable displays</a> that support this feature. It would be incredibly valuable for travel with the Nintendo Switch, and I would be willing to pay extra for this capability.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Hardware-Details">Other Hardware Details</h2>
<p>The form factor of the V3 tablet is similar to a Microsoft Surface Pro, especially when the keyboard is attached. However, the kickstand is separate from the tablet, which makes the entire setup slightly heavier. I prefer the integrated kickstand design of the Microsoft Surface and Nintendo Switch OLED, but the separate kickstand does provide a wider range of angles.</p>
<p>The tablet is completely sealed with no visible screws for opening, which raises concerns about long-term repairability, especially if the cooling system degrades over time. While a 1TB SSD is sufficient for my needs with this device, it would be beneficial for users who require more storage if it can replace the NVMe drive.</p>
<p>The speaker is loud and good, but there seems to be an issue with volume control in Linux. The global volume control can only mute or unmute the speaker, while the actual volume is controlled at the application level. I suspect there might be some driver issues, as when I use headphones, both the global and application level volume controls work well.</p>
<p>The keyboard case is quite pleasant to use. While I might still prefer the feel of the Magic Keyboard, this one comes close. The key layout feels just right. I particularly appreciate that the keyboard includes dedicated Home, Pg Up, Pg Dn, and End keys on the right side. This is especially useful to me, as I’m primarily familiar with macOS/Emacs shortcuts for these commands, which are not supported in Linux except within the terminal.</p>
<p>The fan noise is a mixed bag for me. During the day, even under heavy workloads, I can barely hear the fan. However, at midnight, when my room is completely silent, I can often hear a strange, faint buzzing noise coming from the tablet. This noise disappears when I run benchmarks or play games that maximize the fan speed. It’s not like the typical fan noise but resembles the sound of an HDD, though at a much lower volume. It seems this noise might be caused by the fan frequently changing speeds or being affected by the magnets in the tablet. I’d be interested to hear if others have experienced this issue, and if it turns out to be unique to my unit or an early production issue, I’ll replace it under warranty.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After two weeks of use, I consider the Minisforum V3 AMD Tablet to be a nearly perfect portable Linux device. It offers a promising blend of performance, versatility, and Linux compatibility at an acceptable price point. This tablet is an excellent start for tablets featuring AMD APUs and those that triple as external displays. However, I hope that the minor issues I’ve mentioned can be addressed, either through firmware updates or in the next iteration of the product. I also wish for some level of repairability, such as the ability for users to open the case to clean the fans or replace the NVMe drive. Looking ahead, I plan to bring the V3 tablet along for travel and weekends in coffee shops.</p>

Further advances in uncertainty estimation which separate these kinds of uncertainty would enhance the potential for our semantic uncertainty approach by allowing extensions beyond entropy.</p><h4 id="Sec9">Joint probabilities of sequences of tokens</h4><p>Generative LLMs produce strings of text by selecting tokens in sequence. Each token is a wordpiece that often represents three or four characters (though especially common sequences and important words such as numbers typically get their own token). To compute entropies, we need access to the probabilities the LLM assigns to the generated sequence of tokens. The probability of the entire sequence, <b>s</b>, conditioned on the context, <b>x</b>, is the product of the conditional probabilities of new tokens given past tokens, whose resulting log-probability is <span>\(\log P({\bf{s}}| {\boldsymbol{x}})={\sum }_{i}\log P({s}_{i}| {{\bf{s}}}_{ &lt; i},{\boldsymbol{x}})\)</span>, where <i>s</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is the <i>i</i>th output token and <b>s</b><sub>&lt;<i>i</i></sub> denotes the set of previous tokens.</p><h4 id="Sec10">Length normalization</h4><p>When comparing the log-probabilities of generated sequences, we use ‘length normalization’, that is, we use an arithmetic mean log-probability, <span>\(\frac{1}{N}{\sum }_{i}^{N}\log P({s}_{i}| {{\bf{s}}}_{ &lt; i},{\boldsymbol{x}})\)</span>, instead of the sum. In expectation, longer sequences have lower joint likelihoods because of the conditional independence of the token probabilities<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Malinin, A. &amp; Gales, M.

The joint likelihood of a sequence of length <i>N</i> shrinks exponentially in <i>N</i>. Its negative log-probability therefore grows linearly in <i>N</i>, so longer sentences tend to contribute more to entropy. We therefore interpret length-normalizing the log-probabilities when estimating the entropy as asserting that the expected uncertainty of generations is independent of sentence length.

For example, even if the model is confident in the meaning of a generation, there are still usually many different ways for phrasing that generation without changing its meaning. For the purposes of detecting confabulations, the uncertainty of&nbsp;the LLM over meanings is more important than the uncertainty over the exact tokens used to express those meanings.</p><p>Our semantic uncertainty method therefore seeks to estimate only the uncertainty the LLM has over the meaning of its generation, not the choice of words. To do this, we introduce an algorithm that clusters model generations by meaning and subsequently calculates semantic uncertainty. At a high level this involves three steps:</p><ol>

We can formalize semantic equivalence mathematically. Let the space of tokens in a language be <span>\({\mathcal{T}}\)</span>. The space of all possible sequences of tokens of length <i>N</i> is then <span>\({{\mathcal{S}}}_{N}\equiv {{\mathcal{T}}}^{N}\)</span>. Note that <i>N</i> can be made arbitrarily large to accommodate whatever size of sentence one can imagine and one of the tokens can be a ‘padding’ token which occurs with certainty for each token after the end-of-sequence token. For some sentence <span>\({\bf{s}}\in {{\mathcal{S}}}_{N}\)</span>, composed of a sequence of tokens, <span>\({s}_{i}\in {\mathcal{T}}\)</span>, there is an associated meaning. Theories of meaning are contested<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 51" title="Speaks, J. in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (ed.

However, for specific models and deployment contexts many considerations can be set aside. Care should be taken comparing very different models and contexts.</p><p>Let us introduce a semantic equivalence relation, <i>E</i>( <span>⋅</span> , <span>⋅</span> ), which holds for any two sentences that mean the same thing—we will operationalize this presently. Recall that an equivalence relation is any reflexive, symmetric and transitive relation and that any equivalence relation on a set corresponds to a set of equivalence classes. Each semantic equivalence class captures outputs that can be considered to express the same meaning. That is, for the space of semantic equivalence classes <span>\({\mathcal{C}}\)</span> the sentences in the set <span>\(c\in {\mathcal{C}}\)</span> can be regarded in many settings as expressing a similar meaning such that <span>\(\forall {\bf{s}},{{\bf{s}}}^{{\prime} }\in c:E({\bf{s}},{{\bf{s}}}^{{\prime} })\)</span>. So we can build up these classes of semantically equivalent sentences by checking if new sentences share a meaning with any sentences we have already clustered and, if so, adding them into that class.</p><p>We operationalize <i>E</i>( <span>⋅</span> , <span>⋅</span> ) using the idea of bidirectional entailment, which has a long history in linguistics<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 52" title="Culicover, P.

A sequence, <b>s</b>, means the same thing as a second sequence, <b>s</b>′, only if the sequences entail (that is, logically imply) each other.

SQuAD is a reading comprehension dataset whose context passages are drawn from Wikipedia and for which the answers to questions can be found in these passages. We use SQuAD 1.1 which excludes the unanswerable questions added in v.2.0 that are deliberately constructed to induce mistakes so they do not in practice cause confabulations to occur. TriviaQA is a trivia question-answering dataset. SVAMP is a word-problem maths dataset containing elementary-school mathematical reasoning tasks.

If the datasets themselves are already split into train and test (or validation) samples, we sample our examples from within the corresponding split.</p><p>All these datasets are free-form, rather than multiple choice, because this better captures the opportunities created by LLMs to produce free-form sentences as answers.

In that paper, the authors fine-tune their proprietary LLM on a dataset of questions to predict whether the model would have been correct. This requires access to a dataset of ground-truth answers to the questions. Rather than fine-tuning the entire LLM in this way, we simply take the final hidden units and train a logistic regression classifier to make the same prediction. By contrast to their method, this is much simpler because it does not require fine-tuning the entire language model, as well as being more reproducible because the solution to the logistic regression optimization problem is not as seed-dependent as the fine-tuning procedure.

The confidence score is then taken to be the probability with which the LLM responds with ‘a’ to the multiple-choice question. The performance of this method is boosted with a few-shot prompt, in which up to 20 examples from the training set are randomly chosen, filled in as above, but then provided with the actual ground truth of whether the proposed answer was true or false. In this way, the method can be considered as supervised ‘in-context’ because it makes use of some ground-truth training labels but can be used without retraining the model. Because of context-size constraints, this method cannot fit a full 20 few-shot examples in the context when input questions are long or large numbers of generations are used.

For a perfect classifier, this is 1.</p>
                    <p>Second, we compute the ‘rejection accuracy at <i>X</i>%’, which is the question-answering accuracy of the model on the most-confident <i>X</i>% of the inputs as identified by the respective uncertainty method. If an uncertainty method works well, predictions on the confident subset should be more accurate than predictions on the excluded subset and the rejection accuracy should increase as we reject more inputs.</p>
                    <p>To summarize this statistic we compute the AURAC—the total area enclosed by the accuracies at all cut-off percentages <i>X</i>%. This should increase towards 1 as given uncertainty method becomes more accurate and better at detecting likely-inaccurate responses but it is more sensitive to the overall accuracy of the model than the AUROC metric.</p>

                    <h3 id="FPar2">Assessing accuracy</h3>
                    <p>For the short-phrase-length generation setting presented in Supplementary Note&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#MOESM1">7</a>, we simply assess the accuracy of the generations by checking if the F1 score of the commonly used SQuAD metric exceeds 0.5. There are limitations to such simple scoring rules<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Kane, H., Kocyigit, Y., Abdalla, A., Ajanoh, P. &amp; Coulibali, M. Towards neural similarity evaluators. In Workshop on Document Intelligence at the 32nd conference on Neural Information Processing (2019)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#ref-CR63" id="ref-link-section-d292441206e3098">63</a></sup> but this method is widely used in practice and its error is comparatively small on these standard datasets.</p>
                    <p>For our default scenario, the longer sentence-length generations, this measure fails, as the overlap between the short reference answer and our long model answer is invariably too small. For sentence-length generations, we therefore automatically determine whether an answer to the question is correct or incorrect by using GPT-4 to compare the given answer to the reference answer. We use the template:</p>
                    <blockquote><div>
                      <p>We are assessing the quality of answers to the following question: {question}</p>
                      <p>The expected answer is: {reference answer}</p>
                      <p>The proposed answer is: {predicted answer}</p>
                      <p>Within the context of the question, does the proposed answer mean the same as the expected answer? Respond only with yes or no.</p>
                    </div></blockquote>
                    <p>We make a small modification for datasets with several reference answers: line two becomes “The following are expected answers to this question:” and the final line asks “does the proposed answer mean the same as any of the expected answers?”.</p>
                    <p>In Supplementary Note <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#MOESM1">6</a>, we check the quality of our automated ground-truth evaluations against human judgement by hand. We find that GPT-4 gives the best results for determining model accuracy and thus use it in all our sentence-length experiments.</p>
                  <h3 id="Sec22">Detecting confabulations in biographies</h3><p>In this section we describe the application of semantic entropy to confabulation detection in longer model generations, specifically paragraph-length biographies.</p><p>We introduce a biography-generation dataset—FactualBio—available alongside this paper. FactualBio is a collection of biographies of individuals who are notable enough to have Wikipedia pages but not notable enough to have large amounts of detailed coverage, generated by GPT-4 (v.0613). To generate the dataset, we randomly sampled 21 individuals from the WikiBio dataset<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Lebret, R., Grangier, D. &amp; Auli, M. Neural text generation from structured data with application to the biography domain. In Proc. 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (eds Su, J. et al.) 1203–1213 (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#ref-CR64" id="ref-link-section-d292441206e3144">64</a></sup>. For each biography, we generated a list of factual claims contained in each biography using GPT-4, with 150 total factual claims (the total number is only coincidentally a round number). For each of these factual claims, we manually determined whether the claim was correct or incorrect. Out of 150 claims, 45 were incorrect. As before, we apply confabulation detection to detect incorrect model predictions, even though there may be model errors which are not confabulations.</p><h4 id="Sec23">Prompting and generation</h4><p>Given a paragraph-length piece of LLM-generated text, we apply the following sequence of steps:</p><ol>
                    <li>
                      <span>1.</span>
                      
                        <p>Automatically decompose the paragraph into specific factual claims using an LLM (not necessarily the same as the original).</p>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>2.</span>
                      
                        <p>For each factual claim, use an LLM to automatically construct <i>Q</i> questions which might have produced that claim.</p>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>3.</span>
                      
                        <p>For each question, prompt the original LLM to generate <i>M</i> answers.</p>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>4.</span>
                      
                        <p>For each question, compute the semantic entropy of the answers, including the original factual claim.</p>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>5.</span>
                      
                        <p>Average the semantic entropies over the questions to arrive at a score for the original factual claim.</p>
                      
                    </li>
                  </ol><p>We pursue this slightly indirect way of generating answers because we find that simply resampling each sentence creates variation unrelated to the uncertainty of the model about the factual claim, such as differences in paragraph structure.</p><p>We decompose the paragraph into factual claims using the following prompt:</p><blockquote><p>Please list the specific factual propositions included in the answer above. Be complete and do not leave any factual claims out. Provide each claim as a separate sentence in a separate bullet point.</p></blockquote><p>We found that we agreed with the decompositions in all cases in the dataset.</p><p>We then generate six questions for each of the facts from the decomposition. We generate these questions by prompting the model twice with the following:</p><blockquote><div>
                    <p>Following this text:</p>
                    <p>{text so far}</p>
                    <p>You see the sentence:</p>
                    <p>{proposition}</p>
                    <p>Generate a list of three questions, that might have generated the sentence in the context of the preceding original text, as well as their answers. Please do not use specific facts that appear in the follow-up sentence when formulating the question. Make the questions and answers diverse. Avoid yes-no questions. The answers should not be a full sentence and as short as possible, e.g. only a name, place, or thing. Use the format “1. {question} – {answer}”.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>These questions are not necessarily well-targeted and the difficulty of this step is the main source of errors in the procedure. We generate three questions with each prompt, as this encourages diversity of the questions, each question targeting a different aspect of the fact. However, we observed that the generated questions will sometimes miss obvious aspects of the fact. Executing the above prompt twice (for a total of six questions) can improve coverage. We also ask for brief answers because the current version of GPT-4 tends to give long, convoluted and highly hedged answers unless explicitly told not to.</p><p>Then, for each question, we generate three new answers using the following prompt:</p><blockquote><div>
                    <p>We are writing an answer to the question “{user question}”. So far we have written:</p>
                    <p>{text so far}</p>
                    <p>The next sentence should be the answer to the following question:</p>
                    <p>{question}</p>
                    <p>Please answer this question. Do not answer in a full sentence. Answer with as few words as possible, e.g. only a name, place, or thing.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>We then compute the semantic entropy over these answers plus the original factual claim. Including the original fact ensures that the estimator remains grounded in the original claim and helps detect situations in which the question has been interpreted completely differently from the original context. We make a small modification to handle the fact that GPT-4 generations often include refusals to answer questions. These refusals were not something we commonly observe in our experiments with LLaMA 2, Falcon or Mistral models. If more than half of the answers include one of the strings ‘not available’, ‘not provided’, ‘unknown’ or ‘unclear’ then we treat the semantic uncertainty as maximal.</p><p>We then average the semantic entropies for each question corresponding to the factual claim to get an entropy for this factual claim.</p><p>Despite the extra assumptions and complexity, we find that this method greatly outperforms the baselines.</p><h4 id="Sec24">Entailment estimator</h4><p>To compute semantic entailment between the original claim and regenerated answers, we rely on the DeBERTa entailment prediction model as we find empirically that DeBERTa predictions result in higher train-set AUROC than other methods. Because DeBERTa has slightly lower recall than GPT-3.5/4, we use a modified set-up for which we say the answers mean the same as each other if at least one of them entails the other and neither is seen to contradict the other—a kind of ‘non-defeating’ bidirectional entailment check rather than true bidirectional entailment. The good performance of DeBERTa in this scenario is not surprising as both factual claims and regenerated answers are relatively short. We refer to Supplementary Notes <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#MOESM1">2</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#MOESM1">3</a> for ablations and experiments regarding our choice of entailment estimator for paragraph-length generations.</p><h4 id="Sec25">Baselines</h4><p>We implement two baselines. First, we implement a variant of the <i>P</i>(True) method, which is adapted to the new setting. For each factoid, we generate a question with answers in the same way as for semantic entropy. We then use the following prompt:</p><blockquote><div>
                    <p>Question: {question}</p>
                    <p>Here are some brainstormed ideas:</p>
                    <p>{list of regenerated answers}</p>
                    <p>Possible answer: {original answer}</p>
                    <p>Is the possible answer true? Respond with “yes” or “no”.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>As we cannot access the probabilities GPT-4 assigns to predicting ‘yes’ and ‘no’ as the next token, we approximate this using Monte Carlo samples. Concretely, we execute the above prompt ten times (at temperature 1) and then take the fraction of answers which was ‘yes’ as our unbiased Monte Carlo estimate of the token probability GPT-4 assigns to ‘yes’.</p><p>As a second, simpler, baseline we check if the model thinks the answer is true. We simply ask:</p><blockquote><div>
                    <p>Following this text:</p>
                    <p>{text so far}</p>
                    <p>You see this statement:</p>
                    <p>{proposition}</p>
                    <p>Is it likely that the statement is true? Respond with ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>It is interesting that this method ought to perform very well if we think that the model has good ‘self-knowledge’ (that is, if “models mostly know what they don’t know”<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 24" title="Kadavath, S. et al.

<p>Huber’s Butchery, in Singapore’s upscale Dempsey Hill neighborhood, has long drawn shoppers looking for more than just cold cuts. Starting last month, the deli’s freezer section has stocked shredded chicken grown from cells in a lab, the first time anywhere in the world that cultivated meat can be bought in a store, its manufacturer said.</p>



<p>Cultivated meat has been available at a handful of restaurants in Singapore and the U.S. for a couple of years. But the <a href="https://www.goodmeat.co/all-news/good-meat-begins-the-worlds-first-retail-sales-of-cultivated-chicken">launch</a> of Good Meat 3 — from California-based food technology firm Eat Just&nbsp; — at Huber’s is a high point for the industry that has been in the doldrums lately. Investor interest is flagging, and cultivated meat has been banned in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/italys-parliament-approves-ban-lab-grown-food-amid-tensions-2023-11-16/">Italy</a>, and in the U.S. states of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/13/lab-grown-meat-ban-alabama/73678952007/">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/05/05/florida-lab-grown-meat-ban/73569976007/">Florida</a>.</p>



<p>The retail launch “is more than a milestone for the company, it is also a milestone for the cultivated meat industry,” Josh Tetrick, Eat Just’s co-founder and chief executive, told <em>Rest of World</em>. The formulation of its new product uses just 3% cultivated chicken in order to sell at a lower price point so more people can try it, he said. “Singapore’s population has always demonstrated a remarkable openness to new technologies in food and elsewhere, making it the perfect marketplace for novel foods like cultivated meats.”</p>



<p>Unlike plant-based meats that have become commonplace with brands such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, cultivated meat has struggled to get off the ground after an initial wave of enthusiasm.</p>



<p>The tissue-engineering techniques behind cultivated meat have long been used in making vaccines and drugs: Animal fat and tissue are grown in a lab from cells, then processed into a variety of proteins. The obvious advantages are that it needs less land and water to produce, and can lower greenhouse gas emissions. But cultivated meat is expensive to produce and hard to scale, and has struggled to hold investor interest.</p>



<p>The more than <a href="https://gfi.org/resource/cultivated-meat-and-seafood-state-of-the-industry-report/">$3 billion</a> put into cultivated meat worldwide over the last decade is a fraction of the investments in other technologies, such as renewable energy, which are also aimed at reducing emissions.<strong> </strong>“The biggest obstacle to cultivated meat reaching the masses … is the broad underinvestment in R&amp;D and manufacturing infrastructure, especially from governments,” Mirte Gosker, managing director of the nonprofit Good Food Institute Asia Pacific, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Singapore’s foray into alternative proteins began in earnest in March 2019, with its “<a href="https://www.ourfoodfuture.gov.sg/30by30/">30 by 30” vision</a> to sustainably produce 30% of its nutritional needs locally by 2030 — up from 10%. Alternative protein is a key part of this plan. But its strategy “goes beyond simply meeting its own domestic needs,” said Gosker.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The biggest obstacle to cultivated meat reaching the masses … is the broad underinvestment in R&amp;D and manufacturing infrastructure.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“As a small country with limited natural resources, Singapore cannot single-handedly feed the world,” she said. “But it can serve as the place where companies from all around the world come to work with top-tier research agencies and food-tech partners to refine their formulations, eliminate inefficiencies in their manufacturing process, and explore new techniques and ingredients that could help them drive down costs.”</p>



<p>Singapore was the first country to approve cultivated meat, with the nod for Eat Just’s chicken nuggets in December 2020. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) recently <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/s-pore-approves-lab-grown-quail-for-consumption-here">greenlit</a> Australia-based Vow’s <a href="https://www.forgedbyvow.com/">cultivated quail</a> for restaurants — the second company to receive a local license, and just the fourth globally. Later this year, SFA is expected to approve cultivated chicken and pork from French firm Vital Meat and Dutch company Meatable, respectively.</p>



<p>There are about a dozen local alternative-protein startups in the country, and some 15 from Europe, the U.S., South Korea, Israel, and Hong Kong. While investments in other countries may be larger, “one of Singapore’s greatest strengths is the tight-knit innovation community which facilitates seamless collaboration between startups, researchers, and government agencies,” Gosker said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government has so far committed some $230 million towards alternative proteins — from grants to training researchers to building capabilities in bioprocessing and other complementary technologies. Singapore “invested very heavily in getting technological expertise into its government regulatory departments,” Simon Eassom, chief executive of Food Frontier, an Australia-based think tank, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “That means it’s able to fast-track a lot of these applications safely.” Applications only take half, or a third, of the time to process, compared to Australia or the U.S., he said.</p>



<p>Singapore is the “perfect spot” for testing, George Peppou, co-founder and chief executive of Vow,<strong> </strong>told <em>Rest of World</em>. The speed of approvals is the “driving reason” why Vow launched its cultivated quail in Singapore, he said. “We have an application with the FDA, but we’re not intending to launch in the U.S. anytime soon … It’s a very expensive market to launch in, and now it’s so politically sensitive, it wouldn’t be worth the investment.”</p>

<p>The United States and Israel approved the sale of cultivated chicken and beef in June 2023 and January 2024, respectively. Australia and New Zealand are <a href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/food-standards-code/applications/A1269-Cultured-Quail-as-a-Novel-Food">jointly assessing</a> Vow’s cultivated quail for approval. China added cultivated meat to its five-year plan for food in 2022, while South Korea set up a <a href="https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/south-korea-cultivated-meat-regulatory-approval-ministry/">regulatory framework</a> for cultivated meat this year. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2022/09/30/vertical-farms-and-lab-grown-beef-gulf-investors-develop-a-taste-for-future-foods/?sh=5dbd58fe6334">investing heavily</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Singapore’s Islamic Religious Council <a href="https://www.muis.gov.sg/Media/Media-Releases/2024/2/3-Feb-24-Fatwa-on-Cultivated-Meat">declared</a> cultivated meat halal earlier this year, expanding the potential consumer base in the multiethnic country. In April, state-backed sustainable food firm Nurasa opened a <a href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/nurasa-unveils-asia-premier-food-tech-nnovation-centre-to-enable-sustainable-nutrition-solutions.html">food innovation center</a> that offers food-tech startups facilities such as 100-liter bioreactors to help produce at scale. Some of Eat Just’s Good Meat 3 was produced there.</p>



<p>“Shared developmental resources like this can help solve specific problems in the value chain and bottlenecks that many companies share,” Mihir Pershad, who moved from the U.S. state of Maryland to Singapore, told <em>Rest of World. </em>Pershad’s <a href="https://umamibioworks.com/technology/">Umami Bioworks</a>, which makes cultivated seafood, has secured R&amp;D grants and meetings with potential overseas customers through the Singapore government, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worldwide, there are nearly 200 cultivated meat companies. Although prices in the nascent industry have declined since the first lab-grown beef burger debuted in 2013 at a staggering $330,000, they still need to fall to under $10 per kilo — roughly a tenth of current costs — to be competitive in the mass market, <a href="https://gfi-apac.org/2023-apac-state-of-the-industry-report/">estimates</a> the Good Food Institute.</p>



<p>Cultivated meat may reach <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/cultivated-meat-out-of-the-lab-into-the-frying-pan">cost parity</a> with conventional meat by 2030, with the market worth about $25 billion by then, according to McKinsey &amp; Company. But investor interest has flagged: The industry raised just $226 million last year, a steep fall from $922 million in 2022, according to the Good Food Institute. Several Silicon Valley startups have <a href="https://www.foodprocessing.com/ingredients/alternative-protein/news/33002716/cultivated-meat-startup-new-age-eats-shuts-down">collapsed</a> or <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/upside-foods-glenview-illinois-factory-lab-grown-meat/">shelved expansion plans</a>. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eat-just-financial-problems/">Eat Just</a> is also under pressure in the U.S.</p>



<div><p>Startups are also still finding investors: Cellivate Technologies, a Singapore company focused on cell-based solutions for the cultivated meat industry, recently beat out nearly two dozen startups in Southeast Asia to win a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/brandstudio/cellivate-technologies-raises-eyebrows-it-secures-hefty-funding-final-round-big-spark-4214561">business reality TV show</a>, with commitments of about $3 million from venture capital firms.</p><p>“There is much more work to be done to prove that cultivated meat can be made at large scale,” said Eat Just’s Tetrick. “[But] this year, we will sell more servings of cultivated chicken than have been sold in any year prior.” As for its newest product, Huber’s Butchery is “pretty much selling most of what is supplied to us,” Andre Huber, the executive director, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “Response has been great.”</p></div>

  Like many Unix users,
  I long ago created a <tt>~/bin/</tt> directory in my home directory
  and added it to my <tt>PATH</tt>
  so that I could supplement
  the wonderfully rich set of basic Unix commands
  with some conveniences and shell scripts of my own devising.
</p>
<p>
  The problem, of course, was the chance of collision.
  Because my shell script names
  tended to be short and pithy collections of lowercase characters,
  just like the default system commands,
  there was no telling when Linux would add a new command
  that would happen to have the same name as one of mine.
  This was actually not very likely on,
  say, a System&nbsp;V Revision&nbsp;3 workstation in the 1980s,
  but the trouble became quite a bit more acute
  when I moved into the world of Debian.
  Red Hat never really worried me,
  because they packaged (comparatively) so little software.
  But Debian today supports a huge number of commands;
  my modest Ubuntu laptop shows several thousand available:
</p>
<div><pre><span>$</span> <span>apt</span><span>-</span><span>file</span> <span>search</span> <span>-</span><span>x</span> <span>'</span><span>^/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>[</span><span>^/</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>$'</span> <span>|</span> <span>wc</span> <span>-</span><span>l</span>
<span>21733</span></pre></div>

<p>
  The solution was obviously to adjust my command names
  in such a way that they were still easy to type,
  but would never be chosen as system command names.
  For me, “easy to type” means not having to use the shift key,
  and very few characters turned out to be available,
  unshifted, on a modern keyboard.
  The lower-case letters
  are the very characters used in system commands;
  brackets, backslashes, the colon, the back-tick, and the single-tick
  all had a special meaning to the shell;
  and the slash and dot characters both mean something special
  in a filename.
  (The slash divides directory names from filenames,
  and thus cannot appear in a filename itself,
  while the dot means “hide this file from normal browsing”
  if it leads the name,
  and separates a file from its extension in many other cases.)
</p>
<p>
  There was but one character left: the simple, modest comma.
</p>
<p>
  A quick experiment revealed in a flash
  that the comma was <i>exactly</i> the character
  that I had been looking for!
  Every tool and shell that lay in arm's reach
  treated the comma as a perfectly normal
  and unobjectionable character in a filename.
  By simply prefixing each of my custom commands
  with a comma,
  they became completely distinct from system commands
  and thus free from any chance of a collision.
</p>
<p>
  And, best of all,
  thanks to the magic of tab-completion,
  it became very easy to browse my entire collection of commands.
  When trying to remember which of my commands
  are available in my <tt>~/bin/</tt> directory on a given system,
  or when simply trying to remember what
  some of my commands are called,
  I simply type a comma followed by <i>tab</i>
  and my list of commands appears:
</p>
<pre>$ ,<i>«tab»</i>
,complete-scp        ,go-thpgp            ,range
,complete-ssh        ,gr                  ,svn-store-password
,coreoff             ,hss                 ,umount
,coreon              ,mount-thpgp
,find                ,mount-twt</pre>
<p>
  I heartily recommend this technique
  to anyone with their own <tt>~/bin/</tt> directory
  who wants their command names kept clean, tidy,
  and completely orthogonal
  to any commands that the future might bring to your system.
  The approach has worked for me for something like a decade,
  so you should find it immensely robust.
  And, finally, it's just plain fun.
